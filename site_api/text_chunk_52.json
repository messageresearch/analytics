you would be here with us this morning in Jesus name amen amen you can take your seat seats if you'd stay um we um it's an honor this morning to be here in the house of the Lord once again um and brother Jordan mentioned that tonight we have uh we have our testimony and Praises so I just love these Services I love hearing the the Believers and what the Lord's done in their lives over the past little while and the songs that talent that we have so please come tonight and and I'm I'm really looking forward to a nice service we have uh this morning we have another little Another Blessing sister Grace are we uh ready we have a a baby dedication oh wow look at this little one let's um if we could brother Jordan where'd you go if you could sing a song as they bring the the baby up bring them in bring them in WoW bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring beautiful baby sister what's your name Angelina bless what's your name Joshua God bless you and how are you related that's my mom that's your mom wow you have a grandbaby now praise the Lord um so sister I forgot your name again Angelina sister Angelina and brother Joshua and what is the baby's name Isabella Isabella the Bible teaches us if we could turn a little bit and face the congregation the Bible teaches us Jesus said suffer the little children suffer the little children to come to me he said don't forbid them he said let them come to me and then he made a statement one time he said for their angels are now in the presence of the father so we think of this little baby coming here and to be dedicated back to the father and what an honor knowing that this baby has a representative over there in the presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and this is just a reflection of of that presence of um of What the Lord Has Done Now brother and sister this baby has been lone to you by the Lord Jesus he's entrusted you with the great responsibility of taking care of the child and raising the child right and raising the child in the image of God and I know you're up to it you seem like a very sweet family if uh can I hold the the baby is that okay sister is that okay okay yeah wow that is a beautiful little baby let's all bow our heads heavenly father I'm not worthy to hold this little gift of love that you've given to your son and your daughter father As I Lay My Hands on her I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would guide her for the rest of her life until you would come and Lord that that she would be a blessed baby that your blessings would rest upon her above above others and father that that your hand Lord would guide her and direct her and if if you would tar Lord may she have a happy in a good life and father may your spirit always be present with her in Jesus Christ's name amen did you see that she smiled at me that was good oh man thank you my brother God bless you Sister God bless you thank you thank you amen thank thank you what an honor what a blessing to be able to hold a little baby like that what a miracle we think about we think about a child and how these these babies are formed in the womb and and then they're born and wow they're just these beautiful little helpless little creatures so so many times the Bible Well Jesus said he says except that we become like them we won't enter into the kingdom we have to become like that little baby that's just so dependent on Mom and Dad we have to be dependent like like that baby with our Lord Jesus that's that's the ultimate goal that's a Christian is to become it's strange when you grow up you think you're more dependent you're more independent but when you grow up in the Lord you become more dependent on God been uh praying this week on a on a number of things and we're December seems to be the month of decision for for all of us really we we're closing out the year and and um a lot of times we're choosing what health insurance we have for the next year and we have to we have to do that we're for the for the the students they're deciding what classes that they're going to take next semester and even to the point what Christmas gifts we're going to buy if you do that and there's just so many decisions that we face in December this time of year and it's it seems like it's it's a pressure full time for for many of us right now we're deciding on uh the church renovation we're making starting to make uh some decisions in that way and and I know I've waited about a year but we're also going to move forward in electing the church officials in the book of Jan or in the uh the book of January I don't think there's a book of January in here a month of January and we I I've made the decision to devote many of our Wednesday nights to to studying this Bible and to give an overview of the books that are in the Bible so when we come on Wednesday night or we stream in every book I want us all to remember something about that book what that book's about and going on in that direction and I did get one complaint um about our Wednesday night services and brother Lyall this one was about you I won't tell you who it's from um but she was related to the garas she said brother Daniel you're not giving brother Lyall enough [Laughter] time so so brother Lyall if we want to split these up into two Services we C we can do it we just want we want the people we're not digging in to digging into the foundation of the book we're not getting digging into the specifics we're giving an overview of it and and then the specific sometimes that's what Sunday morning is for is to take a couple scriptures and then expound upon those but we want to be able to give the um the church a uh a good understanding and I'd like to say about this church and and making changes um I believe something special has happened here I know I've said that before but I've seen I've seen an amazing amazing thing and I haven't seen it in the 52 years of my life is we've seen the a group of people who were steadfast in the way that they thought the way that they believed and I've seen people start to be more accepting and more loving and welcoming more people in and saying if you don't necessarily look like me or act like me we still want to worship the same Lord Jesus and friends I've never I've never seen that in my whole life and I've been associated with brother brandom's message since I was born in 1971 my family since about 1950 I've never seen this in my life a group of of people that have just been so caring and so loving and so willing to give I believe that's the very Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ himself I really do the church is for people that need to get better otherwise why would you need a church that's it's that's what it's for it's for us to come to improve on our lives and and of course get closer to the Lord I'm not saying I know that I've I've preached pretty hard I preach I preach on both sides I try to keep a balance I preach preach against sin and and and moving the ways of the world and I also preach against legalism over on this side and say be careful with that legalism but I'm not saying living that life is in any way wrong I'd be a hypocrite we homeschooled our kids you we didn't have a television we didn't we didn't have any movies in our lives we we tried to walk this perfect line in growing up and in raising our children we did the best that we could and trying to we we went to church every single service we even went so far as I wouldn't even and my family wouldn't even listen to any Minister other than brother brandom himself that's how far we were on this side but I have to tell you that in growing in our and raising our children and it was such a blessing that we would have I'd come home from work and Stephanie would have things ready the kids would be meeting me at the door there and I'd come in they they'd love on Daddy and we'd have dinner and then we would go into the living room and and we would have our Bible study and we would talk about the Lord and talk about his word and and we just had such a a good a good life and and I'm just I'm so grateful that the lord gave us that and what I want is that joy that we have had with our children I want everyone to have that same Joy even if you don't have parents that that that are believers even if you don't whatever situation you're in I want everyone to to receive that same thing that I received that my children received and I want this church to be able to provide it I want to have those Bible studies for the Youth and for all of us for the Sisters if you want to have a Bible study yes come in we we'll get that together for men's meetings for the brothers I want I want the kids to study the Bible I want you to have that because it was such a blessing to my family and we had such joy we made mistakes as parents and all of us would want to go back and change things that we did but God still He blesses our motives He blesses our efforts we try and we're doing the best that we can and he knows that and and we make mistakes and and and sometimes we'll suffer for our mistakes and our children will suffer but God knows God takes care of it all he knows our heart there was a uh suggestion that that came in about a month ago and it was put in the offering box and uh it didn't have a name associated with it I like it when it has a name because then I can go to the person and say hey what do you mean or a little bit more and so many people come to me and say well the people are saying don't ever come to me and say that because my first question is going to be who and if you don't tell me I'm going to assume it's you so but anyways there was a a a suggestion came in the offering Box about a month ago and I looked at it and like everything I I took it seriously and I've been praying about it and it said something on the order of I don't remember the exact I have I have the I have the paper um but it said something like we should take a service a week like we were doing for the book of Acts and we should take brother brandom's message and break it down like we did in the book of Acts and I pondered that suggestion and back and forth and and I i' I've prayed about it and I I've I've gone back and forth in my mind how we could do it but one thing I don't want to do is I don't want to fall into into the Trap that so many quote message churches have fallen into and dove into a quote here and a quote there and a quote here string them all together and build a Doctrine out of them I don't want to do that brother brandom when he when he preached don't forget this is different than than your Bible it was presented in a different way it's an audio it is preaching and here in the Bible every single book every single word that was written was reviewed and whoever the prophet was or the Scribe had a chance to look it over and this was exactly what they wanted exactly what God wanted in here brother brandham was preaching under the anointing and he was his message wasn't meant to dissect every little thing and even brother brandom didn't he said you make me nervous when you do that but yet we go and do it and I don't want to move into that direction because that's you know what happens when that then the church dies and friends I've seen it all over the world I've seen it so I want to be careful in doing that I was so I was looking in some old notes and I don't know this came from years ago but I wrote this and I believe the Lord just brought it back to my attention he I said this this is something I wrote we call ourselves and I quote message Believers and we know that God sent a modern day Prophet to call us out of the denominational system and into the truth but do we really know what the truth is do we really understand what that messenger was supposed to do to have a proper understanding of what God did and is doing in our day and to build a strong church we must have an understanding of this book I don't know why I I wrote that but I don't know what I was what I was thinking but it as I read that it brought my testimony and how I've come this walk and like I said I've lived my life after I gave my heart to the Lord as as a young man I've tried to live a very very structured and legalistic life and I I have for the most part lived that way and like I said it's been a blessing to me and it's been a blessing to my kids and in going through my life as I said I never I never missed a service but we never also never heard a minister we were always listening to brother bram's tapes in service so I was in the ministry as you know in in in Jeffersonville Indiana and Stephanie and the kids were here in Tucson and they were um visiting marily and Rod and and our family and I had to go back early to go back to work so this was this was in January and in 2012 and I was working late at night and I um was going through my my voicemails and and one of the things that I had the honor of doing is I had the honor of studying this message and then help helping other people that would call and they had a question on their heart a doctrinal question or something about maybe William brandom lied about this or he was wrong about that or or I'm having marital problems with my children whatever it was those questions would generally come to me and I would go through my voicemails and if if it was an email i' I'd take care of it or or a phone call I would call them back and and I got a I got a voicemail on my phone from a man that had a very strong Jewish accent sister Barber I told you this testimony the other day and it changed my life this man just left his name and he left his phone number and it was late at night I was I was working I didn't have anybody to go home to so I just worked late and tried to get as much work as as I could done and and I saw that his um area code was from Hawaii so I said oh well it's the middle of the day there so I I called him up and he tells me his testimony and like I said very very obvious he was Jewish he told me he was Jewish right away he was he was he lived in Jerusalem for a long time and but he was in San Diego as a young man and some he was he was sitting on the beach on a bench and someone walked up to him it was in the morning and someone gave him one of those little green Gideon Bibles you know which ones I'm talking about and gave him that and he looked up and he said he said I don't want it he says I'm Jewish and they said well you should read this and he says he said no I don't want to read it he says I'm not Catholic I don't want to hear about Mary he says he says I'm Jewish I don't want to read it and the guy says it's not about that you need to read this and he said okay and he takes the little thing and he brings it home and he says he tells me he says I couldn't take it and not read it so he opened it up and he started in Matthew and he read the all the gospels and he said in his in his heart and he was crying out to God he said he said Lord this is a continuation of the Bible he said this is not a gentile book this is not a Catholic book he said this is a Jewish book he said they're all Jews in here you see how he went through the book of Acts and we saw that progression he said this is a Jewish book he said this is God so he gives his heart to the Lord Jesus this little Jewish man this is way back I think it was in late 70s and he starts praying and he starts reading this book and he starts witnessing to other people and he has a gift in his life of a teacher of a rabbi and he's studying this and he's seeing that this is not for the Gentiles this was actually meant for us but we were blinded and then it went to these other people and he was very plain you don't matter we are superior was his was his attitude and I was like yeah but it's ours right now so he kept on and one afternoon or evening he was praying and he sees a vision and this Vision God comes to him and he said it was Jesus it was very similar to what happened to the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus that book of Acts friends is very very important so he's he he he this light comes down and it goes right into him and he cries out to God and the Lord tells him he says that you have accepted me and I can't remember his exact words I have his exact words written written down in some of my notes that are packed away in boxes but he said the the vision told him said that you have received the Messiah and you are going to receive within a week you are going to receive a further revelation of this so the vision's over he said he tells me he said I feel like it would have killed anybody this experience that I had he said it was so powerful so he's praying about this a few days later a man knocks at his door and says can I share something with you and he says he says yes he says are you a Christian he says I'm a Christian he says I've just given my heart to the Lord Jesus I'm Jewish but I'm I'm a Christian and and and he tells him his testimony and the man says I've got something that'll be a blessing to you and then he tells them he says God sent a prophet according to Malachi chapter 4 and he said the Lord told me you were coming so the man stays with him seven days he stays with him in his home teaching him listening to these tapes the man leaves he was so on fire for the Lord he gets in his car he drives to Tucson Arizona to this very church and he comes in and he says I want this message so they he buys he spends all of his money and he buys a full set of those red books that brother green had printed there were all the sermons in order that we had transcribed big big set he buys that set of books runs out of money in Yuma trying to get back home has to go out and work in the fields picking uh I think he said Tomatoes forgot what it was no it's lettuce picking lettuce out in the field has to earn enough money to get enough gas to get home and then he starts reading these books about that time his beloved sweetheart he was a young man he's like 21 22 years old she's a good Jewish girl her parents said that he's not good enough for you so they arranged a marriage with another young man and it broke BR his heart so he says I'm leaving all of this by the way he died 2013 or 2014 and he lived a celibate and consecrated life to that woman his entire life died at 80 around 80 years old so he takes his books so in love with her he takes his books and he goes to Jerusalem and he lives there for decades and all he had was these bound sermons and he read them over and over again as I said for decades so he comes he gets he gets what's called Crohn's disease a deadly disease man most of the time among Jewish people and had a hole in his stomach and he lived just a horrible life he was going to die the only person that could do the the surgery was in Phoenix Arizona at the Mayo Clinic he he flies from Jerusalem to to Phoenix he has the surgery done and he goes and he moves to Kawai where Stephanie and I just went we actually went to his house when we were there we went to the place that he lived and to live out his days we ended up recovering and living many years after that all the time reading these red bound books that's the only thing he knew he didn't know there was anyone else in the world really that believed like this so you'll see my point in telling the story it's a very profound thing so he's gets YouTube on his television and he's tells me this story and he says I got YouTube he says do you know what YouTube is I said yeah I know what YouTube is and he says well I got it on there the first thing I search is William brandom and he said I started hearing all of these ministers preaching William bram's message and right about then I felt the presence of the holy spirit in my office telling me listen to this man and he tells me this he said you ruined William brandom's message oh and he tells me you're preaching all of this stuff that he didn't preach and you're taking all these things out of context and he says you're making up this big thing and you're ignoring the main thing so I went home and I made the decision I was this was um 2000 as I said 2012 40 years old I said Lord here I am 40 years old I was born in this do I really believe this and I said I do and I made this commitment I said but I'm going to relearn brother Ram's message I've said this before I'm going to learn it in the same spirit that it was given and that has been very very much a journey for me until this day cutting out everything all of the around the supper table talks and all the do that we all talk about I'm not saying it's bad we're talking about something good but it impresses all of us it impresses our children and all of the the conversation with friends and now I look at it in a very very different light thinking that no these things are not what he taught he may have said them one time time and that's good enough I believe it if he said it once he may have said it two or three times but then we ignore as my friend told me we ignore the main part of the message which is Jesus Christ himself remember in the last age in Revelation chapter 3 there's somebody standing on the outside of the church knocking to get in it's Jesus and it's the spirit of the people to cut them out to say to say I don't want you I've Got My Religion I've got my faith I'm special and what it has done it is made it to where we have split off and into a cult or a denomination or a sect or whatever you want to call it we have split off and now we are the Elite and we don't care about other people and that's why our churches aren't growing that's right that's why all the churches are shrinking is because we become this Elite sect of people saying that we're right and ignore what the Lord Jesus himself taught and especially ignore what brother brandham taught but even with that said the prophet Ezekiel said this I believe it's Ezekiel 3 Anointed with the Holy Spirit the the prophet said he says whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall they know that a prophet has been among them we should never cut out or disregard a gift that God has given us Brothers I'm sorry I I'm going to completely deviate from my notes um I want to read the parable of sowing the seeds it's Luke chapter 8 Brothers if you could give me Luke chapter 8 verse4 it says this and when much people were gathered together and we come to him out of every city he spake by a parable remember a parable is a story it gives that gives a valuable lesson a sewer went out to sew his seed and as he swed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture he are being planted on infertile ground and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear look at Jesus is putting great emphasis on this Parable so much that he cried out with a loud voice it was very very important to him he must have been troubled as he was saying this and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be so they could see that Jesus was troubled with this and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand he's saying that I don't speak as clearly in public as I do to you my close friends now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so this this man that's planting seeds these seeds sep they represent God's word those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved I see people all time they come to church they get a blessing but then some little things keep them from coming again and it's not just going to church that doesn't make you a Christian just going to church by any means I'm not trying to say that but there is always something that separates you from the Lord there's something that always is there from that prevents you from praying that prevents you from communing with God that's a Christian but there's something there that that separates you doesn't allow those roots to take hold this is listed first in where these seeds fall because I believe that it's the most common this is most people they on the Rock are they which when they hear they receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation they fall away so they get a little bit out there they start to grow a little bit but when this temptation comes it's stronger than the foundation that has been built in them and then theyve just they blow away how many of us see this they're not falling away to other churches they're not falling away to other to to staying home and worshiping all the time they're falling away into the world they're falling away from worshiping God they start with Zeal but it fades because there isn't any root in the gospel there isn't any root in the thing that will actually hold them and that is Christ and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection so it says here the the world is more important than their salvation they would never say that but their choices prove what they are and none of their fruits get ripe they're not a benefit to anyone they don't go all the way brother Mark that's the most important thing they got to go all the way take the last step I was talking with the other day with someone and was telling telling her about Jesus and I said Jesus tells us that if someone takes something from you to go and give them more if someone spreads rumors about you then you go and you speak kindly about that person if someone hurts you you do the opposite to them and lift them up and she says this she says yeah but no one really does that it's it's true but Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments he still said it and when we say that well no one really does that you're taking what he said and say I don't care I don't care what Jesus said nobody can do that but he wouldn't have said it if we couldn't do it he gave us this message to where we can live it the message of Jesus Christ The Gospel but when you say no one can re no one really does it it shows me that you don't want to do it it shows me that that your life is more important than whatever Jesus says but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you can tell me friends you can tell me all you want about how much you believe you can tell me all you want about how good of a Christian you are and how much you read your Bible and you will and do all of that but your testimony is speaking so loud I can't hear your words show me the fruits in your life if you really believe the same with me Lord give me those fruits Lord my time in prayer let it be fruitful let me represent Christ these things that Jesus said Lord I want to do those things I want to be what he said to be now look and I see where's the burden for the lost you talk about Jesus Jesus our example I'd say he had a burden for the Lost he was sent to the Lost he died for the Lost yes and if it was truly there friends it would be outwardly visible there's fruit you can see the fruit on the tree no man when he hath lighted a candle cover it with a vessel so Jesus is telling them listen that fruit is to be displayed no man when he had lit a candle cover it with a vessel or put it under a bed but set it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light I love that for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad these things that are hidden they'll eventually come out and it's strange to me it's very like like with Jesus's Ministry it's the opposite of what you would think it is if you confess your sins then they will be forever hidden so much so that they're wiped away if you confess your sins but if you hide your sins then they'll come out and they'll be displayed the opposite of what we think so I took a long time to answer the question about teaching brother Brown's message and taking some time as this person uh suggested taking some time and maybe expounding on some of these things that are what he taught and I feel yes I will do that I've given my life to this my mom and dad when I was in the the belly they were playing brother brother pom's tapes for me I grew up with it I know it I've studied it my whole life so yes I can I want to I want to do that I want to take some time and say Here's what brother brandom said about these certain subjects but brothers and sisters please I ask you be ready to be he corrected that no he didn't teach it like you think he taught it his message was not what you think his message was maybe maybe it will be but just be ready don't judge me I'm going to do my best to not put my own interpretation on these things I'm going to do my best to take what he said the scriptures that he used and go subject by subject and say here it is now it's up to you but let me tell you this and here's another thing that I believe that we have made the mistake in the ministry is we have taken brother brandom's message and then we've tried to explain it we've tried to say here's what he meant and let me take a quote here and a quote here and a quote here and I'll put it together and here's the doctrine I think brother Brandon would come and say what it's not my Doctrine what are you doing that's what we have done in the ministry and when that brother when he told me you ruined brother brandom's message me Daniel Evans is who I believe has done that because of my way of thinking that was uh let me let me read to you something brother brandom said and I'm not going to get to my notes today we'll uh I'll preach the sermon that that I wanted to preach this morning at another time brother Bram said this in God's only provided place of worship he said this now have you noticed every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination this is 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination God will you will die right in your track remember that the very hour that you mention denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are take a man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word take a man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word that that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it didn't bear fruit the parable I just read it's the same thing was at back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again that's the one that fell on the good ground brother random said we're always saying it's brother brand said brother brandom said brother brandham said and we wonder why we don't see new converts friends we wonder why they don't know we take the Holy Spirit out and we replace it with something else replace it as brother brandom said with a man and those roots stop growing does that mean that we throw out the prophet sermons not this guy not me oh no I still listen to it and I I love it more now than I ever have I listen to it almost every day that doesn't mean that but he warned us we replac the holy spirit with an intellectual understanding rather than a Pentecostal experience when I say Pentecostal experience I don't mean what the world has replac Pentecost with how many times have we seen people shouting and praising the Lord and outpouring of emotion but then on Sunday but then on Monday they're the same person that they were before that's worship worship is good but that's not the Pentecostal experience the Pentecostal experience is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost where Jesus Christ lives in you just like he lived in the apostles the ones that were there at the day of Pentecost the same Jesus Christ the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever so that same spirit that they had back then is the same spirit that we can have in us and it's not dependent on a denomination it's dependent on a relationship with God that's everything brother Braham said this I Pray for Mercy Lord questions and answers I pray for Mercy Lord have mercy on me help me it makes me nervous father I pray that you'll help me I don't want to seal my life all my work here would be out here some fanatic to lead some group or cult into a desert somewhere don't let my name have to go down like that Lord this is Brother Brown speaking I fought hard for this I'm sincere in it as I can be God don't let it happen happen help me some way I don't know what to do I'm just depending on you but you help me I'll do anything you tell me to do I'm your servant these are your children Lord most of these people 99 out of every hundred Lord is really solid they believe they know they understand and they know it's not me but I know these things has to follow every Revival and this is not immune from it so I pray that you'll help us now I can't make that more plain than brother what brother brandom said he said they follow every Revival that word follow the definition of it is to come after to proceed ahead afterwards come after in time or order so he says right here this is going to come after but Lord don't let it be and it's a spirit that comes in and divides and what it does is it takes out Jesus Christ from the from the church it takes out the Holy Spirit from the church and replaces it with a denomination when we start digging in to these subjects brother brandom said some of the most popular subjects we have one once or twice over here this one once or twice over here when he talked about the denom ational Spirit it was almost every sermon he hated it he was set on Earth to knock that thing down and then what do we do we come in and we do the same thing that he said don't do that and we form a little group and we tell the ministers pastors tell each other how to preach somebody came to me the other day said heard that you're you're you're kind of just you're kind of just preaching Jesus in the [Applause] Bible what else am I going to preach seriously what did Brother Brandon preach I just I think who could say something as ridiculous as that it's brother Brandon would be ashamed I love his message I just read most of half of what I've read I read about an equal amount of of quotes as I did Jesus's words but it was to lift up Jesus and to warn us pastor friend of mine called me uh a couple days ago a brother I love dearly he a good friend and he said his brother Dan he says uh I've been fellowshipping with with this this group of people that uh that they're not associated with us he said but these people are going to China and they're going going to Iran and they're going to these very dangerous places so they can get the message they can get gospel the Bible into North Korea and they're having secret meetings in China where they're worshiping God and he said they're risking their lives he says these are affluent people these people were well to do and they gave everything they sold what they had so they could pay their way and they could go to China or go to Iran R and live in danger he said he said brother he says how can I cut them out from the bride just because they don't believe like me he says they're doing more than I am he says they're doing more than we are I said brother why would we why would we want to cut something like that out friend of mine in Jeffersonville he and his wife were living in sin and and and going to the bar and and not living right at all just living really just just bad lives grew up same way I grew up actually very very similar and there was a friend of his that he worked with from Eastside Christian Church which is a mega church one of the biggest churches in the United States in Louisville this man his friend reached out to him and and counseled him and brought him to the Lord Jesus and brought his wife to the Lord Jesus and yet we're going to cut that man out and now my friend is preaching the gospel preaching the same message that we preach but he needed that person from someone we would say ah they're they're we'd call them denominational who's denominational that person or us Stephanie was she was telling me that she's a nurse at Banner hospital she was telling me that that that they had this homeless man that came in he got burned he uh he he had a cigarette and something caught on fire and he was trying to stomp it out ended up catching his clothes on fire and burning him pretty severely he comes into the hospital and he's there very simple guy doesn't doesn't have I doubt that he's he was strung out on drugs he just wouldn't he wasn't able to make his way in life wasn't capable so he's there in the hospital and the housekeeper this little Mexican lady had compassion on this man the man had no clothes everything was burned up he had no shoes this little lady goes to Walmart a housekeeper at the hospital buys him shoes buys them jeans a shirt clothes gives us to him she doesn't have anything it's the poor people that are the most generous why is that she gives to this man and he was so proud he was so happy that he'd been given this Stephanie said that because of his Burns that if he would have had to walk in in in some other pair of shoes he couldn't have walked it would have hurt him he had good tennis shoes that he could walk in and and she said that he was even able to walk and get around he was so simple he he he didn't know his social security number he didn't know how to get money he said he would get an odd job every once in a while painting and then just handouts and here is this precious little lady that no one would ever think twice about I believe she's gonna be a queen in heaven for doing what she did for that poor man I'm not talking about giving these people out here that are strung out on drugs money but Jesus said he said the poor you will have with you always those are the people that need help he said but me you won't have with you because he was going on but he said to help the poor and that little lady is doing it I looked at that and sometimes I think how much of a better Christian is she than me she's probably Catholic doing it these people just fly right under the radar but let me tell you something they won't be under the radar when Christ comes they'll be over the radar they'll be flying up receiving the reward that they've been given well uh we'll close and as I said I didn't I didn't get to the sermon that I wanted to to to preach today I'll get to it maybe next next weekend but in answering that question yes we should learn what this great man taught but we need to learn it in the Holy Spirit and not in an in intellectual understanding because when we learn in an intellectual understanding we will put our thoughts above it and if we just have that Spirit if we if we can understand why Jesus said these things if we can understand this book if we can understand what the prophet said then we will be able to go and do what Jesus said and not say oh nobody can do that yes they can sister Shirley's doing it you know look at you know brother Manny's doing it serving the lord I'm doing it I'm I'm doing the best that I can that's what I want brother Jordan if you could come with musicians let's let's go I want I do want to read one scripture that that I had and I was going to go through Romans chapter 8 and we will do it it'll be a blessing um let's go to Romans chapter 8 quoted a lot because it's it's my favorite thing to read when I need to be encouraged start with verse 35 says this I'm hard Stephanie says you're kind of hard on the people she says you you you know you're you're always and she wasn't criticizing she was just saying that that's my Ministry is is a corrective Ministry and and Friends one thing I I love you and I want us all to be there I want to be there and when Jesus says all of these things that someone might say nobody can do that we can do it and if we fail if we fail who can separate us from the love of Christ sh without tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep as for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that's my God that's my savior that's my Lord that's who I want to be part of that's who I want to commune with that's I want that's every Prophet from Genesis to Revelation the whole span of the book every single one was lifting up Jesus Christ everyone and that's the one I want to lift up the prophet that I listen to every day that's who he lifted up that's who he loved and that's why his message changed the world it was all different you had the Pentecostal Revival and it went up and it died and then you had this man William brandom come in and start up this charismatic Revival that swept the Earth he changed it preaching against the denominational system against the denominational way of thinking and it changed changed me I love it friends we uh we have at least one baptism is there any anyone else brother the amamos we good okay we'll have a have a the baptism anybody that wants to be baptized if you would see brother Ed there in the back the uh the brother I believe it's uh young men if there's any sisters sister Gara I don't I don't see is there any sisters that want to be baptized any brothers any more brothers or sisters we'll go up and we'll baptize as they're making ready this baptism brother Amos just one second just maybe hold on hold right there this baptism this thing that we do that we come in front of the people and we say I want to make a change in my life that what that brother was was reading that Jesus said that's what I want to be I want to be I want to be that one that Jesus talked about when Jesus said you forgive your enemies when Jesus said that you give to those who need it when Jesus said all of these things that didn't make sense that are hard to do I want to do it and I'm going to prove that I want to do it because I'm going to go up there I'm going to be baptized in front of all these people four the remission of my sins that word remission it means means taking away of my sins and it's the way to start that's the way we start our progression with Christ God bless you all brother Jordan I want to live the way he wants me to live till there's just no

was up hunting and I saw this beautiful golden eagle flying they're just huge it seems like wherever you see an eagle there's always a crow or something pecking at it and it was flying along and and and that thing that it had a crow following it and that thing was dive bombing it and that eagle just kept on flying just ignored it just ignored the the little demon that kept on after him and after him and after him and then after a while he kept on and that Crow came to dive bomb him and he turned over on his back in mid-flight and stuck out those Claws and that Crow pulled away and he flew away and Eagle turned around and started flying along they're so beautiful let's let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 sister Lily if you could keep playing for a little bit Hebrews 11 let's start with chap uh verse number 32 and I'll read through the end of it says this Hebrews chap 11:32 and says and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised from life again to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of crew mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worth worth y they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which do easily beset us and and let us run the race let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was not that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father what faithful words you have given us thank you for this book of Hebrews and father we pray that that as this sermon progresses as this day progresses father that you would instill more of that Faith from those great Patriarchs that we read about father May that Faith be more and more in our hearts and in our souls that we may represent you better father increase our faith Lord today we pray in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior amen God bless you you can take your seats

a blessing yeah music is so important brothers and sisters it's all throughout the Bible and we all love we love to worship and good music really um sets a good atmosphere for worship I uh had something on my heart I've had it on my heart about six months now I believe the Lord's he continues to bless us he's just he's just so good I've had it on my heart um Stephanie was reading a book and she was so excited about it it was called the cross and the switchblade is anybody familiar with that book it's uh it's written by a man named David Wilkerson it's it's basically his story about how he started this organization called Teen Challenge and it's done just it's been a tremendous work it's done so much for uh for so many people and it's not just for teens it's for the whole spectrum of society um by the way way brother Aaron pointed out to me this morning speaking of of our young people that they're about to go back to school if you haven't already brothers and sisters pray for our youth amen and when you go back to school young brothers and young sisters be a light wherever you are be wherever you go bring that faith of Jesus Christ with you be encouraged and then you encourage others also sister Becky I just saw you back there God bless you it's good to see you um but uh so this is been on my heart this Teen Challenge and and thinking about the tremendous testimony of this man named David Wilkerson how he was led and and I can't give the story now it's so long and just so powerful but how he was led to these in inner city Youth and the drug addicts and and all of the the abusers and the Crim ridden gangs and all that and and just how the the Lord just paved his way provided not only provided an audience for him but provided the money that he needed to go out and and do the work and it's just it's been something that's just been on my heart to have a type of a Ministry that we can help people off the streets and I think we're in a good place in this this portion of Tucson that we can really use that so I've been praying about it and and just thinking about it for for quite a few months now now really I mean it's been a couple years now ever since I started coming to this Tucson Tabernacle um so sister um sister Zyra gave me a testimony the other day um we spoke on the phone and she said that she was at this thrift store just down the road here on um stone stone and Roger around there and she was in there and she was doing some shopping for or something and she started listening to the music that was being played in the store and she heard oh this is Christian music it just made her feel good so so she she uh she had uh someone on her heart a family member that really needs to get into some sort of program so she was talking to the people there and it turns out it's a it's a Christian thrift store and she wanted she asked do you have any programs that you know of that could be for this this um family member that needs it and they said yeah and and they told her about this program that they have so I was talking with sister Zyra and she um relayed this to me and I said you know what it's on my way home I'll stop by there so I was driving by and I had a hard day at work and and I was just really struggling with some things and I always like to drive by the church just makes me feel better so I just drove by and just just to look at the building and and see what the Lord's doing it just gives me Faith brothers and sisters just makes me feel good so I drove by and and looked at the church and then I remembered oh sister zyus said to to visit this this thrift shop so I go in there and uh I walk in and there's a bunch of people at the cash register and I immediately notice that um the m Christian music I thought okay this this feels good and it's just it's pretty bear and there isn't a whole lot of stuff in there so if I forget I I recommend this place if you have any donations that you want to make of of decent furniture or anything bring it to this thrift store I think they could really use it they're doing a good work so I was I was in there and I waited till everybody left and then the guy behind the counter um I walked up and I asked him I said uh uh a a friend of mine told me that you all have a um a program for substance abusers and I said uh and not just for kids for for adults I said uh do you have something like that and he looked at me and said not me I said not for me and I said well you know I on Tabernacle I'm the pastor of that church and it's like not for me and and he says he says yeah and he gave me a flyer oh I left it in my vehicle um he gave me a flyer and it was Teen Challenge and he says 'y yeah he says if if you someone needs help he says ' we'll help them and no we won't require any payment and I said well I would like to I would like for our church to help in this so I'm talking with him and as when he mentioned Teen Challenge this kind of squirly guy he was working there he he has one eye that goes this way and one ey that goes straight and he said he says I'm six months into the program doing good it's like oh wow good and he goes by and then somebody over here he says I'm I graduated I'm past a year he says he I'm serving the lord now he says I'm doing doing good I'm off I'm off all the drugs and I I said all right and then another guy over here he says he says I'm nine months in and he says it's the best program in the in the world he says he says we're serving the lord we're doing this and what did this place does is it hires these people to help get them off the streets and give them a job to do and I was like Lord this is feeling really good do you have maybe some sort of a of a sign and just a little bit more you know you want a little bit more Gideon was like well yeah you know it's it's wet on this side and it's dry on this side but let's do it backwards just so I'm sure so that's how I was feeling and I said I said uh maybe just Lord maybe just a little bit more and and kind of the squirrly looking guy he comes he comes by and I said well I said kind of my history I said I was in um Louisville for about 17 years and I recently moved back to Tucson and the the the guy he says I was in Louisville and he said it right he said Louisville I say Louisville still the girls here from Jeffersonville they know so he said uh he says yeah I was in Louisville he says I was I was I was raised there and I said really what part of town were we on he said well I wasn't really in in Louisville he says I was I was from across a river from a little town wow I said What town he said Jeffersonville Indiana you ever hear that I said actually I'm not from Louisville either I'm from Jeffersonville I said I was there 17 years he said really he goes I'm a red devil he says he says I went to Jeff High I was like wow man thank you Lord this is this is still feeling good I said really I said I said uh you ever hear of uh brandom Tabernacle he goes oh yeah he goes brother brandom he goes Joseph Brandon voice of God Recordings he says oh yeah I was like wow wow yes so I started talking with him and he said oh he and he tells the the um the guy running the cash reg as we talked for a while and I said here's what I used to do and all that he goes he goes hey and he walks over the cash register he says uh you need to talk with this guy pointing to me he said you guys really need to talk so I got um he put me in touch with one of the directors for Teen Challenge here and uh we'll see we'll see we we don't want to get ahead of the Lord but we'll see how it moves and brother Arie maybe we might have something to direct some of these people that we witness to all the time that really need the Lord I know brother Arie has such a burden amen for the homeless people and the substance abusers so maybe we'll start moving that direction and we we'll start helping in that way it was just it it was just a a the Lord was with was with me there and I was telling this testimony and somebody tells me they said how do you have all these testimonies like wow you're you're always how do you have how does the lord always do this stuff in your life he said you know the Lord I feel like the Lord's not doing doing anything in my life he said I serve the Lord and I do all this and because I put myself in that situation exactly because I put myself where the Lord can use me I could have just drove right by the thrift store and I wouldn't have had that testimony to to give to the church but we need to put oursel in the Lord's way put oursel out so the Lord can use us and in doing that always be ready to give a witness always be ready to talk about the Lord and then he he can use you and we're about to read about these Heroes of Faith in in Hebrews chap 11 they were always available for God they always put themselves out there they they walked in God's path and they stopped at the thrift store they did itow when Matthew was there and Jesus Christ walked by he's there with changing the money he had this great career this man walked by he said I'm done with it I'm following him and if he would have stayed a tax collector we would never know his name but instead he wrote the first book in the New Testament I mean tremendous on because he got up and he did it he put himself out there so that God could use him and what I don't tell you all is the nine out of 10 times that I fail maybe 99 out of a 100 I don't tell you the story I embarrassed my wife I don't tell you the story when we were at an ice cream place in Jeffersonville and these people got out of church and these two old ladies were sitting at the table there in the in the in the ice cream area and I went down and I said so did you just get out of church the woman said yeah and I said uh what the what the preacher preach about uh I don't know it's like okay do you love the Lord um yeah okay um uh what's your favorite scripture in the Bible well and these two old old women um she said something I said I said have you given your heart to the Lord Jesus and and the old woman says you know what I believe a Christian is she said I believe a Christian is someone that would allow two women who just got out of Church to enjoy their ice cream without bothering them I don't tell you those stories but that's usually what happens we've got to put ourself out there and if you fail 99 times out of a 100 you succeeded one time and we want to succeed I got the brothers together last night and we went to visit a church literally across the street over here and I appreciate the brothers coming and and we went over there just to put out the right hand of Fellowship to this this little Spanish church and we went in there and uh it was people were so nice and there's a small group what was it maybe 30 people something like that it's all men all from young men all the way up to older men and uh they uh we we got our place and we all sat down and then the music started and it was terrible it was loud banging drums I was like oh man and I was struggling my head started hurting I couldn't understand anything that was saying because it was so loud and so turned up and the speakers were were cracking it was just it was it was just like I was like oh man I said Lord and I had to bow my head during the the the the pre-service during the worship service and say Lord I'm sorry I made a mistake for bringing these brothers over here with me I said Lord I'm sorry and and U I said I said Lord just just help us to get through and and and I made a mistake and and it continued on and then they uh you know when we clap at the end of the of the song I was clapping because it was over and then they uh they invited the the guest speaker and uh he came up and immediately I was in a bad mood I immediately didn't like him he came up and after about two minutes my thoughts completely changed brothers and sisters we always have to be careful about judging and just because that music didn't sound right right to me just because I didn't I couldn't hear the words just because it it gave me a headache and it made me nervous it doesn't mean that it's not right we're not changing our music to match that but it doesn't mean that ours is any better than theirs that's the way that they like to worship right so it's okay and when this brother started ministering he has uh he has a church in Monterey Mexico and he started his sermon with his with his testimony and I was telling sister Lily and Daniel earlier it is so important that all of us have a testimony that is what you can tell people that's what grabs their attention if you would have just opened up the Bible and started teaching it would not have been effective like this but he started with his testimony he said I was he says I started drinking at 10 years old he says my dad was an alcoholic my dad used to beat me and he said he would beat me so bad he said the only when he would finally stop is when I would wet my pants he said he beat me so bad he said I hated my dad got to be 15 years old he meets a 20-year-old girl she has a 5-year-old son this they get together she she she's um gets pregnant he's 15 he starts beating her just as he had learned and he's on drugs and he's drinking he's an alcoholic he's doing all of this stuff he's a thug you should have seen the pictures of him tattoo across his stomach I mean just someone that you would not you would be afraid to even walk into this building and there he is up there and he's got this he's got this girlfriend and the picture of him there and and they're just she's not living right she had a bad profession she was um like a a a model that you would see at a ball game and she's she's not looking good he's he's has his problems and then he he come he gets mad at her and he beats her she leaves and then she doesn't have anywhere to go she's on the streets she calls him back she calls him and she says I want to come home I don't have anywhere to go she said but I can't I can't come home and and H and have you beat me like this he made a change in his life a young man 15 years old he made a change in his life the Lord God of of hold of him wow the drugs and the alcohol let me tell you this guy was the perfect example of a loser on the streets substance abuser everything that he could have done wrong he did wrong but then God got a hold of him and he starts they have more children they have three boys and a girl the one of the boys is the adop he adopted the 5-year-old boy that his wife had and then they had one so he's only 10 years older than his oldest son and they're raising these children and he said I had to get over that with my dad and and he started quoting his dad his dad would be sitting there with a bottle in his hand and saying son never drink but he set a bad example how can you tell someone not to do something if you're doing it and yet this young man he the Lord is on his mind and he's he's he's moving forward in life and he's raising these children and he starts he gets gets a hold of the Lord he starts going to church he starts preaching the gospel and what a testimony I got to tell you I bowed my head so Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for thinking anything bad about this music forgive me and he's giving this testimony and he raises these children and he put up a picture they all had a wedding at the same time all three of his boys they all married very fine young ladies and his daughter she's she is too young to get married yet but she's she's serving the lord and he said these brothers are a witness he said my children have my boys my daughter have never drank they have never done drugs and they have never slept with someone had sex with someone before marriage prise God and the same thing for these young ladies that these boys married they met young and these girls have the same testimony as the boys that they married I looked at that I said Lord that man is a hero he is a great man he could be listed in in some of these people that I'm going to talk about today they get he has he starts this church and this church grows and grows and he starts a Ministry out to the homeless people and the substance abusers now he's helping countless people he's got five or 600 people in his church and they have this ministry through Monteray helping the substance abusers and getting them back on their feet praise the Lord for this man for what he's done that young man well he's not a young man he's 40 years old I was I was looking at him like Lord that is a hero of the Gospel right there and I was so proud to have been there what a testimony from this man Hebrews chapter 1 I mean 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear God requires Faith brothers and sisters we look at the things things now and they're here and God creates them but they came from nothing but he is God so when he speaks nothing becomes something that's with us in our in our lives this man right here nothing became something when God stepped into my life the man that we heard last night nothing became something when God stepped into his life by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh you know that story Genesis the beginning of Genesis Abel was born Cain was born twins Abel gave an offering to God that pleased God it was he killed a lamb he killed an animal knowing that his that something must die for life to be produced for life to continue Cain made a flowery altar it may have been much prettier much nicer but Abel's was accepted by God and Cain's was rejected because it wasn't right it was his self-righteous way that he said Lord you're going to do it my way because this looks better to me and then the anger welled up in Cain and he killed his brother and here comes God walking and he says where is your brother Cain he says his blood is crying out to me me from the ground think of the think of the faith that Abel had so much so that that when he was killed his blood poured out on the ground and even his blood was so full of faith that it cried out to God that's Faith how wonderful that we know that when we die whether you're I know people argue should be cremated should you be buried you whatever this listen wherever you are if you're an ash blowing in the wind it's going to cry out to God and God will answer Cain's own blood I mean Abel's own blood crying out to God and God heard you remember the story of Elisha when Elisha got sick and died and they put him in the Tomb and then there was there were there was a funeral possession coming by and I believe it was the moabites the Raiders they came down and they were going to rob this funeral possession they take the body and kick throw the body in the they threw the body in the grave and they took off well that grave just happened to be Elisha's grave the prophet that dead body of that that dead man that had died fell upon the body or even the grave we don't even know if the body was in there it fell in the grave of Elisha and that faith that was in Elisha that spirit that was in Elisha was so great that that body jumped up again came back to life that's how important this faith is and when we have that faith that is in us that we are Eternal there's nothing can ever take us take life from us if our blood is spread out on the ground it will cry out to God Beautiful by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God am how many want that testimony Lord when I die when I pass from this Earth let me have the same testimony that Enoch had I don't Enoch said we we don't know much about Enoch it's only a couple lines in the Bible but we do know that he something was so great about this man his faith was so great He's listed here that God just raptured him took him up and that same faith that was in Enoch has to be the same faith that will come at the Rapture it has to be the same can you imagine living a life that pleased God so much that he says this is my bride all right sweetheart let's go and he takes us up just like he took Enoch just like he took Elijah but is but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is must believe that there is a God and he and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him think about everybody says oh I know there's a God do you really do we really know that there is a God then how come we don't have faith if he's God then he knows what's going on in my life if he's God then he knows my problems if he's God then he knows how he to get me out of him if he's God he knows how to save me if he's God he knows how to save my children my grandchildren but we have to believe that there really is a God and I think so much do we we say it we give it Lip lip service but do we really believe that there is a God if we really believe that there's a God then we should have faith in him that he can do it not faith in ourselves we always want to have faith in ourselves that's not it you have faith that he is God and that he is able by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet as not seen as yet moved with fear here prepared an ark for the arc to the saving of his house by the which he com he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive an for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went if you read in the Bible God just calls Abraham out he says he says leave so Abraham gets his family and they just they leave he didn't tell him where he was going he just said come out so Abraham by faith just starts walking he probably walked hundreds of miles trust in God every step of the way knowing that God is there knowing that God had spoken to him we want it right now but Abraham reason that he is used as an example throughout the Bible is because he had such Faith by faith he soldiered in a Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen through faith also Sarah her self-re receiving strength to conceive seed and was delivered of child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised we are so hard on Sarah you know oh Sarah laughed you know it it was it was Abraham's Faith oh Sarah did this and you know she had Abraham go and and sleep with her concubine and then and then they had this child and then she kicks them out and and and she gets mad and all this the Bible sets Sarah as an example to us right here in Hebrews 11: 11 Sarah was a great woman and a leader she was tremendous because she had Faith she had faith in her husband's testimony that he had been with God right what a precious sister therefore sprang there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude ude and as the sand which is in the which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they saw these things far off they knew they had promises Abraham had a promise you are going to be a father of many nations he said look up see all the Stars can you number them start counting them Abraham it's like one two three I lost my place all right try it again one two I lost my place there's Millions up there and God said look up Abraham that's how your seed's going to be but I don't have any children but that's how your seed's going to be and he held to that promise walking around doing everything that he could and yet making mistakes plenty of them but he had that the all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on Earth they saw as I said they saw these these promises a far off I remember I was hunting a few years ago and it was hot we were out for the morning hunt and we were coming back down in the catalinas and I looked brother John and I saw my truck and it was way out there like uncomfortably far I looked and I'm on the side of this mountain and there's this little white dot out there and it's my binoculars yeah that's I think that's my truck so start walking but I kept it in sight and it wasn't a straight journey I had to go down the valley and up the mountain and and down through the through the thickets and the bushes and I'd get up high and it would be a little bit closer and then I'd go down and and fight through the sticker bushes and everything and hot and tired and I'd get up to another Ridge and it was a little closer and that's how these these these tremendous people in this book they saw it a far off and they were willing to go get it they were willing to put their lives on the line they were willing to have faith in this because they knew I knew my truck was there I just had to get there for they that that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a a better country that is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city not ashamed God's not ashamed to be called our God we're ashamed of him it's sad but how many people are ashamed of God how many people won't stand up and say I'm a Christian I don't act like that I don't make fun of God I Revere prayer I Revere God and maybe I don't fit in but you know what I'll Stand with the man that died on that cross more than I will stand with the pressures that the world puts on me as I said God's not ashamed of us I believe he's proud of us I believe he loves us and we should be proud of him we should always be singing his glory we should always be talking about him never be ashamed of the Lord never be ashamed of this Bible it's everything always be willing to quote it always be willing to tell your testimony as I said we all need to have a testimony by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac thy she seed Shall be Called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he had received received him in a figure this boy Isaac was promised to Abraham remember the stars of the sky and Abraham still was without child so so he had a baby with his concubine Sarah maybe doubted Abraham didn't really know what to do so they did this and and and Abraham's like well maybe maybe this ishmail maybe this other son Maybe that's the seed that are raised up and God said no it's going to be another one and then this young this boy is born and he and he he raises him and Isaac was not a 10-year-old or 12-year-old or seven-year-old boy like you see when Abraham brought him up to mount Mariah to sacrifice him he was like 2530 years old his beloved Son now look at my son Daniel thinking about think about taking him up knowing good and well and here he goes going up the mountain God had told him to sacrifice this boy that I gave you that didn't yet have children and take him up lay him on the altar build an altar kill him and burn it and that's what I want can you imagine so he's walking up there and here's his son going and he's like hey Dad uh yeah we have the bundle of sticks and there's no sacrifice where's the lamb where's the RAM and he says says son God will provide a sacrifice you go up there he lays his son on the altar the young man lays down he takes the knife to kill his son according to God's promise God says it's enough Abraham I know you I know you love me I know you believe me and there they looked and in this desert place there's a Ram stuck in the tree they go get that and that becomes the burnt offering that's what he's saying here he's saying that he was he was going to give up his son but whose spirit is that in in Abraham think about someone else who gave up his son and this son was greater than Isaac probably the same age 33 years old but this one really happened nailed him to a cross imagine how proud the father was of his son Jesus Christ never sinned never did a thing wrong and yet put him on the cross for everybody to laugh at to strip naked spit on his face Abraham a beautiful type of God and his son by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph Joseph and worshiped leaning upon the top of his staff brothers and sisters he blessed his family bless your family bless your children you have to have a blessing to give a blessing make sure you are right with God and lay your blessings upon your family you can do it says in the book you have every right to bless your family not only your children but your grandchildren so there's Jacob you know the story about Jacob how he how he wrestled with the angel so he's going he has his twin brother Esau and he had left and he had stolen the birth Birthright Esau was not happy with him bad deal Esau is a great warrior Jacob wasn't so Jac is like man what do I do so he sends his servants out he's got to meet he's got to come back home so he's going to meet his brother he's worried his brother is gonna kill everybody take everything away so Jacob goes before the Lord and a man comes that night an angel of God the Bible says that Jacob wrestled with God and he wrestled with him all night you know you know how that was me neither but it happened he wrestled with his Angel so finally all night long then the Sun starts coming up and the Angel's like let me go the sun's coming up and he's like I'm not going to let you go until you bless me so then the angel did some sort of a move and struck Jacob in the hip caused him to be crippled for the rest of his life life Jacob says I'm still not letting go until you bless me so then the angel gives his Blessing to Jacob now we see Jacob limped the rest of his life and here he is he's got his children before him and he limps up and he leans on his staff because of that crippled hip and he lays his blessings upon his children each one of them all 12 of them and then after that his son Joseph brings his two sons to their grandpa Jacob and has him blessed them you know the story where he crosses his hands with Ephraim and Manasseh but he laid His blessings upon them so those blessings come down you think that your grandpa and his prayers brother Burgess you think you're not benefiting from those blessings that he's given you he has blessed you I want to bless my children the same way amen lay my blessings upon them brother helped me out the other day so much and I wanted to pay him and he wouldn't take any money and I was sitting in my study and I was like Lord this brother has has done so much what can I do for him he won't take any money now I'm not saying that if you owe somebody money I give you my blessing I'm enough you have to give you have to pay them but this brother he's sitting in the back wouldn't take anything so I said Lord I'm reading this chapter right here I said Lord if I have anything let me give my blessings upon him and may he be blessed for what he's done for me amen and that's how we can do brothers and sisters we have that we have that Authority we have that ability to lay that those Blessings by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's Commandments by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter this man Moses um amram and jabed they had this son they knew that he was special they were killing the babies at that time the the boy baby throwing them to the crocodiles out in the Nile River and here they build this little basket and they take their son and they had faith in God how many of us would have faith in ourselves in hiding our children more than faith in God they put them they they felt the leading they put him in the basket and put him out among the crocodiles and Out Among everything else and he floated right down to Pharaoh's daughter then she raised him as a king he had everything that he could ever want raised him as as rich and and and as whatever he had a desire to have he was given to him and then he looked and he says you know what he said I would rather be a Christian than to have all of the the world's money and everything else all of the women all of the popularity all of the influence all of the Tik Tok all of the Instagram all of that stuff I would rather have Jesus Christ and if I'm going to be on there I am going to lift up Jesus Christ and I'm going to influence people in that way he says I don't want to be with Pharaoh he became a slave by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season Moses his greatest desire was to serve God esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of reward the English Standard Version says for he kept his eyes on the future reward right he saw that truck out in the distance and he's focusing on that he wanted that future reward and not the Quick Fix he knew he had a promise Deuteronomy he had this promise he said the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me Moses speaking among you from your fellow Israelites then you must listen to him for this is what you asked of the Lord God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said let us not hear the voice of the Lord Our God nor see this great fire anymore or we will die the Lord said unto me Moses speaking talking to the people the Lord told me what they say is good I will raise up for them a prophet like you Moses from among their fellow Israelites and I will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything I command I myself will call to account anyone that does not listen to my words that he that this Prophet speaks in my name who was he talking about Jesus Christ amen he says he's going to be like you Moses except better by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is visible invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them faith is action Faith is doing something faith is not sitting there and saying Lord I just want you to I just want you to be first in my life I just want you to help me Faith is is something that you do Jesus said have faith it means have faith it doesn't mean just sit back stop by the thrift store witness to someone put yourself in God's service by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians aade to do were drowned by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by by faith Rahab the Harlot perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace so so Joshua goes over he attacks um Jericho big giant walls they walk they March around the city the walls fall down they go in and Rahab had protected the spies that we went that went in before because she had the Revelation that these brothers were right in what they were saying so she hid them didn't tell on them and then Joshua's destroying Army comes in kills everybody but Rahab and her family everyone in her house because Rahab had that Faith does it say if her brothers and sisters and Mom and Dad were Sinners or not doesn't say but because of her faith they were saved because of rahab's faith and then you know what happened she was a prostitute she made her living in a bad way right but then God turned that around through her faith in God and married her to one of the greatest Generals in Joshua's Army and gave her a Wonderful Life and then she had children and those children had children and then you know who sprang up from there King David from the from the union of Rahab and Salon and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of baric and of Samson of jeepa and of David and also Samuel and of the prophets and brothers and sisters I wish I had like all day long now I know what this brother's saying when he wrote this like we can keep going let's talk about all of these who through faith subdued Kingdom wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions I'm not and what more shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and Samson and jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained the obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again the shunamite woman and Elisha the boy died Elisha came and laid his body upon the boy and he came back to life again same happen happened with his predecessor Elijah and the widow woman women received their dead to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover over bonds and imprisonment they were stoned believe it was Zechariah that was stoned the prophet and others they were son aunder Isaiah son in half they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute and Afflicted and tormented John the Baptist in the New Testament wandered about in his goat skin being destitute T tormented didn't have anything he ate Grasshoppers and honey that was his that was his diet but they took god seriously they put God's word first these were great people who put faith into action they actually did it they didn't just talk about it they didn't just teach it they did it couple minutes but they were brothers and sisters they were fallible normal people that had problems every single one of them they they weren't these great people on a pedestal that you might think here they they they did things wrong but it's okay Moses was a murderer he forgot to circumcise his son Abraham gave his wife to another man because he was afraid of being killed Sarah laughed at the promise of God Noah got drunk when he got off the ark planted a Vineyard made some wine got drunk Rahab was a prostitute they were average ordinary people just like you and me yes but they put God first they had faith and they changed the world and we can do that of whom the world is not worthy amen H that is so beautiful of whom the world was not one worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provide some better thing for us than these people a better thing for us that they without us should be made perfect better than the burning bush experienced with Moses better than than David killing Goliath better than the walls of Jericho coming down with Joshua better than the prostitute Rahab finding a Godly husband better than all of these things better than the blessings that Jacob gave to his sons better for us because they had not received the promise of Jesus Christ yet and we have our faith should be higher than theirs it should be we should be walking in faith saying Lord you've done all of these things I read in my Bible read read Hebrews 11 wherefore we wherefore seeing we are Al we also are encompassed about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight Hebrews 121 let us lay aside every weight and the sin do easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us this cloud of witness that's all over the place it's in the Bible here all of these great men and women of God and we read it and it's everywhere we have no excuse we're surrounded by this now let us run the same race that they ran looking unto Jesus it's better than my truck out there a few miles away keeping your your eye on the cross looking at looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen amen brothers and sisters we live below yes our means we live below what we were called for we should be so much more now look at that brother that that spoke yesterday I look at him and I think what a man but he started right with his family he started with his family got everything in order with his family and then he started reaching out and he started helping other people but he started right at home he built this foundation and now he's helped hundreds or even thousands of people because he was led by faith to do these things we were Made for More We Were Made for More than we give we were made for more than we do every one of us every person in this building was made for more listen to this I know who I am because I know who you are I heard this song and brothers and sisters it's so beautiful the cross I know who I am cuz I know who you are speak speaking of Christ the cross of Salvation was only the start now I am chosen free and forgiven I have a future and it's worth the living cuz I wasn't made to be tending a grave I was called by name born and raised back to life again I was made for more so why would I make my bed make a bed in my shame when a Fountain of Grace is running my way think about those words why would I dwell in my negativity why would I dwell in all of these problems that I've created for myself don't lay in that grave that you made that I've made get up and get out of it make a change have faith in God know that it's not even your faith it's Christ's faith that comes into you so when these brothers were going when Abraham was wandering in the wilderness it was the faith of Jesus Christ that God had placed there it was faith in God it wasn't faith in Abraham he failed and failed and failed Moses failed and failed and failed but it was faith in God that God could do it cuz I wasn't made to be

faith like these great Heroes that are in this Bible I believe I met one last night he's doing something and I pray that when you look up here that you're looking at one I want to do something for God and I know that I when I serve God it's never for me it is for his people they were so successful because they were not serving themselves they weren't asking God Lord help me to have money help me to have this help me to have that they were saying Lord how can I help you what would you have me do Lord like Isaiah he saw the greatness of God around the throne and the angels going about and he said Lord I'm a man of unclean lips I'm a sinner I'm lowly I'm nothing Lord I'm not even worthy to be in your presence Lord I'm a zero I'm I'm I'm nothing I'm a poser I'm I'm just I'm just I'm I'm the

in a portion where brother Brandon was talking about the law and what it took and then brother Daniel asked us to read chapter 15. and right at the beginning those who still wanted the law were trying to force the law back on the Believers so we'll read those verses then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are all which we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest had this daily ministering often offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away the sins this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost is also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days saith Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquity iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin

main verse of that it was found written on the walls of an insane Institution many years ago they don't know who the author is but they know that whoever that was was certainly inspired to write those words let's pray Lord God we thank you for another opportunity to come together to worship father to sing to to Father get into your word and understand it better I pray Lord that you'd be with us tonight father God my words is I read the words of this book of Acts I pray that The Same Spirit father same anointing that was on the author would be on here at the pulpit tonight the father that you anoint my words and anoint the ears of the year be with us Lord we pray we love you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can take your seats um again thanks to uh brother Aaron he mentioned that to thank you for the kindness from the Green family um what a nice it was a nice funeral it was uh I thought it was I thought it was interesting that uh sister green always said that she wanted to sing at her own funeral so as as it would have it they they played at the end of service they played a recording of Sister Green singing and I don't know if you noticed but there was a big picture window in the back of the funeral home where the service was and when sister green as soon as she finished singing this giant plane comes down over the Catalina mountains and and dumps this big red slurry fire up on top of the mountain and I thought what a perfect did anybody else see that wasn't that it wasn't that great it was it was and it was right at the end of her song and it came down and I just felt like the Lord turned the mountain red just representing the blood of Jesus Christ and how sister green me she may have gone and brother green may have gone and many of our loved ones may have gone but because of that red blood of Jesus Christ we have the opportunity to see them again one day that that just blessed me when I saw that come down I thought it was a fitting end um after the after the service we had a group pretty much the whole congregation I think that was there came over to the fellowship hall and we had a really nice time a fellowship and I am wild people were fellowshipping I am noticed some people coming in to the door here obviously everyone was out there in the fellowship hall and I noticed some people coming in to the door and I wondered okay what's going on in the sanctuary so I walked in and I saw some of the some of the kids and there was a lot of the family there and I think the the legalist part of me came out a little bit and and I told I told one of the the brothers that was there that was his kids I said I said hey I said I said don't let the kids um be running around the fellowship hall and I was I think I was a little bit I was a little bit too firm I was a little bit too sharp and if any of you know me I know some of the brothers know me that sometimes I can get that way a little bit where I'm just I'm too pointed and when when I did that I could feel that I offended the brother a little bit and uh he was very respectful and he he and his wife gathered up the kids and they they went out in the into the um Fellowship Hall and I wasn't kicking them out I just I wanted control in the sanctuary but like I said I think it came across too strongly and I could feel that I I grieved maybe grieved the spirit a little bit and I I may have offended the brother so and then if you know me you know that I can't think of anything when I've done that I can't think of anything until I want to make it right so finally I tracked him down I went looking for him actually I went outside I was trying to find him right after he left I walked out and I couldn't find him outside I couldn't find him inside I thought man I really messed this one out so but after 30 minutes or so I found it and I walked up to him and I said Hey brother I said I didn't mean to be so so sharp when I said that about the kids I said I just walked in and and um I saw the kids in the in the fellowship hall and I just wanted things to be I just want to keep this holy and quiet in here and he was he was visibly upset about it so we started talking and and I said brother just forgive me for the way that I came across so that's when I said hey why don't you gather up all of your kids all of these these young people and I said let's go upstairs and I'll show you our new room up there and let them play and enjoy themselves so I convinced him to come up and and we went up there and I tried to break the ice a little bit more and uh he said do you still have that Chapel up there Steve do you still do Sunday school up there I said yeah let's go let's go across the hallway so we left the family and the kids up in the upper room and then we walked across the hallway into the chapel and had a conversation with him and uh I said I said again brother I said I'm sorry about this I said I I sometimes I I get a little legalistic in in my life I said but I didn't mean it that way and he said he says you know he said it's okay and he was very very nice to me said it's okay he says he says you know he says I grew up my family grew up here my grandpa brother green was the pastor and and he said you know I just I just wanted the kids to see and I said brother I said I feel terrible and and we talked a little bit more and he said you know he said I have the table on my phone he said I listened to brother Branham a lot he said I love his message and he said but you know he says I think that sometimes what these these ministers teach what these pastors teach isn't what brother Branham taught and I said well brother I think now you're preaching my message and he says he says well he says he says it's true he says that they teach all of these different doctrines and he says I listen to these tapes and he says I don't see what they're teaching here and we had a really nice conversation so as always I think the Lord can take our failures and then he can turn them around and make it a blessing so it was really nice meeting him is very very nice brother it's Andrew is his name you probably all know him I didn't know him Andrew Green but a very very nice brother and just really impressed me impressed me in his knowledge of the word and of the scriptures he's very active in his church and if you were at the funeral wow can he sing amazing voice very very talented talented brother so we had this conversation and and as I was praying about it yesterday evening and this morning I got to thinking you know what this is exactly what I'm going to teach on on Wednesday night that's exactly what I'm going to teach on tonight is Acts chapter 15 and it's the same principles as what happened in the church yesterday with me and it's the same principles as what this brother was telling me that he was struggling with so let's turn to act let's start with Acts Chapter 14 verse 26 so so we can get an idea of what's going on here so this is Paul for those of of uh of you that uh Cynthia God bless you it's it's good to see you see your brother Joe it's good to see you Cynthia thanks thanks for coming what we're doing is we're teaching on the book of Acts we started weeks and weeks ago and and uh we we've gone through how the day at Pentecost how they received the Holy Spirit all the way up until now this Acts chapter 15 and what's happened is we see that Jesus died he rose up from the dead he promised that he was going to send his Spirit upon his disciples and he leaves he ascends up into heaven and he sends his holy spirit down to the disciples in what was called the day of Pentecost then they started doing the exact same thing that Jesus did when he was here so you look at the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John you see everything that Jesus did during that time now you see the book of Acts and the the disciples are now doing what Jesus did previously in the in the four gospels so that's what the book of Acts is it's basically Jesus A continuing continuation of Jesus's Ministry in now not in Jesus but in the disciples so the spirit of Jesus in the disciples there you have the book of Acts in short so now we're in chapter 15 where we're going to start in 14. So what had happened is they had just gone on their first missionary trip and they came back Paul and this man named Barnabas and then they sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled and when they were come they had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith unto the Gentiles and there they Abode long time with the disciples now right here we have two different groups of people for those just getting started in the book of Acts we have the Hebrews who for thousands of years have been considered God's people and we have this other group these new Believers that the Hebrews kind of shunned for all these years but now things are changing and God wants these Jews to start accepting these new believers and that's when we see the message starting to go to the Gentiles chapter 15. verse 1. so they had come back to Antioch and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so we have Paul and and Barnabas and the brothers they're going out and they're spreading the gospel they're doing Miracles they're doing doing all these things and they come back home come back to their home base in Antioch and then they see that while they were gone these people had come from Judea probably from Jerusalem they came and they started telling the people these new converts that unless you're circumcised which is from the law of Moses you can't be saved now you think well circumcision back then how important was that well let's turn to Genesis chapter 17 first circumcision was a covenant that God made between him and his prophet Abraham Genesis chapter 17 verse 10. now let me show you how important that this Covenant was this is my Covenant God speaking this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your Generations he that is born in the house or brought or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed so anyone that you even a slave or anyone a prosely anyone that you bring into the fold also has to be circumcised not only your children and ye shall circumcise let's see which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my Covenant powerful powerful statement that God gives to his prophet and this statement this Covenant between man and God went on for thousands of years so now these two brothers come down from Judea the church at Jerusalem probably they come down and they come down to this group of Greek speaking Jews and Gentiles all mixed together in Antioch and while Paul is gone they start preaching hey you're wrong here is what the prophet said you need to be circumcised according to this word now I want all of us to think where would you have been on the side of this argument before I read the next verse where would you have been where would I have been uh in this argument think about it would I stand with the prophet Abraham would I stand with the prophet Moses who brought these laws or this guy Paul where did he come from you know number one he was persecuting the Christians now all of a sudden he's he's this big guy and he's going out and he's preaching Jesus to all these people and and who is he to say that this isn't important very very put yourself in the spot where would you stand brother and where would I stand and this happens all the time this type of thing by the way before I get to the next verse how many times do you see someone come into a church there was a two brothers from Canada you probably know him um I know him fairly well they uh they came and they made their rounds in the United States did they come here they did okay their buddies of mine I know anyways for those of you you don't know what I'm talking about what they would do is they would come into a church and they would start heckling the women saying oh your your hair is your your skirts not long enough your heels are too high you're and they find everything that they could find wrong with the women and with the men and I sat across from these brothers discussing this and I was like brothers where are you getting all of this and they would go and they'd take one quote over here and one quote over here and they put it together and they'd make this Doctrine and then they would go from church to church heckling people and causing problems and just wanting basically to pull the people away from their Church many of us are familiar with these two brothers but there's also that Spirit isn't just in the extreme like those two brothers but that spirit is all over the place and we see that this is what happened in this church and these people these two brothers were probably very respected Brothers they obviously knew the word well and they came in and what they did is they caused trouble now remember Paul was going through do you remember the area he was going through from the previous galatia so if you look in the book of Galatians Paul addresses this I believe it's in Galatians chapter one and he calls them troublemakers referring to these brothers right here verse number two when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they were preaching circumcision exactly what is in the Bible given to Abraham preached by Moses one of the laws preaching these things there's no small dissension and disputation with them they determined now this is the group at Antioch they determined this caused a problem it's like well we need some answers here that Paul and bartimus and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question so it's like Paul and Barnabas we love you but we need an answer maybe from the ones that were so respected like maybe Peter maybe John these ones maybe James these ones that walked with Jesus Paul all right we'll go so we have to realize that when Paul was was telling these Brethren like no you don't have to be circumcised you don't have to you don't have to go through all of these laws and all of this stuff Paul was not preaching against the law Paul was not saying that the law is wrong if you look Beyond this chapter you see that Paul very much his whole life honored the Jewish principles and the Jewish traditions and the Jewish law he never varied from it we see later on that brother Lyle or I one of us will get to that Paul wanted to get back to Jerusalem to honor the feast day to be there so he can observe this this Feast this Jewish tradition that I guarantee you Paul still believed that was right but with these new converts he says no he says you don't have to do this so whose side would I have been on at this at this moment I mentioned the legalism nature sometimes that I have I think Brother Andy I think I know where I would have been in this specific place I think I may have been on the wrong side but thank God we have this word recorded here and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they cause great joy unto all the Brethren so they stopped in these these different spots and everyone rejoiced that they had so many conversions and so many baptism and the Lord was was doing so much and the church was growing and everyone was just rejoicing and then they came to Jerusalem and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed very very important part of that scripture these are not the Pharisees like you think that crucified Jesus these are the Pharisees these are the ministers that had given their hearts to Jesus Christ these are the ones that have they were they were ministers before they saw that this man Christ this man Peter this man John this man James these brothers are right in their Doctrine this man Jesus fulfills the the Prophecies of this Messiah so these are real Believers Minister brethren and they said that it was needful to them it was needful to circumcise them these are the new believers and to command them to keep the law of Moses now of course these Pharisees believe in grace you can't believe in Jesus and not believe in grace you can't believe in Christ and not accept the sacrifice that Jesus made for us so these Pharisees knew but they were they were caught up in in their traditions and their way of thinking and the apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter and when there had been much disputing so they had all the brothers together maybe in the church now this is the church this is the First Christian Church in the whole world that they're at in Jerusalem thousands probably a people that were members of this church and when they had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and Brethren now remember Peter is a very respected man and brethren you know how that a good while ago God made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe now do you know what he was referring to you guys remember what was it what was the man's name Cornelius right so what happened in this he's referring to a couple chapters back I think it was Acts 10. he was referring to when this man Cornelius an angel comes and visits this this uh I believe he's a centurionist soldier Cornelius and tells him that this man Peter has the truth for him and to send people to go get Peter and to bring him back Peter was up on the housetop praying Peter sees a vision down comes all of these unclean animals that Peter would never eat as a Jew they were against the law to eat them you know what they are can anybody say I want any of them are what a pig a pig because it doesn't chew its cup it's cud but it has a cloven hoof you can eat it if it has a cloven hoof and choose its cut fish rabbits because it chews its cut and doesn't have a cloven hoof uh there's a bunch of them that you can't eat so all of these come down and Peter is hungry and the Lord tells him rise up Peter he says kill these animals and eat them and Peter's like not me because I'm a Jew I don't I don't need anything like that um I'm kosher and uh then the Lord tells him why have you made unclean what I have made clean so Peter it's like wow what then there's a knock at the door and there is this Gentile saying come to my Master's house and tell us about the Lord so Peter goes and he goes to the cornelius's house he preaches Jesus Christ they accept him and we see a conversion of a gentile right here so that's what he's referring to here when he says by my mouth the first one should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith amazing so he's saying that God filled these unclean they used to call them heathens these these people that didn't believe the message before they come in and those that have believed their whole lives and have lived the message and done their best and lived lived a life Worthy the Holy Spirit does the same thing to both of them you have somebody that knows nothing about the message then you have somebody that knows everything about the message and wow they received the same thing it's amazing he's saying that God is Not exclusive to any denomination or any group as long as there's Jesus Christ there now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear now remember there's a difference as I said right when we started this series I said that there's a difference between a disciple and an apostle an apostle would be one that sent out to spread the gospel a disciple is one that has received the gospel and now believes Jesus Christ so we are all disciples I'm a disciple you're a disciple all of us are Disciples of Christ let me read that again now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear so he's saying that these people have have accepted Christ but now you're saying that they have to live up to all these Commandments I'm not talking about just the ten there's like 600 more in Leviticus and and and exodus and Deuteronomy there there's all of these Commandments literally it's over 600. and they take these and then they twist them and they they they they fight over how they're supposed to be implemented and all this and you get this big conglomeration this big mess of a religion and all it is is about legalism it's washing dishes a certain way special diet sacrificing in a certain way special clothing with tassels woven in a certain way not eating as as we said catfish and pork and rabbits and and I don't want to get too too far into it but not having a television not watching movies I hear a certain length choose a certain size skirts a certain League Church three times a week all of these different these different um ordinances and he's saying here Peter's saying but you still sinned but you still have failed he's not saying that any of those things are wrong he's not saying that that Holiness is wrong by any means he's not saying that but he's saying but it was incomplete without the blood of Christ I think it's in the I think it's in uh I forgot where it was in Romans I think it is he says he talks about the grace of God and he says but then do I sin that Grace May abound he says God forbid I won't do that yet because when we see that Peter is saying that this failed and he says you weren't even able to live up to this he says your ancestors were your parents weren't your grandparents were all the way back to Adam you weren't able to live up to these to these ordinances and now you want to place it place this on these people and you want to make them live up to this when you couldn't do it talking about these men that came in there to galatia to Antioch and what good did it do you know what good and I I look at look at my life and I I think about and I still I still do my best to live a very legalistic life I do my best to toe the line you know and I know sometimes I don't talk like it but I haven't had a TV in decades you know I don't go to see movies I don't do I don't do any of those things but what good that's just me doing my best to serve the Lord that's me doing my best to live a holy life before the Lord works Grace is what God did for me works are what I do for him but I look back even at my life and the way that I live just in Daniel's a witness how we lived as just as close as I could as perfect as I could to all of these different doctrines and I think what where did I ever through my doctrines through my legalism where did I ever lead someone to Christ never and very seldom has it happened and here we see that very question instead of all of these things Peter here saying salvation can't be found in anything except Christ but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they and then all the multitude kept silent and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them what if this had been an intellectual gospel what if this would have just been someone who goes and they can just open the scriptures and explain it but the supernatural followed this ministry that's why I believe that we must have that Supernatural following our Ministries it needs to be there it shows that God is with us because there were miracles and there were new conversions and there were baptisms and the body was growing they received Paul and Barnabas with respect and after they had held their peace James answering said men and Brethren hearken unto me do you know who this James guy is is very very important this isn't you know you read in the gospels Peter James and John this isn't John's brother James he was killed earlier in the book of Acts this is Jesus's brother his not his real brother but Jesus's brother James his foster brother I guess we could call him James was also the pastor of the church at Jerusalem very important man but Andy I had a question for you so if James was the pastor of this church in Jerusalem he was the first pastor how could Catholicism say that Peter was the first one doesn't make sense it's a it's a flaw it's a fatal flaw saying that that this Peter was the first leader he wasn't yes he had the Keys of the Kingdom but this man James was the pastor of the church so these brothers they they weighed in on on the circumcision and the other things Paul and Peter weighed in their side now we see James and he weighs in and he had a lot of authority James says this James answered and said men and brother and hearken unto me Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name not for his name now Simeon in other words for Simeon is Simon Simon is actually Peter so he's quoting Peter but he's using Brother lilies Jewish name because it's directing it to a bunch of the the Jews the original Believers here and you know I just one thing it's one of the reasons I just I love I love this Bible so much I like to look at the past in the Bible the Bible it shows the purpose in a lot of these things even the language that was written in you see Matthew Mark and Luke and John and acts and Romans and first and second Corinthians all the way to Second Timothy it's written in the language of Greek not Hebrew if it was written to the Jews it would have been written in their language but it was written in a language and then the Romans and the Greeks they wouldn't have understood probably Hebrew but they spoke this language Greek so this Bible this new testament was mostly written in that language so that these new Believers would understand look at the focus look at look at the emphasis that's put on the new believers even in the very language that it was written in then if then we see the book of Hebrews and you can remember because it's named Hebrews that was written more to the Jewish people and that original language was Hebrew or Aramaic the that that language back to James back to James speaking and to disagree the words of the Prophet as it is written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up so he's referring back to the prophecy of a man named Amos a prophet that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things so he's quoting the prophets and he's saying that the prophets are not saying that they have to be converted to the Jewish message before they come to Christ he's saying that they have to be converted to Christ he's saying that there's not a step between between an a new a new person that may not know anything about Jesus and Jesus you don't have to go through Judaism brother Lyle you don't have to go through the Hebrew you don't have to go through all the laws you can just go straight to Christ there's a parable it just comes to mind there's a parable that these laborers are out in the field and they've been they've been working and they make a deal they one comes in the morning he makes a deal with with the owner of of the um the farm or whatever it was and it says I'll give you this much so they go out and work they work all day then he hires some right at noon time working half the day they come out they they go working and then right before quitting time he hires this other this other guy and then at the end he pays them all the same and he and they said well how come we worked all day and this guy gets the same pay as us and he says I gave you exactly what we agreed to and that's the same here is you don't have to go through all of these different roads to get to Christ like the Jews did you can just go straight to him so a new believer doesn't have to conform to all these things that comes later that new believer you can go straight to Christ and you're there you're already home run out of the park you made it now if you love God now you can start to implement these things in your life where am I at verse 17. I just read it I'll read it read it again that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world God knows it all he knows what's going on he knows where you were born he knows where you're going to die he knows Genesis to Revelation he knows the beginning to the end now James says here now we see the authority that's in this man James were for my sentences my decision is this that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God he says James is saying don't trouble them don't don't trouble these new Believers with all all of these rules and and all these regulations and and all the way you eat and circumcision all that he says don't trouble them but he doesn't doesn't say us brother Paul he doesn't say that we have that that we the Jews and I'm not saying that we are but speaking back in the book of Acts he doesn't say that Paul should change he doesn't say that Peter should change he doesn't say that they should start living like the Gentiles do he says he's talking to them he's talking to the Gentiles now this is really neat but that we write unto them so he's going to write a letter and it's it's really this is really amazing because you get a letter inside of This Book of Acts so you know the Epistles that we have first and second Timothy and Titus and and uh first and second Corinthians all those we have an epistle inside the book of Acts and it says this but we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood so he's telling the new converts to stay away from eating things that were sacrificed to Idols in other places Paul Paul says hey don't worry about it but don't offend anyone but here James is saying that this is a really big deal to the Jewish Believers so do your best to stay away from those things and these new converts they may have been brought up by their families and with certain values that that may not have lined up now he's he's talking about things strangled and from the blood and and from um things sacrificed to Idols but then he says and stay away from fornication and some of these Greeks and these Gentiles may have been brought up that that oh it's okay to go out and run around before you're married but this was a very very important thing to tell all of the children not just the Jewish ones but all of them hey don't do this before you're married it'll cause all kinds of problems he says from things strangled again this was a pagan ritual these animals were sacrificed on Pagan altars and then they were sold for food and the same thing with the blood some of the cultures would eat blood or add blood to certain dishes and this was an offense to Jewish people so basically with the Jews everything had to be bled out before it was kosher before you could eat it so he's saying here that these things are especially offensive so don't do these things even though you might feel you might not feel condemned by it but those long time Believers that will offend them so now we have two ways going back here back and forth we see that that Paul is saying to those longtime Believers he said he's saying hey have some Grace have some patience with these people don't worry about it if they're not living up to all of these these things that that you set forth now don't you backslide he says but but respect them in the way they were raised and just don't do these certain things and then on the other side for the new Believers he's saying hey and you respect these long time Believers respect their thoughts respect how they act two there's a mutual respect in this letter written by James both sides I love that that's a Christian way you know we see so often we see the more rebellious say you can't tell me what to do we know I know that's that's not the point you know so so there's that sometimes that disrespect but then there's the disrespect of of the like our friends from Canada oh you're looking like this you see all this girl's dressed and you know all of that oh did you see this guy you know he's out there swimming in a pair of shorts you know you know and then going on that and Paul or James here is saying respect each other James continues on and he says for Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day so so he's saying hey Moses is still a prophet he's still being preached in the churches that shouldn't be forgotten he has a prophet after all don't forget what he said but then we've taken that and made as I said like 600 of all of these rituals and stuff that they didn't do anything they really didn't accomplish anything so they write this letter then it pleased then well that's what James said we should write a letter that says this then it pleased then pleased at the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surname barsabis and Silas Chief men among the brethren another masterful decision by James so maybe they wouldn't let's say by the end of you and me are Barnabas or Silas and or were Barnabas and Paul and we come back to the church and we're preaching the same thing that we were before they might not believe us but instead they sent two representatives from the church that people knew to go with them this man Judas of course not is cared as another man named Judas and Silas Chief men among the brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this manner the apostles and the elders and the Brethren sin greetings so here's the letter the apostles and the elders and the brother and sin greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Celestia for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so these Brethren came from this church and they said we're from the Tucson Tabernacle and our pastor says this and this and this or we come from the thing that would bug me so much is when the Brethren would come from Jeffersonville when I was back there they'd go all over the world and they say we're from Jeffersonville and here's how you should do things and and here's what brother Branham said and here's here's uh here's what brother Joseph's teaching and and all this let me tell you we can all speak for ourselves brother Branham there's 1200 tapes and they're really good if you want to know what brother Branham said listen to him you don't need me to interpret it to you it's he spoke good English spoke very understandable English if you want to hear what he said listen to him and the same goes from rep representing Brother Joseph or representing brother Biscoe or any of these other men of God let them speak for themselves they don't need us talking for them it causes problems and I've seen it so often these problems people come in they stir up the people and they'll come into a church cause all these problems the churches will split and I have all these problems because they're representing somebody else if you want to know what I'm saying listen to me go on tucsontabernacle.com I'm I'm there a couple times a week if you want to hear what brother Branham says listen to him don't take someone else's word for it because there's always an agenda there and that's why we see all of these problems that's why brother Brandon when he was preaching he said refer back to these tapes and if you'll listen to that quote he was talking about the Seven Seals if I remember right and these people are getting it mixed up and they're quoting me wrong and all just listen listen to what I say and that's why we see all these problems that's why it is so important if you want to believe William Branham listen to him as I said he spoke very clearly and that's what that brother said up upstairs he said I love listening to brother Branham it's because everybody changes it to match their own agenda I could talk about that brother Jordan all night long you know I just because I've seen so many problems the exact same thing that was happening here in the book of Acts they go and they represent someone and here is the letter that comes out and it says for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such Commandments we did not send these guys out as I said let the prophet speak for himself it's we have here in the Bible we have small small precious writings from the prophet and they're just they are golden to us we just cherish them so much and we read them and we study them and we come to church to learn more about them and the ministers they they study these things and they they they try to apply we try to apply them to our own lives but then we hear Brother Branham and we can hear him we can listen to a whole tape and and really understand what he is saying and if you want to believe him believe him you don't have to have me explain to you what he was meaning he did a very good job of it and as as brother said and I've said before I really don't believe brother Branham intended for us to have all of these different doctrines that go around the church and divide people I just I don't believe that he intended that I've listened to him since I was born and he's uh it's just a blessing every time it really it really is Sister Cynthia when I talk about brother Branham he was a man that that was here in the 40s and 50s and 60s he started a Ministry that really changed the world it was he started what's called charismatic Revival he uh he did absolutely incredible things one of the most the most gifted person that you could ever imagine he preached right here in this church he preached from this pulpit and what would happen is people would come in the prayer lines he would tell them exactly what was wrong with them if they were sick in fact many times he would say here's your address and tell tell the person their address he would say things that no one knew he was he would say this morning you went to the doctor's office and the doctor looked at you and he was wearing a blue vest and and something on his head and he's told you these things things that he absolutely could not know but the Holy Spirit was working through this man to increase the people's Faith so they could be healed and when I mentioned William Branham he he was he was very special he's the reason I'm converted he's the reason I'm a Christian today so he holds a big place in my heart verse number 25. it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord to send chosen men unto you this is our letter part this is the continuation of the letter chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth for it seems seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these Necessary Things that you abstain from Meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do well fairly well wow very simple very very simple he's saying stay away from idols and live clean not all of these rules and all these regulations and all of that he's saying just be a Christian so when they were dismissed they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation I'll bet they did and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them and after they had carried their space they were let go in peace from the Brethren unto the apostles I can finish notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still no no let me go back to that previous verse it says verse 32 verse 31 I'm sorry which when they had heard when they read this letter they rejoiced for the for the consolation so so they were happy about all this that that they didn't feel led to be circumcised even though there was a very strict rule yet the the letter came back no you don't have to do that no you don't have to do all of these all of these rules basically stay away from idols and live clean and then Silas decided to stay and the other brother went back Paul also in Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do now they had left Antioch for a little while and all kinds of problems came in with this these legalist Brothers came in and stirred everything up and caused all these problems so Paul's like hey we need to go back to all these churches that we visited and make sure they're doing okay make sure troublemakers hadn't gotten the middle of them too and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was marked remember this guy he was the one that left in the middle of a missionary trip before upset Paul but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them to pamphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God and he went through Syria and cilicia confirming the churches so we see that there was a contention the minute the um musicians can come make ready we see there was a contention between these two brethren and and they couldn't get it reconciled so they parted ways and I don't think we hear from Barnabas again the rest of the book of Acts is mainly about Paul but I want to I think the first part of Acts 16 also goes very well with 15. let me read the first three verses speaking of Paul then came he to Derby and to lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a Jewish a Jewish and believed but his father was a Greek which was well speaking of Timothy which was well reported of by the Brethren that were at lystra and Iconium him would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek so Timothy didn't think it was necessary to be circumcised or he would have already been circumcised but now he gets on the field and he's going to be witnessing and preaching to Jewish believers so he had to be circumcised because they wouldn't have accepted him so we see that's why Timothy Timothy now is on the scene and we see that he took on this circumcision for the ministry not necessarily because he felt a conviction but for the people that he was preaching to we together do you understand do you understand that there was a this letter was a mutual respect this letter was written to these new converts and it was like no you don't have to conform to all of these rules just don't live immorally and don't get caught up in these idols and don't drink the blood because it's going to offend really bad that's really bad don't do those things and then he speaks to the new converts and he says Hey respect these longtime believers respect what they do and respect the way that they live because Moses taught all of this stuff so we see a beautiful mutual respect in the book of Acts brother and if you want to come you understand do you love the book of Acts I love it I love it because I see especially in this book I see that this is what we struggle with so often in our churches well someone will come in or someone within the church and start pointing fingers both sides both sides will the liberal ones and the legalistic ones start pointing fingers at each other and it does nothing but cause problems what he's saying here is respect each other don't try to impose things that never worked in the first place because it it it doesn't work it wasn't written for that it was just written as a guiding principle to keep us on the path till we get to Christ amen let's all stand through the blood through the blood through the blood we can come to his presence through Jesus Christ [Music] all through [Music] Jesus Christ awaken down [Music] for the Paul if you if you come in close by the Paul I uh I asked a young Lydia Peterson to do a project for me she pointed out to me on Sunday she said she said brother Daniel we're in the book of Acts she said look at all of the names in our church right now that are in the book of Acts and and especially right now we have Eunice know who Eunice was the mother of Timothy we have Lois you know who Lois was the grandmother of Timothy we have Lydia who's going to be coming up in in a night in one of the next chapters a seller of purple and a servant of the Lord we have Paul right here and we have Silas or the Silas Lindsay now partnering with Paul brother Silas Lindsay I've I have him actually on a mission tonight doing something for me little blessing that that sister Lydia blessed me with and I appreciated the fact that yeah we're in the book of Acts 2.

such a day well the lot fell upon Jonah they cried what must we do throw me to the water and this storm will be through down in the belly of the fish went Jonah down to the bottom of the sea your turn down in the belly of fish Jonah down to the bottom of the sea now Jonah was in trouble he thought that he was through how he wish that he had done the things that God had told him to so Jonah started praying and then at God's command that fish Rose from the bottom and swam right to dry land up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the SE Jonah just came right out of the fish's mouth yep up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the sand again God spoke to Jonah and this time he obeyed to the city called Nineveh he quickly made his way he cried to them of

before I tell you a little bit about this uh this song they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves they mount up to the heaven they go down to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their stresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men about a week ago I was uh having a hard time going to asleep and and a tune started just going through my head very similar to the chorus of what we just sang and it just kept going through my head and going through my head and oh so I got up and tried to grunt a little bit into a microphone and and capture sort of what was going on and there were words that were kind of in the background there that were coming along and so I wrote those down too and and then uh I I shared my grunting with uh sister Martha and she she put it to music and so by God's grace I want to try and find the right space maybe even on the keys this time I'm usually between them somewhere and and try and and and sing this song I'll put the words up for you it's it's very simple what you would expect okay we'll [Music] try I want to

evening on Wednesday's evenings we've been going through the books of the Bible as our Pastor Daniel has told us we're breaking the pattern a little bit tonight and we're going to have a short lesson from the Book of Jonah before we open our Bibles to look at this book Let's approach the Lord one more time in prayer together Lord Jesus it's such an honor Lord that we can be gathered together in your name in this place at this time to worship you to praise you to read your word to listen for you to speak to us Lord to answer questions to answer needs to touch hearts Lord to just move by your spirit in our midst as our desire Lord that you would accept our worship our praise our singing the thoughts of a heart be pleasing to you forgive us Lord of everything that's been incorrect in our

our knees and thank you for all that you've done in Jesus precious name amen while you're standing and for our opening first verses I'd like to read two short accounts now if you've been here on Wednesdays you know that they're not going to be from Jonah the first is going to be from Genesis the second will be from the gospel of Matthew now the Book of Jonah focuses geographically on the Assyrian capital city of Nineveh in Genesis 10 Noah his sons and their wives have exited the ark After the flood we're given an account of Noah's sons and their descendants did I hit the wrong button technical difficulty there we are now these are the generations of the sons of Noah and I've highlighted Shem and ham because they play a part in our story of Jonah tonight Shem ham and yaet and unto them were Sons born After the flood verse six and the sons of ham Kush and misraim and F and Canan and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and the beginning of nimrod's kingdom was Babel and ER and aad and khna all in the land of shinar what we think of was Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq and out of that land Shar or Mesopotamia went forth Asher and builded Nineveh and the City of roobot and Kalah okay so you ask yourself who's Asher well going back to Noah's sons they're children of Noah's son Shem Alm and Asher and araxid and L and Aram from this we see that Nineveh was a very an ancient city one of the first mentioned After the flood it was located in the area we think of as Mesopotamia it was founded by Asher which is the Hebrew word for Assyria when you read in your Bible and it says Assyria the word is Asher this gentleman's name Assyria meaning prosperous or successful just a a little fun fact here in in the ruins of a library found in one of the first archaeological digs in what would prove to be Nineveh in 1853 was a set CL tablets and they contain the Epic of gilgames you you may have heard of that it includes a story about the Earth being destroyed by a flood and the tablet with that portion of the story is known as the flood tablet which you see here excavated from the ruins of Nineveh now from the gospel of Matthew Jesus is being challenged by his detractors Matthew 12 you read then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master meaning teacher show us a sign we would see a sign from thee and Jesus answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous meaning worshiping the wrong thing evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given to it to you he's in their face right now but the sign of the prophet Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the and the whale's belly the Greek word means a big sea creature with a gaping mouth Jonah was three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this evil and adulterous generation and shall condemn it he's going to these guys that we're going to hear about tonight are going to condemn you scribes and Pharisees because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold Jesus says look at me Behold a greater than Jonas is here please be seated I'm I'm sure their knees got weak and they were seated too we've been studying through the Bible and we're now in the area of the Bible that we call the minor prophet Jonah is fifth among this group and they're just called minor because of the short writings that they left not because of the lack of importance of what they said Jonah is one of only two books of the Minor Prophets The Other being n that deal not with Israel or Judah or an Empire like Egypt or Babylon or a neighboring Nation like Edom but with a single Gentile City and they both deal with the same city Nineveh we know very little about Jonah the Book of Jonah is four short chapters a total of only 48 verses the only other reference to him in the Old Testament is a oneliner that tells us where he was from a place called gath heer though separated by Jesus from some 700 years he was from the same part of the Galilee he wasn't from Jerusalem or some place like that he would have been a neighbor of Jesus if they'd lived in the same day I'm going to try and show you some of the many parallels between Jonah and Jesus one of the reasons or purposes of our brief overviews of the books of the Old Testament has been to see where Jesus is portrayed prophesied or otherwise present and we're pressed for time this evening I I was given 20 minutes and remember that when I did did the psalm and sang the song that didn't count against the 20 minutes so we're going to get right into this book okay so here's an overview the topics of the Book of Jonah it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City and if you fall asleep as long as you heard that song that the Petersons did you've got the book okay so I'm I'm just filling in a little bit in between the lines for you here it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City Nineveh Jonah thought it was all about judgment and destruction on a terrible Place God knew it was about demonstrating his mercy and kindness his grace to those willing to repent and reform to change their ways and to show that such Grace was not limited to the descendants of Jacob so the first thing we read here is Jonah flees the presence of the Lord was now we'll start reading from Jonah 1:1 now the word of the Lord came into Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh that great large Mighty proud city cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me must have been pretty wicked for out of all the world this to come to send a prophet here we see the Lord is sending a Jewish Prophet to a gentile City we're given its name told it's a very large city and that the wickedness of it is Extreme and the Lord wants the people there to be warned God always warns Before Destruction giving people an opportunity to turn to him but Jonah rose up to flee flee that's what that's what Joseph did right with the baby Jesus when the angel came and told him about Herod flee to Egypt so Jonah Rose to flee unto tares from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa that's modern day Tel Aviv and he found a ship going to tarses tares immediate question comes to mind where's this tarish that Jonah was attempting to reach the short answer no one really knows many think it refers to a town on the southern coast of Spain I've seen that in many many references oh he was going to go 25 200 miles to okay this is 8th Century BC we know that ships went there but or maybe another name for Tarsus where the Apostle Paul came from we know of a tarses that Solomon sent ship to ships to every 3 years to get silver in gold and apes and ivory you don't find that in Turkey you don't find that in Spain so this does not describe a place on the Mediterranean but most likely on the east coast of Africa in Solomon's time so there's more than one tarses what we do know is that Nineveh is some 500 miles Overland From Galilee on The Tigress River and if you got there by boat or by fish uh it's about 500 mil from the mouth of the Persian Gulf so little hard to get to I personally suspect that it's the Tarsus of Paul it would be reasonable to find ships going up and down the Eastern Mediterranean coast and to be able to go down to a port and find a ship going that way because it was a lot of trade going on on that route It was a commercial route and it was heavily traveled much less likely to find one going to Spain or East Africa and having space for a passenger so let's continue on so Jonah paid the fair thereof went down into it to go with them unto tarses from the presence of the Lord now we aren't told why he thought tarses would get him away from God's presence only that it was his destination and he was desperate to get there as fast as he could to flee but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea lighten it of them you can see in in this uh slide that that ship ships weren't very large they had a single sail a shallow draft there may or may not have been limited cabin space on the main deck the picture in the upper right of the screen here shows how such Merchant ships were loaded they had a very almost flat a very shallow rounded bottom of a hall it's great if you're in calm water not so good if the WEA is choppy so the bottom of the hall because it's not a nice deep V like we'd have in a modern ship they filled it with rocks for ballast in order to keep the ship basically upright the inner deck covering the ballast was unloaded with Goods to be transported which were segregated and loaded in the HS passengers and Crews might be on this level as well the top deck had Goods lashed down and these typically be the lightest Goods again to maintain the balance of the ship so to empty the ship of its Wares especially in a storm the crew would have to unsecure the cargo crates and jars and carry or hand them up to the top deck to be tossed overboard and as we read in Psalms 107 a little earlier ships were very unstable in a storm Rising near the crest of the wave and down into the trough making this an arduous a very dangerous undertaking but Jonah was gone out into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship Master the the captain came to him and said Jonah what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not you recognize a similar situation with Jesus and the gospels he was sleeping on a ship being tossed about in a storm on the Sea of Galilee the disciples some of whom were experienced fishermen on that Lake were in fear of their lives and went to wake Jesus Mark 4:35 to 38 for those of you taking notes yeah so what's next Jonah is thrown into the sea so back to Jonah the the sailors determined that Jonah is the cause of the problem so they said unto him the Mariners said to Jonah what shall we do unto thee that the ship may be common unto us for the sea rought and was tempestuous and Jonah said to them take me up cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great Tempest is upon you nevertheless the men rode hard to bring the ship to the land but they could not for the sea rot and was tempestuous tempestuous against them and understand that in these days they didn't have compasses they didn't have navigation things they batteries were dead in their GPS so they always sailed close to Land close to shore where they could see land it was never far away which also meant that they were on typically pretty shallow water which meant that any storm coming was going to be particularly severe if you've ever done any scuba diving or just brought in a boat from the shore in the ocean where it's just a little bit wavy as you get close to short tends to get really choppy because of the of the of the slope and the currents in the motion and so forth wherefore they Cried unto the Lord why would they cry unto the Lord why would they cry to Jonah's God because they understood that it was Jonah's God that was mad with them it wasn't their gods they' already figured that out so they're crying to Jonah's God we beseech thee Oh Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life and let not Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh Lord Hast done as it pleased thee so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased from her raging then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice under the Lord and made vows in Mark 6 we read of disciples rowing against a strong wind Jesus walks on the water as soon as he enters the boat the storm ceases like the Mariner and Jonah's both the disciples we were told were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered in Jonah's case he had to be cast out of the boat for the storm to cease in Jesus case he had to come into the boat for the storm to cease in both cases those in the boat were amazed well what happens next a great fish swallows Jonah so Jesus is in the boat but what about Jonah now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights and that brings us to the parallel from our opening scriptures where Jesus said that he that as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and nights so Jesus would be in the heart of the earth what's the first thing Jonah did he prayed he prayed to the Lord he couldn't see if the storm calmed or not he was an in a terrible and fearful situation the storm was the last thing on his mind at this point this is not a Disney cartoon of Pinocchio the puppet boy and monstro the whale this is a unique as they said in the song a real life event is it true yes it's true let's read then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord he's no longer running he's no longer Aid avoiding the Lord he's turning to the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice skipping down to verse N I will sacrifice unto thee with all that I have what does he have he's in the belly of a fish what does God really want from us the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord word and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land how he was kept alive or preserved or breathed inside that sea creature we don't know a brother random spoke about Jonah many times and said he didn't know what we do know is that after three days and nights Jonah was spit out of the fish onto the shore and he was alive well what happens next oh Jonah's not fleeing the presence Jonah goes to Nineveh we don't know how long afterwards we don't know ex exactly where he was but the Lord had Jonah's attention the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time saying arise go into Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose and again tried to flee from the presence no no Jonah arose and he went unto Nineveh according to the word of the lord we can only speculate how long it took by what means he traveled it seems likely that some people witnessed his ejection from the Monstrous fish and would have followed him to see what might happen to share the amazing Miracle of Jonah's arrival on their Shores God doesn't usually do things in the shadow but in the open further there were many tens of gods worshiped in Nineveh and a fish God was among them this would give further impact to Jonah's Miracle now we read Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey that doesn't mean it takes three days to get there it means it would take you three days to go through the place this is a big place remember it was about 500 Miles Overland from japa where he got on the boat about 4 450 mil from his home in giley it's like walking from Tucson to Albuquerque here's a satellite view to give you an idea of the perspective I've shown Jerusalem japa where he got on the boat and Nineveh where he was headed way up on the Tigris River at the time of Jonah this is a little hard to see but those of you sitting in the back understand why we always encourage people to sit in the front at the time of Jonah the Assyrian Empire was still expanding it included the two darker shades of green that you see here but that light shade of green it hadn't reached those borders yet it'd be some 40 years after Jonah's Ministry that Assyria would conquer Israel and subjugate Judah this is uh just one artist idea based on different archaeological things and and texts and so forth of what it might have looked like in ancient Nineveh it was not only the capital of the Assyrian Empire it was a major Center of Commerce on major eastwest and Norths South trade routes you might say all roads lead to Nineveh this is a picture of one of the gates of Nineveh that was uncovered and partially restored prior to the general destruction a decade or so ago from Isis you can see I've circled with an oval there a human headed bull at the lower right of the entry circled in yellow the arrow that I put next to it is about I've got shoes on about my height about six feet gives you an idea the size of that gate that is an impressive massive intimidating structure and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown interesting word overthrown we don't know anything other than this title of his sermon or sermons or prophecies to the people of Nineveh we don't know for how many days he was among them preaching proclaiming the word of the Lord if he was like any of the other prophets and if the Lord is consistent he would have been telling the people to repent so the people of Nineveh believed God that is they believed the word of the Lord that Jonah spoke no doubt influenced by the miracle of his survival inside the sea creature and proclaimed a fast put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them in this section we see that the preaching of Jonah saying what the Lord told him to say back in verse one is effective for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his Ro robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes this is a sign of mourning and of humility skipping to verse eight he said let man and Beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yay let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands the background in this slide is a detail from a bronze gate of Bell a city near Nineveh of the same era from a photo I took at the British museum the ninevites the Assyrians were an exceedingly cruel and violent people I'd left the text obscuring the image on purpose there's children here I don't want to scare them but there are heads hung around the city gate men with their hands and feet cut off piles of hands and feet on the ground another man impaled on a spike afterwards these are cruel wanly violent Wicked people this is embossed on this City Gate warning anyone who comes this is a powerful Empire tolerates no breaking of its rules you have no rights once you enter these Gates a place without Mercy a place that Rules by violence back to the king's Proclamation turn everyone from his evil away in from the violence who can tell if God will turn and and repent turn away from his Fierce anger that we perish not repent of course means to change direction to turn around not God repenting from sin but his happiness that the people were changing their Direction and God heard their words Lord if he'll do this and that I promise I'll serve you it's not what it says God saw their works didn't listen to what they said he saw what they did he observed their actions that they turned from their evil way and God repented of God turned from the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not this is an unprecedented event again Nineveh was the capital of Assyria the Assyrian Empire was vast the Army ruthless the laws were harsh punishment wanly cruel think of a rabbi today going to the IAH and Iran and telling him Terran was going to be destroyed by the god of Israel in 40 days how do you think he'd be received by the Ayatollah in tan today well that's the sort of place and the kind of regime that Jonah was sent to but the people of Nineveh did repent from the King to the lowest person even the animals were made to fast turns out that Jonah wasn't pleased with this result and the Lord then proceeded to kindly teach him a lesson about the value of human and even animal life but oh I'm out of time and wait wait I see someone coming in the main entrance of the sanctuary could it be Jonah did you hear what the rabbi said about these people of Nineveh did you hear how evil they were and how filthy they were and all the problems that they caused and all of all of the filth that's in Nineveh did you hear about that do you hear what he said he was kind they were bad they were immoral they were violent they were evil so here I am a servant of the Lord and God tells me to go to that filthy Wicked place of neveh did I get him right or did I get him wrong you have a place there's this place here in these United States it's called Los Angeles you know play have you heard of to that place has anybody been there to Los Angeles what's it like it's awful it's bad huh yeah have like nasty people walking down the streets and and and uh they have like stars in in the in the ground and memorials and monuments and and idols and all of that this place n of it was like that so then God tells me go to this Place Nineveh and cry out against it I'm not going to that place brother Joe it's nasty so I go down to Jaffa and I pay my money and I get a ticket and off I go to a place called Tarsus very nice fine Jewish people there it's a nice place this place tarus so I get in the boat and I'm going along and and we're cruising along I don't know how you sisters walk in these [Laughter] things almost fell back there you need a split now I can [Laughter] see so I'm going along and I'm in the boat and I want to get some rest it's a long way so I go down in the bottom in the middle of the boat and there's this nice bed there I lay down and I'm resting really well and I'm asleep and all of a sudden one of these Heathen Gentiles that were up in the boat one of the Mariners you know they're rough they cuss they do all kinds of bad stuff they're violent they would fit perfect in Nineveh but he comes down he says wake up wake up you sleeper get up get up come up with we're we're about to perish I was like what you know the boat's rocking I get up there and the the wind is blowing and there's lightning and there's rain and and there's water all over and the waves are coming up over the boat and I and I'm there and they're asking everybody what are you what's going on and everybody starts all of these heathens start praying to their own Gods my God yeah that's going to do a lot of good and this one's praying to that God and that one's praying praying to this God I almost fell off the side and this one's it's modest and then this one's going over this one and that one and and I say watching and they they have this way of finding out the truth and they take these like their Dice and they they throw them out and they knew that it was me and they're throwing all their stuff over overboard they're trying to lighten the ship and they look over at me and they say you're the one what do we do the ship's going to sink and I say well here's what happened you know you're praying to all your Gods I serve the true God I serve the god that created the sea I serve the god that created the land and my God told me to go to this place Nineveh but now I'm on this boat going to Tarsus I said are you crazy what are you doing if you're God's real and he told you to go to Tarsus or told you to go to Nineveh why are you going to Tarsus they said what do we do and I said well really the best way for you to survive this my God is the god he's the almighty Jehovah take me throw me over the boat throw me into this Raging Sea and then you'll be safe they didn't want to do it I saw that these men weren't what I thought they were and they started praying and they didn't pray to their God gods they prayed to the God that I told them about and they were asking for Mercy they said they said Lord Lord God we don't want to throw this man over I said throw me over so they took me they did as I asked they threw me overboard and then they made a sacrifice to the one true God Jehovah and the wind stopped and the rain stopped and the boat the men on the boat were safe and into the water I went and down I went and I thought my life was over and out of the depths comes this giant fish or whale swallows me up brings me down to the bottom and I thought I was running away from God I had left the presence of God and if you leave the presence of God you never know what calamity is going to come across you never know what's going to happen to you but I had left the presence of God and here I am in this in this whale stomach it was dark and terrifying there was seaweed around my neck neck and here I am and I cried out to God and he heard me and when I knew that God had heard me I said Lord one day I don't know how it's going to happen but one day I will again look towards your Holy Temple and I will again pray to that Holy Temple I had faith in God that he could deliver me down there for three days and three nights I was in the belly of the whale and my oxygen was running out and and my my death was upon me I was in the very belly of hell and yet God heard me fish swims up and spits me out on dry land came out smelling like whale vomit brother L brother Lionel you ever get whale vomit in your beard you can never get it out it just stays there forever it just it's smells bad it's gross you can't you can't get it out you never have don't it's terrible it is smelling and bad and and and then the Lord tells me again tells me the same thing that he told me at the beginning he said go to Nineveh and cry out to these people I I wish I would have done it the first time but now I go and I go to this place and I cry out to these people of neveh and I tell them that within 40 days God will overthrow this city and it felt good I was out there and I was I was prophesying against it and I figured here it comes brother Joe they're coming down and there these going to be these invading armies and they are going to overthrow this city but many times a prophet he will prophesy and he won't know the meaning of his prophecy he is just speaking in the name of the Lord he speaks it out Isaiah was a little bit before my time not much but he was a little bit before my time and do you remember when he prophesied a virgin sh conceive and bear a son you remember that that when Isaiah the prophet prophesied I can't speak for Isaiah because Isaiah didn't know him he was a little bit before me but I don't think he knew what he was saying I think it was the Holy Spirit speaking through his Prophet God's prophet and prophesying that this was going to happen so here I am and I was prophesying in the name of the Lord that 40 days and this city would be overturned overthrown and then the word gets to this filthy evil Governor or king of this city of Nineveh yeah it's going to happen to you man and you know what he did he repented and he said maybe maybe he didn't even know for sure he said maybe if we repent and we turn back from our evil ways maybe God will have mercy on us so he should a decree he said everyone fasts he said even the animals fast he said no one eats and everyone repents of their evil ways and everyone go back and I'm sitting there I'm like these people are sinners they're evil they're trash let them die but no they repented and they they changed their ways which is very odd to me think about Los Angeles think about the filth San Francisco or Las Vegas think about the filth that's there this Nineveh was like that I wanted it destroyed but God sent me there for a reason and now I'm there I go up on the hill and I sit down and it's hot sun's coming down the sun's beating down and if you're challenged on the top like I am you really know when the sun's coming down it's miserable built a little booth tried to get some shade and you know what God cared for me God loved me and there grew up this plant in the tender loving care of Jehovah it grew over my head to shade brother Manny bald head and it felt so good man I just love this plant that had grown and then night time came and a worm somehow got into this plant and by morning the plant was dead was dead [Laughter] sister Martha made that very well it was dead the Sun starts beating down on me and I was like Lord let me just die this is terrible I got the sun beating down and my my plant died I loved that plant it was it it grew up and it shaded my my head and Lord you gave me this plant and it was so nice and now the plant dead and I'm burning up in the sun Lord let me just die and sometimes brothers and sisters sometimes when that anointing will come upon you as It Came Upon me when the anointing leaves there's a depression that follows in a suffering and after I had prophesied in the name of the Lord to these people of Nineveh I came back and I just got down and I got sad and I got upset and then the Lord gives me this shade and then the worm takes it away and I love this PL I say Lord I this this is the best plant and now it's dead I just want to die just take me just kill me I don't want to be here anymore and then the Lord spoke to me Rabbi can you open your Bible up yes sir then the Lord spoke to me and he said you are more worried about this plant than you are about those 120,000 Souls that are in Nineveh he said is that right Rabbi can you read those last few few verses yes Jonah then said the Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou Hast not labored sorry which thou Hast not labored neither mest It Grow which came up in a night and perished in her night and should not I spare Nineveh that great City where in are more than six score, 120,000 persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle and us we have the end of my book and it ends with a question why are you thinking more about this gourd plant why is it more important to you than 120 Souls 120,000 Souls out there in Los Angeles I mean in Nineveh or Las Vegas or San Francisco and we think that and tucon we think that there are prophecies that are going to come there are prophecies from real prophets my prophecy that I prophesied said that 40 days in this this city would be overrun the Hebrew word Rabbi what is the Hebrew word oh give me a moment to look that up in my scroll son you appreciate our Rabbi amen this Hebrew word that I can't pronounce I'm sure I learned English and now I forgot my Hebrew oh we're wanting the over the overturned right overturned yes overturned okay I'm in I'm in the wrong place on this scroll it's these Scrolls I tell you I believe it's like uh maybe 3 seven yeah up up up up and it's I'm in the wrong it's it's three yes I'm in the I'm I I got the wrong scroll here over yes here we go when us rabbis get old we get slow the uh the the word is neet and it means to turn overthrow overturn to turn about to turn over to turn around to change to transform and here I am I am a prophet of God anointed by the Holy Spirit and I say 40 days and this city will be overthrown over what is the word again yes it will be kaak overthrown turned over I thought differently but it doesn't change the fact that I'm a prophet and I did prophesy and that city was overturned yes it turned from sin turned over to righteousness and then God had mercy upon that City and how many times just us brothers and sisters how many times have we thought of prophecies that were going to happen how many times have we thought that this world's going to burn according to Malachi how many times have we thought the prophet William brandom tells us that Los Angeles is going to sink how many times have we seen these things and do we want them to happen are we being a Jonah they're going to happen because they're prophets of God speaking these things but we should be crying out to the people that are there yes and asking for mercy and asking them to turn their ways as Jonah did and then maybe we can turn Souls maybe we can turn someone that is the worst of the worst and turn them into the best of the best as Jonah did Jonah's out there prophesying Nineveh didn't think anything was going to happen he thought they were going to be destroyed he leaves and God has Mercy because they repented and he goes down and he sits under the tree loved the plant more than he loved the people and that's the story of Jonah and that's the lesson behind this wonderful book this wonderful short four chapter lesson on Jonah we wonder why it's in there it's a wonderful story but it's not just to tell a story it's a powerful story a Supernatural story he was in the belly of the whale then Jesus's brother Lyall Rabbi Lyall Rabbi Johnson here as he said Jesus himself said as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so must the son of man be in the grave for that long Jonah is a very important prophetic book but it's also a good lesson judge not that you be not judged cry out to the sins of the world and then maybe they will repent I love what that King said what that King said was so beautiful he said you know maybe we don't know but possibly God would have

good it's good to see you and your family I um there's really nothing sweeter than a mother I asked sister Jessica to sing that song um because El Shai has a very special meaning it means it means the the breasted God the god that can nurse life into an infant into a helpless a helpless person and it's such a loving spirit that this El Shai has and as I said it's it's so applicable to Motherhood before we get started brothers and sisters I want to say that just over the past couple days that I've been contacted by a few people and and I'm just so proud I'm so proud of our congregation I'm so proud of the individuals that are going through all of us are going through something but to see character rise up above a trial is just it's such a blessing it's so encouraging to me and we should never ever say a a bad or a critical word about anyone either if it's if it's to their face or behind their back or even to your husband and wife if if you even a husband and a wife talking in private we should never even say a word about someone else even in our private Chambers it brothers and sisters it can do such harm point out when someone is speaking negative don't necessarily try to correct them but point out that Christ was Perfection and Christ is the one that we look to Jesus is the one that taught us not to say a a critical or a negative word ever he and he set the example he was spit upon they spread rumors about his mother that she had an affair with a heathen Roman soldier those rumors followed him for his whole life they accused him as he started in the ministry they accused Jesus of betraying the very Jehovah who was his father and yet he cried out to God for for to forgive those who spoke against him if we are not Christians if someone does us wrong and we are not a Christian then we have every right to fight back we have every right to speak evil of them if they speak evil of us we have every right to apply an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth if you do me wrong I can do you wrong if you are not a Christian but if you are a Christian if you truly believe in Jesus then you have no you forfeit those rights no matter what someone says about you you have no right to respond none that's what a Christian says twice yesterday brothers and sisters experience this one once someone who was hurt by someone by someone else that was offended by someone else and that someone else ended up coming to his rescue saving him from from a very difficult situation someone who was he was they were offended at and then yet this person later on comes and goes out of his way to take care of the person that was offended and then another time a brother felt condemned he he let his temper get to him and and he texted me and he asked me to pray for him and because he he he had said something wrong last week and he couldn't wait to get back to work to make it right on Monday and he said brother what do I do and he confessed these to me and I said brother said that just proves I said you're awesome I said what you just told me just proves that you are a Christian that there is that spirit that holy spirit inside of you that is is causes repentance and you're sorry and you want to make it right shows me there's something very special about that brother shows me that he has that Spirit of Christ we make mistakes and other people make mistakes in dealing with us us also but remember as a Christian we forfeit our rights no matter how bad someone treats us no matter what they do we are not permitted to do them evil harm speak against them in any way because we're a Christian Jesus said in Matthew chap 5:38 has been on my heart the past few weeks as you know you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile goeth him Twain give him that asketh thee give to him that ask asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it have been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy if you're for remember as I said if you're a Christian you forfeit that but I say Jesus speaking but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you persecute you that was Jesus Christ's first sermon we're talking about the Rapture and we're talking about the son of man Ministry and the resurrection of the Saints and the Heavenly City and the bride of Christ brothers and sisters none of us are going to see that unless we have that Foundation none of us will see those things unless we have the foundation which is of Christ and what Christ taught we can't expect that we're that we're entitled to something if someone says something behind our behind our backs or whatever it is if you are despitefully you used love that person if you're cursed behind your back if you're cursed to your face pray for that person Jesus commanded that it may s it may see seem simple but how many people really do it Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it do you think he was just talking to himself it wasn't he was talking to us I'm thankful for that one text I got yesterday I can see that it's doing something a church the ministering and and and and what we're doing here as a as a the Tucson Tabernacle it's having an effect at least on a few people bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans do so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that word perfect in Modern English means blameless brothers and sisters if we can't get the very basics of Christianity the very first sermon that Jesus preached how can we expect to see him when he returns let that sink in these things are basic Christian principles and he said so that you might be the children of your father if you do these things when God came to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 he changed Abram's name to Abraham he changed Sarah Sarah's name sarai's name to Sarah he gave Abra abam a covenant of circumcision and he promised Abraham that although he was 99 years old and his wife was 90 that they were going to have a child and Not only would they have a child Sarah and Abraham both would have this child but God would make nations from them nations from Abraham and Sarah it was a promise and when he came to Abraham to give him these promises when God came to Abraham to give him all of those promises that I said and even the Covenant of circumcision that was told that you were one of God's people when he gave that commandment he came in a certain name he announced himself as El Shai the god that can nurse love life into a child as a mother can nurse life into an infant Genesis chapter 17 verse1 says this and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God the original Hebrew word for that this particular scripture is El Shi walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations so this Same Spirit the same elai this loving spirit that came to Abraham Was the Same Spirit and when Jesus said come unto me all ye labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest there it is manifested itself later on and then you will be able to overcome if you really truly understand this El Shai then you'll be able to overcome when someone speaks evil of you when someone hates you when someone lies about you you'll speak positive things about that person and you'll get down on your knees and you'll cry out for Mercy for that person that's what else should I will will produce and the closest thing that I have ever seen to Eli This Love that Jesus had and this love that when God came to Abraham is the love of a mo mother to a child it's the closest thing to perfect love that I have ever seen when my daughter was born meline we took her home and Stephanie laid her on the bed and and Stephanie just started weeping she said she's so helpless she says I am completely responsible for this precious little baby I don't believe Brothers I don't believe that the love of a man even for our own child can compare to that love that a woman has when God separated man and a woman a woman had strength certain strengths and the man had certain strengths and he gave that love that El should die he gave that love to the woman it's something that she just has and me as a father I remember when when meline was born I mean I was just in love with her when Daniel was born the same thing the kid I was just like oh you know this this is he came out and and Stephanie was just so happy and here's the difference between a dad and a mom I picked him up and I turned him to the doctor and I said is he supposed to look that way he looks like Yoda except he's red I said are feet supposed to look like that Stephanie thought he was perfect my wife looked at that little boy and he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen when I was born my dad looked at me picked me up saying thing and he says is this chin supposed to be like that made my mom cry there's this there's a difference and that love of a mother is just so beautiful Susanna Wesley she was the youngest of 25 children how is that even possible my my sister she went to she had she was on her fifth child for for the sisters that have some children she was she was on her fifth child and and she thought she knew what was going on and and she went to the doctor and and the doctor said uh yes she said uh you're you're pregnant you're going to have a child and this will be your your fifth child um she saides and she said said well how many children are you planning on having she said three her husband Susanna Wesley's husband was Samuel Wesley and Susan Susanne Wesley's life was filled with hardships she and her husband had 19 children but nine of them died as infants two there was two sets of twins that died and then one of the babies died when the maid acally smothered it she was tasked so she was tasked with raising the remaining 10 children and it was under very very difficult circumstances when the children were young her husband who was a minister her husband left her after they had an argument and he was gone for over a year and she was left trying to provide for these children they were in a in a place that they and moved later on they moved and they started a church that he was he was placed in a church that hated their doctrines very a very liberal area and they were a conservative group and they they were under a very hostile environment so she didn't have the community she didn't have a husband that would take care of her and there she was watching over these kids when he was gone when her husband was gone she wrote him this letter she said a woman she said but I'm also the Mistress of a large family and though the superior charge of the souls contained it lies upon you yet your long absence I cannot but think but look upon every soul that you leave under my charge as a talent committed to me under a trust I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother and as a mistress wife I felt I ought to do more than I had yet done I resolved to begin with my own children in which I observed the following method I take such a proportion of time as I can spare every night to discourse with each Child Apart on Monday I talk with Molly on Tuesday with Hattie Wednesday with Nancy Thursday with Jackie Friday with Patty Saturday with Charles she took time with every child and even though Suzanne was doing everything that she could to feed the children she made this statement she said I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother I feel I ought to do more than I have yet done I resolved to begin with my own children and she felt that she wasn't doing enough as a Christian and look she was working her fingers to the bone no husband there no Community to help her and here she is with these 10 children doing everything that she can and you know what she says I haven't done enough she saysi can do more and instead as many people do they want to reach out to someone to outside maybe for their own benefit they want to start a Ministry over here or over there and they neglect the greatest need that's right under their nose and that's what Suzanne Wesley had she said that I'm going to start with my children and it changed the world her saying that in my opinion that was the greatest decision that she ever made was focusing right there on her family and she ended up it affected millions of people she took the time with every child to read them the Bible to pray with them she loved her children and she built that respect from the children for her and her husband finally returned to his family but he never provided he was never good husband he was a minister but he went to prison twice because of his financial issues all that time he was away from his family and when he was with his family he really wasn't a good dad to him 1 Corinthians 113 113 says this but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so in the order of the household it puts the man as the head of the woman and suanna Wesley honored this she gave her husband the preeminence in the family it didn't matter to her that her husband wasn't living up to his responsibilities she had a responsibility and the word said this it doesn't it is not a qualifier if someone else is living up to their responsibilities as a Christian as if you have to live up to yours you have to live up to your responsibility no matter how someone else treats you she lived up to that and in in that it says that Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman so Brothers as we are husbands to our wives loving our wives we should act like we would want Christ to act to us he wants to hear us we want to we want him to hear us we want to be able to speak to him we want him to answer we want to have that loving relationship with our lord and there we are say okay I want this but I'm not going to give it to my wife we should be that loving caring husband as Christ is to the Man 1 Peter chapter 3 says this likewise ye wives be in subjection verse one likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives amen while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear so a wife can win her husband to the Lord just by her behavior who's adoring let it not be outward adoring of plated hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of the meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this man in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned thems being Sub in subjection to their own husbands even as Sarah we just talked about Sarah and Abraham even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement Peter here is saying you're a daughter of this this woman that lived over a thousand years ago and you should you are her daughter so you can have that same faith if you follow these even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well you are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel that word weaker vessel is physical the man's bigger and stronger and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so if you're not treating your wife correctly if you're you're bickering and you're arguing then your prayers Brothers we're talking about husbands then your prayers won't even be heard by God we like to say the women we can we can say a lot of things that a a woman is disqualified as far as her prayers being heard but if the man's not treating his wife like he should brothers our prayers aren't hurt either family starts see how important a family Unity is that love one another it's not just it's not just not doing things it's not just giving up drinking or smoking or whatever it is we also have to work together as a family unit as parents so our very prayers will be heard and we understand we're too different people men and women Brothers you know when our wives say you don't understand me they're right we don't understand them they're hard to understand and it's we are hard for them to understand but we love each other and we work together for these things Susanna Wesley was a good mother and even though her husband had problems she didn't waver she didn't complain she didn't divorce him their house was burned down twice young boy John Wesley almost died in one of those fires she had to separate her family because they didn't have a house to live in she had to put the kids in different homes and to make things worth they were as I said they were hated in that area because they because of their political and their religious views Samuel was was like a trump supporter preaching in like Seattle wasn't popular it wouldn't be well received but with her husband not being a good provider the people around her hating her and their doctrines and whatever they they were doing she still she kept her testimony and even with all of his Seminary education John Wesley Charles they they went to these highlevel seminaries and even with their great education that they have John Wesley said I learned more about Christianity from my mother than from all the theologians in England she raed she raised two of the greatest men that have ever walked the Earth in Charles and John Wesley and it started a Revival that swept the whole world John Wesley rode a horse all over Europe preaching the gospel sometimes four times a day preaching sermons and the spirit that was on Wesley to teach the people then spread from John Wesley and went around the world an exposition of the seven Church ages says this since the fifth age had brought a great dissemination of the word through printing the sixth age was quick to take advantage of it the age was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of intellectual Men Who Loved God and served him missionaries abounded around the world and spread all over the world abounded and the word spread all over the world it was an age of Brotherly Love it was an age of the open door and this was the age that John and Charles Wesley started they spearheaded it and it started from a mother teaching them at home Suzanne Wesley changed the world and it was hard biographer for Suzanne Wesley wrote this although she never preached a sermon or published a book or founded a church she is known as as the mother of methodism why because two of her sons John Wesley and Charles Wesley as children consciously or unconsciously will applied the example and teachings and circumstances of their home life what they learned at home they applied in their life and millions came to Christ through the meth Methodist Church it was the age of the open door and how much did those individual prayers and bible studies how much did they have to do with that when our children brother and sisters when our children hear our words when they see how we handle situations when they see us lose our temper it makes them lose their temper when they see us complaining about around the supper table it makes them complain when they see us wanting to get our way it makes them want to get their way it create our weaknesses create weaknesses in our children or when they hear us praying in private or when they see us studying our Bibles or when they when we're talking around the Lord about the Lord around the supper table that creates strength in our children when they see us handle a situation that in a way that may be the harder way but it was the right way that builds a character in our children my mom I never heard my mom complain about anything in my life and I never heard her she say she was tired she died brothers and sisters she died a terrible suffering death I've never seen seen anybody suffer like my mother suffered for days and weeks and months but she always kept her testimony from the time I was born until the time she passed away that woman had a testimony and it never wavered and it had an effect on us her four children every morning I was always the first one up Mom would squeeze me fresh grapefruit juice and and she she always make me a bowl of oatmeal and she'd she'd take the oatmeal and she'd put the brown sugar and then a thing of butter on the top and she wouldn't mix it in but she just put it right there and then she'd give it to me and I just loved it I would eat around all the way and then I'd get to the Sweet buttery stuff in the middle right and that was the last couple bites I just loved the way that she did that and it was early morning it was like 5:00 Rock would' be up and we'd be talking about the Lord and and just she would ask me little questions what what do you think about this and and it was just it was a precious time and it built a character in me from my mom my brother Jeremy is serving the lord and voice of God Recordings he's a man of integrity and he's honest he's doing everything that he can everything knows how to to get the message out to this Dying World my brother Adam he's preaching every Wednesday he is preaching to Inner City young people he's winning Souls these kids most of them almost none of them have dads or none of them have even met their dad some of them are 25 30 years old and Adam is teaching the Bible that they've never heard before and he's making a difference started with just a few people now there's like 70 of these boxers these Fighters coming on Wednesday night and he's winning these Souls my sister I mentioned her she's she's got five kids at least the last time we counted and she's one of the best Mothers I've ever seen she's stays home to raise the kids they made Financial sacrifices so she could be a mom to them and those kids are absolutely precious you talk about sweet kids and it's because they they got a mom that loves them I think all of this is a testimony to my mom and how she taught us and she made time with each of us and each one of us had that personal relationship with our mother and it produces something in the future it's so important our time is with our children our time with each other and I'll get to this in a minute but sisters you do not have to have biological children to be a mother I really don't think that has anything to do with it it is a spirit that God gave you it is that El Shai that is manifested in a woman of God and it is just it is without equal the Apostle Timothy we've all read the letters to Timothy when Paul writes both of his letters to the Corinthians his letter to the phiman his letters to the Thessalonians to the Romans to the Philippians to the Colossians both the letters to the Thessalonians and even the letter to the Hebrews Timothy's mentioned he listed at the beginning that he seems to co-author Corinthians second Corinthians Philippians Colossians both the letters to Thessalonians and to philimon seems to be a co-author on those Timothy went before Paul to certain places probably to prepare for Paul's arrival and Paul took him with him when he went to Corinth and thessalonica and to Macedonia to preach the gospel of Christ and eventually Paul placed Timothy to be the pastor of the Ephesian church one of the most advanced churches in the New Testament you read the book of Ephesians and it is deep and it is powerful and Timothy was placed to be Pastor over that church this man Timothy was one of the greatest Servants of the Lord in the whole new testimony and he was unique because his mom was Jewish and his dad was Greek and Timothy was one of these new Believers one of these new converts and he may not have looked at looked or act like one of the traditional Jews but Timothy had a gift that Paul identifies and Paul identifies where this gift comes from 1 Timothy chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son he's calling him Timothy his son in the gospel to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I served from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy look at the relationship ship that Timothy and Paul had the greatest of all the apostles in Paul with this man Timothy Timothy must have been a man of impeccable character verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first brother Jeremy am I in the right spot okay glad I had your attention First Timothy that's second Timothy I'm sorry second Timothy verse one let's go to let's go down to verse five when I call to remembrance see that's why you gotta use the good old Bible you know and and not and not the electronics all the time they are a blessing verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in my grandmother in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice I am persuaded I am persuaded that is in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Paul is saying that the gift that's in Timothy was first in his grandmother Lois and then in his mother Eunice and that gift was passed down from eating oatmeal in the morning and talking about the Lord from studying the Bible down to Unice and then Unice had learned from her mother and she was serving oatmeal to her little boy Timothy and she was talking about the Lord and she was talking about the Messiah and she was she was teaching this young man about the word of God and she was instilling not only the word in him but this great character because she had a great character she had a gift as the Apostle said and here it is and it goes right into Timothy the boy and he changed the world he was one of those first ones pastoring one of the greatest churches that's ever been close with one of the greatest Apostles that ever been I wonder how it was growing up in Timothy's House El Shai must have been present in that home really to produce such a great man the um this word elai to me just hearing sister Jessica singing it and and being and listening to it over the past day how beautiful this these words are and what it represents that it's this God that comes to the helpless person and this God is able to pour out that spirit and that love and to take care of that person and to nurture nurture him up comes to Abraham and says you're Barren Sarah you're Barren I know that but look at the Spirit really that our mothers have come and give them a child give them covenants give them a promise encourage our hearts encourage us to do great things but today we don't see that elai anymore now we see that it's it's a it's a shame many times for a woman to have a child to kill it before it's born it's a shame for a woman to have like my sister to have five of these beautiful little babies little little kids running around but she's proud of them I'm proud of them amen and there's not time that's spent we all we all want to blame the world brothers and sisters if you send we want to blame the school system if you send a bad kid to school at 8:00 in the morning you're going to get a bad kid when he gets off the bus at 3:30 but if you send a good kid to school one that has come up in the gospel one that understands the word one that has good parents if you send that kid to school not only is is the kid going to come back a good kid but that kid's going to make other good kids and he's going to have or she's going to have an influence on the others that Spirit of the family and of the parents is going to continue on and as I said in closing we can have the musicians come a woman brothers and sisters doesn't a mother doesn't doesn't mean that she has to have biological children you can still have that Spirit of a mother as a nurturing that elai Spirit where you're taking care of of of a child or or of someone else that nurturing way my aunt Jacqueline she never she was never married she never had children but she's quick to tell you that she has 10 children because that's how many grandmothers she had or how many Grand child children she has and she loves every one of us like a mother loves their children and we're thankful all of us are for the love that we have and it's that Spirit of el Shai coming out in a woman and she's always the Lord's always willing to bring that precious little baby which is you and me into his bosom to take care of us there's one last mother that I'll mention and that's Mary the greatest mother that has ever lived in my opinion she was she had this child brothers and sisters it wasn't even hers it wasn't Joseph's child this was God took a fertilized seed and placed it into this woman and she had that child she loved that child like her own she cared for him Joseph was a good dad he passed away at a at a um when when Jesus was young but it shows you that that love of a mother goes far beyond biology that love of a mother is it's it's a love of God is what it is and as I said it's not from the world this comes directly from the Lord Jesus I want to I want to have one I want to read one more scripture I think I have a few minutes Ephesians chapter 1 verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will we consider ourselves Sons and Daughters of Christ but it says here that we are adopted and yet he loves us just as much much as he does his own children shaat and and and um Hannah the Jewish people are the rightful Sons and Daughters of God they have a claim to that but us through adoption we are now his sons and his daughters and we see that that El Shai Spirit come unto me all ye that labor in our heav lad and I will give you rest everyone come to me yes he is Mother amen he has that wonderful spirit that brother Joe you and I could never understand but God has it amen and he wants us all to come in he wants us all to be part of him and I want all of us to benefit from the mothers that we have and not just the mothers but but the sisters that they have some age on them and they and they understand things and the brothers that's why next weekend next Sunday night I want the young people I want you to be here but next Sunday night I want to have the elders in the church I want them to give us some words of wisdom I want you to tell us if I could do it all over again here's what I would do here's some of the mistakes that I've made now you don't make them here's some of the successes I've had and I want you all to benefit from them and we can just sit down and and take in some of the wisdom of the elders would you be part of that would you come to

his his wife I lost her where'd she go oh there you are God bless you sis welcome thank you for coming down and visiting us we appreciate it and then um brother Gabriel Murray bless you my friend it's nice to meet you yesterday brother Gabriel and I were fellowshipping and um just talking about how life sometimes times is hard and uh brother Gabriel was sell was sharing some of his testimony with me and it was just a real blessing and then our brother martin Warner came and and he started fellowshipping with us and then I got up and I left and I I went around and I came back and brother Gabriel had big tears in his eyes and and I heard the last part of brother Martin's testimony and it just blessed me so much I asked him I said brother why don't you just share it you're about to leave and go back home why don't you just share it with the people and I really believe it would be a blessing to them and and of course Brother Martin agreed you know I've met quite a few people over the past couple days that haven't known God that don't know him and I want to encourage I know brother martin that this is this is his life and it's my life but I want to encourage us all that if we meet meet someone to introduce them that gives you the joy in your life and let me tell you if with brother Ed here I can't introduce you to Ed dugall if I don't know Ed dugall myself so same thing with the Lord Jesus I can't int introduce you to Jesus Christ if I don't know Jesus Christ myself so we need to get to know the Lord we need to spend time with him we need to understand his ways we need to get before him and pray so that he knows us and that we know him and then we'll be able to introduce them to Jesus we'll be able to tell people more about the Lord Jesus the better we know so the more time we spend in his presence the more time we spend in his word the more we will be able to introduce someone else to this living Jesus Christ that means so much to all of us that's all Stan I wanted to also mention that sister Amelia called me today our dear little sister that sits here in the front she was very very upset she went to visit her um her mother who um or no it's her sister her older sister that's 90 years old I believe and she's not in good health and um so that's that's been a heavy burden for sister sister Amelia but today um she just found out that her oldest daughter died sister Amilia sister Mia's oldest oldest daughter so friends we're in this together we're a family in the Lord so remember when you get down and pray remember Sister Amelia sister's had a hard life and she's been really blessed by the church especially how the church has has grown over the past year and much of the growth from the church have been relatives to Sister Amilia so she's done a lot for all of us so let's do our part when we get quiet before the Lord and pray for sister milia milia I truly love her she's a she's a precious precious sister as I said sister Margie you're leaving us we um we love Brother Martin Warner he's he's not only he's he's a servant of the Lord he's he's a missionary he's a minister of the Gospel he's also a dear friend so I'm looking forward to

sister or brother son or daughter it is it is so close I just thank you for uh your fellowship in these last five weeks I I think or so that we've been here and uh I just wanted to say a few things to you maybe just be seated for a second we'll take this take we're going to read in Revelations tonight but uh I just wanted to thank brother Dan sister um I forget her name Stephanie sister Stephanie I I just my wife keeps reminding me I I want to call you something else and my apologies I I just appreciate you and brother Dan and the the load you're carrying here and we pray for you we do and uh we're holding you up in prayer um I wanted to thank uh them just for the fellowship we've had and just the support they gave us while we were here and just having a little place to stay and we just appreciate that and you know being a missionary uh you know we stay in a a lot of places and uh but my wife she she likes her own bed and she's she's on her way home already I'm sure in her mind so uh I just want to thank my wife also Having the courage to to come and just support me and uh also want to thank the the Peterson family again I I I don't know if uh sister Rachel is here is she here sister Rachel theur oh okay that that sounds right she's always doing something for someone else but but uh I want to appreciate them I I I was just dropped in on the the little lunch after the funeral yesterday and I just thought my just all the work that goes into that you know I'm sure you appreciate uh her and all those of you that helped I know many of you helped and you know if you if you appreciate someone then you ask them how can I help you know you could ask them how how can I what can I do amen and I just wanted to give her a round of applause for all she done am man I I have a little uh place in my heart connection with the Peterson Family through brother Al Peterson and I was up there yesterday to to the grave site and I just laid some flowers there it was kind of a appropriate time and then I came back for another funeral but uh I just uh got close with him even though he was 30 years my senior we just seemed to to to click and uh you know I could tell him anything I could tell them anything I I could just share share my heart with them and it was just like we were just on the same page and saw things the same way and I just want to Lord thank the Lord for that that time we had together while while he was here and and I know he's enjoying himself now with sister Minnie and in young bodies and my you know why would we want to stay here amen Saints and you know we're just they're just we sang that song we feel the pull amen I I'm feeling the pull now maybe it's my age too but I just feel that Dimension is so much closer now and uh and I don't know how much time we got I know it's really close amen but I wanted to greet you and express our love for the fellowship and thank brother Daniel sister Stephanie and you know I wanted to say it's you know it's it's a burden pray for your pastor um you know I've been around a little while so uh as you hear in my testimony uh it's easy to tear things down you know it's easy to tear building down but it's hard to build it it takes a lot of love and and dedication and all those things you know and we we need to support one another and we need to have and I appreciate brother Dan for the vision he has amen without a vision the people perish and and you you need to and we need to fall in line like uh brother hillbrand was my pastor for 38 years and you know he had a vision for Missions he had a vision for for Souls overseas and that's the way God L him and printing books and getting the message out and and we just fell in line with that sister Angela we just fell in line with that as young people we just fell in line we packed books we did this we did that you know we just fell in line with that vision and then God blessed it and you know we had our ups and downs we had our troubles and the prophet said any church that's not having trouble is not making it with God every church has troubles every church has problems amen and and that's how you know you know you're in the will of God sometimes because Satan's fighting you amen so I encourage you tonight to do that get behind the vision of your pastor and uh you know he asked me to take the service tonight and just give my testimony and and I just thought yeah well that's that's the Holy Spirit anything I can do anything I can do to help you know we just want to be a help and and uh I'd encourage you older ones too you know you have a you have a testimony and uh I was quite surprised in Edmonton when I heard some of the older brothers and their testimony it just really encouraged me because they were young people too they came to the Lord and it was miraculous and you know it was it was special and you know it just encouraged me to hear th to hear their testimony so I encourage you older ones too your older Saints you're appreciated and you're loved amen and and you know it's sometimes you don't think you're you're doing much but when you're here amen people are leaning on you they're they're looking at you and leaning on you amen you don't realize it and I remember the ones in in our church and how many years you know and there a lot of them are gone now and I remember just seeing them there just say a few words here hear some wisdom you know it's we've all got something to give amen so I encourage you to do that and uh you know uh do that and pray for one another uh you know the widows that are widows indeed I remember being uh staying at a a Widow's house for three years when I got saved and I learned the importance of prayer and and being a prayer Warrior so there's prayer warriors here you get you get on your knees and pray for the service pray for your pastor amen pray for one another and that's the strength of the church that's how we're strong Saints we can't do it by ourselves brother said we're in this together think if it was your daughter now that passed or my daughter how our hearts would break amen God help us Saints to to feel that love for one another and and put our shoulders to the wheel amen and just just press this battle we're we're on the last stage now Saints we're we're so close now so I wanted to ask you just keep us in prayer for the upcoming travel to Europe and then on to Africa for Easter and a lot of people be coming for those meetings from from many villages and small areas and you know we just just keep that in prayer I'll I'll send D brother Dan a text to remember us uh before the services amen so uh I just wanted to share those little Thoughts with you and thank you again for your your fellowship and I I we leave here richer people I leave here with a renewed burden you're leaving us rich amen I I I hope so and I I you know the burden to for Souls amen I I leave here with a renewed burden for souls and and you know Saints when that last one comes in you know just like the songwriter said call me gone call me out of here we're we're gonna be gone and that is so close so Revelations if you want to stand in chapter 3 we'll just read us a scripture there familiar to all of us I'll try to summarize my my testimony it's it's been a a while since I give my complete testimony but I'll I'll try to give you important parts and uh Revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lat ofans write these things sayith the amen the faithful the true Witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot but I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth amen and we know the prophet talked about that is God would rather see us cold than in a lukewarm condition and he said if we fail to testify and give God glory we'll find ourselves cold old formal and backsliding testify testify to the to the store clerk testify to your schoolmates testify to you know when you get a chance when you get a chance when there's an opportunity take them aside the prophet said there's a better way or you know just as the Lord leads you but testify and and you know all we have to do is pray Lord just give me someone to testify I put some soul in my path amen and he'll do it it's just having the desire so he doesn't want us lukewarm because thou sayest I am rich increase with Goods have need of nothing knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness does not appear anoint thy eyes with is have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent that's the Zeal of this hour is to repent how many repented to today amen yeah I had to repent today amen that's the Zeal there's nothing you know there's no shame in that that's the Zeal of the Bride behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me and the prophet said see it's it's to the individual it's now an individual thing we're a body but it's individual to him that overcometh will I grant to sit in my throne even as I over overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the Lord bless his word you may be seated I'll just uh just uh go into uh my testimony um as I was was saying we were sharing a little bit yesterday uh at the reception here and uh you know I told the brother I was speaking to it it just always humbles me you know and the prophet preached a message humble yourself and it always humbles me because there's things I'm not not proud of there's things I'm ashamed of and uh there's mistakes I've made and we've all made mistakes but not that we want to give go uh the devil the glory but just you know David said Look Back to the pit where you come from and the hole in the rock where God brought you from and sometimes it's good to look back you know and as I thought about it today brother Dan I was just you know putting putting some of the highlights together here and you know this came to my mind and that came to my mind and God did that and God did that and and I thought wow God's done a lot for me you know we all got something God a testimony is is what is it you said you got to know the person to have a testimony there there has to be uh you know uh an experience there so we all have got that amen and we we need to share if you can't do anything else tell somebody your testimony tell them how the fire got lit am mean you don't need to explain the message or Malachi 4 or Revelations 10 you could just say you know God saved me I was a drunker I was a I was an adulterer I was this that and the other I was a thief the Bible said such were some of us amen we we're we're not Angels the prophet said he never made us Angels Angels don't know what it's like to be redeemed but we know Hallelujah I'm so glad I know that tonight I was I was born in 1960 so you know that makes me 64 amen and uh uh I don't feel 64 but my body tells me I'm 64 my dad was born in Hartford Connecticut and uh his dad my granddad moved up to uh Eastern Canada Nova Scotia he he met my dad met my mom uh Scottish descent immigrants from Scotland and they married and uh had a had our family there in Nova Scotia which was New Scotland it if you go if you travel to Nova Scotia you'll see it's a lot like Scotland on the ocean there and uh so uh I was uh raised there my parents were heavy Drinkers and uh that's a large part of my testimony they they drank heavily so we we as children were exposed from that to that from our youth and you know we saw you know we saw a lot of the uncertainties in the home financially and and emotionally we we weren't you know we were kind of twisted or or you know bent a little bit because of that when you grow up in a home like that and uh I'm a little bit of a nervous person brother Dan I know you know that I I'm I'm a little bit neurotic I think sometimes I I don't you know I heard the prophet say don't don't let me try to uh explain the type of person I'm in I I am because he said I can't even explain myself you know I don't I don't know why but and I don't know why sometimes we're allowed God allows things to happen uh for a certain reason and it it brings out something also that nothing else can bring out and uh you know I was uh I I was like I said Till I was probably 19 when I left home 1819 I was exposed to that and even though uh you know I hated that I want to say to you young people if you have parents that are believers you pre you should appreciate them you should honor them you should pray for them like the scripture said it'll will give you long days and and goodness of life and blessings even just the natural blessings that'll come on you for doing that amen I I you know I look back and I said wow what if my parents had have been messaged Believers you know and had had the Bible out and you know the only time we took the Bible was when we were lying then then Dad would say put your hand on that Bible and swear to me whoa you know and then we knew we were going to die that we're going to die if we we lie this time and you know that but that's the only thing the only thing we I remember looking at the pictures in the Bible but well this looks Holy Angels and all that but didn't know anything about it just went to church just went to mass did the Stations of the Cross but there was a thirst in my heart all the time there was a thirst there but I didn't know how to fill it I didn't know what it was so anyway we we we were raised in that and uh I hated it but I fell into the same cycle of coping you know that's what people do it for you know the prophet preached a message letting off the pressure and that's what my mom and dad would do they let off the pressure on the weekends and sometimes for a week and fights and everything else like just terrible terrible the things I've saw as a kid it just it just emotionally it it it scarred me emotionally and and and and you know I didn't know how to cope with it and I fell into the same thing because it's a spirit isn't it common yeah and I didn't know the psychology of it or anything I just knew I was UN I was bound by the same thing that I hated I remember I remember going to bed crying at night just you know see my my mom and dad fighting and physical abuse and all those things I just I just hated it you know and I I I would just cry myself to sleep sometimes and uh just and yet you know I fell under that same thing because that's all I knew that's how I knew but they were they were Catholics they went to church you know and they they thought salvation was coming in the church being part of the church is salvation it's not I know coming here is not amen it's not salvation it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you and me amen and meeting meeting that person like I told my sister I just got saved and I told her two weeks before she died I just told her I said Kathy I said I met Jesus Christ the man he's real it's you know all this Born Again stuff we heard about I said Kathy it's real she said Martin I'm so happy for you I think you found what you were looking for amen and and two weeks later she went off to scene and that's her testimony to me amen so I I believe I'll see her there brother Dan she'll be there amen so I started to get so depressed as a teenager in high school you know there was one time there was a man visiting my home and he was from the country and those old Scots you know they get together and and drink even uh moonshine and stuff like that you know it was uh and I just you know he'd been in he'd been in our house and and my mom was there my dad was away and I I just felt real bad you know that he was there and I out behind the house and I was just sawing some wood and all of a sudden I felt a presence and I can't I couldn't explain it to you if if I tried with a thousand words but it was like there was there was something here watching me someone here watching me a being and I couldn't I just kept looking around I thought someone was spying on me but I just felt this presence come down brother Dan all around me just like arms and I just felt oh my what is what is that and I so I then I quickly walked in the house and this man that was there he looked at me and he kind of like looked at me he said that boy will be a preacher someday a drunk he said that boy will be a a priest or a preacher someday and I didn't I didn't know what to do with that I just you know there's things in your life you remember and you think that was something I'd forgot and and and you think that was at the time that was very odd and so God has a plan that's all I want to say God has a plan and it might not be preaching it might might be this might be that you know but God has a plan to use you Amen to to to spread the the Gospel of Jesus Christ to win souls Amen to encourage the body to be a part of the body of Christ if we're just a fingernail or a toenail or whatever we are a prayer Warrior amen that's so important amen and so I I I just put that you know in the back of my mind but uh you know the drinking went on and I drank as a teenager at a high school but the scripture warns against it said W wine is a mocker Proverbs 20 strong drink is Raging and whoever who whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise it is it is not for Kings o limo it is not for Kings to drink wine nor princes to drink strong drink lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the Judgment give strong drink to them that are ready to perish and whine to those that are heavy hearts let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more you know so uh it can be a deceiver and and you know Satan with alcohol it's it's a counterfeit it's just a counterfeit for the stimulation of Revelation the wine of the word amen it's only a counterfeit and you know Satan makes you feel like oh you're with with the crowd you're in The In Crowd you're going to the same parties and and you know you you you got no worries no troubles and you forget all your problems and you forget all the dysfunction at home you know and that's that's the Trap that he sets and he's he's a master at it and young people today he's he's doing it maybe a different way he's doing on social media there's peer pressure there's all those kinds of things you know people get hooked on addicted to and I I I I just read recently a young man here in the states he uh he got on Facebook and posted some stuff about himself that he shouldn't have posted some pictures and then some some man from Nigeria blackmailed him and he ended up committing suicide you know Satan's got traps and if it's not one way it's another he wants to destroy young people in their youth and he's out to destroy you too young people I hope this helps you I hope you feel warned tonight that Satan has a trap but God has a plan amen Satan has a trap but God has a plan amen so I I just kept uh going on you know and uh after those experiences I you know I did get very dep depressed so depressed that I I felt like I wanted to die I wanted to get out of it and uh one night I I thought I decided to do that and and I was drinking and you know uh there's been several people in my community had died in in the straight of Cano which is a body of water that goes from the island to the mainland that people try to swim and they don't make it because of the currents and and I just decided to that I was going to try that and before I went though I thought I'm going to see my my best friend because I only had one friend that I really considered a friend and I wanted to see him for some reason I just wanted to see his face and I went to his house where his sister lived and she said no he's not here and uh I I'm here by myself but uh she said you look terrible what's what's the problem what's wrong with you I said nothing I was hiding it and uh she said come in come in come in for a minute so we sat down and she could see there was there was something definitely wrong wrong and uh I was determined what I was going to do and she said you know Martin she was a she was not a person that You' uh she didn't have a good reputation in town I'll put it that way and and she uh you know you'd maybe you'd call her a Rahab or something like that but you know here I am sitting with her and in in the house and she said you know Martin she said when I get I get feeling like you do said I I read this and she pulled out a little bible and she you know Catholics don't do that and she pulled out a little Bible and she read me something and I forget what it was but when she read that Bible that spirit of suicide just lifted right off of me it was gone and I thought that was stupid what would I do that for what would I end my life for and it was just it's it's like a cloud and and an oppression that comes and you know you just you can't you you have no way out there seems to be no way out so anyway God delivered me there after I got saved I went back to her brother Dan and I I bought her a Bible a real Bible and I put her name on it to Kathy McDougle my friend amen I thought you know God used her you know God puts people in your life and I I I I really believe that she'll have a reward on on the other side and and I I know she's been rewarded since then too but things like that would you know just I tried a few times but it failed and and just Satan is like a roaring lion seeking he whom he may devour and to take you out before God can use you so I ran away amen I I I finished trade school I uh got my trade in power engineering and uh got in trouble few times with the law and it was just my marks in school and and my parents that just I I didn't go to reform school or whatever because I hung with the wrong crowd and uh so you know like I said Saints there some of these things that humble me uh I'm not proud of them but you know we look back to where we come from and give God the glory amen and uh you know he he's used me around the world to give this same testimony and souls have gotten saved people have come to the Lord amen so I promise the Lord I would make it somehow and I've traveled too far to turn back now amen so God has a plan and you know we can never stop it I ran away from home 31 about 3,100 miles from Eastern Canada to western Canada and as I was driving into the city in western Canada on a bus I saw a sign on a green elevator that said what shall I profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul I'd never seen that before I'd never knew that scripture and here it is just staring at me when I'm going by and I'm looking at it thinking well that must mean something you know people are going to have to answer for those Witnesses those Billboards and those signs you see along the road they'll have to answer for those things amen they'll have to answer for seeing God in nature death burial and Resurrection everything preaches the gospel amen and you know it's hard to fight your way to hell it's hard it's A Hard Road and you have to fight your way to hell because heaven made a barricade amen and we have to climb over the cross trampled of blood you know and I I just thought boy all these things you know I ended up just working there in western Canada for a while and you know um my brother had a friend that asked me if if I if I could stay with him and I ended up working in the in the power plants of of Big Oil industrial companies and uh you know for power generation that was my trade and and but still I was thirsting see alcohol is a thirst and you feel it because your soul is thirsting and and we we didn't know that the prophet preached a message thirst a our brother Ed saying As the deer panth for the water so my soul panth after thee Oh God and I didn't realize that and I don't think people out there today realize that but uh the brother let me my brother's friend let me stay with him and I was working in a in the industry and uh I I I ended up at his place and I had a dream and my families are my family is is Dre I would say dreamers but they dream a lot and I had this dream and it was so vivid that I saw this great huge Beast like a dragon and he was on a sea of glass and he was and people were running for their lives and he was scooping them up and squashing them and killing them and uh you know it was just chaos and murder and and uh it was so visive that it just repeated and repeated and repeated all night I woke up the next day and I said said wow what a nightmare and all of a sudden I just felt that's something told me that's the end of the world that'll be what the end of the world would be like and I thought I wanted to I didn't want to tell my brother's friend because I thought well he'd think I was crazy you know I just I just thought that that was and I felt like that was going to happen in my lifetime and and what came to me was I need to be ready for that you know nothing knowing nothing about the scripture nothing about a prophet nothing about the end time you know I thought life was going to go on it was one big party but you know what when I when that happened that was I need to be ready and I just that thirst got how do I find that where do I go you know I didn't think I could find it in religion so I just I just left that job and and uh went running away again and you know but that did shake me and I met some people in Edmonton that were with Youth for Christ at the YMCA and they asked me about you know if I'd like to stay on a farm for young people I was about 20 years old and and that uh for Youth and they were Christians and they were good people and you know they they they did a lot for me and but it was a stepping stone for me but still that organized religion and that religion they they had and all the good works they did and I I thought you know that's not it that's not what I need that's not what I'm looking for you know you can't make it to heaven on good works and so I knew that and they had brought us to some different churches and I was exposed to maybe they go to a Baptist Church one week and and a Pentecostal in the next and and the Pentecostal one there was a preacher there and uh he was praying for people uh in the front at the altar and and uh he he he just came by me and he and he put his hand over me and he never touched me but he put his hand over me and it was like brother Dan the first time I experienced anything like that it was like a 10,000 volts just I just about went down you know I just it was it was a some kind of Supernatural anointing that was there and you know and and then what he was what they were wanting is that then speak in tongues and then you're filled with the Holy Ghost well it didn't come into me I didn't open myself up to to it but I knew there was a power there and so that that's another thing I put kind of in my pocket but I was still thirsting that didn't satisfy so you know I I continued my my drinking and uh the life of you know pleasure and sin for a season at 20 years old and uh I went I went into this weekend I went into a bar a club and the the the club's name was Lucifers Lucifers on a Friday night and the the devil was there they had the flashing light on the top the Devil with the Pitchfork you know and the big horns and you know Lucifers and it was all this music and and drinking and rry and you know and and that was on a Friday night and then uh I was so sick because I had I I had left that that farm or that ranch and I jumped on a train and I went to I was going to go back home and I was 3 days on the train made it to Ontario and then felt no I don't want to go home I want to go back you know it didn't know where where I was I didn't know what I wanted I didn't know what what I was trying to find so I got back on came back to western Canada drinking for three days no food Went to went to Lucifer's on Friday night and then Saturday I I was so you know that I guess it was that night yes it was that Friday night after after or Saturday that I was in Lucifer's that I was so sick I was laying on a bed in the YMCA and with had nothing to eat for three days and I I was I basically had alcohol poisoning and uh I fell into a trance what they call DTS but to me it was different than that I felt like I left my body and I went into this darkness and I knew I was going down down down sinking down and I and and I it just felt like the bottom was never there and finally I came to this place and there was a bright light and it was a fire a literal fire I can still see the flames in that fire and I was on and I was like on a on a on a rotisserie thing and I was going over that fire and the fire was just intense but you couldn't die you couldn't die die from it you just were tortured and that's what Satan is young people that's what he's got the the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life amen and I I I was going over and over in that thing and and then I saw women come to me they had no clothes on and they would just Decay when they come up to me they would decay in front of me and and it was like the smell of death all around me and and and and I couldn't communicate with no one and no one could communicate with me you know when you go to that place you're alone you can't communicate and and the worm doesn't die and the fire is never extinguished it's a real place people think you know nobody goes to hell these days everybody preaches everybody into heaven no there's a literal hell there's a literal burning fire there's a demension of the lost and we know that better than anyone else you know uh those women I remember seeing a woman out here on the street and the and the and the look of Terror and fear on their faces and I just saw a woman on the street there yesterday was just yesterday and I felt so bad for her she looked at me and she had this Terror on her face like a just like I saw just just before I give this testimony now just like I'd saw back there you know where we at Saints we are so close we are preaching to the souls that are in prison now amen and you know we we got to do if there's one Lord you know Abraham said if there's 10 but if there's one Lord Lord save that one send out a send someone to to get them amen and uh so I I was in that place and I I cried out for God and I think some of you know that part of my testimony I cried out for God no I didn't cry out for God excuse me I cried out for my parents see I cried out for my mom and my dad but they weren't there I cried out to my one of my best friends and he wasn't there you I was alone there was no one to cry out to and I I I you know it didn't it didn't even dawn on me in in that state to to ask God until I realized I'm not getting out of here and I I had an awareness Saints and God is my judge I had an awareness that my body was there but I couldn't get back What a Feeling what a terrible feeling and the prophet screamed out what a terrible thing to be lost heading for the Falls what a terrible place what a dreadful place to be in and you know and and so I cried out finally I said oh God oh God if you'll help me' I'll change tomorrow I promise you I vow I promise you I'll change tomorrow well I started to feel that I was coming back and I remember just waking up really like not even realizing like oh I I'm not in that place that was a nightmare that was that was something really different like that was so real so vivid and uh my bed was soaked with sweat like I had sweat so profusely from the alcohol was probably alcohol poisoning so I didn't realize that but my heart was there was such a pain in my heart a sharp pain that I thought I was going to take a heart attack and you know I I just I just said oh God thank God I'm alive I'm not in that place so I I I I quickly got up got dressed and no sooner I get dressed I heard to knock on the door and I always say Jesus knocked on my door A young man that was a backslid message believer running from the Lord knocked on my door and he said would would you help me and I looked at him he was clean cut you know I didn't I sized him up a bit he had had some stuff he said I need a place to store this stuff till I till I uh get my place and and I started a new job and he said would you help me and I thought there was a mill you know Pro probably a million people in that around that City well I thought I must be one in a million you are huh I must be one in a million so why did he knock on my door why did he ask me for help and I and I I just come from from Hell or the I just come from Lucifer's place and now this guy's asked me for help so I said uh yeah I guess so come on in so he put his stuff and he stay stored there for a few days he saw a little New Testament Bible the the use for Christ gave me and he said oh you you believe in god well I I I had an an you know I knew I had to say something I I knew I couldn't say no because I just asked God for help and I saidif you'll give me help I'll change tomorrow' so I said yeah yeah kind of well yeah I do and he saidwell would you like to come to church he was a backslid message believer and he was looking for a liquor store and he ran into a brother in the message that said no I can't tell you where liquor store is but I can tell you where you can find the Lord Jesus Christ that's all we need to do brother Dan is tell them come and see come to my church come come and hear the the word of God and so I I said yeah I guess you know yeah I better I better I promised so I thought it would be like maybe it would be maybe a Baptist or maybe it would be a Catholic but he didn't tell me anything he just said come so I went and there was brother Harold hilbrandt preaching the gospel and me with uh the yellow t-shirt Scotland long hair ratty jeans T you know ratty t-shirt put me on the front bench looking up at this preacher preaching the gospel I heard the gospel of my salvation and uh you know I went to dinner with some Believers that day that were uh in the church sister Angel you might know brother gun brother Gideon's father who uh witnessed to me a Chinese man with broken English eating Kentucky Fried Chicken can't never forget get it broken English and he said see the what the Bible says acts 238 repent and be baptized and as he was telling me the words were just jumping in my heart this is the truth this is what I need to do so I said yeah I said yeah I I'd like I'd like to get baptized he said okay I I tell I tell the preacher so they brother Harold was aware of it he was preaching that night and uh the whole time he was preaching he was preaching on The Crow and the dove the nature and and and I felt like I was the crow sitting in with all of the doves like these people are holy you know like they're they're good people like what am I doing here and and and this devil sat on one side and said you better get out of here you you don't belong here and and this the angel on this side said no stay there this is the truth and so it was yes no yes no I was numb after a while I was like what do I do and then all of a sudden the sermon ends and brother hillbrand I never forget it brother Dan uh he said does anyone have anything to say like he never ever opened it up for testimonies after the service never one time in 38 years do I ever see him do that again but he said does anyone have anything to say before I knew it I was on my feet I said listen I'm I'm the guy that was supposed to get baptized but said you know I can't I can't go through with this you know there's there's 100 200 people and I'm thinking why why am I standing up talking to all these people just this is you know I was numb and and he said well brother he said we don't force anyone to get baptized here we don't pressure anyone but he said you can go with the deacons and they can read the scripture to you if you decide you want to get baptized the tank is here so they they they brought me to uh Romans chapter 6 as we're buried with him in baptism as we are buried with Christ and baptism do you know that when you got baptized you were buried with Jesus Christ you know that's so profound and the prophet said because you were in him when he rose you Rose and the power of the Holy Ghost that's in you will raise yourself up he said in the resurrection if you go by the way of the Grave so when they said that that just put the nail in it you know I put the nail in Satan's coffin Hallelujah it put the nail in Satan's coffin because I knew two is a witness right so I knew so anyway I uh I I I was baptized that night in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh uh had a had a wonderful experience it took some time you know uh the prophet priest uh justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and uh I wasn't I wasn't quite clean yet that God had to do some some work on me and clean out some things and I might have sat in the church for maybe three four weeks and you know I I I I I just was faith comes by hearing hearing by the word and uh you know I I one day they were preaching on uh Holiness brother hillbrand and he was talking about 1 Corinthians 11 and he said if a man have short hair you know if a man have long hair it's a shame to him and I had sat there for a while with long hair and I never thought nothing of it I never thought the Bible said anything about it it wasn't like legalism I just thought and then I looked around oh yeah I'm kind of the only one around here like like I'm I'm kind of a standing out and then I had these corduroy pant pants on that were uh designer pants and they were real tight on the back with no pockets and and and when when the preacher was preaching he said and these these designers these homosexual designers he said they they make these pants with no pockets in the back I knew he couldn't see my pockets but I I just kind of felt back from my pocket no it's not there so I thought well I'm getting rid of these that's for sure and you know what next next week I'm going to get a I'm going to get a haircut and I said if I look like a monkey which I look like a monkey with the long hair but I said if I look like a monkey I'm G to get my if that's what the Bible says you see the message is not legalism Saints the message just is just obeying full obedience to every word of God entitles you to the Token so take those steps and as I took those steps God then came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was a process and uh I'd like to say you know I think it's 8:30 is it now we start at 7 8 I'd like to say my testimony ended there and but you know I open that door and you're the only one that can open that door my experience will be different from you but you remember when God knocks on your door sometimes he'll knock on your door you you don't have to be an alcoholic it might be it might be another pressure it might be another oppression or it might be something else that you need to answer that door and let Jesus Christ into your heart it's so simple isn't it salvation it's so simple you know I didn't knew nothing about a prophet nothing about Malachi 4 The Prophet's name was being mentioned but I never even heard it it was just like I walked into the Bible and these people had the holy ghost that's why I say you older ones you created an atmosphere for the younger ones amen I don't have to call your names you know who you are amen you create that you're that core you're that you're those pillars amen and and I I thank God for those old Saints amen that when I was at that altar you know crying out for the Holy Ghost they were praying with me they were praying for me they were praying me through that birth canal amen glory to God it's the same holy ghost that it was that night it's the same one now and I'm not let Satan take that away from me that seal that fire amen burn on Saints burn up burn on let the power of God fill our lives in every way we can and like I said we're not you might not be out on the street testifying praying for people casting out Devils but you got a testimony you got a testimony like brother C coffee there just a mistake a phone call amen it just yeah well maybe I should talk to him about the Lord amen so anyway I you know I listen to the message today doors in a door and the prophet uses Revelations chapter 3 and he talks about doors and the door you know I open that door for Christ to come in my heart and he did and he filled me with the Holy Ghost and he used me I started to Deacon in the church I was then preaching once in a while and then I'd go on the street and testifying ministering and started to travel up north and the among the Native Indians and then on to Alaska among the eskimos and you know saw many things and saw many Supernatural things and healings and different things and I God started to use me and I I I you know I thought wow this is not nothing like turned out that I was that I had planned I didn't plan on any of this I running running away from that and God had to really do something there to get me to to actually do that but uh I started to feel after a while I started to feel a little proud I started to feel a little proud a little pride came in I'm a little bit better you know I'm a little bit I'm a little bit more special uh you know I'm kind of I'm kind of a great guy you know you know the prophet said that about Joseph he said he he started to think he was a great guy because he had visions and dreams and he and he and he was lording it over his brothers anybody out there amen and I just started to feel a little proud and you know what the scripture said Pride cometh before a fall and you know the Lord let me fall flat on my face and you know I wanted I I walked away I wanted to get away from the ministry I thought I I don't I want you know it was just selfishness and I I told you this here before I went I had such a complex and I I just it was all about me you see it was all about me and I thought you know that that then God has to do something with you God has to do something with you and I you know I I just quit I quit the ministry I I got out of it I I got out of it for four years from 2000 to 2004 some of you don't know that but uh I was sharing that you know and and and I was backslid really if you're not where you were with God when when you were close to God and you're not there now you're backl in any form amen Saints the Zeal of the Bride is to repent Lord Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation take not thy Holy Spirit Spirit from me amen I went through a really hard time I and I I just give glory to God and the wife he gave me to stand by me brother Dan amen and uh you know she was there praying for me and you know and just being there and I and I read I was reading in the message perfect faith and the prophet was talking about a guy testifying to his his friends at in the boiler room he said about his wife because he was a new Christian his wife said honey it must be hard you you were in an alcoholic family you were drinking and all these things and you're going to have temptations you know but honey if you ever fall if you ever fail she said you come right back home praise God God bless you Sister margorie amen she's part of my Ministry amen and I and she was right there she could have left you know if I if I had continued in that you remember when brother brandom had that complex he said I'm just going up north and the Holy Spirit you'll become a bum you'll be a homeless person and you'll be among the homeless people and your wife will leave you you know when when that reality finally came through and all and all of the mixup you know I couldn't even see straight you know Satan he he won't stop Saints you know he's not going to stop because you you became born again you know and and let me tell you another thing there's other doors that once you let them in then then you got to make him feel at home so if he comes over to the door of Pride he said what's in here oh no don't go through that my private life don't go through that you know what I do in my home is is is what I do in my home but you know what you do in your home affects people here amen what we do in secret what we do in private affects people right here and it and it can and it can even give us a bad attitude or resentful spirit so anyway I would I I would say my testimony didn't stop there because God continued continues to open doors Amen in our hearts and we've got to let him let him go through the house amen this is your house this is your house maybe the musicians can come I want to just wind this down and uh there's probably more I could share but I I think I got the majority of it and you know I saw many supernal things and I I've saw since since God restored me you know I saw so many things in the ministry overseas and miracles and amen cripples and blind people and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he's still the same God still the same power he said you know cast out Devils he said raise the dead they're still being raised God still raises the dead amen praise God there's a witness amen so he still raised the dead he still heals the sick amen you just you just open every door Saints I don't know what I was referring to there that song I was referring to white as snow amen let's Stand Together amen you know if you might be here tonight and feel that like maybe I'm not where I should be and like the woman said you know I'm not I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I should be but I'm not what I used to be and you know you're not what you used to be but you're not

Jesus precious name amen brother Jordan if you could put up that picture that I gave you this morning yeah there we go now there's two wonderful things in this image the first of course is my sweetheart and the second you notice in the baptistry there's a painting in the background of these mountains and these are those mountains this is at the monida border we were going up to a family reunion in the very northern part of the panhandle of Idaho this last week and we'd driven past this place a couple of times since we've been married but it's always been either coming in the wrong direction bad weather you can't see it and this time it was visible and we could see it and we wanted to get get a picture of it and Heather was so happy to be able to to finally see this I was happy to I'd seen it back in 1970 with brother Francois when we were on a trip but uh anyway and and and I won't tell you about how he had to make a huge turn on the free where it says authorized Vehicles only but but I said Heather I'm authorizing this turn and we went ahead and and we made it so anyway that's on the moon either border if you're ever headed up Interstate 15 and just as you approach the Border Crossing into Montana you'll see a sign that says monida one mile uh don't go that far just before you get there there's a chain up area on the side of the road that's where you want to stop and that's where you can get that picture and the and the mountains are just perfectly framed there uh anyway that was just a real blessing but we had opportunity to be with family have their side of the family the wear side and a couple of cousins that uh they're not Christians uh I'm not certain that they're anti-christian but they certainly don't believe in uh in the Lord and their dad uh Heather's father's brother Heather's Uncle he was very adamant about not being a Christian but his wife Gwendolyn she became a Christian and I know that she was praying for her sons two boys Greg and Keith and and it turned out that in this property that we went to uh to have this family reunion that the cabin that Heather and I were in was the same cabin that these two brothers were in her cousins that she may be seen twice in her life and we were way off at one end of the property together so we were able to spend some time in Fellowship there and and we were able to answer some questions in a way that was not offensive to them that respected them but still brought in the Lord Jesus Christ and and and and and you know we were invited to stop by then see them and so forth so I I feel like there was progress made if you happen to think of of Keith and Greg Ware Greg is a retired University professor in Keith is is I'm not sure exactly what he is except he's basically retired as well I think but but these these men and their families need the Lord Jesus and and and I believe that that we won't be complete without them so we need to reach out and embrace him if you remember them in your prayers we'd really really appreciate that um and uh I don't know what else to say except that we had a good time a good time in the Lord a good time renewing connection with family and uh and and that in some way we were able to uh to to be a witness for Jesus Christ and and that is always always a privilege so God bless you thank you for humoring me with uh This Isn't She Lovely I don't know how I could be such a lucky guy to be married to Heather God bless you our wives love us when we get to stand behind it's amazing I remember seeing sister grain somewhere around what sister

that's what I was trying to get across this morning that don't put everything on God make sure that we are also doing our part to have that relationship with him I am I appreciated that for the Lyle sister Heather it's good to good to have you all back with us there you are God bless you Let's uh we've been going into the book of Acts and I've been getting some feedback from some different folks that have been blessed by our study on this book I've been hearing a lot of people say that you know I never I thought I've read the book of Acts I thought I understood it but I never really understood it I never understood that there was so much that this book was so rich and it is it's just it's so as uh the song goes so deep you can't get under it so high I forgot but you know the song I'm talking about it's a great song I just can't remember it Let's uh let's get started in this in this book of Acts chapter 18. So what had happened in chapter 17 is Paul had just been to this place of of Greek culture and Society with Greek gods everywhere lining the streets and the marketplaces it was this place called Athens so Paul Paul was there and and he was able to preach to these people and to bring it right down to the level that they understood as I said Athens was a hub of Greek culture and we see that Paul as he was walking down the marketplace he saw all the different idols and all the different temples and he went by this place called the Temple of the unknown God and he used that place as he went up on the mountain he used that place to preach a message to these gentile people and we know that we have seen now from our study in the book of Acts that that we see really three different kinds of people that Paul is preaching to he's preaching number one to the Jews in the synagogues these are the ones that have accepted the Lord Jesus and have a background that have been taught by probably the Pharisees but the Pharisees or the Sadducees and they have seen Paul has explained to them and showed them this Jesus Christ in the Old Testament in from from Genesis from Abraham all the way through Moses teaching and all the prophets Paul has been able to show them how Jesus fulfills all these prophecies so we have those Jews and then we have these other folks that the Bible says that they feared God so these are these Gentiles that have come in and accepted at least part of the Jewish Theology of the one God a monotheistic religion which is not normal for really anyone outside the Jewish people so they were able to come in and they had accepted this Jewish god but they had not yet accepted the Jewish way of living with all the rules and the regulations so we have that group and those two people those two types of people were in the synagogues and then we see in the Athenians we see in the the ones from Athens we see this other this whole new group of these people that knew absolutely nothing about God all they knew was idols and and and and idol worship and and all of these different Greek gods and Zeus and mercury and all all these different ones that there are thousands of them that they had worshiped so we see in Athens we see those people start to show an interest in this Christianity I appreciated what brother Lyle said when you came up here you said um that you asked for prayer are these were these family members I couldn't quite hear that their family members and I appreciated brother Lyle saying that he was able to answer some questions without being offensive very very wise and we see the Apostle Paul has he's the master of that wisdom to where he could bring it right down to where everyone he was talking to whether it's the Pharisee theologians or whether it's these Greek Jews or whether it's these converts or whether it's these completely heathen people he could speak to all of them so I see you brother Lyle maybe you were able to apply some of this book of Acts that maybe that we've been studying to to your wisdom and I did appreciate the way that you said that without being offensive we saw that Paul in Athens he quotes actually he's talking to these completely idolaters and he actually quotes a famous celebrity of the day and he says that that this celebrity says that we are all the offspring of God and that celebrity when he had taught that that celebrity was talking about that we are all offsprings of Zeus so Paul is able to take that and then he's able to get their attention and preach about the true God and how we are actually offsprings of this true God and then he was able to bring Christ into it and it really intrigued these people in Athens so now Paul goes from Athens which was like I said the Hub of the Greek religion he goes to one of the most awful places on Earth at that time and that is the city of Corinth verse number 18 says this and after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth now Paul and his team they go from Athens they take a ship and I found out today from Brother Lyle that they they sail along and then there's this little Peninsula or this little section of land that they have to they have to go through and they actually Portage the boat they take it and they put it on some sort of of rails or rollers and they drag it across this two is it two miles one or two miles come on brother Lyle we're not we don't live in England thank you about four miles that that they had to bring this boat across this piece of land and then they they get over to this place called Corinth now Corinth was an absolutely massive City we think about Athens and how famous that was but Corinth is somewhere around 15 to 20 side 20 times the size of Athens and it was absolutely evil it was a terrible City and it's neat because I as I was studying on on this this city of Corinth I said you know this looks like a modern day Las Vegas and uh because it was it was filled with prostitution filled with immorality filled with just every type of advice that you had in that day that City had it and it was an absolutely disgusting City I can't say I can't say enough bad about it so Paul he goes into this city like I said a modern day Las Vegas and it blessed me today because when I saw brother Lyle this morning before service brother says hey I'm really looking forward to Acts chapter 18 and he says you know that place was like Las Vegas I was like oh brother we're on the same page that's exactly what I thought so really gave me confirmation in talking about this so we see that Paul goes to this city and there's Believers there not yet but there will be so Paul goes there and he's going to build a church now this place Corinth there's a couple letters that we have in our book that are written to these Believers in Corinth it's called first and second Corinthians so now you see what a bad place this is and you see now Paul is going here and he's going to start this he's going to start this church and he starts up this church and he's preaching like I said he's preaching to the Jews and he's preaching to the Gentiles and he's preaching to the kind of the the converts there he's preaching to all these people but what do you think that they struggled with they struggled with the same things that were prominent in their City so let's let's quickly let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 6. verse 9. now remember Paul is writing this this letter to the Corinthians to correct them and it says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not now Paul remember as I preached on acts 15 and in Galatians last last Sunday remember Paul isn't the farthest thing in the in the world from a legalist but that doesn't mean that Paul is against a holy holy life says here first Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor nor revelers nor extortion or shall enter shall inherit the kingdom of God now look at this next verse as such were some of you wow so these people that Paul had witnessed to they came out of that but you're washed you're Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God do you remember my sermon on Acts chapter 15 and on the Galatians Paul was correcting a problem of legalism within the church at Antioch there now Paul is writing in First Corinthians he is writing to correct immorality and writing to correct the sin that was prevalent in that area and don't you love the book of Acts now when we read these books and we'll get to Ephesians a little bit later but when we read these books Galatians the Corinthians we see oh this is who this is written to these people in that area were struggling with these types of things that's why you see Corinthians it's a lot of Correction it says here well in Corinthians IT addresses a lot of immorality IT addresses sleeping around before marriage which is called fornication having relations with someone who's not your spouse which is called adultery the difference there between adultery and fornication effeminate it says here and I'm going through these these uh what he mentions here in First Corinthians effeminate which is homosexuals abusers of their selves with mankind which is also homosexuality idolaters which is worshiping anything other than Jehovah God like in Athens thieves covetousness covetous drunkards you know what all those are revelers reveal here revilers which is actually a a modern word is Slanders Slanders that are causing harm to other with others with their words extortioners none of these shall enter the kingdom of God as such were some of you wow that is the church at Corinth so you can see why this church this letter that's written to these people that we're going to be talking about here why it is so corrective it talks about a woman having long hair it talks about how when men and women divorce and and how that that of a man should treat his wife and a woman should treat her husband it's all of these things that are very very important that they didn't know about because they came from such sin so that is the book of First Corinthians and this who I'm talking about right now is who he is he is writing to and now we're seeing he is starting this church in this Sin City called Corinth are we together so we know now what Paul is facing there and he Paul found a certain Jew this is verse number two yeah there we go thank you and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them I I don't have time but I could talk about how that that this Emperor had kicked out all the Jews of Rome it you know where it gives an excellent um description as this is in the church age book but it's it's when this man he kicked out all of these Jews because he thought they're causing problems I'll just I'll just say it for a minute so what happened is we had the First Church of Rome okay and this Church of Rome was all of these just solid Jewish believers and these people these people are like Paul Aquila and Priscilla were part of it they were just solid Jewish people that understood Jehovah they understood Christ but this man goes and he kicks out all of the Jews for this First Church of Rome so they all leave and we see that these other people take their places that don't have that walk with the Lord that these Originals had and they bring in idolatry now this is all in the church age book I I recommend that you read it they are they bring in idolatry and then we have the foundations for the Catholic Church that was a bonus I didn't have that in my nose and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them and because he was of the same craft he Abode with them so Paul had the same profession as Aquila and Priscilla and wrought for by their occupation they were tent makers so now just because Paul was a minister didn't mean that he was solely dependent on the Believers to support him the in lean times these Ministers of these rabbis back then they always had another craft that they could fall back on that they could do and that's where Paul he must have been taught that in his hometown of Tarsus and that's what that's what happened here so he goes to this Corinth and he goes to work and I think about me I kind of had a similar um experience to where I used to be I used to I went to college and I and I got I I got this job and and when I came back here I needed something to do I needed a job and the Lord provided a job doing the same thing that I used to do way back when and the same thing here happened to Paul he comes here to Corinth and he's able to to step right in and to work in this profession of tent making now when they had the um when they had the synagogues many times people that were of the same occupation would sit in the same areas so when Paul was probably sitting in an area he that's maybe I don't know it may be how that he met Aquila and Priscilla because they were of the same craft they did the same type of work so we see that that they had this in common and then Aquila and Priscilla this really great couple and they come they come up later on in the scriptures they are just a wonderful wonderful uh couple people but this friendship that they had lasted forever it really lasted until the end we see Aquila and Priscilla we see them in Romans we see them in First Corinthians and we even see them in the second letter that Paul wrote to Timothy which is the last work that he penned that we have record of so the right at the very end of his life Paul even mentions Aquila and Priscilla so they were lifelong friends and they probably met most likely met right here in Corinth and he reasoned and Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks so again as I mentioned we have the Jews and the Greeks in the same church we have the the ones that feared God these are those converts that came in and then we have the the real Jews and when Silas and timothius would come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ now we all know who Silas is but this timotheus this is Timothy this is someone that Paul writes his letters to when he's in when Timothy's in Ephesus and when they oppose themselves that word opposed it means that they opposed Paul and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from henceforth I will go until the Gen unto the Gentiles Paul was fed up with this hypocrisy among the Jews and he said he said if they don't accept now Paul was doing something a Jewish Tradition now you remember in the gospels when Jesus sent out his disciples to preach and to heal the sick do you remember that and he said when you come to a city and they don't accept you he said Shake the Dust off of your sandals Shake the Dust off of your clothes and then go to the next one now what that was is that was a Jewish tradition so what would happen is the Jews they would be in the Gentile area and they would go and then they would come home to their Hometown to their home Jewish country and before they would walk in they would stop at the border they would take off their shoes and they would knock the dirty Gentile dust off of their shoes and then they would put them back on and they would walk these proud stuck up Jews I hate to say it but that's what it was so what Paul is doing here this is a serious insult to the Jews so what Paul is saying is I'm going to shake this legalistic gust off of my clothes and I'm going to go to these more pure Gentiles the exact opposite of what the Jewish tradition was that was that was a slap right there but the boldness of Paul he's he's like well it's what's good for what's saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander and he's like listen you're the ones that are dirty not them so he shakes that nasty dust off of his clothes and then he's going to the Gentiles he's saying I'm done with you with your closed-minded legalistic self-righteous ways finished with it and he departed vents and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshiped God whose house was joined hard to the synagogue so Paul is in there and he's debating maybe with these with these Pharisees and and these Jews these legalistic Jews now he is able to if it got rough but for God's serious Paul could just exit stages left right into or stage right whatever this may be right for you but right into this house of justice and go right in there and be safe I think it was a he stayed with Justice and I think who was it that he stayed with last chapter um same thing he stays with this guy Justice is Jason Jason is who it was he stayed in Jason's house and Jason suffered persecution for housing Paul and Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized so still Paul with that gift of being able to bring the message to the people now Crispus he was you know what there is a let's go to First Corinthians 1 14 real quick let me let me read that so he was he was Paul's convert and it says here I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius so this man right here this Christmas this this leader of of the synagogue Paul actually baptized him I love when the two scriptures come together it's like oh that's that guy just just great but we see in the next verse we see these conversions going on and we see the the Lord moving but we see in the next verse that things aren't all butterflies and daisies in Corinth things are going to go south here in just a minute it was a case in lystra when Paul was stoned it was he was threatened in thessalonica if you remember as we're going through this book The Believers snuck him out of thessalonica in Berea same thing they had to get him out of there pretty much everywhere Paul has been it's been persecution persecution persecution by these Jewish people and Corinth was turning out the same the in the Bible doesn't say it but he had to be having problems because of this next verse the Lord then spake the Lord to Paul in the Night by a vision so there must have been something coming against Paul be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city I think what an encouragement what an encouragement to Paul that the Lord Jesus speaking to his servant and telling him that I'm with you Paul and these people that the Lord is talking about they had no idea that they were about to become Christians they had probably never heard the name of Jesus before in their lives but it was about to happen that there was going to form a Christian Church in the city of Corinth for the Lord he said that I have much people in this city and I would like I wish that I could get sometimes I wish I could get that same Assurance for here in Tucson that there are a lot of people that are God's people that still need to come to him I would love to have that Assurance from God that there are that there are still people hungry for the Lord but I believe this day is is not the day that Paul was in it's just few and far between the Lord hasn't told me but I just have to go on believing that there are more people in our city that can come to God that can come to Christ and he continued there a year and six months he was in Corinth for a long time and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them so even after he shook the dust from His Garment he stayed there and when galio was the deputy of a a Kai AKA the Jews made Insurrection with one Accord against Paul and brought him to the Judgment seat here we go again we know this story well it's happened over and over and over so they they the Jews go and they stir things up and they bring them to the Roman Authority saying this fellow persuadeth man to worship God contrary to the law same thing that these two troublemakers when they came to Antioch they're saying the same thing this guy isn't preaching what our law says he could he should preach and just like Antioch and everywhere else the legalistic Jews do not like Paul's message about Christ and not having to live according to the law they cannot stand that message so they try to get the Roman Authority as I said to arrest Paul why not have worked in Jerusalem with Jesus why wouldn't it work here you know Satan has a bag of tricks and those tricks work pretty well and he takes those tricks and he uses them over and over and over again many times he appeals to the legalistic nature of a religious person and when Paul was now about to open his mouth so he was about to say give himself a defense galio said unto the Jews now Galileo is this ruler said unto the Jews if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness OU Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and your law look Ye Ye into it for I will be no judge of such matters the same thing very very similar thing that happened to Jesus Remember When pilate had Jesus and he's like oh what am I going to do this is just this is a mess and he says oh hear it I'll send them to Herod and let him deal with it so that's exactly what happens to here here that they're trying to get this man to do their dirty work and now this galio didn't even give Paul a chance to talk now this is where the Lord remember he just promised Paul protect you Now watch how God protects Paul he says if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness or ye Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a a question of matters and names and of your law look ye into it for I will be no judge in such matters and he galio drove them from the Judgment seat then all the Greek Greeks so now they're all fired up Paul's gone so the Greeks took this guy named sosthenese the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the Judgment seat and Galileo cared for none of those things who is sosthenese where did he come from I thought the other guy was the rule of the synagogue so we have a new ruler of the synagogue somebody must have got kicked out so now we have sustanies and uh sustanese is also in the Bible where is he he's Paul's writing a letter from Corinth and it says and oh yeah it was I think it was first Corinthians first or second Corinthians there Paul is writing back to to the Corinthians and and he's he's saying these things and he says oh ingredients from softon he's our brother and like oh sosthenes you remember him yeah he just disappeared one day oh he's with Paul good I'm glad I'm glad he's in good shape so Paul was Paul this sustines actually traveled with Paul and Paul after this Terry there a good while and then took his leave of the Brethren and sailed thence to Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his head in centria for he had a vow now so Paul is leaving Corinth and it seems like he shaves his head but actually he really just cuts his hair and what did this mean that that he he he was shorn because he had a vow well if you look back in the Old Testament you have there's a word that all of us are familiar with and it's called a Nazarite vow and this Nazarite vow means that this this man he wouldn't drink wine he wouldn't do a lot of other things and one of the things that he also wouldn't do is cut his hair now can you think of someone that had a Nazarite vowel just say it Samson right Samson had a Nazarite vow so he let his hair grow long you know somebody else that did Samuel the prophet he also had this vow so they they would go they would go for this period of time when they had this vow and then when their their time was over then they'd get a haircut and that's what happened right here is Paul got a haircut before he left now we think so much because of Paul's message especially to the Galatians but all throughout Paul's message he is saying listen you don't have to live up live up to all these Jewish rules circumcision and and diet and all these things and and really pressing that but if you look at Paul right here Paul greatly reverenced the tradition of the Jews for himself that Nazarite vow Paul held that in a high regard so much that he took this Jewish vow and we see that Paul and and we'll see here in a little bit that he even more reverenced the Jewish the Jewish traditions and when he came to Ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasons with the Jews so now he's out of Corinth and he goes to Ephesus Ephesus is a big city like Corinth and there's a lot of Jews so the so the Jews at at Corinth they disgusted him so much he shook the duff dust off of his clothes and he didn't go back into that synagogue but now he goes to another city oh and he goes right into the synagogue at Ephesus Paul doesn't care he doesn't care if you're Jewish if you come from his background he doesn't care if you're Greek he doesn't care if you're Roman he doesn't care if you've you accept Jehovah or not he doesn't care if you're an idolater Paul wants everyone to come to Christ and he proves that in every city that he preaches look at the variety of people that Paul is preaching to so he comes to this city at Ephesus again there's no Christian churches yet so he goes in and the only places that he has to preach are in these synagogues so when they desired now remember he's in Ephesus when they desired him to tear a longer time with them he consented not wow that's different remember all the other places like get away get away get away kill him you know throw him in jail get rid of them but these people at Ephesus they're like well we want to hear some more so these people the Ephesians had something a little bit a little bit special it seems like to me and if you read the book of Ephesians you'll see that it's a much more advanced letter than the book The Book of Corinthians the books of Corinthians and he goes back to Ephesus later on in fact he goes back to Ephesus in the next chapter in chapter 19. so we talk about a little bit more about the Ephesians in in there but I will say this that the central theme of the book of Ephesians is the Holy Spirit and Paul preaching a deeper Doctrine to these people than he does to the Corinthians and we'll see here in the next chapter and I'll leave that into the capable hands of brother Lyle to show us what message Paul preaches to in to the Ephesians in the next chapter verse number 21. but Paul made them farewell saying I must by all means keep this Feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return again to you if God will and he sailed to Ephesus again Paul Paul is showing that he has not forsaken his Jewish roots he was honoring the Jewish tradition of the feast in Jerusalem and when he had landed in caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to Antioch now there's a lot in that verse 22 that may not that may not be all of that apparent it says here and when he landed at caesarea and gone up right Jerusalem he salute to the church and he went down to Antioch now Jerusalem is a high elevation in that part of the world in fact it's about the same elevation as Tucson fact it's about the same latitude as Tucson and if if you go to Israel it actually looks a lot like Arizona looks like this part of the world so Paul so pretty much anywhere in that area you have to go up to Jerusalem and that's why it says here and had gone up it's up in elevation so they went up to Jerusalem now it's odd to me that we don't know more about this visit than a politics it's odd to me that it's like well why isn't a little bit more written we don't know there's nothing significant enough to be recorded in the Bible of this trip but one thing that we can assume is this was a short trip and after he had spent some time there in Jerusalem he departed and went over all the country of galatia and frigia in order strengthening all the disciples and a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus now this guy is intriguing this man Apollos very very interesting man this is the first right here this is the first we hear about Apollos but he plays a very important role in the message going out to the different churches in First Corinthians Paul mentions that there are fightings among the people you remember that scripture that there's fighting among the people some say that I am of Paul and some Apollos and some Peter so Paul is putting this man Apollos right up there with him and Peter this man must have been very very good at what he did this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John now for those who say baptism isn't important right here you can see that that if you just knew the doctrine and the baptism of the Prophet John the Baptist your understanding was incomplete this man of paulus was from Alexandria Alexandria is in Egypt which is one of the biggest cities in the world and it had an enormous Jewish population it also had some of the best schools on the planet so we can assume that Apollos was probably highly educated in this city in his hometown of Alexandria so somehow the teaching of John the Baptist came to Apollos and he began preaching John's message now he didn't know about anything about the day of Pentecost he didn't know about the Holy Spirit he didn't even know about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but he is still one of the most gifted preachers that anyone had ever met so he shows up at evidence Ephesus and he starts preaching John the Baptist's message and it goes to show that there is so much about John the Baptist that we don't know he John the Baptist we know that he was a powerful Minister we know that he preached against marriage marriage and divorce when Herod married his brother-in-law's or his brother's wife Philip's wife we know that he preached the Messiah we know that he preached against obviously preached against divorce and he preached against the priests and he preached the Messiah but it must have been a very deep message to have gone as far as John the Baptist message went he must have been really something that we don't read here in the Bible now Paul now Apollos and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took under they took him under them and expounded unto them the way of God more perfectly so Aquila and Priscilla they knew Paul and they knew Christ and they knew the Holy Spirit and they knew baptism so they take one of the most gifted ministers probably in the world at that time he comes into their home and they're probably like hey Apollos you're really good but you need to know a little bit more so they bring him in and they start teaching him and what struck me the most from the scripture is look at the humility of Apollos educated knew the word knew the scriptures knew the Torah knew it better than anyone and here he is with this humble Little Couple comes in and they tell him about Christ and they tell him about the Holy Spirit and he accepts it with all of his heart what a humble man what a good man and when he was disposed in fact brother Branham Likens Apollos to Billy Graham Billy Graham was probably as far as the church world the one of the greatest ministers Christian ministers the world's ever seen and for brother Branham to compare this man of paulus to Billy Graham is a great compliment from him also and when he was disposed to pass unto Ikea the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through Grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ and and we can close if the if the musicians would come so this man Apollos Aquila and Priscilla they explained to him these things and you know like the bereans do you remember the bereans from last week they went and they checked the scriptures I guarantee you Apollos did too so they take they take Apollos takes what Aquila and Priscilla had told him and enlightened him and then he was able to take that Revelation and really present it to the people and there were groups that had heard now Apollos as I said he was all over the place in a great Minister there were groups that had heard Apollos before that he probably had this revelation of the Holy Spirit and of Christ and Paul actually goes and encounters one of these groups and how did Paul handle this when he encountered Apollos this great man comes and he preaches this Gospel of John the Baptist and he converts these people and then Paul comes in and he starts preaching Jesus they're like oh yeah we know and how did Paul handle it brother lie I was going to tell you in his in his sermon on Wednesday it's beautiful Acts chapter 19 is is a wonderful wonderful chapter and Acts chapter 18 17 16 15. oh they're all great I love them all and and I've just been so blessed to be to been going through we've all been blessed to go through these and you see the different people you see from Athens in 17 and you see these just idolaters and Paul is able to speak to them in their language you see that he comes here to Corinth and the most evil Sin City that that you could ever find Paul goes right in jumps in and forms a church right there absolutely beautiful the gifts of this great man the Apostle Paul God bless you brothers and sisters continue reading this book of Acts and I pray that tonight gave you a little bit better understanding of this Acts chapter 18. let's stand God bless you all [Music] oh Lord send your power just now oh Lord

maybe their questions that they had on on who you are they're their thirst for understanding uh who created them wanting to to know where they came from and and their excitement when they found answers in the name of Jesus Christ and we can relate to a lot of these stories Lord and they failed just like we do and quarreled among each other just like we do they needed to ask for forgiveness just like we do Lord and we love to to see your Bible come alive and [Music] just ask that one day Lord will be able to to spend time with these characters that we're reading about Lord and to think that it's really we're part of the same story and we get to spend eternity with some of these characters Lord and we I I don't understand it here on this side but what a what a remarkable thing that'll be to to be able to to talk for a thousand years to each one and they're going to have questions for us just like we have of them and all part of the body of Jesus Christ we're thankful that's again more that we're able to to Fellowship around your word we just ask that you would forgive us where we've fallen short give us strength and courage to depress the battle and maybe take this light

lord and we ask these things to name of lord jesus christ amen [Music] amen good morning saints it's good to be in the house of the lord amen are you thankful we still have a privilege to gather publicly as christians oh you say brother daniel i thought we were always going to have that no we may not have that someday you know so most people would think the tribulation was on if that happened but you got to remember that our brothers and sisters before that they met in the catacombs they met just wherever they could it may happen again i say we appreciate the day that we have my grandfather used to get out of open throw his legs out of bed push the curtain open and he'd say this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in it amen we're going to do something a little bit different we're going to read together maybe psalms 139 if you have your bibles we call it reciprocal reading back home we do it on sunday morning we pick a psalm and the the speaker will read the first verse and then the audience read the second verse and we read that way through the whole chapter and then maybe read the last verse verse 24 altogether so psalms 139 i don't know if the brothers have it if somebody how'd they say it the sisters with the babies want to be able to hold their babies and still see it on the screen we as warriors like to take our sword and know right where it is in our bible psalms 139 maybe we'll read this together do we have somebody back there that can pull it up on the on the overhead well let's go ahead and do it all right psalms 139 oh lord thou has searched me and knowing me amen that was really good thou compasses my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways thou hast beset me behind and before and has laid thine hand upon me whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea i hope you're seeing that david is saying that god knows every place that he is now you got to realize that the devil he can't create so all he does is pervert and duplicate what god has done so with science and technology he's tried to duplicate what god has done and gives you a cell phone so he can know where you go if you go under the earth he knows you there if you're flying in an airplane he knows you're there your phone knows when you lay down and it stops moving for a time they assume you're sleeping so the devil is just trying to duplicate what god had thousands and thousands of years ago god already had it he already knows your down settings he already knows your upright uprisings amen verse number 12 or was it 12 that we read the last one let's start with 11. if i shall say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously raw in the lower lowest parts of the earth amen aren't you thankful that god saw your substance even when you're unperfect amen we're not perfect now but by the blood of jesus christ but even when we weren't perfect god saw us verse number 17 how precious also are their thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them hey man my wife and i read this psalm the other day and it just really struck us verse 17 god says how great are the some of my thoughts towards you if we would ever get read these verses it'll take care of depression and anxiety and all of those things when the word of god says daniel i've been thinking you don't have any idea the sum the amount of the thoughts that i'm thinking about you now if you could put your name in that verse and know god has a great sum of thoughts that he's thinking about every one of you he knows your down settings your uprising everything about you isn't that wonderful amen god knows about you the creator of heavens and the earth and the thing about it he can be so great he can know that about every individual in the world seven billion people he knows all of that about them and he says my thoughts towards you are great if i should count them they are more in number than the sands of the sea next time you go to the beach just look at the sands of the sea and think the bible says those are like the thoughts of god towards me that's how many times he thinks about me praise the lord surely thou will slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and m not i grieved with those that rise up against thee amen so it's not wrong to hate evil the bible says be angry and sin not a lot of people get angry and then they sin but the bible says be angry and send not here david said i hate them with the perfect hatred they are my enemies and then in verse 23 he says oh god search me o god and know my heart try me and know my ways and all together and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting amen [Music] search me [Music] try me [Music] every i praise the lord [Music] in me from sleep [Music] me [Music] me with [Music] with [Music] is we're gonna have a sister lily and sister grace sing us a song special please be seated [Music] god did great things [Music] he was with [Music] do you think god would do this for [Music] spill did they have to pay for i am the lord that killeth thee as long as they obey they did not change with fashion for their clothes did not wax old and the shoes upon their feet did not let in the cold hallelujah faith is the victory that overcomes the world overcomes the world faith is the victory that overcomes the world [Music] is [Music] is [Music] faith is [Music] with this message [Music] hallelujah faith is faith is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith in his word [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's all stand standing on the promises of christ my king through eternal ages let his praise [Music] yes i'm standing standing on the promises [Music] when [Music] standing on the promises of [Music] standing on the promises [Music] standing on the [Music] makes [Music]

big storm started coming into clouds and we said we got to get off this hill it's uh we're way up there in the mountain and started raining we were trying to run down directly we looked back and there was a huge rainbow all over the hill big rainbow there we just stood there looking at it took some pictures of it and all of a sudden another one appeared right above it amen god made a covenant he wouldn't destroy the the world by water amen anymore and he's he's not going to destroy the righteous with the wicked he's just a little confirmation i'm with you brother daniel he's never leave us never forsake us aren't you thankful for that it's nice to see it in the word but it's nice when god comes and gives us a visible covenant said oh that's not enough here i'll give you another one amen a double rainbow rainbow is beautiful in fact it's on the top of my ipad you know hey here it is right there see if i can do this screen here you can see it there's the one picture of it nice that's just one side it was huge through the whole thing i keep it in front of me amen the bible says write them upon the tablets write them upon your your door post to your house when you look at it like oh yeah i remember that yeah i remember that experience that i remember that experience praise the lord god bless you musicians i appreciate the song that peterson sang wasn't that a beautiful song and what they didn't give the history of that their grandmother brother al's mother wrote that so there was a little tribute to her maybe she's got old hour to look over the balcony today and allow her to see her grandchildren standing up here singing about the the grace and the uh of god faith is our victory that overcomes the world amen i just today's mother's day god bless all the mothers with your mother would you raise your hand amen god bless you let's give them a hand clap today special day praise the lord amen none of us would be here without a mother amen may god bless them we're going to speak a little bit about that coming up and i got to tell you your testimony is reaching far in this city i was uh i was up we were had to get an airbnb we're staying a few miles about 15 miles up or oracle road there and i had to get a haircut i was looking a little shaggy and so i went in um the other day my brother john flew in actually wednesday night late and so thursday and friday we spent some time together and we need a haircut so we go in this place and i don't know how you all do it here and there was somebody there to cut my hair we just got to talking a little bit i said well we're what are you doing here i said well i'm in town helping down at tucson tavern like a tucson tabernacle we started talking they said where is that i said it's on north street you know you won't know where this place is like well you know we start talking a little bit like where where exactly is it on north street and he's talking a little bit and then directly a person said well you know i live in the apartments right down at the end of the street and i've been up to your food bank and i've got food up there and and they're just three blocks away from here so i try to invite them out to church come on out to church we not only have natural food we have spiritual food amen we got an angel that came in our day and said store this up daniel and the believers are going to need it in this generation so there's a people that are feeding on that word so amen just keep being a testimony for the lord you may not think that people aren't watching but they're watching they're watching everybody's watching amen may god help us to just do that which is right we were talking about a couple things just give me a couple minutes we've got to get through these announcements we were talking about having fellowship and things and there's a lot that we could do but we were just thinking maybe this friday night we would maybe be together and have like a meal together and maybe do like a pitch-in luncheon here maybe friday night if that's okay i know everybody's day timer's running through their mind friday and they want to pull their phone out check the calendar but just maybe keep in mind as we say back home no time is a good time so this you just set a time and say this is when we're going to do it but we'd love each everybody to come out maybe friday night and i don't know my wife or some of the ladies could get together and just coordinate so we don't have all baked beans there but maybe we can get kind of a variety and come together i think it would be good that we have fellowship amen fellowship is good encouragement you get together and realize you know i'm not the only one fighting this battle there's other people that's got teenagers you know and you look around like you know i got a pain in my knee like hey i got one in my back and you fellowship in your suffering sometimes amen but we all going through trials and battles it's good to come to church amen and see other christians so maybe we'll do that friday night about 6 30. if you can't make it at 6 30 come at 7 30. if you can't come at 7 30 come at 8 o'clock amen to encourage you just to be together with believers tonight we're going to have communion we had talked about having it last week and we baptized anthony and so it would work better to do it this weekend so tonight we're going to have the communion service also something special on mother's day i met with brother figueroa the other day and the lord's doing something special in his life and i asked him if he would maybe come and speak for us tonight brother robert figueroa i think he spoke here a couple weeks ago at the memorial service um so we just want to i invited him if he'd come back seemed like the holy spirit impressed that on me to just have him come back tonight so he's going to come back and and speak for us before the communion i appreciate him and his labors i think he labored here i don't know what it was 28 years or something he was here before he started helping the group in sara vista so just come expect and i know i'm excited to see an older man like that still has the fire and zeal for the lord i said you remember you may not have ever listened to the the testimony of jack cole but jack cole came and he sought the lord and he found the lord and he tells the story going through the grocery store and screaming hot dog i got it hot dog i got it and got salvation and i wish people would just get what jack cole got sometimes and he walked through there and he seen a tomato can it had red tomatoes he said that reminds me of the blood of jesus christ and he went running through the store and run you know we say we're message and we're way up here we just need to get what jack cole has a lot of time he's running through the thing and he comes to the end and there's a butcher standing there in his clothes and he said you know what he said i know you you've been up to that revival up there jack cole got something so great inside me went home and his mother was an unbeliever just a total center one day she came to the service said if it'll do that for jack cole i want it too said at the end of the service she came up to the altar and she said god i don't know anything about you but give me what jack's got god give me what jack's got god give me what jack's got i pray each one of us gets so full of the holy ghost people come they don't know anything about god but say lord give me what this brother's got lord give me what this sister's got give me with this i thought about brother anthony just got baptized he doesn't know anything about the bible doesn't know anything about god doesn't know he's just new to all of this and so there the bible says you are written epistles read and knowing of all men so he may never understand that he's trying to learn i said look this is the old testament this is the new testament 66 books 39 in the old 27 and he's just it's all new like a baby he's learning the whole thing but us have walked with god for so long he's not going to you know what he's going to look at your life more than he does this bible he's because you are the written bible and so he's going to look at your zeal and love for god more than he's like well they don't even care about then why do i why would i but i say lord fill me with the holy ghost amen lord they're going to read my life let me be a written epistle knowing and read of all men a song so touch me about the i don't know was it ray boltz that wrote that about the cross amen they gave their life on crosses and died you heard the story of them frozen i think don francisco talked about them being frozen out on the islands 49 soldiers for jesus is a good song if you've never heard it i mean these people gave their life i want to have what those people had in my life amen blessed be the name of the lord i haven't read the text yet y'all are just pulling me everywhere amen if you have your bibles let's go to ecclesiastes chapter 3. amen i'm just so excited about being a christian having the zeal of the lord and you know what it is it's because i'm getting older amen i can see the end and i realize i only have a few more days a few more years to do something for the lord and i want to go out with a bang you know they do those fireworks and they just send a few things up but at the end they have this grand finale and that's the way i want my life to be i want to go as one man said i want to go and i want to fall into the grave completely spent for jesus christ i want my body to be wore out i want my memory i want all of it to be wore out because i want to be how's paul say i'm willing to be spent spend and be spent for your sake amen praise the lord ecclesiastes chapter 3. let's just ask the lord to bless the reading of the word amen lord we just bow our heads to you we thank you for the inspiration of the holy spirit lord i would remember reading in the book of acts he said you have the unction lord and that's what we all need the unction of the holy spirit father in our lives lord as i remember your prophet saying in the message the token he said the theme of every apostle was to ask people have you received the holy ghost since you believed have you received the quickening power of jesus christ since you believed the word of god and the message of the hour and i pray god you'd fill us all with the holy spirit lord the bible says as peter spake the word the holy ghost fell upon them and lord i pray as we read the word of god and speak of you may the holy ghost fall among us lord may we hear the wonderful works of god how god is working among us and changing lives and moving us closer to you lord we thank you for what you've done looking forward to what you continue to do and i pray lord you'd work in me lord do a work a mighty work in my life i pray lord help me to throw away the things of the world and the desires of the world that are not like you and love you with all of my heart soul mind and body help us today lord and i pray as a body of believers lord we just lift up joseph lord roberts there

strengthen him and his father if he's there with him lord bless them together bless sister sarah lord who's given so much in their family going through this trial your word says when one suffers we all suffer together lord you said bear ye one another bird and lord and i pray that you would bless this family and help them and encourage them today i pray in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord ecclesiastes chapter three i want to read this chapter some of the verses here ecclesiastes chapter 3. the bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill a time to heal time to break down a time to build up there's a time to weep there's a time to laugh some people they just don't i just weep in time i'm just you know how's it saying lady it says they're poor wretched mind blind and miserable and you see some people they just get enough of god to be miserable and hateful and armory and do we have to do that and be a christian they're miserable but here the bible says there's a time to laugh and i think it says in another place the joy of the lord is our strength the david said lord restore unto me the joy of our salvation god bless you brother up in the balcony i don't know who you are but everybody look up there he's bouncing up and down something's happening in that brother's life and i guess it's only the second time he's been to church god bless you brother david said the joy of the lord is our strength and he got to a place the trials were so great he said lord restore to me the joy of my salvation some of us has lost the joy of our salvation and we're just going through the grind i tell you there's a place where the oil of the holy ghost can fill our lives amen and we say lord this is i enjoy this i enjoy church i enjoy god i enjoy the forgiveness of sins forgiven i enjoy the liberty the bible says where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty so if brother arnie takes off and starts running around this church you'll know wow he's got something give me what brother arnie's got he's back there smiling time to laugh a time to mourn time to dance time to cast away stones the time to gather stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing i like to preach a young people service right there there's a time to refrain from embracing and that's before you're married embracing other individuals of the opposite sex a time to get time to lose a time to keep a time to cast away a time to rend time to sow a time to keep silent there comes a time as a father you've got to speak you've got to say something time is a mother day's mother's time there's psalms mama says nope that's wrong we're not going to do that so the bible says there's a time a time to love a time to hate a time of war time of peace what shall it prof what prophet hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth i have seen the labor which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end go down to verse 14. i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him amen may god bless his reading of the word you may be seated praise the lord sometimes preachers just have to vent they kind of build this up kind of inside of them and i don't know if you ever had a thermostat stick on your radiator of your car you know but it and then it gets all that pressure and sometimes you just gotta vent it out and so you gotta vent it out in the right way i think i told you all about the big scar i have on my my arm right here i got a big scar people don't show their scars but i got a big scar on my wrist i was 17 18 19. i was up in vancouver visiting some friends and their car overheating you know i'm the hero and all the ladies and the guys around like hey and when i took it off and it sprayed up on my arm and in my face and so there was some malpractice they treated it wrong now i've got a big scar and it tells me don't vent in the wrong way some people they get under pressure in life pressure comes to everybody you know sometimes young people they get under pressure and they go drink and they do drugs or they may be living morally that's not the way to vent we have a way to let off pressure brother and preached the whole message he saw this days he preached a message called letting off the pressure letting off the pressure people it builds up and it builds up and it builds up i remember i was a 15 year old boy i was sitting in down in the basement in my brother's basement i was talking to my best friend jesse collins he was a diesel mechanic i knew he went to school and i said jesse what happens if this engine builds up if you know anything about compression engines and you know there's the piston comes up and the spark and the gas and diesel is just there's no spark plug it just comes up and the compression the heat and and then it explodes and pushes a piston down and so i was talking i said what happens if there and he went through this great scientific reason of what would happen i said and i was like you don't understand i am as a teenager i'm 15 years old and i'm under so much pressure and god began to deal with i mean it wasn't just a couple months later than a youth uh camp that i was sitting about where our brother here nathan is and they made a call and i got up and went down and i let off the pressure in jesus christ and gave it all to him say lord here's my life i've made a mess of my life and my testimony and when my teacher looked at me we went to a christian school you probably heard my testimony she said daniel you have the filthiest mouth in this christian school i thought oh god what a terrible testimony i have my father's a minister i've just made a mess of my life but you know i went to the altar and i laid it all down that's what altars are for they're places where living things die and i you know god just got to the place he said i'm sick and tired of lambs and goats and all this blood he said i don't want that i want a living sacrifice and i went down sister hannah and i laid my life down and said lord here's all of my life and i gave it to christ and he came in and i got up and i walked away a different person amen i went from the back row of just wanting to be a teenager and aloof i went up in a front lord i just want to be in your presence lord i want to be lord close to the flame of fire and i can hear my mom's voice speaking to me tonight i called her last night to wish her happy mother's day i haven't got to my first note on my page here but it's mother's day so i sit and talk to my mom and you know it's a mother it's amazing how a mother can shape your life she's probably watching today god bless you mom she doesn't they haven't been able to go to church in a long in over a year i guess their church and so she's streaming and so he said mom you can stream us today it's amazing there was a little book my mother had she said children are are wet cement and you mold them and shape them for a period of time and then that's all you have them and they're set for life the bible says train up a child in the way it should go and when he's old he'll not depart from it amen he might stray away from it a little bit but you've molded something in him so that's why you realize it's wet cement if any of you brothers any brothers ever poured concrete how many brothers we have yes we got some concrete so you pour that concrete and all of a sudden you get in a hurry like we got to get this done and we you get it all done and when you get done your little kid comes up puts his hand up here like puts his hand printed and oh we didn't wipe that out and there it is forever their hand print and those things make an impression in your life they they mold you and she had this little book so children are wet cement and it made an impression on me that young people they're there for a little time and you have an impression and then they grow older as the one man said arrows were never meant to stay in your quiver they're made to point in the right direction and shoot them and that's the way children are they uh oh this little girl shot love her we never had girls but i can imagine i'm going to keep this girl at home and then you know they get older and you know they're like you know and then maybe boys you're like you know i've got to point you and then i want you to go paul told timothy follow me as i follow christ it was imitation you follow me that's what parenting sometimes people they get to place they're telling their kids what to do is like instead of doing that say hey you just do what i do you just do what i do you respect the policeman and you do what's right you be responsible when sunday comes we go to church because they're gonna they're gonna do what you do you're where every one of us are preaching a gospel i remember one time is this okay this is just me this is kind of so i remember going in my basement i was like 17 18 years old and i preached i felt like there was a call in my life and i went down in our basement and i walked i remember walking in and my mom followed me in and i said mom i'm never going to preach again she said why daniel why why do you say that and i remember looking at her and i said you know what i've got some deep convictions in my heart about the bible and the word of god and and i just people don't want to hear that i don't i'm not going to do it and she looked at me and she shaped my life she said daniel that's what this world needs is men that have strong conviction and she made an impression on my life she molded me she shaped me and sometimes they shape you and maybe it's not for everybody but maybe it's just for me last night i was talking to her on the phone she had six children so she spent time in the nursery she said i spent that time in the nursery she said when i come out of that nursery she said i purposed in my heart that if i couldn't see the weight in the preacher's eyes she said i was sitting too far back so she said i had to see the white in the preacher's eyes and that was just her but it made an impression on me last night so you know now as a young person like i got to see the white in that preacher's eyes obviously brother branham's day there was 8 000 people in the congregation but she had a conviction in her heart she wanted to be close to where the minister was and that's the thing parents you're molding and shaping people's lives amen mothers and fathers alike we don't have father's day but god help us all going back to our subject here i just want to get started here and i want to read a quote brother and said you know we got to have a doctrine brother ham taught us he said you don't have a church without a doctrine every church has a doctrine and so we believe according to the scripture that god sent a message in this day malachi 4 says i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord so we believe god was going before he burnt the earth he was going to send elijah the prophet now he had two choices one i'll either strike the earth with a curse and destroy it like he did in noah's day or i'll send elijah the prophet jesus was concerned he said when the son of man cometh will he find faith so i believe it's what is it matthew 17 or matthew 11. the disciple says i thought elias was to come and jesus refers to william branham's ministry and says truly elias shall truly come and restore all things now he wasn't referring to john the baptist because if he had referred to john john the baptist and john the baptist was to restore he would have restored them back to the law of moses so jesus was they were talking to him about thinking it was john the baptist and jesus is saying future truly elias shall future he'll come and he'll restore all things jesus saw the church ages he saw it all fall he saw the dark ages he said i'm going to send you william branham's ministry and it's going to restore you back to the faith of our father so i say if jesus saw the ministry and acknowledgement how much more i should be able to see the ministry and acknowledge it and see what it does for my life and so i want to read this right here brother adam says and here we are down in the ladies in church age i love a prophet because he tells you where you are people they get in the world and they get lost like i don't know where we are it's the end of the world is this the beginning are the chinese it looks like the chinese are going to rule the world and it looks like they're building then they got armies and what they say you can name just doing the mass some of you are scientists you probably they said you can you can stand them for a breast and just march them into the ocean and the there's so many of them i don't know if it's 1.3 billion or 4 billion now that march them in the ocean they'll reproduce and you'll never run out of chinese and so it looks and if you watch the world or and watch how they're gaining dominance and things and like like that and so we had a prophet come in our day and he begins to talk about the roman catholic church is going to rule the world it's not going to be the chinese that rule the world we the roman catholic church is going to rule the world so you watch these players and we've lived long enough to see all these things coming to pass and see america go into debt and so a prophet comes and shows us the seven church ages in revelations chapter two and revelations chapter three these are things to help guide you through life we especially as men need to know because our children are going to come to us and no we're not going to it's not going to be a thousands and thousands of more years no right before the lord burns the earth with a and the earth is destroyed by fire we remember reading it over in peter hill the elements will melt like fervent heat so when you have a revelation of the scripture you don't put your whole life into becoming a millionaire and forsake god you remember amen that the bible says that the earth is going to burn with the fervent heat then we had a prophet come in our day had seven visions and every one of them come to pass we see them coming to pass we don't have time this morning to go through but the last one was america just in craters if you have a revelation of that it'll keep you from getting distracted and say oh how's the bible say six days shalt thou labor and the seventh day shalt thou rest it's the lord's day instead of working seven days if you go back in the book of um and study the romans and the jews the things that made romans romans and the jews were separated the jews would take a day and set it aside to rest where the romans they just work seven days a week so you see that culture coming today where the stores are now open seven days a week and there's no regard for god they just go on it's that roman spirit coming back in this day so now we have a prophet come goes to the book of revelations chapter 2 and chapter three and shows us that we're living in the last part of chapter three and the first verse of chapter four is come up higher which is the rapture so we're living right at the closing of the ladies and churches you said well how do you know it's the ladies in church age where we're living because the bible says thou art rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing have you ever seen in the history of the world where people are so rich and have need of nothing some of us think i need that other pair of shoes well what about those 15 that are in the closet that are right there you know when we were young you had play shoes and church shoes you had you had work play clothes and you had church clothes and that was you know and we were so blessed hey siri turn the temperature up hey siri uh turn the light out and we're so rich and increased with goods and haven't you and god said look you're wretched poor mind blind and miserable and you don't even know it brother and preach the message called and knoweth it not listen to the message if you're a young person listen to the message and knoweth it not brother ram talks about your body soul and spirit your triune being all these revelations of the prophet will help you identify where you are in the world history he'll go through and dissect you when you're tempted that's another sermon as well brother adam said this we're down at the ladies in church age and we're taught the lady in church aids that christ was put on the outside of his church and it was even knocking on the door trying to get back in and we see that happening and we we are we know the age that we're living in and now we're at the closing history of the world the world the book is now being finished the last line will be wrote across it someday and she'll be closed and time will be no more that's why we come to church to shake our minds away from the world shake our minds away from that young man that came to me that one day i think i did this illustration here a few weeks ago and that young man said i'm just going to walk away from god and i'm not going to serve the lord and when i get ready i'll come back and he was thinking that his desire for god was like this light switch i'm going to turn it off and when i get ready for god i'll turn it back on and we come to church to shake our minds and realize that jesus said no man comes to the father but by me it's not like hey i'm 16. i'm going to go do my thing when i get ready and i make a million dollars i'll be back when i'm 40 or 50. and the bible says we shake ourselves as young people shake yourselves from that jesus said i come in an hour that you think not when you don't think and you think authority and i'm going to come when at this age and so we shake ourselves from that and we shake away from the glitter and the glamour of the world because all of us are tempted every one of us have temptations you think well you're a 15 year old boy you're 18. i got these temptations mom and dad don't have any idea no mom and dad are tempted just like you it just changes every seven years you go through a change in your mind and your body and you say i don't believe that well you don't have to believe it but if you'll just practice it it'll help you when you get to those stained changes of your life and you realize that you go through a change but after when you're seven you're tempted to steal that cookie or steal something and you change in your 14 and then the boys and the girls and then you get 18 and then you get 21 and then you've got those kids you're like hey i'm just and i see sometimes parenting people have maybe a few children then they get their last one and they get tired and they kind of just check out they just like hey i'm down with this parenting and they kind of check out no no god gave them to us for a reason their responsibility i'd like to so many things you know i i i'm a minister that's not ashamed of where the the the things that have molded my life that i'm not ashamed to tell where i got them i see some ministers are ashamed they'll preach the message but they will not say i got this from william branham they're ashamed of many denominational people they'll preach the revelation of the message but they won't say hey i'm reading the messages of william branham and coming and preaching i'm not ashamed to say that i'm following a message that god sent by william branham and if you go back and read the message a man running from the presence of the lord and brother ram says now when you have children or we it's responsibility when you have those little children you get little fingerprints on the walls and you know you say i don't want those well that's the responsibility then you have a responsibility to raise them and to correct them and and educate them and so it's a responsibility and when you get married it's a responsibility some young men they get married and then they they want to go out and do all their hobbies and like well hey that you should have done that for you made a commitment to love honor and cherish and care about the way your wife feels or she's lonelier and then you and same with the wife you've got all these things and you make an obligation i promise to cherish and and value this it's getting really quiet in here but this is what pastors do all right evangelists run and scream and do all that but pastors just simple and talk and here i've got all these notes and the holy spirit's saying look you're not going to preach that so god help us today brother rahm says there's a great gran drama being set the angels are standing over the skies and they're watching as the actors are ready you can see them acting and on the uh they're acting you can see the evil one acting you can see the villain at the play and how he's coming to the scene and his cunningness to to deceive and here's a prophet showing us all these players that are in place and he said you can see the raptured church making herself ready and it's a great scene oh i trust that he saw me i trust him when he saw looked down in this thing and he saw all the preachers just quitting because some went to doctrine come and said look just stop preaching and and i trust he saw me reading the scripture jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel i trust he saw me standing here preaching today and preaching the gospel and being faithful he said all the raptured church is getting ready it's a great scene he said you can see the presence of god vindicating and making the great drama that's uh foretold here in the bible to act out what a what a time to live the most glorious time the men of all ages is long for this time the prophets of old long to see this hour but they wasn't privileged but we are privileged to live in this day we are privileged the darkest time there's never been a time where it's been more dark than this time isaiah said there'll be darkness on the earth and gross darkness on the people it'll be actually gross you don't believe it go down to walmart walk through walmart and just look at the people like this is just gross the bible prophesied said it'd be a gross time and in that time god chose you he chose me i'd love to live back there in that day and just you know get in the herd with the two million people leaving egypt like hey here we go cross and go right in there you know but no god chose you every day brother edward you have to fight a battle greatest battle ever fought greatest battle ever fought how we read at second corinthians chapter 10 casting down imagination when the devil's putting thoughts in your mind as we said now don't think of a pink elephant no you already thought about pink california because you can't control your thoughts the devil can put thoughts in your mind and that's you're sitting there trying to love the lord serve the lord ding a little text and then like go go go check your text go check your text and it's actually dopamine they say dopamine when you hear that ding and i can't preach that sermon the bible says that we are not ignorant of the devil's devices you go back and study facebook and they got people in the room and said how can we addict those people to their phones and they said we're gonna we're gonna pattern this just after the slot machines when you go to the gambling and they become addicted when they pull those slots down and ding i want something and they do the same thing with the facebook and it goes ding and they said it releases dopamine in your brain dopamine is more addictive than cocaine and now he's addicted all these people and people they love god a lot i want to say ding why can't you lay it down there's an addiction that comes with that and once you learn that like hey i'm gonna put that on silent i'm gonna talk to the creator lord help me i'm not ignorant of those devices i'm not gonna let that thing rule me i'm gonna put it in its place i'm not gonna let it rule over me and me become a master how do we read that the other day in corinthians he said yield your members as members of righteousness and not unto unrighteousness why would i let this little device come in and i become addicted to it and take me places that are bad and evil and i hear things that i wish i hadn't heard and i see things i wish i hadn't seen because of this device now i know preachers and then they say look you can't have facebook or you can't have a cell phone i don't think the bible says use the world but don't abuse it put it in its place lord help us today so much i would like to say but we're living in an age where the son of man ministry is coming our day luke 17 30 i was thinking of that scripture the bible says as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be luke 17 26 he says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the day of son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted building and build it and but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so what was going on in the days of sodom it was homosexuality you think homosexuality is going away not on your life it's prophesied remember they were going to legalize in one state and people like oh no texas has done it oh no i like hey get used to it's going to cover because it's prophesied all of sodom and gomorrah as it was in that day it's going to be in this day it's prophesied it's not going away so shall it be in the coming son of man when the son of man is revealed but what happened up on the hill in the days of lot abraham was sitting there remember the angel come elohim come and said you're going to bear a son and sarah laughed in the tent and the elohim said why did sarah laugh they called her out sarah why'd you laugh she said i didn't laugh he said oh but you did laugh you laughed in her heart wasn't an audible she laughed in her heart as it was in sodom so shall it be in this day remember jesus comes to the woman at the well and he's sitting on the well in the city of samaria said go get your husband she said i don't have a husband. he said you've said right you've had five the one you're living with now your sixth one is not yours but she said wait i know when the messiah comes he'll do what you just did messiah means the anointed one she said i know when the anointed one comes he'll do it he said i'm the one that's talking to you and so brother bam goes back and the angel comes to brother branham and says you're going to have a gift of discernment you'll know the thoughts and the intents of the heart then he takes them back to revelation or luke 17 30. as it was in that day it's going to be in this day and now we have 1200 tapes that you can listen to of the discernment of the son of man being revealed in our day and they'd stand up and they bring them around this side i keep doing this like this because brother ram said the angel of the lord is always on my right side he said that's why i bring the prayer line this way he said because the angel stands between me and those people and you can listen to it on the tape he said now you feel that presence that won't hurt you that's him that's standing between he said now that's a sweet humble tender presence and so we see we have 11 1200 tapes of that so he preaches a message recognizing your day and its message can we get through this doctrine will you bear with me a couple more minutes here brother man preaches a message anointed ones at the end time some of you maybe were raised in pentecost and they say look there's the holy spirit following that person she's speaking in tongues and running the aisles and i know that's the holy spirit maybe she's cut her hair and she's dressed in morally i know that's the prophet god said i know that stumbles you god showed him anointed ones at the end of time he preaches the whole message the rain falls on the just and the unjust on the wheat and the tares it falls in but what is the true evidence of the holy spirit is the life that you live by their life by their fruits you still know them so at the end of the message he comes down and this is really good this will help you because some people looked at the ministry of brother branham just like they did john the baptist remember they came to john said are you christ or do we look for another are you the one jesus said or john said no i'm just the voice of one crying in the wilderness i must decrease he must increase so when brother branham came in our day and had such a amazing ministry of the son of man that god gave to william it wasn't william brandon i want you to always remember this go back and watch deep calls the deep he's standing there he said i'm as helply as helpless as a baby unless he comes i i can't discern these people it was not william branham it was jesus christ borrowing a body and it was christ's ministry through him it's the same as the people getting up here singing a song or or or witnessing all of you all witnesses ain't you it's christ anointing your memory and then you do something for the lord and it wasn't william brandon it was jesus christ coming brother adam says this and he said i want you to know this for sure you that listen to this tape that you might know today that i was trying to say i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice some people try to make him god and here's william i'm saying look i'm just the voice i'm the microphone that this is flowing through and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but he said it was the will of my father that i declare to do and i'm determined to do it i wasn't the one now listen how he he he changes right here he said i wasn't the one that appeared on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only the one that's near when he does it isn't that what john was saying i must decrease it's him it's jesus christ and any ministry that doesn't point you to christ has got another uh objective and we want all of the ministry everything we do not to glorify man but to glorify jesus christ he said it wasn't what i knew he said it's what i just surrender myself to that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god it's the angel he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and then he makes this amazing statement he said if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above the denominations and the things of the world will you do it amen so he's bringing the people down to a challenge and i can tell you if you'll feed on the word of god's message in this day the son of man the things of the world will fade away from you the denominational idea even that comes into the message that will fade away from you and you realize that jesus christ loves you so much that he sent a message in this day all right done with the doctrine back to our text series ecclesiastes chapter 1. the bible says to everything there is a season i began to meditate on that yesterday brother lyle and i begin to think about the bible says to everything there is a season there is a season for this plex plexiglas there is a season for this speaker here there is a season for this microphone if you went back 20 years brother branham didn't necessarily have lapel mics there was a season and then technology changes and you discard it and so we find that everything has a seasons back home we have four seasons fall and winter and spring and summer and they go from one to the other we have a house it's just for a season you have children and they're just for a season how many of us would love to freeze our kids at 12 years old and they never went into those teenage years but you can't it's a season and then they move into that and chemicals kick into their mind and they become a different person and men young boys want to become men and start sparring and young ladies are concerned about their appearance and and things and it's a season that they go through it's not going to be forever they won't be teenagers forever you'll go through that and you'll come out the other side i had three boys and we made it through thank the lord you're changing diapers and you're in the nursery like oh i'm in the nursery it's just a season i see our sister in the back smiling it's a season you have to go through that season together you know you go through it i remember my wife when she got pregnant with one of our boys and the first one was really difficult she had a c-section and so the second one and then she got pregnant she came to me and said i'm not going to have this baby and i'd got a little wisdom after being married and i realized i would just agree with her you're right you don't have to have this baby you're right you don't have to have knowing that to everything there's a season within 10 months you're going to have this baby you're going to have this baby it's a season but you have to go through it most of our trials are when we have to change those seasons and we don't want to change seasons i'm going to say that again most of our trials is when we change seasons and we're not ready to change seasons so we're all young and it's as one man say it's a shame that youth is wasted on youth and you see people running and kids like man if i had that much energy i could do great things in the world but it's just youth and they're like stop playing stop playing no it's just something about a child they got to burn off that energy it's a stage and then they'll come up to the or they don't like i don't feel like doing that so y'all just smiling at me you know what i'm talking about and you have a season you know we read there further down there's a time to be born and there's a time to die it's appointed under man and we don't like to think about but as christians you know and and christianity is not all what are the some of the prosperity gospels you know i'm too blessed to be depressed i'm too anointed to be disappointed and sow a thousand dollar seed and god will bless you with a hundred thousand it's a gospel of prosperity and it's not real it's a gospel without a cross the gospel we preach has a cross a crucifixion a death to self and so so many people they sell christianity has no problems but life is real and the gospel came to bring us through life no matter what stage if we're 12 jesus was about his father's business as you go and become a young man and you worry about your career and amen you how they say with men they say i think it's um i think it's three minutes when you meet a man the average time is three minutes you you get through the weather and all that and you say hey what do you do for a living and a man's identity is created by what he does and and the bible tells us that a man should work and god told adam look go have dominion that's why if you're not a christian you don't know christ don't have a relationship with christ many times when you look at the world you and you don't have dominion the devil comes and he pushes you down you watch young people they come up in their senior year the pressure like a sliding board they come down and right at the end and they go out like where am i going to land and the devil comes in at times and there's alcohol and pressures and come on young men don't let the world the devil pull you out there somewhere come in the presence of the lord say lord help me the bible says commit your way unto the lord and he will direct your path the footsteps of the righteous they're ordered by god god has everything in his control he's leading us and guiding us every day things don't just happen by chance god's got it all in control oh if we would just get alone with god and pray and say lord i don't understand this i don't have it it's in my bible in their song he's got it all in control every road i walk down i know he's got a plan lord you're shaping me you're molding back at our church back home we have well you all have them here everyone those are probably man-made fabricated rocks and a mold but if you go out to regular rocks every rock is different and there's been conditions that happened in a per in a life to make that rock different and each one of us are different and god is shaping sister liliana differently than he's shaping sister heather and i think i'm a mother every time i see sister heather just that gentle nature and my daughter-in-law is named heather just a gentle nature each one of you have a character and no one can take your place god's made you different he's made us go through maybe some of you have been coveted through covet and maybe some of you haven't and so your life is different and you're going through just be a christian wherever you are just be a christian be a light say lord this is shaping me maybe you were born in your genetics your genes are weak and and you have a little illness you know or that don't don't discard your life or build a complex or go say look i can no in your weakness say remember paul he had his eyes he said i sought the lord three times that he would deliver and god said my strength is sufficient for you paul it'll keep you humble but look at how he changed the world by writing his letters and preaching the gospel may god help us everyone to say holy spirit empower me with our unique talents and abilities lord let me use my talents for the glory of god was it finney or one of them they'd listen to him say they did or went back and did a review said man the guy squeaks he's ball-headed he's ah look he's just nothing and he said but hey i'm winning souls for christ i'm winning souls for christ i say we do something for the lord jesus so i thought about this seasons changed from a boy to a man from a girl to a woman sometimes our health changes and we go through middle age i was thinking of this scripture back in the book of daniel in daniel chapter 2 verse 20. this is when daniel they were going to kill all the astrologers and daniel i'd like to preach a whole sermon right there when they come and say look we're going to kill you all the first thing daniel did he tried to buy time he said can you give us overnight and he tried to buy the second thing he got with the believers and the saints and he went to a prayer meeting we may need to know that someday always try to buy time when somebody forces you was talking to somebody yesterday and this has happened and this happened and this happened and this happened i said look just look let's just don't make decisions under pressure this is another pastoral thing never make a decision outside of the presence of the lord make all major decisions in the presence of the lord when we come down to the end of the service don't waste the time get down on your knees and pray say lord i have got to make a decision lord will you help me and only make major decisions in the presence of the lord how many young people if they would hear my voice and they say brother daniel said only make major decisions in the presence of the lord and it will save them from making a decision in the backseat of a car somewhere and they make decisions in the presence of the lord lord this is a righteous young man i think i'll take him to be my lord this is a godly sister i see the holy spirit in her life i'm going to make a decision in the presence of the lord so we come down here daniel chapter 2 and verse 20 and daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his oh the wisdom is in god what is it james the first chapter it says if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god i don't understand the world and the complexity well they used to say knowledge duplicates every five years uh with technologies and that's why the bible says in the last days knowledge shall increase it's fulfilling the scripture so everything you knew about machine work every five years it doubles and then it doubles now i think they say every year every that's why they have continuing education it doesn't matter if you're in nursing or what you're in the technology comes out and you have to go have continuing education because knowledge shall increase that will help every one of you and say look to keep your nursing license you got to go every two years and have these classes or this because knowledge see it as a scripture then the bible says knowledge shall increase the bible says if any man lack wisdom let him ask god don't get overwhelmed and just go down in depression say lord you help me lord i need wisdom god help me now i want you to notice that wisdom is different than knowledge okay wisdom is different than knowledge knowledge is information wisdom is to know how to apply that information so they tell me and i don't know everything about the fruits and vegetables but they tell me that that tomatoes are a fruit what is it whether you have seeds or something like that so if it's seeds it's a fruit so anyway knowledge tells me that tomatoes are fruit but wisdom tells me don't add a tomato to a fruit salad so i have the knowledge nope it's got seeds going in with the fruits but that wisdom tells me no no don't put that acidic tomato in with that fruit salad you'll ruin it so you see the world is full of knowledge but very little wisdom i'll say this the bible says the fear of the lord is the very beginning of wisdom what would it profit a man if he gained the whole world and he lost his soul it's not getting a lot of knowledge in making a career as a man but the beginning the wisdom of god amen the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord this is the verse i wanted to get to verse 21 and he god changes the times and the seasons oh sometimes when we go through trials as brother daniel said many times our trials are when god is just changing the seasons of life and we're going through changes and and the bible says that is god that changes the times and seasons he removes the kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge unto them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him daniel goes on to pray and says i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of our fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast made known unto us the king's matter so the bible says god is the one that changes you might be going through a change maybe you're well one day and now you're sick and you're going through a different season we need to pray for joseph their whole family is going through a little season and telling how it changes where their beds are and trying to get him out and he can't walk he's in a wheelchair and he's going through a season but that's not the end it's just the season you're in darkness and it's night time you say oh it's nighttime but that it's just a season the sun will come up you just got to get through that that that dark season we've all been through those dark times in our life as long as you hold to christ don't let it bury you don't go out and and just stay with christ remember paul said they were going to abandon the ship and paul said stay with the shep stay with jesus christ amen may god help us because romans 8 28 says all things work together for good now the word of god is an anchor to the believer and your mind will start wandering you come go through seasons of your marriage you see people are engaged like oh we want to do a fairy tale it's like man it's coming life's coming at you it's real praise the lord it's good we got friends having get married in a couple weeks hey and you all laughing like hey it's coming yeah we went we had our honeymoon we came home i remember monday morning i had to you know we went on nice honeymoon and come back monday i had to go to work is this okay this is you become real vulnerable when you share personal things so now you're getting personal stuff so my wife she's like wonderful wife goes downstairs i hear making this orange juice and and all of a sudden i hear and then i hear her crying and so i come down the stairs she's sitting in the middle of the floor orange juice all over the floor and she's crying and i'm like honeymoon's over and we had a nice glass pitcher and it had a like a glass wand it's bubbled at the end and she put that frozen orange juice down in the thing and she was stirring it with this one and it the picture was so thin it cracked the side and it all flowed out the side of it and it's like you know the honeymoon life just comes at you you know that and then you get your first child and then it comes and you don't just have a love for your spouse but now you've got to divide that uh and it's just life it's seasons you're going through a season everybody y'all are just looking at me like yeah because every one of us are in seasons maybe we were once a kid and now like i'm not going to that party if there's if there's girls there and you went through a different season like i ain't going unless there's girls there maybe girls like no they got cooties like if they know guys they ain't going to that there's got to be some guys there don't it's just a season that you're going through a season of your life this is something and the bible says to everything there's a season thank god for the word of god there's a time to be born and time to die i was thinking of this brother rem said this right through this room is coming color every color shirt dress whatever you got on is eternal laying right on records going around and around the world every time you bat your eye it's on record watch television will prove it then he says this amazing thing i want you to understand this is in 1935 before the technology ever got there remember we read psalms 139 god knows your down settings your uprising he knows everything about you now prophet is coming in 1965 before this technology ever got here he said when you were born god sets a record on he didn't know how to say sd card and cameras and infrared lighting that even takes it in the in the dark he said he just said god puts a record on he said it don't make he said put a record on and it doesn't make much noise after a while you know and and that's a little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things listen to me young people he starts saying things and doing things that he has to answer for and when and when that life ends he said that record or that tape is taken off he didn't understand sd cards are you sticking in some of you have trail cameras we do back home and you track the deer and there's turkeys and there's a coyote and there's my neighbor and there's and you just pull the sd card brother and say that's what your life is when you start god puts something in a record he just had record players and he had a tape he didn't know what to call the technology but he's describing he's illustrating something that he's seeing he said there's a record there's a and he said and so he he said after your life ends it's taken off it's laid up in the great library of god now some of you have like uh now they you know i have um removable hard drives and i have it and i have it in my bag i accidentally stuck it in there it's got everything for my company and everything our life and pictures and all that stuff is laying in that cart in that little but now you have it in the cloud most of you put your data from don't even know where your pictures are they're just up there and i'm one of those old school guys like okay it's up there but i'm going to back it up so i own it you know because how many people i know my friend they changed their apple password and they lost all you know 20 000 pictures of their kids through five years of their life so i'm like oh i want to own those we don't even know where that but we believe listen to me we believe it's there and the prophet of god is telling us look when you're born there's a record that's put on and god is recording everything that you wear your thoughts he said and now how are you going to get around it on judgment at the judgment bar when it's played right back you every move you made every thought that went through your mind so it behooves us as we have this little season maybe just at a little hour brother daniel's here preaching say lord you really are recording not only my actions everything i wore everything i said but not only that but my thoughts sometimes you go into mcdonald's and they have the thing they turn the volume down and they just have their words transcribed and that's the way your thoughts are brother said at the judgment you come in the great canopy of god and they're the people that saints will judge the earth and they bring them in and there's the great candle lord i never thought that i am i've been a good person everybody sit down for a minute hey get the get the card out of the rack they come over all i can relate it to is the sd cards and he puts it in the player i just and he plays it back just goes through there's that person there they are in church there they are and their thoughts are like oh it's a bunch of nonsense wish we were out here he's too hard to preach that's a bunch of i hate this place any judgment needed no depart from me you worker of iniquity you see how but aren't you so thankful that there's something in the bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all i love the word all all unrighteousness so there's going to be blank spots on the tapes of the redeemed because they confess those little spots and god wipes the tape out oh blessed be the name of jesus aren't you thankful for the blood of jesus christ amen so the prophet of god is telling us look those tapes are there but the bible says that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from those sins they line them up i think it was brother borders might have been brother perry green came to brother branham said brother branham do you see everything in those people's lives that come up brotherhood said you know if they've confessed and it's under the blood i can't even see it god can't show it to me because god doesn't even know about oh that ought to just make us get up and run around and say blessed be the name of the lord i'm going to confess my sins lord i want them to be cleansed and erased from that great amen that that great tape that god has on that day amen so many things here i don't know how to get through it all i don't want to get through at all because i've been trying to be better i try to get better try to get better i've been trying to preach shorter but i thought about mother's day you know they're the first one that holds you first one to love you we should never ever disrespect our mother she held us under her heart for nine months before you breathed your first breath she was watching what going down the stairs with her baby she didn't want to trip because she was protecting you as teenagers we should never get in a place the chemicals kick in our mind that we would ever dis disrespect mom your mom say amen preach brother daniel and lower your voice when you do it but let it sink into these teenagers you should always the bible says i tell young people to say if you want to be a christian the evidence is you believe the word of god in ephesians 6 1 says children obey your parents in the lord don't ever call yourself a christian if you don't obey mom and dad and then mom and dad it behooves us to not make ridiculous rules for our children at 20 years old that they got to be in bed at 8 o'clock at night the bible says provoke not your children to wrath and so we grow up together as a family you go through sicknesses and good times and bad times you go through them together that's what happens somebody goes through a season and then adolph no we go through those things together as a church sometimes we go through we go through it together iron sharpened with iron well brother daniel i don't agree with that oh don't just do that wait just stick around you'll understand a little bit just talk you know let's talk through this sometimes you're misunderstood i was thinking about that because the bible says the scripture was written by holy men of god were moved by the holy ghost and then i was reading in second peter chapter three it talks about holy women so if holy men of god can be moved by the holy ghost and write the bible can't holy women be moved by the holy ghost and write and then script and change i was reading that this morning brother ram said the first preacher that ever gets a child is mother said there's five gospels matthew mark luke john and a mother should be a spirit-filled woman who can teach her children and teach them to pray and to know about god and so forth he said it's too bad that moms don't care about their children today and tell them bible stories he said it's hard to get a preacher that'll do that let alone a mother and he said if mothers would take more time to talk to their children about god and to pray for them we would have less juvenile delinquency he said first of all it's parent delinquency before we get juvenile delinquency if it said if mothers would take their their place in the home in the bible and pray for their children and lead them to christ he goes on to say i was listening to message mother's day it's just a really short message you said a child would listen to its mother he said some little touch about that mother and that child will listen to and when it's hurt it'll go to mother for consolation before it'll go to father oh i know that's true i got three boys they fall down and skin their knees blood right now like come on wipe it off we got to get this done right no they go to mama or their aaron's laughing over there i never had daughters so i don't i don't understand a lot of that but i'm learning you know and god help us all but it's a mother and he goes on to say because she was the first with it you know and there's some gift that god gives to a mother it's a gift that a man doesn't have and the world they want to make gender neutral and make everything neutral and all the same and you can take your right hand your left hand they look the same but they're different god made a man and a woman he made him different he gave gifts to a woman that a man could never ever achieve it's a special gift he goes on to say mother's day he said it's a racket they made a lot of money and flowers out of it but mother's day should be every day every day not just hey i'll send mom some flowers no we're gonna say to do more to sit down and talk to her call her on the phone say mom i love you thank you for every whipping you gave me i remember the one day my brother was two years old and he climbed up the stairs me and my brother slammed the door and hit him and he rolled all the way down the stairs she took us in there and she lined us up she said pull your trousers down i'm gonna whip you i said dad doesn't do it like this she said but i'm doing it like this and she made a an effect on my life mom has an effect brotherham said they're little treasures that god has given you the responsibility of raising and i always said and made this kind of saying we know that written gospels matthew mark luke and john but there is a fifth gospel unwritten and that's mother she gets them before matthew mark luke and john's teaching gets him so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children for a kingdom of god i woke up really early this morning went to bed late and woke up around five something my friend had texted me a minister and he sent me this quote he said a good praying mother or wife can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on the platform a praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on the platform amen so there's something that you can do as a mom that the preacher can't do that the pastor can't do you can do it as a mom talking about seasons i just you know i was talking about sometimes brother perry green came here when he was 30 something years old and had a church and maybe many of you all went here and had him as a pastor and he thought this is going to be forever and now we realize that was just a season my friends grew up and brother branham was there and they said you know people believed him as god because you never had a problem whenever problem you had you just called brother branham and he prayed and your problem went away my father-in-law dallas you can hear it on the tape he run a stick through his ear he's squirrel hunt run a stick to his ear and bled a whole pillow of blood out in his ear he went to the doctor said your ear blends ear drums bursts so they called brother branham and brother branham just prayed said dallas your ears going to be all right he goes back to the doctor and his ear was completely here he healed his eardrum was healed he said we just our problems we just you know and we thought brother iran would be us forever and then they brother god took brother branham so that you would have faith will he find faith he delivered a message that all things are possible now you believe you pray you ask god and so i was thinking about that was just a season and sometimes you know we think about you know a season and and uh a time and you know we've talked about us being here for a time and a season and you know to bear one another's burdens and that's always been my burden is for the souls of people have one motive is that people would draw closer to jesus christ and i just you can see that my motive has been that that to draw people to closer to god or do whatever we can to draw people closer to god if we have a youth activity we come together and we read the bible and pray and conviction of the holy spirit and little nathan is there and in that conviction he gives his heart to the lord a few weeks later brother arnie baptizes him whatever we do is for the kingdom of god and i don't want to change my burden many churches are losing their identification they're changing their vision and it's about sports and activities and they build a a social club and a clan and they lose their original purpose of challenging people if they're ready to meet the lord jesus christ and not everybody wants a pastor and some people in this room maybe never had a pastor and i've said in the five-fold ministry people are changing the five-fold ministry to be apostle and prophet and evangelists and it was pastor and then teacher and they've changed the the p for pastor and they changed it to orator i want an orator i want to go to church once a week and i want somebody to deliver an oration to me and i want to leave and go home and so they think they have a pastor but they don't they have an orator and they're happy with the orator but a pastor is a shepherd like a father in the family paul talks about being a father in the gospel a shepherd of a soul to move a person from as they're on this journey to make it to a rapture so if we change that to an orator and we're just all together we're building a clan we're all coming together we feel good and say hey everybody's the bride and i get a better ship we're the bride we're the bride we're hallelujah we're the bride we're the bride and we all shout run the aisles we're the bride and then a real pastor says now wait a minute wait a minute you can say you're a brain surgeon but they have a whole if you say i want to go to school some of you have gone through nursing and you've done that and they they used to bring a whole set of books out now they probably said hey here's all the classes online but they stack a whole set of books down and they're this tall i say this this content is what makes you a brain surgeon you have to go through the books retain the information actually become the information and when you do that you're a brain surgeon so an orator just says we're the bride we're the bride i got all the quotes i got the message 12 minutes we're the bride but a pastor comes along and said look if you're the bride the bible says the bride made herself ready you have to go through the content become the content to be the bride is that fair to say so you can see how everybody wants an orator that just screams worth of bride as opposed to somebody says if you're a brain surgeon you'll go through the books become the content of the books remember john what is it 10 7 he took the book and gave it to john and he ate it the type of the bride it was sweet to his mouth i'm the bride but it was bitter in his belly it was bitter in his belly to say okay if you're the bride as young boy and girl getting married there's such a passion to be with the one they're going to marry they love him you write them a letter i want to open it i want to read it i want to what did he mean here what did he mean what i'm just so fascinated and then we have the bible and people don't even care about the word of god don't even care about being in the presence of god and in the church of god how can you be the bride and you love the world and the things of the world more than you love jesus christ so that's why we come to church and we check ourselves and there's a shepherd say are you really we say we're a brain surgeon but are you have you really gone through the books and become the books we say we're the bride but have we gone through the book and become the content of the book brother ram said this he said we he christ should be the principle theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our talks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principle theme of the bible and the bible's in us then he should be the principle theme of everything we do we say we think should be christ i know we get together we have kids we're cutting you all don't catch your grass you throw those rocks out there in the landscaping i love it i hate grass i hate weeds and see this grass and your landscaping just rocks and big rocks and little rocks and brown that's my kind of landscaping i like that and we all have those things in life and school and bills and troubles and that but the principle theme of all of that is jesus christ we all have to you know as the bible say we were reading it the other day in the bible i think it might be on ecclesiastes what comes to the animal comes to the human and that's right one dies and they all go to the grave but there's something greater than that we were made in the image of god we have a greater task than just raising children feeding them that's what animals do there's something greater than that as sons and daughters of god especially christians the world they just they show that their serpents see that's all they worry about is the animalistic but there's a christians made in the image of god they realize there is a purpose for them in life and we read it over there was the colossians on wednesday night how that he said that he wants to have a preeminence in a people he wants to be the primary thing of your thought now this isn't for everybody that's why this message isn't i can't see it i don't expect people to see it lot couldn't see what what abraham was saying but there was something abraham was up there was with the son of man ministry being revealed in his day and there's a people that are called to be the bride of christ i believe i'm going to believe that everyone in this room is called to be the bread of christ because something has drawn you here today the bible says no man can come except the father draws him and something knocked on your heart this morning and said get out of bed and go to church the bible says that that's not natural that's supernatural amen that god would deal with your heart amos and you'd obey your mama and you'd come to church and ride in a van and god would do something and amos says maybe he's like amos in the bible and he'll just be a a prophet of god he'd prophesy the coming of the lord and and each one of us i'm going to believe that god is dealing with our hearts and we're going through seasons each one of us going through seasons amen there's more here but we better save that for another service i'll turn that upside down 50 musicians will come that's the only way to get me to stop brother ram said this he preaches the message how can i overcome he said now i chose this because that i think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die and we're living in a time where they asked for the random brother and why can't i pray he said the revival is over and then the prophet of god said the way to overcome is keep the spirit of revival inside of you and if you've been camping and you burn it and it gets burnt down a little bit and the logs and it starts going out how do you create a revival brother david you just push those logs back together you push them together and it creates another revival and a great fire brother man says we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul said that he had to die daily that christ might live and he said we must never say must never must never we daniel andes you must never let the spirit of revival die within us amen i say lord don't let me let the spirit of revival die so if you see me crying and lifting my hands or running the aisles or doing something like what are you doing i'm trying to keep the revival inside me i'm trying to keep the spirit revived inside of me i know the spirit of the world is ladies and to just roll over and become cool and and so i'm keeping the the logs together as we'd say i'm keeping the believers together and it's the same with the holy ghost on the day of pentecost who was it was standing here was talking about i was somewhere and they were talking about little licks of fire coming down on the individuals and when they they went out and witnessed but when you come together that's what church is it revives you you push those holy spirits together now you have a bonfire of believers that come together that renew our strength how's the bible say they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they'll mount up with wings as an eagle amen may god help us let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord i've delivered what's been on my heart today father lord i have many many notes here but i pray god that you would just take the words that have been spoken the burden on my heart little experiences that i've been through with life godly mother godly father little stories lord and i pray that you would tuck them deep in our hearts or maybe there's a young person going through a season of their life they can't understand their life is changing their mind is changing their body is changing maybe someone else in the middle of their life and things are changing in their mind and their body i say brother daniel i understand what you're saying i i you're explaining to me what's happening in my life and in my mind maybe we're older lord and we're getting an ache and a pain and we go through a sickness and you heal us and maybe we don't come back as strong as we used to be father it's it's life father i pray you would strengthen us today you would help us lord we look at the scripture ecclesiastes chapter 3 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven

sh English English the peace of God be with you truly the peace of God be with you this morning my name is Mark I wrote a book about the life of Jesus Christ most books about a person end with their death but that's in chapter 15 my book goes on to chapter 16 and we're going to share that with you this morning now when the Sabbath was passed Saturday night after the sun had gone down Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and slom bought spices that they might come and anoint the body of Jesus very early in the morning on the first day of the week Sunday morning they came to the Tomb at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who will roll away the stone for us but when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away it was very large and entering the tomb they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed but he said to them do not be alarmed you see Jesus of Nazareth who is crucified he is risen he is not here see the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and Peter that he will go before you into Galilee there you will see him as he said to you so they went out quickly from the tomb for they trembled LED and were amazed they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven demons she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept and when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they didn't believe her after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the rest but they didn't believe them either later he appeared to the 11 as they sat at the table and he rebuked their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they did not believe those Witnesses who had seen him after he had risen and he then said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damn condemned and these signs that shall fall they believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink of any deadly thing they shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of the god and they went and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word through accompanying signs amen good morning God bless you rep God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive I feel him in my hands I feel him in my feet I feel him in my heart I feel him all over me God not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive God not de he is alive I feel him in my hand feel them in my feet feel them in my heart I feel them all over me

will heal him that's a serious need it's not too serious for the Lord and another request from Sister Salazar she's she was cleaning this week and she got something in her right eye and for the past four days she's been seeing uh with a film over it and it's scary because some of you know she already has a problem in her left eye and she relies on her good eye to do things that she'd need to do on an everyday basis if we could have the brothers come up to prepare for prayer this morning she relies on that good eye and so now this eye is is damaged and she's been having headaches and trouble driving and she doesn't want to have to go to the doctor or the or the ER she's asking God to heal her and restore her he can he's able he's done it before he'll do it again I believe that let's all

Sunday Daniel came up to me and and I know my son and he said uh he said hey Dad how's it going and that means I could care less how it's going but I got to tell you something so he says uh here here's the thing he says you know you were talking about um Taylor Swift in in uh last last Sunday sermon I said yeah he goes here's the thing dad he says he says you know that that um that place is it is a boba is that what it's called that place it's a it's a Boba place he said he says you know that place and and the owner a a Christian guy and I said yeah he says you know they have a car karaoke machine there and I said yeah he said dad last night I sang Two Taylor Swift songs like buddy and he said yeah dad he says and I was like well I said you know I probably wouldn't have said it if I would have known that that you were doing that but that was just the Lord and and when we do something if we make a mistake the best thing that we can do is to correct that mistake amen so d said but Dad while we were there he said that this owner he's a Vietnamese man he said he invited us to sing in his church and I said sing what no so so the actually our young people went to this Vietnamese Christian church and Daniel was taking videos while while they were um fellowshipping and they sang for this church and they blessed this church it was it was you all right the new the numer sisters were there and Daniel was there and I think a lot of them were there and it just blessed this this church to reach out like that so then they go there they went hiking yesterday and they they had the the youth together and they came here and practiced and then they went back last night to the Boba te place and Daniel took some videos when he was there our young people were there with that karaoke machine and they had the whole establishment up and praising the Lord and and dancing to the spirit of the Lord singing gospel songs I'm so proud of you all yes let's keep this going you know it's we've everything's been going so well and the Lord's been blessing us so much I what I want to say is Satan get out of the way because we just started we're coming and you better get out of the way what a what an exciting time that we live in and on this Resurrection on this wonderful day that happened 2,000 years ago when Jesus came out of the Tomb we have to understand what happened during this time and remember you can't have a resurrection without a death I mean you can't raise something from the dead if it's not dead right and you can't have a death brothers and sisters you can't have death without suffering so it's all part of this great plan and the best times in our lives brothers and sisters are not the good times are not the prosperous times the best times in our lives and many many of us can look back are the times that we were suffering let's turn to Isaiah chapter 53 now this was written 700 years before the prophecy came to pass in this Messiah this man named Jesus Christ Isaiah 53 verse number one says this who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should just desire him so he's saying he's just going to be an everyday young man not even particularly goodlooking maybe like Moses was or like Joseph was in the Bible this is an ordinary man he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he was and he made his grave with the Wicked the thieves on the cross and with the rich in his death Joseph of arthea because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth I wish I could have that testimony amen yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors what a prophecy that was wholly and fully fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ that came 700 years after the prophet Isaiah prophesied that a man of sorrow and grief and today we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus but last week was Palm Sunday the Bible says he rode into Jerusalem the most important city in the world rode in on a donkey and people were celebrating his arrival like David coming in to the city with the Ark on the shoulders of the Levites and David danced before it was a wonderful time that Jesus came they were they were taking off their garments and they were throwing them down in front of the donkey that Jesus rode on and and with the Palm leaves and singing hosana To The King King but that time fulfilled scripture but as far as Jesus's Ministry it was a very small almost very almost unimportant part if you and I were there we would think that this was my highlight of my life this was the greatest time that I've ever lived that when they finally recognized who I was but it wasn't with Jesus his time his greatest time was yet to come and it would happen within a week a week later after he rode in on Palm Sunday now when he came in it it it was a it was a good day and then during that week things gradually got worse and then it came to the real suffering the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Apostle Paul says this and he said unto me so Paul he couldn't see he had a thorn in his flesh his eyesight wasn't very good he may have been suffering from some sickness and he sought the Lord three times and the Lord said to him my grace is sufficient for thee my my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather GL glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong 1 Peter chap 5:10 says this but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect perfect establish you strengthen settle you Ecclesiastes 71 says this a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth I don't think when we read this and we we read of of the The Passion of Christ this this week that that Jesus went to I don't believe that the Lord wants us to suffer I don't think that's the point I don't think he he wants bad things to happen to us it's like if you know like going to going to my wife is like hey honey I got a $1,000 bonus today oh I'm sorry honey I'm I'm really sorry we we should we should lament that no good things are good things and he doesn't it doesn't say it's like hey uh hey honey remember that speeding ticket I got the other day our insurance went up 25% yes we're going to suffer for that one that's really good yeah the dog died this morning that's not that's not what he wants that's not what it's about but it's during those low times that God really speaks to us human nature brothers and sisters human nature requires suffering our nature gravitates towards sin and God uses the suffering that we have to perfect us even you go all the way back to the Book of Genesis and you look the first thing God says do whatever you want but don't do this one thing look at the nature of a human being goes directly to that one thing that he said not to do it's the nature of a human being to go towards sin and it's the good times when times are easier and we have we have memories maybe of having more money or or having a little bit better job or an easier time of life most of the time that that our lives don't make any changes we only make changes maybe for the worst in those times but the best times the good times are not associated brothers and sisters with positive change wow in fact the good times are the hardest times to change it's in the hard times that we make changes in our lives like the Rich Young Ruler things were going really good for this young man he had a lot of money everything was good he had a high standing in the church everyone respected him and he sees this man who people were calling the Messiah and a prophet and he sees this this he hears his teaching he says oh this man is great and he knew that this Jesus something about him was associated with eternal life so this Rich Young Ruler goes to the Lord he bowed bows down before him he pays him respect and he says what must I do to obtain eternal life and Jesus looked on him and loved him there was something about this young man Jesus saw he said you haven't suffered things are too good and he said sell everything that you have give it to the poor and then come follow me because this young man hadn't had any problems in his life there was no there wasn't that great character that was there so then he he goes and he the man was grieved and he couldn't do it he had a chance maybe to be a disciple we don't even know his name if he would have made the right choice yes he would have suffered yes there would have been problems s but instead the next time we see this young man he's in Hell lost his salvation and then on the other side there was a beggar named Lazarus that just had nothing in his life that was always struggling and we see that Lazarus when he died he went up right into the bosom of Abraham the Rich Young Ruler he died he went down to Hell we see which is more important the good times and the bad times I was talking with a uh a guy at the gym I've known for a while he's come to church here a couple times he's not he'd be fine with me telling the story he came up to me and I I said I said hey how you doing um and he said uh he said not so good I was like okay um here we go and uh he says you know he said I'm sick of it and I said what do you mean you're sick of it he says you know he says God always sends these women into my life and he said and I get attached to them and and and I I I give them I start talking with them they tell me their problems and I counsel them and he says then they just they then they leave me and I said I said really and I said that's God's fault and he says yeah he says why does he send them into my life if it's if it's not for me if it's just to make just to hurt me just to upset me and I said I said okay I said I knew the answer but I said and how old is this girl he says she's 25 and I said and how old are you 47 I said don't blame God for your bad decisions right we can look at these we can go through life and say oh just because God puts something something comes into my path that doesn't mean to take itow make a decision in your life so he's he's there he says he says what I do he says I talk to these people he says I spend my time and and they they tell me all their problems and I help them and I counsel them and and then he said finally they get they they they don't want to talk to me anymore and then then they just shun me I was like oh yeah takes all your time he goes yeah and I just give and give and give and give and God never gives me anything I was like listen man I've been sitting here for 30 minutes you just got a free counseling session from the pastor and I said what did I get out of this said write a check Tucson Tabernacle make an offering but it's all about me he was thinking about himself and when I told him I said listen I said you haven't gone far enough I said what you should do is you should say Lord if you never want me to have a wife I just want to be in your will if you never want me to have another job Lord just let me be in your will I will do everything that I can to serve you and work as hard as I can but if you don't want it Lord I want your will and I said you're not there yet and I believe this young man I believe young man he's almost my age is a child of God I really do and I think that his time is coming that he's going to have to make a decision he might be forced to make a decision I was talking with another young man's about Daniel's age found himself in jail been there for a little while and I went and visited him and I never met him before he's got a good family he's a good mom got a good brother he's he's he's he's got a good child and he just made bad decisions all through his life and finally this bad the last bad decision landed him in jail and now he's awaiting waiting sentencing and he he was talking to me and I was I was understanding what he was what he was doing and and and he said I said Do you believe God is in all this he goes I know he is he made the wrong decisions all the time until he got put in a jail cell and then he says now he goes he goes Pastor now all I have is time he says I think about the Lord all the time when I now that I'm here but before I was here he says I never thought about him and he says now I'm here and I don't have anywhere else to go and he says now I'm praying and I said brother this is the best time of your life it may seem hard this may seem like the hardest time but it's not it is when it is the hardest times in our lives that God finally can he's knocking all the time but it's the hard times that we finally listen there's a woman Matthew chapter 15 we call her a syap phenician woman she was her daughter was mentally ill her daughter had ma major major problems so she comes to the Lord Jesus let's read it Matthew 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed under the coast of Ty and siden and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and the disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us so this woman came to Jesus and he ignored her let me tell you she wasn't quite low enough she wasn't quite surrendered enough she wasn't quite at Rock Bottom there yet she was about as bad as it can get but there there was still a little bit more that she had to do all the pride maybe was not out of her yet it's a hard one to swallow but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel he looks at her he says look at you you're not even a believer you don't look like us you don't act like us you're not worth my time what would I have done if someone treated me like that it wasn't the case for this woman though her daughter was the most important thing then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me was she low enough yet but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs he's saying do you want to take my time you think my time is worth giving to a dog like you but her daughter is more important than her pride and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table she says Lord you are my master Lord You're my king I'm not worthy even to sit at this table but I'll take just a few crumbs that fall off then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so she had reached rock bottom but notice she didn't just sit there and not do anything and then when she came into a little resistance she didn't just say I will it must not be the Lord's will she didn't just say well I'm trusting that the Lord will heal my daughter it's a promise and I accept it brother sister I'm just going to hold fast to that that's not what she did that's the mistake that many of us make we get lazy we're not willing to give everything so that we can receive what we ask for so then God in his kindness and his compassion he will put on this hardship to us put us on our back and then finally he can get through to us and speak to us my children are here I'll tell you the hardest time in our lives with me and Stephanie was when our kids weren't serving the lord and we we would cry and we would pray and and and we we didn't know what to do crying out to God saying Lord I don't care what it is Lord I will I will give everything up I will give my job up I will give my Ministry up I will give it all up and Lord save my kids I don't care what it is wow Lord I am humbled Lord help us and they saved my kids and it was at the hardest time that really we get an answer back and and I remember praying it's like Lord we've homeschooled them we've never missed a service at church I've done everything I've known how to do to just walk this perfect line kept them from the neighbor kids protected them as far as who they hang out with and then I felt like Stephanie and I both got an answer was that my will God speaking or was that your will is that how you think this should be happen is that how you think or have you really surrendered your life have you really fallen down and ask the Lord Lord I don't care however you want to lead me we will follow and that's what these hard times that's what these troubles give us they give us a surrender that's what they gave to the lord it's in the lowest times in our lives that God really speaks to us and that's the time when we respond to him as I said he's always knocking but in the good times in our minds everything's going good that's not when we answer the hard times the worst times they're the greatest times we love hearing testimonies from people that that they go through a hard time time and and then they come out we love that because they went through it as I said you can't have a resurrection if you don't have a death and you can't have a death if you don't have suffering that's what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus comes down his disciples heaviness he knew what was going to happen he goes and he asks his friends he says can you just pray with me a little bit I didn't think it was that important he gets there and he gets on his knees and he ask the Lord the father remember he was a son he was the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he was real he knew how it was to suffer he knew knew how it was to feel Temptation he knew what we were going through and there he was with everything on him and he's praying and he's saying Lord let this cup pass from me but thy will be done you think well brother Daniel he uh he was the son of God he should have known he should have known what was prophesied about him he should have known his role in these things that's why maybe it wasn't so hard for him it was hard for him think about you I'm G to ask the church here something how many people here and I want you to raise your hand if this is true how many people here believe that Jesus Christ is their Savior and how many people here are Christians amen don't raise your hand on this next question so if you are really Christians the Bible says I believe is brother ly did you read Mark yeah brother Lyall read Mark at the end there and when Jesus is giving his disciples his people he says if you believe on me the works that I do shall you do also and then in mark 16 he said they shall cast out demons they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if that's the case then why do we fear when we get diagnosed with cancer wow why is that there anxiety there why do we fear if we're diagnosed with heart disease what says right here there's a prophecy right here for me and I just gra why shouldn't I just be healed well here's Jesus the same way and he's like he's like yeah I know I know what's prophesied of me but do you think the enemy wasn't there every every gun in hell was pointed at him you think that the enemy wasn't coming in saying maybe you got the prophecy wrong maybe maybe you're not this or or all of this this confusion comes in our mind if we don't have enough Faith to be healed how could we ever say that Jes Jesus knew he was the Messiah so it should have been easy for him it was not easy he knew how it was to suffer and then we worry about our kids like like I have like many of you have St John chapter 14 verse1 14 says ask anything Jesus speaking talking to us he says ask anything in my name and I'll do it yet we struggle we worry about our children it's a time of suffering but there's a time when you when you finally you get so low and you just cry out say Lord I don't care I just want your will I just want you I just want to be I just want to be what you want me to be I want to do what you want and there was Jesus in The Garden of the Gethsemane saying Lord whatever your will be done and then he gets up and here it comes the people to take him away they take him as you know to be tried and beaten all of his friends that night you know the ones that we rever so highly Peter and James and John they all ran away they all forsook him every want which fulfilled scripture and here's Peter and he just he just told him at the Last Supper Lord I will never forsake you I will never do it and and Jesus said you're going to do it three times before the next morning Peter you going to do it before the rooster craws and here's Peter and now the the Lord's taken away and they was surely thinking that he could save himself and somebody asked him do you know him and he was afraid he said no I don't even know the guy when this book when these gospels were written you notice one of the most beautiful things about the Bible is they record their mistakes wow they record their own failures and here read out of the Book of Luke and here's here's Jesus or here's here's Peter and he's probably telling Luke here's what happened that night I cut off the guy's ear I ran away from him and then I I forsook him three times they kept asking me I forsook him and then the last time not only when somebody asked me not only did I say I didn't know him I started cussing and then you know what happened there a far off Jesus looked over caught Peter's eye and Peter just was destroyed he started weeping and he he ran off crying the lowest time for Peter the lowest time for all of these people then Jesus is put up on the cross here he is stand up there nailed to the cross still this man he's still getting lower he didn't even reach the lowest yet and the disciples as I said they were giving their testimonies later maybe Luke was writing them down and Peter maybe said yeah I was one of the ones with with that was with Jesus oh you were the one one of the ones that stood a far off you were one of the ones that that were far away from him they didn't have enough courage to be with him yeah that was me it was a low time so there's Jesus up on the cross and there is a man that was crucified next to him that said Lord I'm mercy on me he tells the other one he says he doesn't deserve to be here you and I deserve to be here and Jesus said this day you will be with me in Paradise what was the greatest day in that thief in that criminal's life it was his lowest day wow it was the day that he was crucified it was the day that he was suffering that was his greatest day and it's our greatest times or when we're suffering because that is the time that we can speak to Jesus we were when Jesus died and he he got got to his lowest and it was his greatest achievement he conquered death Hell In The Grave right there he conquered all sin right there when he died who could say that I Lay My Life down many of us could say that brother Leo we can't say I take it up again that was reserved for one man one man with the power to do it how could somebody be dead for three days and then have still the power to take his own life to raise his own life up so here's Jesus he dies and all the disciples they they they they run away and and they're sad and and they don't know what to do and they had already forsaken him really the lowest the lowest point in their entire lives and then they start questioning he couldn't have been the Messiah I saw him die well yeah but didn't he say that he would raise again so easy easy for us to forget the promises of God we might not forget them like St John 14:14 ask anything in my name I'll do it but we just don't think that he's going to do it and here are these disciples struggling going through and and Jesus is put in the Tomb they the disciples go back and and and and they're don't know what to do they're afraid Saturday was a a very very difficult day let's let's read Luke 23 I want to read about that man that was on the cross verse we'll start with verse 42 for time sake and he said unto Jesus Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour of the day and there was Darkness all over the Earth until the N 9th hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and when Jesus cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I Comm in my spirit and having thus said he gave up the ghost so when Jesus died over in the temple there was a curtain and this curtain inside the temple was in this area that only the high priest could go one time a year and then that high priest when he went in there he would make a sacrifice and atone for the sins of the people and then the presence of God would come in to that area into that holiest of holies was covered with a curtain thick heavy curtain and when Jesus died on the cross that curtain was ripped from the top to the bottom top to the bottom if you would have if it would have RI ripped from the bottom to the top any of us could grabbed it and maybe ripped it but it was God that broke that curtain think about that curtain how long was that curtain in the temple we don't know it could have been new it could have been there a year it could have been there for a hundred years we don't know how long that curtain was covering that holiest of holies but that curtain the greatest day of that curtain's life was when it was ripped in wow and it's the greatest day of our life when we are ripped into and we finally surrender to the Lord Jesus then after Jesus had died Joseph Vera got his body and he wrapped it and another man that came to Jesus by night this guy Nicodemus he uh didn't really want everybody to see he was a he was a a priest he didn't want everybody want to see was associated with Jesus but he came with Joseph of arthea because he Joseph couldn't have done it by himself so he takes this body and they wrap it up and I think probably the sisters were watching and I'm like yeah maybe they didn't do such a good job when they wrapped up Jesus so when they saw that then the sisters that same day on Friday remember the the Sabbath starts at sundown they went and they got a bunch of ointment and spices and they got it together and then they were going to go on the first day of the week and they were going to do it again they were going to embalm this Jesus with the spices so he's put in the grave he's there all day Saturday and then on Sunday morning as you saw the play The Sisters go to the tomb and and he's not there they go and tell the disciples Peter and John they run back and they they look in they look in there and he's they like he's gone he's not there Mary Magdalene was probably saying Hey listen he is risen the Bible says it was like idle Tales to them like what he's risen it's like guys he said he was GNA rise Mary believed it but so these brothers are like I just I can't I can't I can't really like digest all of this they were down Luke chap 2 24 verse 13 so while those disciples were talking about things a couple of them a couple of followers of Jesus they go on the road and they're walking to EMAs this town that's right really close there to Jerusalem and behold two of them went that same day to a village called theas which is from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden they shouldn't that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was Copus answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou Hast not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and the word before and mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and the rulers they delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done we thought he was Messiah but we were wrong he wasn't because he died yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the supplier so this morning these sisters were up there and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and a certain and certain of them which were with us went to the supplier and found it even as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken he said you don't remember what he said you don't remember the promises that he gave gave ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and then the spirit started to build they started to hear the word of God and they started to apply it to their lives ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh to the village where whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us like wow this guy is awesome he's special they didn't recognize him yet for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tr with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and they eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures at the lowest point in these brothers lives they were wrong we thought he was Christ we thought he was Messiah we thought he was all these great things we saw do these Miracles maybe he was just a prophet maybe he was just a good man maybe he was just maybe we were all wrong about this no Copus you weren't wrong he promised these things you just had to get really low before God could really speak to you then Jesus said he told his disciples he made a very strange statement he said take up your cross and follow me these things that I've suffered now you suffer them if you stand for me you're going to be hated so when we get down when we get low and it seems like things are just going so wrong no that's the time that God speaks and it's sad it's sad that the only time that he can speak in a human being's life is when he is so low that he just completely has nowhere else to go there was another guy I was witnessing to and he just wouldn't I was he's like oh you're you're you're wonderful and you're great and and I love all of this and and everything that you've said me it's it's such a blessing told me it's such a blessing from the Lord and and all and everything's just so good and then when he got what he needed I haven't talked to him since he just left just lip service he wasn't low enough but when you get so low that you have nowhere else to go then everything changes imagine that thief on the cross his worst day in his life life was his greatest literally it was greater than the day he was born as the proverb said that torn Veil the greatest day in that curtain was the day that it was ripped in half and torn up what was Jesus's greatest day wasn't Palm Sunday when everyone was singing his praises and everything was good it was when he bowed his head he said father into thy hands I commit my spirit the greatest day is my greatest day because that's the day that all my sins wiped away there was a a young brother that uh he's a good friend I haven't talked with him in a while but he's he's a good friend wasn't living for the Lord he was 20 in his 20s and he's just drinking partying doing what kids do sometimes and and he was just going down the wrong road and had this this girlfriend and and they were just there there wasn't there wasn't much to them but he got invited to a youth meeting and in this youth meeting the Lord started dealing with the young man and they were up at the altar and they were they were worshiping brother Josiah the musicians can make your way up they were they were worshiping and and he felt there was a call that was something was pulling on him and he was he didn't have a job he he was like I said he was he was doing drugs and and drinking and everything was just really bad in his life but there was something pulling on this young man came to the Altar and he was praying all the young people were up there and they were all weeping and and he was just just just everything was coming out and he was repenting and and he was crying on his sleeve of his suit of his new suit that he had bought and he kept wiping himself and and and praying and something inside of him said raise your hand up to the Lord and he looked down at his sleeve and there was snot and everything all over his sleeve he says I can't raise my hand I'm embarrassed everybody will see what's what's on on this he kept praying and something said raise your hand doesn't matter what everybody thinks of you he raised his hand and the Holy Spirit came down and filled the young man changed his life and he never went back from that point and then he went and led that young lady to the Lord now they're married have a beautiful family he was influencer on my son Daniel and his guitar he's a really great guy that a lot of the kids would look up to and he he when he changed then he was able to give something back to the youth he helped my son [Music] that day at the altar when he was as low as he could be then he was able to make a choice that was the best day for him this man that's this young man that's in jail right now let me tell you this is his greatest day he's in the he's in the cell right now what is he thinking about he's probably thinking about a resurrected Lord Jesus he's probably thinking about our conversation from a couple days ago where I told this is your greatest day this is the day that God's going to deal with you so why is Easter important to us why is the crucifixion important when Jesus said take up your cross look what I have done as a sister saying now you go do the same brothers and sisters none of us we have problems those problems are a blessing but none of us has stooped as low or hit as Rock Bottom as Jesus Christ did he knows what we go through if it's a child if it's a [Music] job if it's an attitude if it's a religion if it's a denomination if it's a judgmental Spirit he's he humbled me he humbled my wife with my kids to the point where we said Lord I don't care I don't care what it is I need you God I need [Music] you we need him but he went through it he suffered and he died so that we might live please brothers and sisters if things are going good if you think everything's okay fall down on your knees and thank God for his goodness and surrender your life to him as I said it might be sin but sin comes in many many different forms sin very very plainly comes in self-righteousness s sin very very often comes in judgmental [Music] ways [Music] brother in Christ alone my hope is found he is my life my strength my song this [Music] Cornerstone this Solid Ground firm through the fiercest drought and storm what Heights of love what depths of Peace when fears are still when striving cease my comforter My All In All here in the love of Christ I Stand think about these words in Christ alone who took on flesh amen the fullness of God in heless Fai this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to save till on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was a here in the death of Christ I live Brothers and Sisters Let's worship God now just just let aside everything that's in your life amen let go any type of any type of feelings that you have let go any type of of of thoughts and and ideas about how he should be and just say Lord I surrender to you let this Easter be a time that things change let it be a time that changes in our families let it be a time that changes in us don't forsake Him don't leave him there were two thieves on the cross two of them one on one side one on the other one of them could not do it the other one all he had to do was surrender and say I was wrong I've been a sinner my whole life and I I am ready to give my life to Jesus Christ brothers and sisters not just to go to heaven but because he is worthy he died he went through all of that if for no one else he went through it for me Daniel Evans he went through this for and I will love him for my whole life because he did it and I will preach him and I will lift him up I will give him my life and it's him and him alone any Minister that's worth anything will point to Jesus Christ and this Easter brothers and sisters if there is something in your life that you want to get rid of if there is if there is a dedication that that you want to make and you are welcome to come here at this Altar and make that choice and I would suggest that you do it if you haven't done it Jesus Christ is alive the Easter not only celebrates his resurrection but Easter celebrates his suffering and his death and he did it for me and he did it for you now the least that we can do is give him our lives let's all [Music] stand there in the ground his body lay Light of the World by Darkness slain then bursting forth in glorious St up from the grave he rose again and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine brought from the precious blood and as he stands and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine I'm bought with the precious blood of Christ no guilt in life no fear in death this is the power of Christ in me from life's first cry to find no breath I know Jesus commence my destiny no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ no power of hell no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Stand I would suggest that if you don't know Jesus Christ in the way that you should know him I would suggest that you don't leave this building today until you meet him until you call out to him until and he answers brothers and sisters let me tell you there's Spirits all in this building right now there's the Holy Spirit and there's the spirit of the enemy and it's all working and the enemy spirit is so deceiving he's far beyond us but it's only through the power of the holy spirit that we can overcome him so please if you need prayer come down for [Music]
