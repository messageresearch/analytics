my family from my uh uh church back home and the ministry amen and the Saints in India especially from my dad and my mom they send their love and respects the greetings to each one of you greetings from the orphans and the old age and the lepers and we would like to say thank you for all your love uh the burden and the great sacrifice you people are doing Amen to stand behind the ministry and to support it we are thankful to you and we appreciate each one of you for the for the great sacrifice amen I believe my words are not enough to thank you all but what can we give to you for what you have done but brother sister I stand in the presence of the Lord and I say you people your sins are in our hearts and in our prayers and I pray that God uh has kept a great reward for each one of you for the sacrifice you have made am there's a crown waiting for you God bless each one of you appreciate uh and love you um the book of Ephesians chapter 2 I would like to read uh two verses from there and maybe we can go from verse one later on but uh verse 8 and N uh very simple scripture but you I know you all are familiar with it uh we're say for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast amen may God bless the reading of his word thank you very much you all may be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord and uh it's such a blessing uh to uh stand before you Saints and uh I count it as a great privilege I thank the Lord for his grace upon my life that he made it possible that I could come and visit your Saints and stand before you share the word of God what God has laid on my heart I would like to thank uh uh Pastor Samuel Dale and the family brother Wade and each one of you for giving me this opportunity that I could come and share the word of God I would like to thank each one of you and uh if you want a title uh for today this morning uh on the basis of the scriptures what we have read and I would title like this Undisputed value of Faith amen now the faith we are talking about it is the faith of God we are talking about the faith which God has given us by his grace and the Bible tells us that uh the faith which is given to us God has given us by measure and the proportion uh so we each one have faith in our lives and uh we cannot deny that we don't have faith because the Bible says we have received Faith from God and he has given us by measure and by proportion right amen amen but what we have to do is we need to exercise our faith and uh uh asking God for his help so that our faith will be increased Glory like our Prophet taught us that we could pray for every thing or anything that's in the world but he said the greatest prayer you can pray to to uh plead him Lord increased my faith right you know and and uh faith has got a tremendous value I would like to uh just read something for you if you don't mind and uh you know uh someone uh would say what good would it uh do to have faith and and the prophet of God God makes a statement he said faith can sign my pardon sure there's value in faith glory and that's where I got my thought Undisputed value of Faith now you can dispute about anything that's in the world you can dispute about the structure of the building the value of the building you can dispute uh on the measurements of the building or the area of the building you know you can you can about anything you want to you know you can have a dispute about a property a piece of ground and you can you can dispute uh whatever opinion you got and uh you you can take anything that's in the world and and you can dispute it you can you can argue with it you can you can give your opinion you can you can give your negatives you can give your positives you can give your best of your opinions you can give the worst opinions you know you can dispute with any anything that's in the world but brother sister we are talking about something that cannot be disputed it is an Undisputed value that faith has God and brother sister this Faith you know uh the as the prophet of God has taught us that it can sign our pardon and not only the prophet of God but before the prophet of God came into the scene the Bible is already being written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost amen and if you if you can and say Amen to the word of God that will really bless your heart brother sister you know this word of God is given by inspiration for our betterment for our blessings for our you know edifying uh edification of our spiritual life and and and Paul speaks to the to the church in Ephesians here and he speaks to the people who are saved he's talking to Christians he's not talking here to the unbelievers he talking to the people who have already known Christ and they knew the power of the Deliverance they knew the power of the Holy Ghost they knew what God has done in their lives they have experienced they have tasted God in their lives what God has done uh who is rich in Mercy and think about this brother sister and the Bible you know the the very first words it says he said and you have quaken who were dead in trespasses and sin sir you know when we when we think about our natural birth when we look about our natural uh Instinct in in life you know we are no good there is nothing good there is no righteousness in us there is no goodness in us there is there is there was nothing that God could see and and you know you know uh feel good about us because the Bible says we were brought and brought up and we were shaved in sin and we were shaved in and we came into this world speaking lives but thank God before the world was ever founded or put foundation To The World God knew us and that makes him a infinite God that makes him almighty God that makes him a powerful God that makes him as a alls sufficient God are you with me brothers and sisters that makes him a wonderful savior but you know when we come into this world we come with the natural desire of our of our father and mother we were born in sin we were shaped in an equity but he knew us because he chosen us he knew us before the foundation of the world I'm so grateful and thankful to God and that's the reason we have come to our place that's the reason we have come to our position where we can say yes Lord I believe in you I trust in you because the faith he has given to me and that faith has helped me to believe that there is only one God there is no other now you know in America or the Western world has has only known about a God and and and and and the and the God name is is Lord Jesus Christ now you you have Catholics in this country you got all kinds of uh Christian uh different Christian churches in America in England in the Western and the European world but I come from a country which has got 33 Millions gods and goddess can you imagine brother sister you have only about one God but I heard about God who are 33 Millions gods and goddesses you can point out that is their God right right now you know this is on the internet this service is on the internet right and and you know I've got enough sense what I'm talking about today because there may be some people in India you know listening to this message what I'm saying but you know this is the very truth that I come from a country which has got 33 Millions gods and goddesses but think about the faith I'm talking about today think about the grace that I have received in my heart today think about the mercies of the Living God that God has opened eyes and my understanding to see that there's only one God only one true Living God and I was dead in sin and in trespasses but thank God when I was dead when I was dirty when I was you know there was nothing good in me that God could look look upon but yet he loved me yet he he showed me his love yet he showed me his grace he showed me his mercy and he quickened me amen hallelujah he quickened me to live he quickened me to eternal life he quickened me to see the the depth of God's love for my life hallelujah amen it says when in time pass he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of R even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love right we cannot measure his love right we we cannot know the depth of his love if I know the depth of the love of God I know only in the portion in the in the in the uh little portion of it but you know I have never known what is the depth but you know thank God that he has opened our eyes to see his great love Glory which we cannot measure which we which our minds cannot fathom Hallelujah where with he loved us oh what a love that is brother and sister if you are loving our Lord Jesus Christ tonight it's nothing great in us we love him because he loved us hallelujah because he first loved us we are loving him today sometimes we think that we are doing a favor to God by coming to church sometimes we think we doing favor to God when we walk according to his word of God you know sometimes we think we do favor to God when we do good things you know we we think we are doing a favor to God when we put our offering but brother sister when you use the electric you have to pay the bill when you use the use the water you have to pay the water bill and you using his oxygen just think about it if the if the payment is not paid and if they cut out your gas or your electricity you have no stuff to cook you may say Brother Sam we have got wood to cook yeah well if the wood gets so then what right that's right you know being traveling in different places he said save the forest save the forest that shows the forest is you know people are cutting lot of wood you know and and and and wildfires you know and and they have a sign that say you can you can stop wildf fires so there are a lot of things happening brother sister but just think about it you know we think that we are doing a favor to God by coming to the church but remember we are just doing it because we love him it's it's not a compulsion no nothing is compulsory now God is a gentleman the Bible says right he doesn't pushes anybody exactly he puts you know in front of you life and death you choose life you have chosen the right if you choose that it's up to you there are two roads one is the toll has been paid but if you don't want to take that road which is the the toll has been paid then you have to keep on paying from your pocket because you chose the road right exactly you know so so we need to be careful in what we're doing what we're saying but brother sister we are talking about faith and you know that has got a great value right a tremendous value for the faith right amen just I want you to to to uh you know follow my thought little bit and and and the Bible I want to go a little further it says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quaken us together with Christ by Grace he are saved only by the grace of God we are saved I am saved you are saved it's the same Grace and brother sister when that cap Stone comes down amen when that headstone comes down it will be only Grace and nothing else Hallelujah the Bible says it will be only Grace if you are getting ready yourself and you're believing it's just the grace that you will be in the Rapture it will take the grace of God it will take your faith it will take my faith in the word of God to be in the lure amen amen nothing else exactly so we we have thankful to God for his grace today amen amen he said by Grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we are sitting now in the Heavenly places he has raised us from that pit of sin he has raised us from the mighty clay amen and he has you know put us in the in the Heavenly places and which we are ever grateful to God amen amen right that in the ages to come he might show us the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards kindness towards us toward us through Christ Jesus I thank God for this scripture that's been fulfilled in our day amen that the great mysteries of God has been come open exctly amen thank God that the book was taken right amen thank God that the book was opened by the lamb that's right it was not opened by any man right no man was worthy no in heaven amen on the earth beneath the Earth whatever whever there was no one worthy not even to look into it not even to touch it not even to open it but thank God there was somebody who was kinman to us who was a kinman you know relative to us a blood relative to us hallelujah oh brother he came and you know he took that book and that wiped out tears from the eyes of John and he began to scream he began to shout and he began to worship right when he began to worship the whole Heaven heard it the whole earth heard it amen how about our worship today amen that's right I believe whether he crosses this ceiling or not I don't know but when we see ourselves Redeemed by the by the blood of the Lamb sir amen that's right oh yesterday we had that wonderful time right Plan of Redemption how God redeemed his bride how God will redeem his 144,000 people in Israel how wonderful is to see the Plan of Redemption and brother sister when we see that we are redeemed and when we see our name when I see my name I cannot hold my peace I cannot keep quiet I cannot just my hands and sit out and canot shut up my mouth brother sister when I see my name I will scream like Jun whether people like it or not whether people agree with it or not whether people love it or not brother I will scream because I am redeemed I am free than you Lord I am free yes sir praise God I am free amen and I'm not in the boundage and what made me free what saved me is just the grace of God and my faith in that Grace amen just think about it a tremendous importance and value God has kept in that Faith right that's why we need Faith yes sir by faith we are saved and by faith we stay saved right amen I'm sorry English is the language I learned but I hope you understand what I'm saying good yes by faith we are saved yes and we Stay Saved By Faith amen if you want to be saved you need to keep your faith alive right amen exactly that's the TR we cannot have faith on Sunday and no faith on Monday amen exactly yes sir you know we will have faith on Wednesday and no faith on Thursday that is not going to work amen we need to have faith every minute every second in our life brother we as our brother was quoting I was listening in the office he said we are living in such a bad time if you say we are living in a bad time which I do agree with you and I know if you're living in the bad time then we need a good faith we need a Divine Faith Of God every moment in this bad time now Faith is such a thing faith is such a a wonderful blessing God God has given into our hands in our lives and that Faith Can you know change that faith can bring Wonders that Faith Can you know change and face any situation it want that's correct only faith can do that and that's the reason Paul writes in catian chap 1 from verse 21 to 233 he says and you know and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked words yet now had he reconciled right we are reconciled people yes sir we are one with Christ amen we believe in his word we believe we are his children right you know we are walking in his ways praise the Lord and verse 22 he says in the blood in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable and unreprovable in his sight that's right there are three things here he wants you to PR be present to him and he did it by the death of his flesh he a presently holy unblamable right and repr provable in his side amen now if there is anybody's going to judge us it's going to be him right amen if anything you know if we are judged by we are going to be judged by him right through him through his word so he wants to see us when it comes to get us you know and take us home he wants to see us holy right because our God is Holy amen yes sir and no Unholy person can stand before him no Unholy thing can stand before him only the thing which is holy right because our God is Holy you tell brother Tam is there any other way there is no other way he's a holy God Amen he is a jealous God yes sir oh he's a consuming fire Glory oh brother sister that's the you know God is love that's only one side of God but the other side is a jealous God he's a holy God he loves Sinners but not the sins he hates sin Hallelujah he hates sin yes sir but he loves The Sinner that's the great part of my God that is the greatness of my God hallelujah he wants to present you holy right unblameable unre provable if we continue in faith that's right brother that's what we need to do today sir we need to continue in faith not only continue in faith but grounded and settled amen and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel amen right right think about it brother sister yes sir many people they are degrading the word of God many people they don't want even the Bibles in their hands anymore they think the word of God is is a history today you know they only say oh we got the message you know the message is the absolute I believe the message is the absolute but where did the message come if there was no Bible if there was no Bible how the message would come to us brother the message came from the Bible the message is the Bible because of the Bible the message is in our hands Hallelujah thank you Lord right yes we need to give great regard and great respect to the word of Goden and brother sister nothing can take this place nothing can you know of course I know let C you cannot put the word of God in the pages of this book you know and and boast about it but you know the prophet of God said you need to take the word of God from all the pages and bring it into our and the Holy Ghost will take it water it and it will you know grow it will bring the produce the word will come into action amen but we cannot in no way degrade the word of God right yes sir that's what Paul says y we must be you know continuing in faith grounded and settled right and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which is the word of God this word gives us a right up amen there's no book in this world like this book that's right amen amen there are millions and trillions of books y hundreds of millions of books are written all over the world right mhm with different titles and different you know names of the book of different topics or subject whatever you call you know but a person begin to read a book he can close the book you know what he may give his opinion said oh my you know this author might should have put this thing in different way like this or he might have wrote like this he might have wrote like this but brother sister you know about this author about this book there is no man that was born in this world there will be no man that will be born in this world that could come and say oh this word might have written like this or this should have been written like this because this is the word amen this word yes sir is alive today and if you ask me where is that word alive it's in us it's in me and the word of God is Not only alive but it is in continuity amen I thank God for his grace amen amen that this word has given us the Hope y hope for our healer right right hope that will never put us to s I hope that we will be the leure I hope that no book can give that's right oh the very word bible if you can just look into it I got two arations Believers instruction before leaving Earth yeah B yeah Believers instruction before leaving Earth there is another approvation I have known he said behold I bring life eternal amly amen they say what my Bible amen right and this gives me great hope yes sir behold I bring life eternal every person that wants eternal life has to come to this word of God this book yes sir oh brother sister we got some beautiful beautiful books in India called Ram mahab back yeah these are the holy books of the religion the Buddhist have got books oh yeah the Muslims Muslim Brothers have got books sure sure every religion has got book right but no book says like this book says no book said behold I bring eternal life no book said you know give instruction to the Believers how to live the life in this world and get into the no book tells that but I thank God for this book right right it gives me eternal life amen oh my brothers my sister just think about it this book gives us hope this gospel gives us hope which you have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven let of our Paul and Minister amen that's why we believe in this word yes sir that's why we put our trust in the word of God Amen that's why we walk by faith in the word and not by sight right amen the faith which we have right helps us to walk y right exactly it helps us to walk in the deepest valley right the darkest Valley it helps us to have strength yes sir yeah it helps us to Have Courage yeah I would like you to just you know follow a little bit with me the book of Hebrews 10: 22 and 23 says let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith right what gives us Assurance the gospel amen the word of Goden this gives us a full assurance and the and and the Apostle Paul says let us draw near with the True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with the pure water amen then he says let us hold fast the preparation of our faith right yeah let us hold fast to what we have confessed profession is confession of our faith without wavering right amen the Bible is asking us not to wav right now there are two reasons we should not waver right the Book of James chap 1 verse 6 and 7 it says ver six but let him ask in faith right not nothing wavering exactly for he that Werth is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and TOS right right y the Bible is asking us not to we right right he wants us to be grounded and settled in faith amen right and we need to continue there on right it's not one day one week it's every moment of our life we need to continue in faith no matter what situation comes no matter what sickness we have no matter what the doctors are saying no matter what the people are saying no matter what the other churches are saying we need to just keep on continuing and grounded and without wa we need to be settled in faith he says he says but let him ask in faith nothing waving for he that is like a way of the sea driven with the wind and TS power let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord right you cannot even imagine if your faith is wavering come on if your faith is shaken yeah whether God can do this do that right is it possible the doctors has said you will die yeah you know there is no hope the Medical Science has done its best and there is no hope but I am a Christian I am a believer can do anything to me yes he already spoken in his word by his tribes you are healed now that's his word if he says by his Tripes you are healed you are healed if you say I'm not healed I have the problem it's because you're lacking fath right exactly amen right amen come on think about it my brothers my sisters amen that's the first thing if you were you will be driven with the wind and passed up and down right exactly we cannot be in that position and think that God will answer our prayer now the second reason second reason that we should not waver in our faith Hebrews 11:39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect can you see the second reason we have got something better than all those people that's right yes sir right yes sir on and I could say we got the best things that the whole history of mankind we got the best thing what they yes sir you canar it and see yeah now we you know brother says I preach only what Paul preached amen The Book of Revelation was written by Apostle John bless bless Hallelujah and imagine you just saw in some he just saw you know amen and he knew nothing about it now the apostles the children Disciples of Jesus Christ they had a name he said these are the on who turned the world upside down right exactly and they didn't know nothing about what we know today can you imagine brother there's one sitting on the throne yeah there is one sitting on the throne and there are 24 seats which are the 12 patri of the Old Testament and the 12 disciples of the new testament which makes 24 24 is 12 and 12 24 right so there are 24 Elders yeah there's one sitting on the throne but where are you sitting right yeah come on brother amen where are you sitting Glory you are sitting on the throne am we are the queen of Jesus Christ but those 24 were actually you know Taken part to WR to write this book that's correct amen right y few of them were there who wrote this book right right under the anointing under the inspiration of the same holy ghost that we have today but they have not in opposition come on that's right amen EXA they wrote this book so that we could believe we could read this book we can study this book we can medicate on this book day and night and have a fruitful life Glory right and sit on the throne and poor guys poor guys they have their little seats around the and you will be sitting before them I will be sitting before them in the throne on the things they wrote right by believing those things that's right and we are all of them right come on Amen yes sir think about Peter yeah actually he was the one to open the door of Heaven he said whatever you lose I lose in heaven whatever you bind I bind in am he's the key man y That's he's got the authority yep he's the key man and he got the authority and he begin to unloose Y the doors of Heaven that we could go in and set on the throne he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what he was doing he was unlocking the door of Heaven amen well he came into the heaven come on but that very thing has brought us to the throne right which he spake and which he wrote Glory come on can you imagine Brother s that's right can you imagine the book of Acts written by Dr Luke yeah and the prophet said we have the continuation of book of Acts right the word of God is alive in the bright Jesus Christ and we are in continuation of the book of Acts can you imagine Dr R Luke writing this you know book of Acts yeah and we are reading it and believing it and putting the same word into action but this book is not written by drct L this book is not written by Brother Samuel K this book is not written by Brother Samuel de this book is written by the spirit of the Living God we are that book amen now we don't only not only believe this word but this word is in action on because we believe this word that's right oh how wonderful he is hallelujah we should not waver in our faith right we know faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right that's okay right faith has no problems no it doesn't need no evidence exactly Glory brother we just believed in the Lord Jesus Christ he said let not your heart be troubled we we said Thank you Lord for your word our heart is stable now right right we have confidence by your word amen right and we have never seen Heaven Come on but we believe there is a heaven we never know what is eternal life but we got the the the the uh what do you call the earnest earnest we got the earnest of of the eternal life we got the earnest of the healing we got the earnest of the Resurrection we got the earnest of that eternal life brother sister just think about it we are just having the earnest what it will be when we enter into the it will just take the faith of of you and me right in the word of God come on if you can just believe the word it says faith is a substance of things hoped for right amen if you need something just ask him right exactly just ask him you don't get it today the problem with us is we pray in the morning in the afternoon we want it yeah we pray in the morning we want it somewhere in the night some right but remember our watches doesn't work like his that's the problem that's right but God has given us enough faith enough you know he has taught us to wait right and we can wait upon his word right and waiting gives you the renewing of your strength renewing of your faith renewing of your ability amen when you keep trusting in the Lord the prophet said when you are praying for sickness and you still see the subtance you just keep on praising God you keep on praising God until it Le thank you Lord I have a personal testimony to to tell you my brothers my sister in the month of May I was badly you know in pain on my left hip you don't imagine the pain I had yeah I couldn't just get up from my bed on 3 weeks brother you don't believe I didn't go to church I couldn't stand I couldn't sit I couldn't preach I had to go to the physician the the the bone doctor orthopedic and I I I said sir I have a problem I just cannot do anything so he examined he wrote a lot of things and you know he spoke to me and he gave me treatment and medicines and write a prescription and all kinds of things but then he made me to sit down and he said you know what the only problem is you're overweight yeah they said your hypertension your back pain whatever problems you have they said you're overweight if you can do something to get your weight cut off this thing will leave you I said I will do it sir and I've been trying right that's right when I look at the deserts you got or ice creams and cheesecakes strawberry pies and apple pies a chocolate cake and chocolate pie I can hardly stand right every time I stand there I say Lord have mercy but I'm trying to do amen do my best but brother sister you know what God he [Applause] now I'm having trouble with the right side yeah it's about a month and a half oh brother yesterday night I was coming to the church from Brother Ban's house and and immediately I sat in the in the car with him you know I felt somebody was you know poking KN behind my right hip oh yeah and I just just sh up like this in the car I said Lord I Thank you for healing me Lord I Thank you for healing me I rebuke this pain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the time I came to the church the pain left it doesn't come it haven't come yet right if it comes I am going to do the same thing every time it comes I'm doing the same thing why I'm saying is you need to exercise your faith and every time the devil brings some things to you do the same thing keep praising God keep thanking for his healing think about it worry doesn't hasn't got one bit of value to it at all right in the message testimony Chicago Illinois 53 paragraph 71 he says wor hasn't got one bit of value to it at all so why you worrying worry that's right amen just what would wor do any good right exactly right amen change that's the prophet prophet's word right the Bible says you ask it in my name my father will give it when he said he will give it he means a friend he's not a Wishy Wasing God no he's not like me if I say something today and change my word tomorrow tomorrow Heaven Earth will pass away but not his word if he said he will give it he will give it but he has his own time right right amen he works according to his own watch not our watch right amen amen he said why would you worry and the worry do any good yeah he said but Faith does do good right so have faith amen Luke 12 verse 25 I would like to quote and he said and which of you with taking thought can add to his sture one cubid which is 18 in yeah verse 26 if he thou be not able to do the thing which is least why take it thought for the rest y why do you think why do you worry yeah that's worry has got no value no right amen what is the value 0% right yeah what you have to do exercise your faith amen the prophet of God in the message faith in action speaking about Noah and his day and its message yeah the prophet G said that he built Ark on the word of God right for the saving of his family he kept on building he had many critics oh yeah lot of critics that's right his SS are much more you know higher level than what we got right you talk about the pyramids being built right the prophet of God said there is no machine that can take that Big Stone today and place it in such a way that has been already placed right he said there's no machine in this present world right I was just talking about the the the the technology the other day you think about the cars you know 50 years back their body was built by 18 or 20 mm gate the body was Heavy tough rather you punch it it will break your bones in your in your that was Heavy strong but you know the science begin to grow the technology begin to grow the more technology it was growing the more better they were coming with sign the more lighter they made today you can take your hand and punch your car it will have a big right dance thank you it will have a big dent why because they're thinking about the marriage they wanted to make the body light and the engine powerful and that's why people are killed so easily right exactly because the car is not built stronger right am that's how about our technology right now what about no's technology right yeah what was the time you know when when they built pyramids right what kind of Technology he said even the razor could not pass through between the stones what kind of Technology it was right right think about it my brothers myself exactly right and he says in spite of all those critics against him he said he just went on believed it was God's word and God is going to perform what he has spoken right amen now Noah kept on holding to that right and then Prophet goes further and he said but faith doesn't look at what a circumstances is Faith doesn't look what circumstances is Right Faith looks to what God says right hallelujah amen if we got faith in us if we say we are believers then we must have faith in us or else without faith we cannot be a believer we can be a make believer we can be unbeliever but if you want to be a believer we need to have faith if we got faith then Faith doesn't look at the circumstance Faith only looks what God says if God says you are healed you are healed now Faith is looking at that amen that's right amen amen Faith doesn't try to reason Faith just takes it at its face value right now that's faith it will take God God's word in his face value Faith knows what is the power in the word of God but when you take that word and put in a human thinking or imagination right there all the problems comes amen yeah is this possible is this amen okay but the faith takes it at its face value exactly that's what we need to do in our Amen brother sister we cannot dispute it just take the word of God just believe it amen how to build it just blindly right Hallelujah sir I believe this is the true word of God Amen yes sir we need to just believe it amen if you talk about believing you know the prophet of God said you may have lot of things to hinder you like that little you know sop phenician woman who came for the healing of her daughter yeah she got a lot of hindrance Y and Jesus went up to a stage and called her a dog indirectly yeah I don't know what will happen if the preacher stands on the pulpit and and calls somebody God oh my you cannot you will not see them back again but I want you to notice something right I want you to notice something that God spoke through the prophet I want you to notice here he said but Faith finds a source yeah no other thing anything no other knows no other blessing no other people or nothing right knows about it Faith finds the source that no one can explain it right it's something you know only faith can see it and then he says faith admits it is right when God called her when Jesus called her a doll indirectly she said yes Lord right right she admitted it right y Faith admits right word right Faith always humbles itself right she said yes Lord Glory I'm not looking for the bread that crumb is enough exactly Faith humbles it right Faith speaks the right word she said yes Lord you right right I'm a heathen yeah I'm a dog you cannot take the bread of a child right and give it to a dog right it's not meat it's not Al to the get right but Lord there's one truth in that when the master eats the bread you know always the crumbs fall give me that crumb Glory can you imagine the the level the faith that woman had brother sister right can we imagine the faith she had yeah come on just think about it the thing that was containing in the bread the things that were present in the bread were present in the crumb and her faith said Lord it is enough that CR is okay for me because it it has the same contains right what the piece of bread has amen that is enough amen we know that bread is Jesus Christ we know that meal is Jesus Christ and that little Crown Y is enough for me amen Lord Faith bless admits the right word yep Faith always humbles Faith only looks for the crumbs not the whole bread right Faith knows no defeat right faith has no right faith has no opposition right faith has got nothing to stop it right oh hallelujah amen nothing can stop Faith nothing can hinder Faith nothing can oppose Faith right right faith is such a that's why the prophet of God said it was a super sense y nothing can stop nothing can hinder right if we can have faith to amen if we can just have faith in the word of God right oh brother sister we will see the blessings of God in our lives we will see the power of God working in our midst in our homes in our lives in our children we will see the power of God moving in our church if you could just have faith like this amen little woman the problem is fear right that's it bu that's the trouble with men tonight y right the trouble with people today is they are scared right that's right I don't blame you people I don't blame anybody because I'm traveling I've I've got some experiences in America amen if you're in the plane yeah some little unusual sound the plane makes Hallelujah right he SC I don't blame that for that yeah the agony the pain they have gone through I don't blame for that right right but the fear has gripped the hearts of the people right you're in a bus station brother sister one little thing one little move somebody makes one little thing somebody speaks a lot people are scar yeah the hearts of the people have been that's right is controlled by the fear right that's correct and I don't blame anybody for that right the problem is fear yeah the he says that's the biggest curse that's right there is on the people right the biggest curse that is on the people is the fear amen oh Hallelujah is there a way out for this brother yes sir amen you replace love right take that fear out put love in his Hallelujah I'll come to that and he says I know that if you can take away you know that that fear and get love in his place something's going to happen amen you need only love yes right we know love is God nothing else God is love love is God and if we have love mhm God will move in our lives right Glory you will see God's power manifesting in our daily lives yes sir you can see it in every step of Our Lives brothers and sisters amen we need to replace that right we need to ask God to take that fear out amen and instead of that put love in our hearts let the love of God be you know shed abroad in our hearts and let the love begin to work amen you know fear has got no value I will read it for you right there's only two faculties that govern a human being one of them is Faith which brings result Faith brings results right and fear has got no value in it at all right faith is of god fear is of the devil right fear makes you weary and wonder but it is of 0% value right exactly Hallelujah absolutely amen can you say amen amen exactly amen this says unbelief can do nothing for you but then right right that's all it can do to destroy you and faith is the only thing that can help you right unbelief there's no value in unbelief at all unbelief accompanies fear when you go through reasoning and wondering then you begin to fear amen it says so fear is no good at all no value in it let's discard the thing all together let's have faith and believe God so it's by faith we know God not by knowledge amen hallelujah amen that's what we today right no fear no worries right many people in this day they looking at the things of the world oh the world is getting better the world is getting worse the yeah we're not expecting anything good but the problem is why our eyes are focusing on the bad things on why can't we focus on the things of God why don't our eyes see the of God the position God has placed the things God has given to us you know the blessings God has given to us the faith he has given to us brother you know we need to face uh Place love in our hearts right amen and love is God Amen that's why we need the Holy Ghost today right without the Holy Ghost we cannot have love amen we cannot have faith because love produces Faith that's what he says here only love produces faith God hats a cover yep love casts out all fear right amen so if you have got love you don't have any fear right fear don't have one bit of value about it no and you and we talk about our prophet and the great things what God has done right and think about you know the prophet of God a little you know little bitty man standing in front of that wild animal and and and he shows he begin to speak with love he said oh creature of God I'm sorry that I'm in your territory right right but I'm not here to hurt you and he doesn't have a gun and this one is is you know scrapping the ground and getting ready to hit the man of God and here he stands full of love and when the love was projected right he conquered that while he just stopped scraping the ground and you know making that dust to fly he just sat down quietly and the prophet went to do the work he came for you remember when he was moving the grass right he hit the uh honey yeah you know honey bees Hornet Hornet and what happened he didn't have shirt on his on his back yeah and they all came and you know how what happens when the hnet you know follows you but you know he began to you know stap and say oh dear creatures of God I didn't mean to hurt your home yeah I'm sorry for what I did and when the law began to project no we all talk like this that's right we like to hear this thing we like to talk like this brother and sister you know want to preach pre it's so good it's so wonderful yeah but we need to practice this we need to bring this things off the pages and put it in the practice in our daily life and see God is still Our God he's alive he's alive even today right amen if you're talking about the Living God what good of God of history is right what good is right what good a God God of Moses would do right a historical God in India as I told you in the in the beginning there are many gods but the history nothing is present tense right yeah it's a history right okay but we are talking about God right the Bible says which is right exactly which was which is to come the almighty the Alpha and the Omega no we are talking about a god which is so we talk about God of Noah God of Enoch God of Abraham God of Elijah God of Moses all good god of Paul God of John God of Peter we talk about God of William Brandon which is still a history come on brother what could a god do of

Corinthians 5 Ephesians 1 Second Corinthians 5. now remember that the Lord William Brother Claude weisinger will be here with us for the weekend uh preaching for us so you know remember that Sunday

time everybody want a hot dog you can get it anytime of the day all right so just remember that you can get them in with a hot dog you can get them out with a hamburger so we will try to do the best we can all right so remember that then remember now the Easter weekend the 23rd and the 24th that brother Pinkston will be here with us preaching on Saturday night and Sunday morning and then we'll be having our Easter Sunday dinner together and no afternoon service on that day on the 24th you'll remember that amen keep these in mind Ephesians one and second Corinthians 5. I'm one of the workers out there a while ago we said call me over there and he said no um just say a prayer for me tonight if you would so you know as we pray just remember one of them that wanted to be prayed for you know that the Lord be blessing father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and you give them to us freely so we we just Lord we just thank you and just Praise Your Great Name and we ask you Lord the man asked for us to say a special prayer for him tonight Lord and we ask you to just reach down and touch him and be with him Lord and take care of him give him whatever he has need of Lord most of all give him salvation in your soul and Lord we pray that you would just come now and be in the service tonight with us and that you would bless us and guide each and every one forgive our sins cleanse us and let us walk in the light of Your Love Lord just as we read your word you come and speak to her hearts in Jesus name so we'll go back and read on Ephesians now because we're going to be picking up some things and you know going on a little bit and you know I was going to read every service but it just we just read so much of it so look Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into Below in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in here to mount it toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed to himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and want all things in Christ for which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and let's go over to second Corinthians 5. verse 1. but we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we should not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unburdened not far that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be slaughtered up of life now he that hath brought us for the self-same thing is God who also has given us given unto us the earnest of the spirit you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we'll get to that verse in a little while you know to speak a little bit about it from Corinthians and uh you know I'm trying my best to get a point across to you and and uh you know I want to make sure you understand what I'm trying to say because I believe that the real part of you is your soul because that's you right that's the real you right you said with now the body in the spirit now with the body of spirit and we're a unit we you know we would have to have that but even after this this body is rotten away in the ground and the spirit goes back to God who gave it or whatever steal the soul of an individual will live on and and even if you're an unregenerated your soul is where you're at waiting the Judgment Day and the things you know so then it's the real you now the bride of Christ don't have no judgment day so we know where they go and souls under the altar to cry how long not to avenge our blood but to how long in other words come on you on Earth and let's get this thing on on and of course they can uh have a connection in some way to You and I by the faith that they were all right now she's in the soul of man is that part of you that will even be will even continue after your body and spirit is dissolved or whatever you want to say about it gone or destroyed or whatever all right because the soul is that part of you that God begins to work on now just to say these few things to to get make sure you follow me because that's what he begins to work on us in the New Birth the new birth is not in your body it is not in your spirit he deals with those situations and Realms that we talk about but the real part of you where God begins to deal is in that Soul now we'll get back to more so if you will study souls in prison and you know it'll help you especially maybe the first 10 15 pages you know I've sold in prison and then we'll get back to it a little later on but as mortal beings we seem to want to put more emphasis upon our body you know right because that's the part of us that we claim to be real or whatever you know tangibles or whatever it is but just remember that what's inside of us is more real than the body that we're living in amen because as I said it lives on even after we're gone now whether you're saved or not right it will go it will live on somewhere until a Day of Reckoning you know of the shoulders or the Rapture comes for the bride of Christ but now you what God begins or they're said to work on that show because that's where salvation's at it's not in your body it's not in your spirit it's in your soul all right and that's the part God begins to deal with you so that's the real part of you I mean something that you can't even uh show to somebody maybe right but yet it's more real than all that can be seen amen because it's the real you right that's where you live at that's where your see our problem was that we were sold into sin in the the domain of Satan and being sold into the domain of Satan then uh right around and said those angels they give us the nature right all right and they pervert our nature we started out right because God created us perfect not Eternal right Perfect Right made us right Body Spirit and soul as much as possible of the body but the spirit and soul being a perfect creation because God can't create something imperfect I keep emphasizing that because I I want us to hold on to that point all right but see then God comes down and he starts to deal with us now here's where our problem is he begins to deal with us in the soul but yet you can make Christians in the realm of as we call it the word Christian using it in the realm of anointed ones you know and look at the things that are done look at the the way man goes and and all so you can become a a religious person right and just be if the prophet says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit and dying go down right still be lost see that way then I believe the biggest portion of the religious world are religion religious in their Spirit realm right yes sir amen I don't believe they're religious in their soul you know what I'm saying that's so dark that's right but see some way you cut off allowing that soul to have control and then that's what brother Brown says people do he says they'll they'll give all their calls and they'll they'll go out among the congregation you know or something or tell somebody call them out you know now Gary you you need to get an altar you know hey and right around says you'll make that person a twofold child of hell that's right he said God is harder the next time to get to it right I know my sister I've told you many times she came to me in the church and Samuel you need to go to the altar you're an ojc Huber dare said he didn't have a chance to be saved well I thought more of his salvation and him never claiming anything I did hers I'm just honest you know but the point I'm getting at is we do like the Philippian Jailer said you know Paul and him you know there and repeating him they're in prison you know and uh when he saw something Supernatural take place all right right and he knew about them being a Christian he knew why they were in there right so then when something Supernatural took place he said what must I do to be saved okay now I gave you some quotes from Brother random that you know to me it is very fitting because like I said you you go out and you you talk to people and you and you you try to you really embarrassing them on that blessed God I felt led all right you're gonna have to argue with your Prophet about it not me I'm not going to argue with you at all I felt led to go talk to them was it your leadership or was it the Holy Spirit now I'm not against you if God told you right but I'm just telling you what your Prophet said he says you make it harder for that person to come to the Lord in other words right my coach you embarrassing you put them in a situation and they won't come back to church or something because why because you're going to talk to him again well you don't believe in talking to people now there's way in mind and run it all you want to talk to people about the Lord but don't embarrass them that's right don't get right out in the big old group gang call it you need you know the Lord's neither will you you need to come to the Lord you need salvation right in front of everybody go to him privately three right you didn't want nobody to do you that away they may have but you didn't like it but that's what I'm talking about see we talk about salvation we talk about the new birth yeah and it can only be the first of the show right and you can fill a church up full of people and it'll still all be lost right well you don't believe in going out and winning the people to the Lord yes I do but your Prophet said it I didn't he said a life lived is a greater testimony than all of your words he said because your life hinders so much I can't hear your words because your life is in the way that was where it was with me when I was 18 years old before it even was even converted in a Baptist Church one because people wouldn't have said they come to me and they'd say you need to get saved I said I live a better life your Deacon board does I wasn't hateful I'm telling the truth all right but see we get in the way so the Philippian Jailer said what must we do to be saved look what your Prophet said this was off in Hebrews chapter 2 part 1 and 57 825 today we got so many things you have to do now watch it now this is your prophet today we got so many things you have to do have to turn new pages you don't want people turning you pages you have to do this and do that in order to get saved he's saying what we we try to do see I thank the Philippian Jailer when this Jailer asked Paul what must I do to be saved into being you or I we'd have told him the things he ought not to do you ought to quit smoke drinking you ought to quit your gambling your gambling you ought to quit this you ought to quit off to quit that Paul never told him that he just told him the things he just told him the things he ought to do now what was it believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I shall be saved all right now that's what we do somebody comes to church want to be saved where do we start telling them you need to quit this you need to quit that you need to stop doing that you need to start doing this now show it to me in the Bible where that's at well I just feel led all right that's between you and the Lord and I think a lot of the people's leadership is their own leadership man Lord tells you to go deal with somebody healed in on the other end amen that's what the prophet said all right watch what he said turning northward 61 129. like a Philippian Jailer that night when he said what must I do to be saved well we will we do we tell him what not to do you got to quit doing this you got to quit going over there you got to quit doing this he never asked what he had to quit doing doing he asked what he could what he could he do to be saved right all told and no misunderstanding words he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's all get the faith of God back into people so that they'll know what to do and how to act not say come over and join our group in other words come in the message you believe the message you gotta believe this message if you're gonna be saved is that what's been put in most of your faces right come over and join that group just get them back to God God will do the rest of it of it get them into the kingdom oh Finance Jehovah Jireh 1961 209. you know the thing of it today when a sinner comes to the Lord we don't treat them like Paul did when the Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be saved now what would we say today you got to quit smoking you got to quit drinking you got to quit doing this that wasn't what he asked he said what must I do to be saved and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ leave on the Lord Jesus Christ not come join our congregation and stand up before the church and say this and we'll sprinkle you immerse you or whatever you want to do our way and if if if you're not in our church then that wasn't it he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved amen all right if you can believe for yourself you can believe for your house or also amen have enough faith in God to believe for yourself then believe for your children also amen that same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying God will answer prior don't worry just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart and just keep moving on that's the way it's done the house 1961. 808 did you notice now did you notice you and I today and most all ministers are so forth we're always trying to tell a feller what not to do now he put himself to her so you argue with him that way we'd say now quit you smoking quit your line quit your Stephen quit this or that that wasn't what the man asked he he didn't say what do I have to quit doing to be saved he said what must I do to be saved see we try to tell them what they must stop doing see and say well I must do this that or the other no that isn't the question what must I do not what must I stop doing but you just do what you're supposed to do you know what and all the rest that will take care of itself you're lying and stealing or drinking and gambling and doing the things that's evil it'll stop when you do that Paul answered the question what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and die in thy house will be saved and it's not going to save your house because you believe right because you believe that's right they must come to their own salvation but if they're watching you and you're trying to tell them the wrong way to get to God how can they be saved so get to God first it's my brother Adele Don't Preach like all these other preachers you know I learned screaming about the clothes you wear the things you do get born to end it'll take care of that that's right amen if you're doing it you're not born again right well you're telling me I'm lost right I'm telling you you lost amen that's right what else you want me to say oh that's going on what am I tell me I'm lost will it Bruce you're lost then because of the attitude all right you get upset about somebody saying something that proves you wrong all right which see salvation starts in the soul of man when we deal on the body and spirit to try to get people saved we think it's because we get them to church because we get them to believe the message because we get them to baptized correctly because we get them to quote a Creed no let's will and do it but is that salvation salvation must start in the real you in the soul get your soul right the body and spirit is going to obey right but around said it's impossible to get a holy ghost for a woman to put on purpose you put them on you're proven yourself you need salvation right what don't you think we're to live good no I told you that over and over don't think we're gonna live good I think we're to be born again amen the life will take care of itself amen but you can quit smoking you can quit drinking quit everything you're going to do that don't save you because you're trying to deal with the body and the spirit of a person something you can see right the church seen this what must we do to be saved start with the inward part of you let that inward part of you it's real right there is where God's deal is well I believe the message brother Dale amen I quit this and I quit dead amen then you see people turn around and going back right and doing it again right must not have been delivered right and that's right because they got born again ain't gonna go back and do it again nope that's right you mean you don't never make mistake every day every hour your Prophet did too so he's the one that said it with the mistakes of a Christian is not the sin of a sinner right it's mistakes of a human being problems troubles getting caught in the devil's trap right but quickly repent amen why because down inside of there if something condemns you you know what I'm talking about the body and spirit of you you go find you another church a little okay for you to do that right amen and this message you got to imagine divorce problem just go down around just get in there you know connect up your little internet things and listen You'll find you somebody to tell you okay well brother Dale you won't do it no I'm not unless God tells me but his word tells me whether or not I'm okay but you can do anything you want to be a believer in this message right typical just in body and spirit it's not in my soul David set my soul on the fact of the old God now he could do that without the new birth what would be our problem with anyone you mean just because you wouldn't get caught doing what you do or something that you will go ahead and do it but you're going to keep from doing it because you're afraid you get caught right you can hit a thing happen one time um Dean's son's daughter uh son's wife and uh you know I just preach on this and I just said it one day the pope had she happened to be here I said if you want that drink you know in fact you can't stand it without it you might as well go and drink it brother would you give somebody a drink man come up with a what do you call it DTS is that the word for what are you going to do for him the only thing you can do is give him a little house y'all want to get him over it till he'd go somewhere else out well you sure know I know it so anyhow the lady said I told her husband said I want a beer I want something to drink and he said but honey we're not supposed to drink we're trying to do right she said you heard brother Dale he said if I wanted I might as well go ahead and drink it well she took what I said literally which was it was a truth you know you can keep yourself from doing wrong right because you're afraid of getting caught right and that's what ninety percent of Christianity does they're afraid of getting caught right or like I said they'll find them another church to go to that tells them it's okay come on they got homosexual preachers and everything else around the country they'll tell you everything's okie dokie but listen what must we do to be saved repeating everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost why if your repentance is genuine now it's easy to say I'm sorry go baptize me if you're offendency to genuine amen but that's where we miss it actually we look at it and we think well now I've done that but the Lord didn't save me it don't say immediately it says and you shall right and that's right you shall so if in the time of the shell which could be like me two years Amen Brother Gary one year like if you turn and go back what you prove you see salvation is in the soul amen because that's the real you that's what I've been driving at amen that's where salvation begins he's in that soul man we'll get around to it later where it says it's the earnest of our inheritance right you know the prophet said your soul is not complete yet it's only got the earnest right amen he's got to have a growth development it's got to have a I'm going on and that's kind of what we're going to be dealing with tonight all right but do you understand somebody comes along and they say well you know I want to be a Christian well come to our church right yep all right get baptized correctly oh that's well and good the worst of salvation right right that's right I believe in Deliverance I don't believe in quitting right you quit smoking you're gonna go right back and start smoking again amen you quit drinking you're going to go right back and drink again right why because you can't control it the devil is stronger than you are go to the Lord is it Lord I don't want to do that may you help me and watch you come on the scene help me Lord but I don't want to do it all right I want to be delivered amen you know that's why I believe in the total Deliverance amen what we need to do then listen is to get the one inside of us and the quitting will be on because of him well how do I do that repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ release the sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right he said well I've done that all right I wanted to flip you in jail what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I shall be saved now that believing dire is not just well I believe my brother around says you go down there to get a drunk going down the road and he's you know you ask him so if you believe Jesus Christ get born again all right man that's what I'm trying to say because that's where the birth takes place he's in the soul amen amen see we try to conquer the body right it's honorable to quit things but run around City women said you can have a dress drag in the ground yeah yeah ain't no righteousness man but you get bored again it'll take care of everything that's my brother Dale's lucky is because I know what salvation is well you're just not a good pastor I'll agree with you not just what I am you tell me whether I'm right or wrong right see we try to deal with people to get them to us to a situation A Doctrine and Prophet what did he say he said I don't believe we're getting them to Christ he said I don't believe we're getting them to Christ because we're getting them to a doctor him that's great well then brother there you think it's all right and he's going to do that yeah you lost all right don't tell me you're saved and doing it you're lost well then I don't let you know plain enough where I stand you're going to tell me but I can't help it I do this I do that I can't help it you're lost wait a minute you need to be born again that New Birth has to begin in the show now watch that as we go along in the message see that new birth begins in the soul that's right that's why did you know the way that I believe it see then when you're born again in your soul is your theophany which is an upward going right before then you've got a Celestial form you can call it a theophany just don't carry it on over to a theophthy of Eternity right because you can't have an eternal Center basically for The Sinner in theophany lining up for a Christian Realm all right but you see just get born again and take care of itself in The Soul Man see big get saved first and get yourself saved and then apply it to your family don't know if I could just get my kids in church and then you lay out don't talk to me that's right too old I'm sorry you see a mom and daddy and they're goofing off and they don't go to church but every so often they just go sometimes special events or maybe every once in a while when you think you need to well I know you know what the kid's going to be the same way you know that kids don't have to overcome his mom and daddy to be able to go to church all the time because his mom and daddy says it's okay yeah we don't have to go to church ever service not that Lord have more amen especially in this day that's right you know in this day we ought to be having seven days a week Services amen oh well we'll see there you prove your loss right you don't want to come to church seven days you would sure go to the world I'm selling days and worldly events see then we prove where's your digging at we think salvation is right here well I don't go out and do them things now I like what the the colored ladies hit she said I ain't what I want to be and ain't what I want to be something like this but ain't what it used to be that's right she coughing somewhere something took over and she'd come she'd made a move amen all right that's salvation you got troubles Drive says you get borned again he said the devil turned over a gun he's got on you you know what you know what fool you before then so you see the world you want to steal me especially in this day right right when we're dealing with the change of this body right this is not the age to just go to church be good right it's the age of the Redemption of the body amen so we got a problem struggle right but what you gonna do is quit but now what's your point of what I'm trying to get to we've been over and over about the soul of God being the real you whether you're a sinner or a saint it's still the real you and it lives on no matter what right even after death all right see the sinner has a place to go to we have a place to go to right but let me just ask you something you know that when you was a sinner and I was a sinner you know what we was doing you really know what we were doing as sinners we were building us a house to go to a tabernacle right right yep yep come on that's why you loved it but you were not building a house now and out on the on the ground out there somewhere you know that ain't the Tabernacle that Paul was speaking of you know it's this Tabernacle amen our Dwelling Place we serve the devil right amen you know no problems with it I've watched them at General Motors I watched them in the world and the things of people and they come to work man you know what I wanted to do I know what I mean I wanted to take two big old cans and just crush them together see because they've been out all night drunk you've been there you wouldn't want nobody crashing the can around you would you but you know what next night you'll go right back and do it again you know what you're doing you're building your house to go to yep that's what I mean by the downward pool the prophet said one is going downward one is going upward right all right now I thought we believed as Christians now I'm getting down to something so listen that Jesus said in John 14 I go to prepare place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come and receive you again unto myself now where did he go is he up in heaven when Hammers and Nails building a supply well now why does everybody think your soul is up in heaven or you see often is up in heaven right right that's what the basics of the message believe that your theophany is up in the oven somewhere but I thought Jesus went up and come right back inside of the person am I wrong you know Am I Wrong Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you you know he's building this place we build our own going down right right we supply all the material the devil needed amen Amen to build us a good house to live in down in hell all right all right A.D sugar honey anything you want to call it but it was a downward pull the prophet said but he said you get born again it starts an upward pull amen why because Jesus is building us a place to go to but where's he at inside of you all right where because you're in your body is he just an anointing upon your spirit or is the new birth in the soul see him the Christian is different from the center because in the center we would we were doing everything ourselves to go down we were trying to you know that said you got to go over the cross to get to hell that's right he said it's hard to go to hell because you had to get over the crowd so we sure did love the world didn't we but now we have someone inside of us that is building us a place to go to building National if we die right amen we have one lady right here's what we read in Corinthians feet Jesus Christ came back on the day of Pentecost you remember the other day now into what now in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul of God came back on the death Pentecost to start building us a place to go amen so then it's all the building that's on the inside right amen right the workers on the inside now like I said if we act out here in these bodies and spirits and things like that if we act like the devil then the devil's on the inside so forget it amen that's why I said I don't believe in being good I believe in getting born again and let God come and live in our hearts and alive it'll take care of us but I can keep myself from doing wrong right amen yes I can keep myself from doing wrong see he came back into the man in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give the new birth listen now which is not the birth of the body our spirit but it's the birth and the Soul see then your soul is your theophany amen now that we read it that's only the earnest we'll get to that on another message go then write a random old paragraph 80 or page 80 of the Hebrew Book and I tried my best to get you to see for 40 years he said your soul is your theology no no no no no we got one up yonder well is Jesus up there working or where is he working right man that's right now according to the Bible he's gone to prepare a place for us he's up there working I even thought your Prophet said that the future home will be built because of your desires that's right is that true he said some people like mountains some people like valleys he's a little bit though thank you Lord God it's according to your desire he said what about if you could build a house you know that's your wife you know you could come and say well honey why do you want here why you won't die and it's just to all be there he said but he's going to prepare a place to live way on a greater needle house all right see when you're born again you start an upward pull instead of a downward pull in the same Soul right amen people of the message they say oh we get a new soul remember the quote get a New Soul was before the prophet or when the prophet was bringing it Body Spirit our body Soul spirit amen see we do get a new Spirit right Ezekiel says 36. you don't say we get in your soul but that was the Two Sold options you should get a New Soul then I hear it and the people of the message and they said they called it chains of the Soul all kind of things come off of that you know of doctrines but it's the same message for the rest of it wasn't your soul that died right he said it was the nature of your soul you said so was the nature that's what I told the man up in Jeff one time sitting there talking to him I said but around and said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how could a nature have a nature I said argue with the prophet he said this nature of your soul that's what I was trying to get you to see and we say the souls just the nature of spirit no it's not just the nature of the spirit right Satan took our soul and gave us a nature his own right God by the new birth comes inside and drive that nature out read future home page 15. the unclean Spirit goes out amen God came down and drove out that unclean Spirit right and it comes and dwells in that soul making our soul Eternal I didn't bring it on things but but I said don't get it on the next mansion He said that makes us as persons together you know you got no problem saying that God in your soul made you persons together your soul you remember the other day when we were bringing out said Adam was body and spirit and then just put a soul in there he'd be gone don't destroy the soul only God can do that the soul is a real you and God starts right in that soul mother New Birth all right clean Spirit out amen and covet and dwelling in see now when that unclaimed Spirit goes out we get new desires that's where the trouble when the unclaimed Spirit goes out of a man that gets new desires right see everybody say it then I'm saved because my desires change I used to love this but I don't anymore he said well when you preach I I can't find out whether I'm saved or lost well it gives you good reason to pray amen amen all right talk to God about it amen until he shows you what the truth is see salvation then starts in the soul making that Soul Eternal by the new birth and what is the new birth come on how many years have I been preaching to you what is a new birth the birth of the word amen you said what's the baptism now you can have the baptism about the daily life die and go to hell yeah that's right the new birth is the birth of the word he was the word right and if it's his soul coming and giving our soul eternal life it was he was his soul his theophany come on how many quotes do you need it is so histiochneous person of his being went to hell to preach to the soul in prison how many do you need to believe your Prophet is the one that said it Jesus's soul went to hell and preached to those souls in prison amen he didn't go down there as a spirit form to just look at him and they didn't even know he was around they knew who he was that's right as soon as you birthday is the birth of the word according to Romans 10 7 Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word amen so how do you start the New Birth by hearing the word oh I was just sitting out somewhere and all at once I just got saved man that's you've got to hear the word first you show me anybody in the Bible who's ever saved without hearing the word first right Philippian Jaguar what must I do they have any calls what must we do they heard the word it convicted them right that's right that's why a lot of people are not saved they're never convicted they're convinced that they need to do something else but around says you become sympathetic that's what a lot of people do they become sympathetic see God then by way of the new birth brains you and I part of his own life just like we did and covered the last message of 126 and 27 with Genesis that Adam received a part of God's life amen amen and his soul exists theophany he received part of Eternal part of God's life you and I receive part of God's life see the empathy is the soul of God or in other words the only form of God that's eternal I'm talking about an eternal fee off me I'm not talking about now just there's somebody to go to I'm talking about an eternal fee off me amen and there's only one Eternal right all right now if I was you I take a little pencil right in front of me show me the right notes right down right now there's only one eternal right but it can't be a whole lot of eternals the prophet said we start eternal life right here in the altar salvation there that's right we went through that now watch that's number six on your notes um paragraph 70 of manifest the sons of God he said you begin your eternal life right here at the altar amen that's where you begin eternal life right here talk now this is one I really like look at number seven on your notes paragraph 88 who is this male Chesney you left the Whirl in all of them things what did he say he said you heard look what's on the line he said you heard from your theosity right well I got a telephone call and the Lord called me from heaven and told me that I had some uh what did he tell you you had if you heard from you theophany you would have to have some form of connection right amen did you get that yeah I just now got it so I hope you did you have to have some form of connection sure then if it's not connected to the eternal life in you where it's connected to eternity can only come to Eternity right all right so keep in mind what we're saying that eternal life see then the real you at the new birth begins to develop by you eating the word and that started your upward agree I wrote it like this you say all that sounds so good brother Dale but I thought my theophany was up in heaven hey so now let's while we're at Dad if that's what you're thinking come on down to number eight on your notes expectations and look where your Prophet says that were now in Heavenly places is that what the scripture says in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus already resurrected sitting in Heavenly places so now if you're saying that it's in Heavenly places then you're not saying it's your soul is in heaven right it hasn't left the body it's in the body right and if it's in the body then Heavenly places must have come here amen that's right that's right are we waiting to get to heaven to get eternal life or does our eternal life begins here see we can't even believe that and then turn around and say oh boy bless God one of these days this body is going to be changed some more we gonna do it you say yeah but you just gotta start eternal life in the soul I don't know about that but why not I thought we believed in Jesus Christ that the message I just previously preached and she said you enjoyed that having a nurse guess these times righteousness and peace push together in Jesus Christ and then by the new birth it's in you and me right right Heaven and Earth has kissed each other because you're not you United with him in the new birth that's right are you following me see I thought that we were already by the new birth resurrected and sitting in Heavenly place look at where he put it on questions and answers number nine on your notes read down to there where he said that you were already translated into Heavenly places already translated I thought we believe the soul was redeemed page 49 future home but we're waiting the Redemption of the body right I thought we believe we received eternal life in the new birth did we start our eternal life here right see that's what's going to take us there do we want this whole body to go there this body is going to go there because of what's inside of it that's right right all right okay already in Heavenly places look at number 11. Heavenly places brother Brown said what is it he said the believer's position in Christ the believer's position in Christ is Heavenly places when you receive the new birth that soul went into eternal life or became eternal because it's not Eternal you didn't get the new birth see we want to try to make it some kind of anointing when I said that while ago we only had the earnest of it you know what I'm talking about you got to add Faith Works or knowledge temperate faith has gone in this worldly kindness and all that got on to that's why we're here and that's going to bring us to a change in the body so it's only an Earnest when you get to New Birth I've got to the quotes laying on my desk would you say but brother Dale so go ahead and read number 13 while you're at it paragraph 22 God's only provided a place of worship 1965 11 28 in the morning service you helped me because I used to have an idea when a person died this their just their soul went off but when he quoted now who's he remember the he that's quoting this to him was that he that quoted to him when he was beyond the curtain of time and was questioning the situation and the angel of the Lord said this is Souls under the altar crying how long Angel the Lord referred to souls under the altar hmm when he quoted that to me that if this Earthly Tabernacle of our habitation be we already have one amen and we've got to have everything in trees to make a Perfection see and there's one body here then that body dire which is the celestial body that's what he's saying right and then the glorified body in the resurrection makes it complete now but brother Dale the prophet says we already have one amen the day you receive the new word you start eternal life in your soul and the positive of God's mind is then and in view right amen that's right that's why I love the scripture like it is so let's read it second Corinthians 5 let's read it see what it says for we know that if that if is past tense right that is that's past tense that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were hey dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens amen no if you die you step right over beyond the curtain of time right around and saw those people there right and they were in their theophanese he said they were and what was their theophany their soul right because the angel said this is sold under the altar the angel of God to referred to brother run these are sold under the altar now remember when he went to hell when the Lord Jesus Christ went to hell he saw souls in hell right right and when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he saw Souls amen people that he could feel that he could hear that he could talk to not just folks floating around they were in their theophany body agree and it says we have a tabernacle and they see Turtle into heaven now maybe I shouldn't be so much to bring out things but I really like to bring them out to prove a point if that's not talking about your soul then that means you've got an eternal body somewhere a human body eternal come on did you get what I said you get it brother Gary if we have a tabernacle and that's a human body let me see turtle in the heavens so while we need a change for eign just like Jesus said I go to prepare you a tabernacle is that what he's saying oh no brother they only said a Dwelling Place well he said he went to perverse of Dwelling Place he went up come right back down into the soul to prepare Dwelling Place a tabernacle a dwelling place is a tabernacle and it's not talking about your physical body is talking about your theophany now remember the only difference in the way that we come in the way Jesus Jesus come a fool in morphe theophany body right and stood back there and said let there be and create it all things well we only received it in a part we only get a part of eternal life now part of eternal life don't mean that that there's a lot of it that ain't eternal that doesn't mean that it just simply is stating the fact we don't get all of God Jesus had all of God he was all of God but it takes all of us putting the parts together to make God you agree but you see sure the minute I die that's a prophet said it starts off as a little trickle so then it becomes a little small stream he said after a while it becomes a river and he said actor while it becomes an ocean and he says you're standing in the presence of God that's the way he describes it and that profit beyond the curtain of time he saw Souls under the altar right you know what they look like what they look like on Earth you know that he recognized his wife and you know that one of them was still on earth when he recognized the other one that one took him by one arm one the other one in another in a form that he's describing it you know he knew all about that like brother Stephen Wilson I know weights brought it out too said one times a good point you know that Sharon hope or what a name would hope that she was 18 months old when she passed on but when brother Brown saw her she was a full grown woman amen amen she then stepped into her theophany ain't gonna be no babies in heaven they ain't gonna be no old people either old age be gone we don't want to get a new body do we we want this body redeemed amen we don't want to get a New Soul do we that's what I'm explaining that's why that scripture says that we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved now he's not talking about this human body because if it was then you you would have to go down to the Life part of it and say that the body would be Eternal in heaven the body's not in heaven the body's in the grave wrote around his body feeling in the casket up here in Jeffersonville Indiana right so that's not the body that you're talking about that'll come forth in the resurrection into a glorified state the body I'm concerned with is the soul that's within us we heard from our theophany when we received the new birth the prophet said we become the word here he said Jesus was the word and a full word in morphe body he said we become the word here as we eat the word you said well brother Dale people say that you don't believe that we've got a body well you better get make sure you read the scripture correctly because it says you have one eternal in the heavens now here's my point if you have eternal life in the Soul by the new birth is there another eternal life waiting somewhere for you and brother Brown said is there any such thing as to eternal life remember the other day he said you couldn't answer that could you he said because it only won now a year back to where you're supposed to wrote that down while ago only one eternal life right you understand what the prophet is saying you understand what the Bible is saying I'm standing right here Body Spirit and soul my heart quits beating in just a Split Second even faster than that right my soul is there it's not here well because eternal life starts here there's the key that I want you to keep on your mind to remember the Old Testament people could not enter into that form of eternal life amen they could be anointed they could do great things that they could not have eternal life in their soul that's right amen because it takes the new birth to have eternal life in your soul or if you've got to go by the grave and come up now brother random says in Matthew 25 I mean that where's that Matthew wanted Matthew 17 excuse me let me get scripture right he said Moses and Elijah was there in their theophany you remember that you know what it looked like Moses and Elijah you know why because that was in their their soul not their natural body yep that was in our show amen see they had went on to their inheritance then they could stand there I ain't never said those Old Testament Saints didn't have no inheritance don't ever think anything like that don't you ever think that I've ever degraded Those Old Testament Saints which you better remember one thing they're called servants right right yes sir they're not called children it takes the new birth to be a child of God those were servants 144 000 that will even get eternal life after we leave here the Bible called I'm sure your Prophet said they will be our servants in the millennium servants a lot to receive in the new birth because the new birth makes you a child of God hear it nothing but in spirit but in your soul okay now if I'm a sinner and my heart quits feeding I'm going to where my body is being provided right I'm going to The Fifth Dimension Center day but if I'm a Christian and I die I just step right over there beyond the curtain of time and it's not a way off of younger that's what we all think that one of these days we're gonna have to make a long jump and run and go away up the prophet said it's 20 feet away to slant now you've explained that people have gone Haywire trying to figure out 20 feet at a slant my slant was it 45 degrees 33 degrees 60 degrees what slang well you're worried about a slant for it in other words another dementia right right you step out of this Dimension into another dimension right but your body doesn't go there it goes to the Grave all right but one day you'll come back together here right right but you see we don't even have to do that wig stand right here be changed in a moment because negative and positive means partial becomes perfect amen amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the believer's position amen what do you think about it come on come on brother what do you think about it well I've always just believed in my theophany was up yonder I never said it wasn't that's the positive of God's mind right if there's a headstone the prophet would talk about and you get the new birth of Faith then that headstone is what's pulling you right the positive of God's mind is pulling you but you know the day Martin Luther begin to preach so just show me about faith he reached his positive position he had to go by the grave because there was nowhere else for him to go right right when Wesley began to preach sanctification when he reached the place there was nowhere for him to go there was no message to take him to a change when the Pentecostals received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the Zeus tree and they reached their place there's nowhere to go but then your steps of profit according to Leviticus 25 8. I believe it is verse 7 7 is 49 here come a prophet and a 49 on the South Church age proclaiming that we could step into eternal life but you know what you've got to have eternal life to go for eternal life is why you don't have to eternal life you only have one eternal life and your eternal life begins in the new birth and is completed when all of this is over with it eternity eternity then you can't have no more than eternity there's only one eternity there's only one Eternal must stand together what we got bro 103. foreign thing to happen Tom shout I could tell you things I had seen God in a church or anything I said I'm not free because it didn't accept Jesus Christ the first of the word and when he said that that one person is real Brian how loud you see Thanksgiving birth personate all of them and then we can't be the only problem s and they go on the basis of coming into this message gave me a new birth oh brother different I'm here if you're viewers until the new Earth God you are real you can use it no if I did anything help me I'll go straighten it up something smart every time I can get a travel I meant it go straight into all the ones that just became knees oh God in dreams if your mind go es real God is pretty bad I guess that's why I preached like I could do something awake experience he gave me I believe God is real full time so I'm not talking about something that's not real didn't they say I'm leaving that today amen so not to say I know I got the Holy Ghost because I believe the message I never said that right but for two years I read and studied I just rejected my family all I've done was work the doorbell and just cried and prayed out before God read and that's when I was reading six books a day and listening to two tapes but you see I knew that it wasn't a new bird the brother mode was not the kind of person to say brother Dale you got to quit this and you got to quit that thank God I run into him and not a lot of people because a lot of people would have said like one brother I said to him he said what do you mean you believe the message he said yeah and the devil believes it too absolutely I'm really Gary sitting back here behind us when he told him but he knows what I told him I said Brother Gary you're trying your best to figure out what the Holy Ghost is and stop it you're trying to find it through whatever you could do or not do whatever stop it yeah I should just simply get down and pray and say God give me the Holy Ghost because you promised it a phone call and he said it's over amen see because the new birth is a birth word and that way they can't take it out of you that's right you take my Bible you can take the prophet's message you can destroy everything but you can't destroy what's inside of me amen amen because that's where I am that's why I believe your soul then when you're born again he brings eternal life to you here puts you in Heavenly places because eternal life come here well what's dark the positive of God's mind waiting for me to reach that place and if I die before the change come don't say it brother deals are messed up no I'll never taught you nothing like that I've never said there was any disgrace in dying going by the grave just say he reached the place God saw he would reach that was it that's right and it was over with and I'll be just as happy the prophet said you just go to sleep and said you wake up and she might take in a nap anyway just be standing right back there 152. living by faith baby anybody have a need less baby what are you I think you've ever changed God you made me like I'm 71 years old a few days I believe I promise for a replace the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ foreign about their work I am here my things brother Tom now

who shall declare his generation Our genealogy which is a what family all right who shall declare his family turn to Isaiah 53 and we'll read scripture there they should have all this up they doing a wonderful job all the these quotes and everything we won't have as many quotes today we're going to read a lot of scripture but we're going to we're going to dwell on two points today going to take time dwell on two points today one is Adam and Eve and and the what happened in the genealogy in the Garden of Eden and then we're going to look at why the Holy Ghost wasn't given in the Old Testament they're not part of the family of God as in Sons and Daughters of God coming straight from God they're the Bible even calls um calls Abraham a friend of God right all right so they're not in the family as far as sons and daughters and we're going to try to cover those two points pretty well today and then maybe next week if that's okay we'll get back on the the natural family but going to give you a couple of testimonies that um uh two I want to thank everybody for taking part yesterday and we need to thank our pastor for for supplying all the food and and all the entertainment and

some miles off of that thing so going to Kansas we'll do that I promise you but anyway one more thing um I want to kind of put it in your mind that starting in June or July when June and I finish this Financial Peace University class that we're that we coordinating at Keller Williams uh some of you have said you wanted to do it but the only way we can do it is do it here and if it's all right with Dad we can do it here after second service it'll be 2 hours but we'll start right after second service and have it downstairs I don't want to have it up here so we'll just take the projector downstairs go back there but I really want to know if you want to do it you need to write it down and give it to Sister June or will uh keep asking you but but the 23 people that we are dealing with now which a lot of them 18 of them are from this church and 6 weeks we have saved as a total group of 23 people we have saved $35,000 and paid off $32,000 in debt Amen in 6 weeks amen nothing special nothing nobody's Grandma Rich grandma died or anything like that we just took our money and put a name to it all right so that will um and some of you that are that are there you you can testify to the ones that maybe want to go but um we may think we know how to handle money but we may need to sharpen a pencil a little bit too so but out of 23 people in 6 weeks just in 6 weeks those same people have took what money they make and saved put $35,000 more in savings and paid off $32,000 in debt that they had and June and I was one of them we just paid off our last one last week so we are debt free uh except for a little bit on the house so we don't have any extra debt so the Bible says that the borrower will always be slave to the lender always always Isaiah 53 let's bow our head dear heavenly father we pray today Lord that you'd come Among Us in a special way yes Lord Lord we know that 2000 years ago Lord you you're already out walking about doing the things Lord that you wanted to do before there was a fall you wanted to walk on this Earth in a glorified body and Lord you you were doing that and people didn't believe you and they they didn't trust what was going on and they didn't listen to what you were saying but father maybe with 2,000 years of teaching that we can listen to what you you have already said in your word and through the prophet's message that you have risen and Lord You've risen in our hearts you the quote of what a resurrection that was but Lord what a resurrection is to bring us out of dead denominational thinking Lord to bring us into the Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ give us eternal life while we're standing here on the earth father we pray that you'd be with each one Lord take care of the ones that are sick and not with us the ones that are on the highways brother boy and Sister Janet them that are on the highways there in Louisiana will be coming back tonight Lord give them strength and bless them Father take care of each one of us that are away from the church Lord just be with them be with the sin sick Lord bring them into the fold Lord the the list Lord that we go over every day in our minds Lord that's right down below my feet now in the Sunday school class Lord I pray that you just go to their hearts Lord and and PR their hearts Lord and bring them back to you father we pray that you just be with us now take care of us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit let only thing be said Lord that you want to be said nothing said wrong or out of line Lord we pray that you'd just be with us take care of the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord we pray that you give them fruit for their labor and bless them as they go and travel and do and spread your gospel father just be with us forgive us of our sins and our daily mistakes that we make Lord just be a part of our life in Jesus name we pray amen Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed thy report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground now remember who he talking about Jesus Christ growing up he have no form or commonness in when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it was our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but that was man's idea right but he was W was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his Strife we are healed now remember that happened in his body all right all we have all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way now that's you and I being lost and out in the world right and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all amen he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears his dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison here's the here's the theme of the of the message he was taken from prison and from judgment PR come from prison went to Pilot's Hall they judged him and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living in other words he was killed right if a man's dead his his genealogy ends right all right who shall declare his generation question mark for he was cut off of cut off of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the of his word and let's go now to Daniel 9 cuz we're going to see today we're going to take a natural part we're going to look at the Eternal genealogy of God but we're going to see the natural part remember the two points we're going to deal with today and and like I said Wednesday night brother Daniel did a wonderful job and he brought a lot of things out that were that were just really wonderful but I want to kind of expound on it and and maybe take two services and and kind of expound on on the family of Jesus Christ or the family of God because who shall declare somebody's got to declare his generation it's not Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago when he's done finished and we're all that we're not children of God we have nothing to do with with our heavenly father but that's not the way God wanted it he saw remember he predestinated before the foundation of the world put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life So Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do six things right cuz look at these six things in in chapter 53 of Isaiah and this is the sixfold purpose is what he's doing remember he come to get Israel but watch he was cut off just like he was cut off here should have Clare as generation and make an end of s finish transgression make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy all right give you a little key brother Daniel said something last week about the resurrection starting from within the Earth yeah I'll read you something in a few minutes know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem to the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks that 7 we period then there's a 62 we period right everybody knows that in Daniel 70 weeks the street shall be built again the wall even troublous time now that's a that is a prophecy of a natural happening right right that's going to happen and it already has happened cuz after three score in two weeks what on the 69 after the 69 weeks yeah two I mean the 62 and 7even Y right that's 69 after the three after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off go back to Isaiah same thing right who shall declare his generation because he cut off from the land of the living right all right and after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself amen he didn't die just for himself he didn't die just for Israel he didn't he died for us and Israel all right but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city that's the Gentile and the sanctuary that was Titus and the end thereof shall be with the flood until the end of the war desolations are determined but he was cut off what he was cut off so that who could come in you and I could come in right is that correct you he cut off Daniel 70 week shows that the Messiah week is 7 week how many so one week is 7 years so 3 and 1/2 years he preached he was cut off and he's got 3 and 1/2 more to preach but we know there's a one more week period cuz if you keep on going which we're not going to talk about Daniel 70 weeks today but there's three periods the first one the second one is 62 the first one is right here right all right then there's another week and in the midst of the week of the other time coming up they're going to make a covenant and then in the middle of that week right natural all right but look at the spiritual part he was cut off but not for himself he was cut off among the land of living why was he cut off he was cut off because of what happened in the Garden of Eden right the natural lineage of Jesus there was no natural lineage right so it wasn't that he was being cut off for himself he was being cut off to get you and amen out of him right all right so now is't that correct amen cuz we're bottled up inside of Jesus Christ we're bottled up inside of almighty God before the foundation of the world we're not some floating vessel over here and God some floating vessel over here right no we were born in His image now let's go to my favorite scripture Genesis 1 26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air that's what Adam and Eve were doing right right and over the cattle and over the Earth because what's going to happen this part of God this this part of God that moved over went into Genesis 27 right Genesis 126 man into the 27 man correct this is not flesh man this is Spirit man all right over F of the air and over the C and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them right that's a them not a thee all right created he them now this scripture is the Eternal genealogy of God Amen exactly right this is his children right this is not Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph um John the Baptist this is the children of the Kingdom right the least in the kingdom is greater than John now John got the Holy Ghost yes he did but he didn't get the new birth right he wasn't born into the family of God right amen he received an anointing just like Abraham Isaac Jacob that's why we're going to read in a minute that they were given to us for examples not full examples you can't type Abraham all the way through Abraham's Journey don't go give your wife away twice right don't laugh at God right but remember God God said let us make man this was the part of God that brother R said this Genesis 126 man went into the two7 man now now remember this is the generation of God Amen this is The Book of Life The Eternal section right brother D's going to be covering that you watch that book go all the way to to Revelations 5 right amen this is the book in Revelations 5 right the redeemed this is the redeemable exactly the others are not redeemable this is redeemable why because you were before the foundation of the world God saw you listen right put you in a family album this group right here in the spiritual never needed regeneration right this group never needed regeneration this group was perfect this group was God made manifest in another form right called Sons and Daughters amen amen right amen this is not mankind this is man the only M that ever was and that's Christ right this is Christ we are Christ made manifest in another form God takes this and remember you take the one seed and put it in the ground it grows a tree that has many apples one seed many apples one seed remember Galatians 3 we're going to read those scriptures right but this is the family album of God before the foundation of the world right before the foundation of the world this happened right let's look at the first quote questions and answers now look take a cell you break it down from a cell and it comes into a cell and a cell into an molecule down like that and finally it ends up into the Unseen it goes from a natural something you put your hand on to gases from gases to acid acid to gases gas GES on back like that till it finally all winds up to one little thing and that is Spirit yeah and this Spirit who has occupied these gases he's talking about us human beings when we die and go away it might not be the same gases but the features that you are will be exactly what they are again amen see the spirit has control that if the spirit of him that rais up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he will also Quicken your what moral mortal body your Soul's already quickened by the new birth amen all right and now in other words when you become a young man or young woman and like God takes a picture of you that's right now no matter but now look be careful be careful cuz watch the quote down at the bottom God takes a picture of you now no matter how old or wrinkled disfigured whatever it be that will wind right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up my lines whatever but it was made up of gases let me tell you something God thinks enough of your flesh so he's going to preserve it all right so we're going to watch that now because remember everybody we talking about Adam Adam was the man earthy right amen and he had a we're in Adam's race yeah Adam's what family I'm looking at Adam's genealogy flesh right that was calcium and potach and petroleum and Cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter that the whole Earth is filled with that yeah but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again exactly now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 right when was it taken amen before there was a foundation of the world right Genesis 1:26 and 27 came into being amen right before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file family album amen and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice right amen see then you become a servant of God him knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative right we think this is so great and so wonderful this is the negative of the positive picture right this the pictures absolutely this is the negative look how much God thinks of us amen back before there was any time he knew how many children he was going to have he knew their names he knew what they're going to look like and he put them in an album and he preserved us the negative part of life is where you're living now and you know what he didn't do he didn't go preserve it in somebody else he preserved it in himself right right and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative right therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere amen and this isn't the real thing right this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you get it so I don't care what you would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's Great Gallery up there sounds like we're declaring somebody's gener doesn't it right it cannot destroy it it's in heaven right you can burn it up feed it to the lines do anything any way you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as the two twos is four amen just as sure as God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are in other words no matter what happens to you do not worry right God has already got a position that's a place for you amen if you're a son and daughter of God if you've made your choice exactly to be a son and daughter of God so we are truly spoken word seed children forget about the natural right now right we're spoken word seeed children it did not take a sexual act to get us in God right come on we going to look at Adam and Eve here in just a minute it's not it did not take a sexual act to get you in the family of God right it was a spiritual spoken brother BR preach the spoken word is the Original Seed all right so let's don't worry so much about here and there and here and there let's go to Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed through his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul right man became a living Soul Adam become walking around had the Genesis 126 he was the son of God he was eternal right in his soul he was eternal right amen right now go to verse and you get up 18 and you're going a little bit further and the Lord God said it's not do we've already read these remember we went through when we talked about the man and the woman but let's that's why I said hold your point we'll get back to the spiritual but let's see what happened in the natural the Lord God said it's not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meat what we say that was help meat one suitable to help him amen all right and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field male and female right every file of the air male and female brought them under Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof why Adam was a Son of God he had the mind of Christ for his day listen I said for his day cuz you got to watch what he did afterwards but he had the mind of Christ for his day and Adam was there and and I'm sorry and Adam gave names to all the cattle foul the air in other words he sees the male and the female coming up and God already told them to multiply replenish the Earth right so by so by sex they were going they were multiplying and replenishing the Earth cuz they had the organs for it and that's the way God animals that done mind you don't have to cover animal up when they're when they're breeding you understand what I'm saying everybody okay with that cuz what because they're they're lower form they're they're living they're living life but they're not a soul they're not something with a conscience to say I shouldn't do that or I should do that no that just what happens by Nature right so Adam sees all that cuz remember Adam's got the mind of God that's he's a living soul but he's got the mind of God remember he was God of the Earth right and Adam gave names to all the cattle foul of the air beast of the field but for Adam see Adam Saw 2 by two 2 by two 2 by two 2 by two but for Adam it was just him it was not found a help meet suitable a help suitable for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof now remember he closed the flesh up and the rib which the Lord God took from the man he made a woman and brought her under man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man amen the word woman means a man with a womb right so now now Adam and Eve can do what God told him to do in Genesis 1:26 and 27 right multiply and replenish the Earth right but now not by sex but by Spoken Word every how you figure it can come that doesn't matter we were not supposed to have sex to bring kids period all right you say well what about the organs I'll read it to you in a minute oh I can't read it to you the diglot the diglot says animal flesh we were put we were made animal when we read about earthy about over there in Corinthians where Adam was was made Earth the man earthy that actually said animal yeah so we're animal flesh this is this is the highest form of animal flesh so if an animal boy had a and an animal girl had a keep it in your mind yeah then Adam and Eve had to have the same parts or they would be they would not be in the creation line rightly God created amen Genesis 2:7 man was not something out of the line no he come right up through because remember in Romans 8 the whole creation fell because of Adam but now if he would have been something different the creation wouldn't have fa right but since he fell the whole creation fell below it all right so God put that 126 and 27 man into Adam to reproduce himself then he brings a part out therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall clle to his wife and they shall be one flesh looks like that kind of what we're ending up to now right all right so now number two Blasphemous name dad's read this many times let's read it again but now here Jehovah Witness in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is a soul which they call it aoya if you want to read on down through there but let's just read the other save time now take the scripture from back and God breathed breath into his nostrils and he began a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into it right he was a living Soul what kind of breath he was breathing living man yeah well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul he talking about if he if it's the breath right cuz they breathe a human soul if that's the way it's supposed to be which it's not we know that and our soul and all together then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient hold that point so brother the argument don't stand but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen when he became a living Soul a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey Plum up to your elbows now watch breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul cuz God breathed not what nature done right but what God did breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul you then you say to me Adam died brother brand but remember before Adam died he had a lamb to redeem it Hallelujah those who he forew he called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a Ty Adam fell now Adam didn't fall from eternal life in his soul does everybody understand that he fell from eternal life in his body all right then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a Son of God he was actually the only son of God in the Old Testament we'll read that in just a minute not his breath as the African word amoya then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathed into us by breath why would we struggle for eternal life it backfires brother see it just can't do it but gone especially upon Adam exactly breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amature God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday he didn't leave it to Adam amen and someday the sons of God will again become Gods Glory Jesus said it's written in your law you're God and if you can call those who he call God who God visited how can you condemn me say when I say I'm the Son of God see now we're getting into something deep right that's what we're fixing to do okay now here they are he is now a Son of God but he makes a mistake and he knows he's doing wrong right amen he's a Son of God he's got the mind of God he knows he's doing wrong right Eve didn't Adam did we're getting to a point here now now remember Adam was not deceived amen the Bible said so 1 Timothy 3 Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived was in the transgression Adam walked with Eve because it was his wife same as Christ not deceived by Satan but walked into the death with the bride he went to be with the bride so he could redeem the church in other words he came down here all right Adam know he was wrong so he just walked out with Eve see but there was a lamb provided for them that they were redeemed see they were covering theel with fig leaves God just said forget that jump here cover the whole thing right put this on and these Lambs today that were for on by God and God is called there is a redeemer talking about us no man can come to me except my father draws all the father has given me will come that's right congregation says amen so there is a provided lamb from the foundation of the world where their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life right a lamb was provided to make way of Grace now what is Grace for is for something you've done in the past not for what you've done in the future we're not Catholics that's premeditated if you do it before all right but for grace for what we were trapped into or the thing that we didn't know was wrong and it was wrong and we asked God to forgive us give us Grace for everything that happened afterward I'm working toward something here cuz something I I believe the Lord showed me this and I brother they can corank me if I'm wrong but I think this is what the the part that Adam and Eve and all this stuff that they're thinking that what they did was watch a lamb was provided to make a way of Grace Grace was what for what you done in the past to make a way of Grace for every one of them to go in the resurrection a provided lamb Adam's lamb now notice as Adam had a provided lamb right right now remember in the fall Satan used the Beast to stop a Son of God from being born yeah right cuz the Beast came to Eve put a natural genetic seed into Eve so that it polluted the womb there's no way that God's program could continue in that condition right right stopped it correct right now what's he still trying to do now sure he's trying to stop Sons and Daughters of God from being born spiritual all right but now look Adam could not save Eve he wasn't the Savior right right amen that's right right amen but he could protect him right or preserver yeah he could protect and preserve but he couldn't save Eve he could not bring her back from the condition she was in cuz the natural act had already took place there's no way Adam could turn back time exactly let's go to Romans 5 now people are are discussing or preaching that Adam put his natural seed into Eve to save her you can't save her there's no natural genetic sperm let me be plain will ever save anybody nevertheless death rain let's let the Bible prove it nevertheless death rained from Adam right so anything Adam did after that is death right nevertheless death reigned from Adam to MOS even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression death reigned in other words look death reigned over let me make it plain even over them that didn't do the sin that Adam did yeah amen but being in Adam's Fallen race right when God cursed that ground anything come out of that ground is cursed anything that's why Jesus didn't come out of that ground right amen even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression now keep in your mind who shall declare his generation right who is the figure of him that was to come which is what Jesus Christ but not as the offense so also is the free gift for through the offense of one man many be dead right if Adam seed was some special something Abel would not have had to drug that lamb up right and sacrificed it I get to a point here in a minute but not is the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of many of one many be dead right much more the grace of God and the gift of Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many in other words Grace come through who Jesus Christ not Adam and not not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the Judgment was by one the condemnation Adam not Eve Adam right cuz the Bible said in Adam all die right and not as by one that sin so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification Jesus rose for our amen justification right for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which which receive of the abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one amen Jesus Christ all right so that's the only way we're going to get out of this mess is to get into Christ all right so now First Corinthians 15 I think brother collee may have read this this morning for since by man come death right by man came also the resurrection of the dead right am for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive those first Adam second Adam all right but the first Adam could not save his bride Eve he could only cover her or preserve her or or or just do like brother rown said you know he couldn't get to Eve he couldn't get to Sarah because of Abraham the head the headship was established there in Genesis right all right number three let's read what Adam did but he's forfeit that Adam forfeit the title deed to it what the Earth eternal life to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the Earth right Adam forfeited that Jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the see now we don't have it now and look it wasn't to Adam any of his seeds yeah right right right Adam planting a seed and Eve did not save her amen gee come on people Adam's seed absolutely lost everything right it's not the seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world and how much we try to make big fine homes and things it still doesn't belong to Adam seeve no sir it did not go to Adam's seed no sir because Satan took it locked stock in Barrel right for Adam forfeited it amen now number four the breach see Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God right let's go back for a second Adam was a son of God right he had the mind of Christ he had the he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him he was God of the earth amen right Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan right he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited it every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted listen to this and the seed of Adam natural not the spiritual seed of Adam the natural seed of Adam right has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had amen that's the Earth that's right see the seed of Adam now what happened the polluted seed of Adam there's only one original good seed that's the word of God Jesus Christ right so every other seed is perverted now what happened the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land do you know the Bible says that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of Adam God will destroy them amen but now listen remember Grace is something that you for something you've already done that's right now this is what I believe this is my belief Adam seeing what Eve done Eve was already polluted Eve was already ruined but she had a natural genetic seed placed in her by the Beast amen all right now go with me that far like I was telling brother Donnie the other Sunday this is what Adam did Adam said God I will accept what she's already done not what I'm fixing to do to her right right I've accepted what she's already done what did Jesus do he accepted what we've already done he was the first Adam and this is the second Adam right typing total type so Adam was saying God I will accept what she's already done so in accepting what she's already done he soole the human race out but now listen let me make sure I get this right he will willingly took on her sin yeah because there was no way because she had been naturally polluted naturally we're not talking spiritually now she has a natural genetic line in her womb right okay and it was polluted there's no way that a son and daughter of God can ever come from Eve anymore right but and there was not a way for her to actually get back into Adam wound was closed up amen there was no way for her to get back into her protector that's right so he could either kick her out and say God let her go I'll do it with another one but he couldn't do that he'd be killing a part of himself all right same way with Jesus Christ Adam's Act was to preserve his lineage think of that Adam just didn't have sex with her because it was nice and fun and all that stuff right right he knew that if he destroyed Eve and didn't do anything past what she had just done with the Beast his multiplying and replenishing the Earth we know he knew that in that he could do that in in spiritual but once he saw that the way was closed where he couldn't he couldn't do it spiritually anymore there was no Genesis 12627 going to come out of that amen right but Adam's natural lineage would have stopped if he hadn't went and took Eve and then did the act that he did now if you go that way with it I'll agree with you that he and I was telling brother join him that's why brother R said he took her quick quickly to himself why heet waited two or 3 days the womb would have been closed he would have been locked out people there was no other woman for him to have his lineage with right so he took that's the same way with Jesus Christ to carry on his Genesis 1:26-27 he placed the spiritual seed right Amen to what declare his generation right so Adam the first Adam earthy remember everything Earth come from Adam Adam and Eve you understand what I'm saying right we know the Beast line was there but they call it Adam's race the Bible even calls it Adam's race this is the race of Adam without Adam coming to Eve and doing what he did there would not been a Abel a Seth an Abraham an Isaac a Jacob a Joseph right no uh right just keep naming them on down Thad there so Adam and Eve didn't get together just to have fun Adam was preserving his lineage right natural so he knew there was no spiritual way his lineage was going to come about there's no son and daughter of God ever going to be born from first Adam right not since what happened to Eve but if he did what he did Adam knowing he was a Son of God he knew he knew things God had to teach him things right right there wasn't nobody else to teach him there wasn't prophets we got prophets and and and scribes and people to teach there was nobody but Adam and God and Eve right and the devil right and the devil had pulled th pull one over on God but God didn't bother God because look if that act was so bad that Adam and Eve did with each other had the sex act then why did Abel get B I mean why did Seth get born and why did this one get born and why did this that's my point if that was so wrong God didn't destroy the sex act afterwards they started beginning to what multiply and replenish the Earth under a permissive will right right right God takes the book back from Adam which is the names of Genesis 126 and 27 only one came up that was Adam then Adam was supposed to bring everybody else right well when that got stopped God said hey that's okay right to be a redeemer I got to let something fall amen cuz it's called the Fallen race of Adam right so for Adam to propagate his species or to declare his generation he had to come to Eve do what he did to keep his lineage going because through all that lineage is our types and examples until Jesus Christ could come 2,000 years ago without any sex without any sperm and and EG from from parents to get us back amen right is that okay so everybody understands you know when people preach about Adam having to having to do this and inject his seat that wasn't to save Eve that's right that was actually Adam preserving his own lineage is that okay that all right he preserved his own lineage knowing though the the Christ that was in Adam Christ didn't leave Adam when he did that the mind of Christ was still there hey I can't get it this way anymore that's right but I got to get the people on the earth now cuz I'm fixing remember after all that happened first thing God done was curs the Earth right so when he cursed the Earth everything had to come up was cursed right right but it had to come up right there had to be a lineage does everybody understand is that okay I told you I was going to make sure we dwell on that point if you hear anybody say that Adam had inject his seed into Eve to save her it wasn't to save her it was to preserve his natural lineage knowing that God somewhere down in that lineage is going to come back through right right cuz remember Joseph and Mary was not a natural lineage of Jesus right but they were used they were used in lineage right natural lineages for our example all right till the one that come that was born without sin that was born without sex that was born without uh any sex act all right but the wom was already polluted Adam's Act was to preserve his lineage he had to do what he did having the mind of God he knew he had to we all had to come right all right remember brother said he knew what he was doing amen we just got to get the same mind of God to know what he was doing am not some silly sex act but to know that he was preserving our line to get us here in flesh amen cuz that's what God wanted he wanted us here in flesh Adam and Eve were going to bring us here in flesh but God was a redeemer yes so he had to let us follow he had to let that that happened right but did it stop God's purpose no he just dropped down in permissive well and allowed us to come the way we did right but a type but now look what did God do for both of them yeah he made a skin yeah for them he made an atonement blood made an atonement threw them into the GU into the into the bushes and said hey forget to figure Le put this on I'm going to cover more than just your bikinis that you got on in there you know your fig leaves yeah you need to have you need to all be covered cuz it started right here right right started from the mind but God made an offering or covering because there were no more sons of God to be born through flesh at that time right there's no more sons of God I'm talking about eternal Genesis 126 born again could not come through that right right caus in Adam all die amen right right so God brought a group of people into the Earth let's go to Genesis 3 15 let's just read that just make sure see I will put eny your division between thee and the woman who's Thee the Beast right and the woman and between thy seed be seed right right right and her seed now woman don't have a seed so there's Christ saying that I'm going to separate this thing I know we're going to have to come in flesh but I'm going to come down and give her a seed seed right right seed and and you know the whole thing amen the whole thing's a seed okay and it shall bruise thy head serpent yeah and thou shalt bruise his heel well if you kick somebody in the heel it's not going to hurt him you take cut the heel off but it what her seed shall bruise thy head you cut the head off and you're going to kill it right and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband remember we talked about the double Covenant that now the double Covenant in the man is the man's going to rule over right and he shall rule over thee and into Adam because thou has hearkened under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat cursed is the ground now he didn't curse Adam right he cursed the ground in sorrow shalt th eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and F shall it bring forth to thee Thou shalt eat the herb of the field sweat of thy face shall th eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was you taken for dust Thou Art and to dust Thou shalt return and Adam called his wife name Eve because she was the mother of all living now here she got her name now let's go to Genesis 5 genesis 5 verse one see look this is the book of the generations of Adam there would not have been this book there would not have been this generation of Adam had he not done what he did with Eve after the Beast did what he did with Eve right right that's where the twins come right this is the book of the generations of Adam now remember and Adam all died so that's what happened in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him now look male female created to them he's going right back to Genesis 126 and blessed them and called their name Adam for the fall they were both named Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived 130 years and begot a son in his own likeness after his image a natural boy called his name Seth so there you start the natural lineage of Adam correct all right Abel was killed so remember when you look in the Bible just for a turn let's go to L Luke 3 when you look in the natural to be a to have a lineage or line you got to have propagated your species right or sent your genealogy down to the Next Generation right what I was telling them up in U up in Virginia right there where brother Ron and all them there was probably 200 Civil War battles fought right in from where he you know 100 miles from where he was at I said could you imagine 600,000 men were killed in the Civil War in 4 years 600,000 men there was 600,000 Generations stopped if they had not had children a lot of them were young boys remember a lot of them were young boys fighting now if they were older men and had children but just think how many were young boys that that generation stopped but God preserved somebody stayed alive to get us here cuz we're all from that line except you move from the south I'm going move from the north which bless your heart that you got here so all right Luke 3 but that was that's the God he had to have a natural lineage right cuz he was going to put Genesis 1:26 lineage into a human flesh right right that's what he did right so he was going to do the same thing to you right cuz that's the way you come you didn't come a spirit baby right you come a natural baby right which was the son of Canaan which was the son of whatever that name is which was the son of sham which was the son of Noah which was the son of lamic which was the son of Methuselah which was the son of Enoch which was the son of Jared which was the son of Mal which was the son of Canan which was the son of enus which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God right so he was the son of God for the for the Old Testament right the only one that had eternal life to be a Son of God in the lineage right right all right you got that which was the son of enus which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God all right everybody got that yes so Adam was a Son of God glory amen all right but this is a natural lineage of natural people same way in the Old Testament from Seth to Joseph there were generation but not sons of God I'm talking about Joseph what what this do if you what this do what this do does if you go backwards through Luke it starts with Joseph wasn't the son of what Joseph was not the father of Jesus but it comes down through Joseph line right but it's showing a natural Li lineage coming back to the beginning of time right right straight down to Jesus if you'll read it back right so Adam had preserved his lineage yeah right there it was he preserve that lineage all the way to Joseph all the way to today actually but they were not any of them Genesis 1:26 none of these enus Seth Mal Jared go all the way up to Joseph they were not sons of God by birth right they were not Adam which was the son of God right so now but remember from this all we get natural lineages not spiritual L lineages right the only time you see a spoken word child is on the day of Pentecost that's when the book became open again exactly all right that's when the book became right into the rightful owner which Jesus was the book Jesus held the book while he was here on Earth and we'll go through that in just a minute so we're going to walk you through this who shall declare because remember Jesus natural Jesus When They Crucified him a couple of days ago 2,000 years ago on a cross he never had children so that stopped his natural genetic lineage amen who shall declare his genation right his genealogy he had no earthly genealogy as far as this right here was going none right Adam shouldn't have really except the Genesis 126 and 27 people that's all he should have had right but by permissive will he has allowed all this Old Testament turn to First Corinthians 10 verse 11 now all these things read the rest of the scripture but I I like to use this because all these Old Testament things all these things happened unto them for examples right and they are written for our our admonition who upon whom the ends of the world are come so baby do let me tell you something that's me and you in the scripture there's nobody else there's not another one to come there's not another one pass if you can't read that you're dead you understand what I mean if you're in the grave you can't fulfill this but you are alive you are a genealogy you are written these things are written for our admonition what Abraham Isa Jacob Joseph were examples of Christianity not Christianity examples of Christianity examples of the way we're supposed to live upon whom the ends of the world are come so that's me and you so they were all given for examples every bit of this was given for our example whom the ends of the world have Came Upon Psalms 139 now this is David but listen to what this says put your name in here yeah for thou H has possessed my reign right thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am Filly and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee that's right f 5 4 years 53 years ago I wasn't in existence right but God knew who I was amen God knew when I was coming right all right that's what I was telling them we were sitting at a at a at a high school um I think Hope was graduating and I looked around and all the guys that went to school with me a lot of them were there and I told them I said you know what I said about 70% of the people in this Stadium wasn't even born when we were in school they weren't even alive yeah where' they come from yeah genealogy right right genealogy they appear my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously WR in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect flesh and in thy book all my members were written so he he he did see my substance what I was coming to right here but in thy book all my members were written which in continuent what's the continuance mean one right after the other and continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them right that's right God didn't go on vacation when Adam and Eve did what they did in the garden that's no he just went right on making examples of the Old Testament people covering their sins by the blood of a lamb that didn't have a soul so the soul of man the soul of almighty God was not in those animals amen that's right that's why they had to just be covered right right they were just covered but look how powerful they were in just the covering of lamb all right in continuance you and I had to come because Genesis 1:26 27 was still sitting in the mind of God yeah right he was still holding the book it you know it went back the book went back to the original owner Satan's a squat on this Earth he's just here for a time but the original the book The Genesis 1226 the book of names yeah God's holding it he's the only one that can produce it that's why it took a lamb to produce the book it took a lamb to bring that book forward why that lamb that book was a part of the Lamb that's right all right all right so now Isaiah 53 verse 10 now see yet it plead we didn't read we stopped at verse eight for for on purpose verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul see you can't make the soul of an animal an offering for sin that's why in the Old Testament you couldn't have the soul of God in any individual couldn't that's right right just a covering right but but Isaiah 53 says when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin y right here he shall see his seed righten Genesis 1 126 and 27 right right right he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand we'll read the rest of it in a little while but right there Isaiah 53 who shall declare his generation that was in verse 8 right well Isaiah is telling you really in between the love letter here he's writing he's telling us that he's going to bring us when he himself when Jesus Christ himself comes and makes an offering for sin he shall see his seed Glory why because the seed was inside of him not some little spot you can't the the seed that produced Josh you couldn't find it in my body chemically you couldn't look for it until it went to its place everybody understand that you couldn't so so you don't say well I was that no but we have to know our position we're the body of Jesus Christ so we have to know what position we're in right but you don't have to say well he shall see his seed well who was his seed Genesis 12627 that's the only seed of God Galatians 3:16 and thy seed which is Christ Not seeds right that's right not Abraham planting seeds in women not Isaac plant seeds Abraham planting all uhuh thy seed singular Christ that seed never come from the loins of a human man amen exactly it came from the mind of almighty God spoken remember it has to be a thought before it's spoken yes he thought of us and then spoke us but now look let's go to Galatians 3 and just read that now the Abraham and his seed were the promises made right he saith not to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ amen you and I have a promise we're not Abraham's promis seed by natural genetics right if you if some of you have not been going to brother Bob black class you need to go you need to listen to it because he's taken from Genesis about five four and five where we just started at and he's taking lineages and showing you that lineages really if you break them down in the Old Testament they don't mean nothing that's right you start bringing in Rahab and Ruth and this one and that one and this one and that one you'd think boy that thing comes right straight down like they want to preach you know you got Adams line over here well Adam's line over here is just as polluted as the Beast line I just proved that right there's no difference in Adam's natural seed and the beast's natural seed none they all come perverted polluted dead nothing alive in it oh yeah we're alive no if you don't have Christ you're dead Okay and that's the seed we're looking at and that's the seed like brother Daniel was talking about Wednesday night Jesus said a little while the world see me no more I may stop here and and finish this afternoon may go maybe a few more minutes but that Resurrection started inside the Earth the stone was not rolled away when Jesus came out of the Grave we it the stone was still there the angel rolled it rolled it away we read it last night in the Bible study you did it's St the angel rolled it away and sat down and said who are you looking for that's right Jesus didn't need to move that thing the resurrection started when it quickened that body and he just walked right straight through that that rock and didn't matter is a million miles thick we'll read it we'll read it tonight there this afternoon but now look let's go back in the Old Testament cuz we can't do away with Israel cuz God loved Israel right he called him his children he called him his bride I was telling I was telling him somebody the other day I was telling the guys at work the reason they were called the children of Israel cuz they acted like children yeah that's right that's the reason they were called the children of Israel they acted like kids they never weren grownups they never grew up they always murmured and complained and wanted these social social programs and God gave it to them and they still murmured and complained that's babies that's not full grown adults children that never grew to maturity right but remember he put Israel away for her defilement right right he put her away for their for their defilement but Daniel 9 what we read proves that he's going to restore Israel to a position not to wife again not to his genetic children cuz remember they had all those tribes in lineages and they had all this in L that was natural every bit of that was natural there wasn't a supernatural act in the Old Testament even though um Samuel's mother Hannah was old she still had relations with her husband to get Samuel H right and there wasn't an Immaculate Conception in the Old Testament is what I'm trying to say okay everything was done by going into your wife okay or them going into the husband so Daniel 9 proves that he's going to restore her to a position she was cut off because of you and I right he's going to declare his generation here right but he's going to also declare his spiritual generation right yes which is you and I amen you and I are his spiritual genetics we all come from all different natural genetic lines but we we all have one spiritual Gene right right and it's woven into us like Daniel that was good brother I appreciate that you doing a good job I'm honored a good job cuz that really sparked something in me because that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead right will also Quicken your mortal body but what did that Spirit do when that Spirit went back in the body and we'll cover that this afternoon but when that Spirit went back into that body it quickened that body that was beat like hamburger meat his bones weren't broken but he had gashes and lashes and all he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity that's the outside this is for this guy yeah where he really done the damage is he gave his soul amen a ransom so he could see a se you could have beat this body you could have beat that body of Jesus almost to death but he was in full control of that situation Jesus Christ knew that we were going to be bruised and battered and we needed healing in our body right right but when he gave his soul Ransom when he gave himself up because of our sin what did he say he gave his soul a ransom so that he could see his SE in other words you he paid for something he ransomed our soul out of hell he ransomed our soul from Adam's race Fallen dead on our way to hell and put us into his race right into his kingdom all right and we'll see that this afternoon how did what did Jesus do Jesus came with the genealogy in him right he brought his own genetics amen he didn't depend on nobody else I don't depend on nobody else to have my kids comes from me right right and if there're my kids I put them in my family album I love your kids but I don't have them all over the country I mean all over my house in a family album I got my kidss in the family album that's right and that's the same way with Jesus Christ he did the same thing you love the Lord let's go to one more scripture let's go to First Timothy before we finish because look we're going to talk about the law because the law was given because of our transgression right okay so we're going to talk about this the law this afternoon but how the law and the prophets built the body of Christ and we'll come on into where Jesus comes up and that's why we're going to talk about today this is his this is the resurrection right right the only way that he could declare his generation was to come out of that grave amen exactly cuz he was cut off among the land of the living I hope everybody caught that this is this is a resurrection message he had is they they tried to put that great big they trying to put that great big rock up there to stop his genealogy if they could have stopped him from coming out of the Grave we were gone we were done we were finished right but see they were looking at the natural man God's looking at the spiritual man that went to hell preach of the souls in prison come and pick that body up in in other words change that body now left the scars for the nail prints but remember he was beat all to pieces he was bruised for our iniquity all that bruising was gone when mayor Magdalene made him in the garden she thought he was a gardener a young boy but when he said Mary for every cre of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God in prayers why don't you should pray before you eat anything if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and good Doctrine where unto thou has attained but refuse refuse profane and old wies fables exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all all things having promise of the life that now is and that which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of accept acceptation for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe all right everybody got that right everybody the ones that believe now Paul said he was scared of Our Endless genealogy right but how God has took us and told us that that have a promise of life that now is and that which is to come now look let's go to quote number five let's let's do that one then we'll then we'll stop right there the law was given because of man's transgression we know that right that's right Israel man wanted a law to live by the blood of animals with a sacrifice covering an atonement but what was the curse of the law what was the curse of the law right nobody could live it amen nobody could live it they wanted the law and then it couldn't even abide by it right all right now look Perfection we'll stop right here now when Adam and Eve had sinned let's read the whole thing there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with right and no man can commit a sin of anything type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy God so therefore when Adam and Eve had sinned and had transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death now if we can only settle down for a few moments now in our thinking and look at this great picture and remember that every person here is included in this amen right right every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race Adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin amen and sin must be dealt with and so God in his great infiny and his great love the law was to separate the sinner from his maker amen then he became Anil and totally annihilated there would be no way for him to ever come back unless that sin was dealt with and it would be very easy then to believe in a total annihilation of The Sinner at the end for he is completely forever separated from the presence of God all right so that kind of explains all that but sin must be dealt with sin had to be dealt with in a different way than Adam and Eve tried to deal with right and even Abraham and Isaac and Jacob they dealt with sin as in they give an atonement they give a covering we're covered we're covered we're covered but just being covered someday you got to stand in front of all that right cuz it's just being covered it's not being done away with that's right a lot of you young ones coming up in the Lord you sin's got to be dealt with it cannot be covered it's got to be dealt with amen and it takes what one man could do it and that's Jesus Christ he's the one that took the sin down away because he had a soul that sacrifice for you had a soul let's stand our feet and for that Soul coming out of that grave bringing the body with it took all of us and cleaned us up amen he was wounded for our transgression right he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of his GL peace our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation amen for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken right and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and his death amen because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed amen he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall Pro in his hand right he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied on the cross he was travailing in body obviously but he was travailing in Soul because he had to all scripture had to be fulfilled you and I were hanging in the balances we were inside of him there was no way for us to get out we were inside of that man Jesus Christ no way to get out unless that Soul came out of that body amen and went and paid a price and come back and brought that body back he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied for his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity amen therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death now you can't kill a soul but a soul he poured out his soul unto death the body died the body died the soul didn't die the body died but the body paid the price soul went paid the price in Hell the body took our Stripes took our bruises took our iniquity something you could see see because Adam's race was broken Adam's natural race was done for exactly all that was rotten remember in David he said I'll not leave my Holy One see corruption right that's right not leave a soul in hell so remember he didn't suffer corruption he wasn't corruptible right he was Incorruptible amen when he raised out of that grave 2,000 years ago this morning it was for me and you it was for his kids it was the greatest father that ever lived on the face of the Earth cuz he died he died to get me and you here amen amen let's s song 266 spiral book power book 266 in the spiral book because he I can face to amen you believe that all Fe my well we sure know how to do it is wor the Living God GL he for Amen to do what to buy your part but you got to accept that part you can't just say oh he died for me and he did all these great things for me know you got to accept that he did it for you he did it for you he did it for BL Dale he did it for me I tomorrow be know he hold my and is wor the Living God and I'll cross that I'll find my what a victory you say well I'm not going to die you going to die to yourself what's going to happen of glory and I know he now because he I pr to because he all here all I know yes I know he my fure Liv you know we were talking the other day Adam's problem was he did what he did and he began to fear yeah and remember I told you that when Jesus came every time he come comes by he says fear not exactly right in other words fear not I'm the second Adam there's no fear in me so don't fear me in the way that Adam feared approaching God right cuz Adam was just a wonderful he just walked up to God and just talked to him but boy when the transgression happened the sin happened Adam said I'm afraid I was afraid I I couldn't face you anymore god well see that's the condemnation that Satan puts us right see that's not what God Said right exactly God's willing to forgive he always will forgive but we're the ones that go running in the other direction hiding and want to make excuses and first one thing and another before we just on up and say hey come B to the throne of grace that's what we'll talk about this afternoon how that God didn't just come die and go back to heaven and just leave all of us to be scattered and and no he he he's still building his family Glory he's building his family the greatest Father Like I said that ever lived on the face of the Earth he was very patient when his first son done what he did he was very patient with Adam and Eve very patient let them bring those bodies into being in a permissive will but when you go back to Jesus Christ there's the perfect will of God Amen the spoken word the spoken word is the Original Seed the seed the word of God the soord is the son of man we'll talk about that this afternoon you love the Lord all Minds clear yes Lord let's bow our heads and we'll say a prayer before we before we leave dear heavenly father we pray Lord that what we said was pleasing to you Lord we pray that the people will take it Lord and put it in their hearts Lord and ponder it as Mary did Lord she pondered those

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3sm-Pr6Mw\n========================================\n\nokay now here's the omitted version shake somebody's hand and say god bless you this morning now for those of you that listen for those of you that are going to camp we need to meet today um we can't meet in between services because i got a sermon to do this afternoon so it won't be long short won't be long be short we'll never run after the second part i've been told my sermon will be short today short meeting i'm sorry but i just we just need to know exactly who's coming and exactly when and if you're not if you're if you're even if you even have a question just say no okay because i don't want to depend on somebody and i know things come up but hey i got a i got a uh a plant manager that's going to be out friday saturday and sunday and they want me to stay at work you better pray because he's having a lung surgery he can't do anything he just came up instantly he's i think he's got um so anyway so that's serious all right but i told him i said look i said that's my ministry for the year for the young kids and i said to me it's just like church and i'm not going to miss it so we'll see how that works out plus uh a company came by just for a testimony for a minute the customer came by friday and we thought he was going to fire us we were doing seven 280 000 pounds of product with them a week they want us to do what's 15 times 40 600 they want us to do 600 000 more pounds instead of firing us so guess what wednesday we're opening the other plant back up again and i'm leaving thursday friday saturday and sunday so you flat for the opening of the plant but me being gone is important i don't know it is awesome that obviously they'll probably be jobs right we need to hire 150 people tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow we need 150 people can you cut chicken no actually we are hiring back the office help we have before so we don't have to need any office out we need general labor so anyway but to god be the glory because thursday we had a meeting thursday and the owners were like hey this we're going to do this if they fire us we're going to do this and we we're going to lose those seven loads but we're going to do this bunch business that's not totally into the story but they said because we've lost this we can do this so starting monday instead of doing 80 000 pounds of size a day we're gonna be doing four hundred thousand pounds a day so i said we need 150 people because they weren't expecting cooked foods they were expecting them to fire us so we'd have this to take over well now we got both of them make a long story short 15. 30. 1.2 million pounds of product is going to be going through the plant starting monday if we can get enough people where it was only 400 000 pounds but anyway but the the glory behind this is is i told the lord i said i've had enough of this up and down business we go in the meeting and we're going to lose everything we're going to meet and we're going to gain everything we're going to meet we're going to lose everything we're going to meet we're going to gain everything and i said lord i don't want that to happen about three o'clock friday morning i just woke right up lord just said it'll all work out they were so fearful friday morning that that company was going to tell us you know get out of here as soon as that man walked through the door because i know it as soon as that man walked through the door i could look in his face and i could have walked in and told him they're not gonna fire us they gonna give us three times more what we're doing so don't do it if you're just asking right all right let's get finished with this we're going to finish this up and then next sunday we probably won't have sunday school because most of us will be gone okay um we just won't have it for the sake of just nobody being here much and then the next sunday lord willing june and i will be in saint augustine florida um preaching brother keith brown so we'll be on that sunday but i had already asked brother joe last week if he would take that weekend and i'm not knowing that brother keith brown was gonna call you know he called it wednesday right so i asked you lord knows how to work everything out he knew it before i did he knows all things so we know the lord's on he's on the scene so let's turn to revelations 21 and let's try to finish this up today with a parallel between the millennium and the future home just for a recap we know that the millennium i'm gonna back up so you can all see that the millennium we know is time all right i kind of made kind of self-explanatory here millennium is time we're still in the seventh day rest we don't enter the eighth day until we get into the future home but now listen you and i that are born again this morning we're already in that eighth day all right we're already in eternity already have crossed over from time to eternity that's why the bible can say we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus already eternal but there's a process like everything there's a process to this and the process is that we we had sin over here in the garden man fell man came through the old testament came to the new testament god testifying and we'll kind of look into that this afternoon in the appearing and the coming of the lord like brother dale's been preaching but i want to kind of take it in a little different angle um but what happens here is then everything after the it kind of hooks in with the daniel 70 weeks that we've been doing at the end of that last week to the jews to the world then you start blending into the millennium but it's still time time is still going on we're still going to have days and times and seasons all right now remember here is going to be atomic fire right that's going to destroy the world bottle of armageddon we're going to come back into the millennium after a three and a half year wedding supper the millennium will be the bride's honeymoon all right right but it's going to be our eternal home because we're in our eternal home right here in in this this man will be body spirit soul eternal but the world has to come behind and follow through right right right so in the millennium he's not going to be to us a son of david because the bible says that he'll sit on the throne of david ruling the 12 tribes of israel now we'll be sitting on the throne with him but in the millennium is our honeymoon but to the jews it'll be the time of the building of this temporary city and i believe the reason that in ezekiel 40-44 you can read that that's a temporary city because that city will be destroyed after battle of gog and magog all right because everything will be destroyed battle of gog and magog they'll be everything will be gone right um in the millennium he'll be the son of david to us he's already all in all but when we get into the future home that's when he's all in all to everybody all right so that's the difference between these two it's our honeymoon it's our eternal home in the future home this is just a honeymoon now basically in a type your honeymoon where you go on your honeymoon is not your permanent home right usually you go off somewhere now some of you go home somewhere but what i'm saying is normally okay if you go on a honeymoon you don't want to just go back to your house you want to go somewhere special and enjoy all the pleasures that are there all right then go to your normal home right or eternal home all right so that's for the bride that's the bride's honeymoon we'll be here for a thousand years just to walk through the earth to go into this temple and be able to explain to each person of the 144 thousand maybe they'll they know about this temple but they don't know all the significance about this temple what it meant to go into justification outer court inner court and holy holies all right so you and i will be able to expound to them and then from that it's going to convert after sin is done away with because remember sin is still here in the millennium it's not in the millennium but it's still alive all those demons that that depressed you they're still somewhere but they're not on this earth brother branham said they're bound with a chain the bible says angel goes and gets the chain binds the devil puts him in a pit why is he why is he bound he's bound because you and i are eternal we have an eternal mind the only people he can get to is maybe the heathen that may be raised up in the millennium i don't you know that's something we don't even need to be discussing we just need to make sure we know how to get there all right now the bible says we'll build houses and gardens and etc and in the future home there's no building because we're going to read right here in just a second that home was built when jesus in john 14 says i go to prepare play i go to prepare a place for you that's not the millennium millennium is a natural happening still in time still god can still walk among us though still jesus christ can walk among us but this earth and some of the things that are around are still going to have spirits but they're going to be bound but at the battle of gog and magog those spirits are going to be killed sin is going to be done away with everything's going to be brought back to its rightful position temporary world that's exactly what it is it says heaven and earth will pass away in other words the old the old form of the earth will pass away we'll have a temporary world but if the devil's still around somewhere it's not perfect right or eternal until all this is done away with and then it converts into an eternal world here what we're talking about all right after the battle of gog and magog which burns see it's the type of brother brown or uh john said to baptize you with holy ghost and fire baptize you with the holy ghost when he gives you the holy ghost and fire which will burn this guy up that you're looking at and he'll become eternal same thing with the world world's gotta go through the same process you and i went through justification under moses sanctification under jesus baptism of the holy ghost under the fire of god only in the fire of man the holy ghost is your earnest it's not the full redemption it's the earnest but right here is where we get our fullness but the world doesn't get its fullness do you understand this world gets its fullness because we're baptized with the holy ghost and fire we get a body change here then the world has to be changed temporary world turns into an eternal world same world it's just made eternal same body right right it's just made eternal temporary city ezekiel 40 through 44 is a temporary temple all right but this one we're going to talk about now revelation 21 and 22 is an eternal city it'll never change there'll be no difference in it from from eternity to eternity all right this city is going to change this city is going to be destroyed right here is the city that abraham looked for right the bible says we have no continuing city i mean they're continuing down here but we have one that's not right this city right here in in its earnest form is in me and you now that's why it says the earnest of your resurrection the earnest brother brownson when you get the holy ghost you just get started it's a little dip then you have to grow all right same thing with the world it gets a temporary burning right here then it has to go through the millennium then it goes through the fire of god then the eternal city comes in revelation 21-22 now let's read it and then we'll okay listen before we read is there any questions the white throne that's the fire of god the white throne is the fire god which is the judgment seat and that's where you and i'll sit and we don't judge the 12 tribes of israel the bible says the saints will judge the earth right angels will even have to be judged by humans that are born again born again human beings all right but the white throne judgment after the white throne judgment you're going to see that god's going to come down and burn every bit of this off and then brother the bible i keep saying brother but he quotes the bible says we read it right here let's go back to chapter 20. verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth god and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is the sand to the earth what satan do in some way he's unlocked that fifth dimension or or whatever and he's going to bring everybody up all the demons in the world it's ever been because brother brown said demons don't die spirits don't die they just move from one place to the other he said the same demon that was uh that was in legion when it went into them pigs when they died when the pigs died the devils left them and just went in some more people all right so now dog and make all together together the number of whom to sin and see and they went up on the breadth of the earth and come past the camp of the saints about and the beloved city now that's got to be the millennium city all right that's not the city that's not it's not the city coming down us what's the problem yeah absolutely that's the biology manga are we really going to be tested well no but look listen and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city that's us we're down here living in this millennium right and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them burnt them up didn't burn us we already had our burning it's going to burn them up now the question was and i agree that i don't know whether that's going to happen before the white throne or after it looks like to me it could be either one but it looks like to me more that somewhere because remember scripture is not exactly verse one two three four five and that's the way it happens there's a lot of things inserted taken out so you could insert maybe right in here in the beloved city stop right there and then that's when the white throne judgment comes in because god's got to judge those demons before he can do what he's doing if i understand he's got a he said just god everybody's going to have a judgment all right and remember brother brown said god made the heavens and the earth period then he started with the very next sentence he said it could have been a million or a billion years in between those two those two verses right here we could see that and compassed the camp of the saints about in the beloved city well hey if you've got all the saints if you got all the dead if you got all the demons what a time to have a white throne judgment right because that's where it's going to happen everybody's going to be gathered together right because right here it's going to tell you about the great white throne in verse 11. and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are in other words there's some people going in first that beast in the false prophet must be going in first it shall be tormented day and night forever and i saw a great white throne and him sat upon it whose face the earth and heaven fled away and there was found no place for them what a place right there for to be the battle of gog and magog right in there somewhere all right and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened another book was open which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in the death death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written and the book of life was cast into the lake of fire now let's have a battle of gog and my god because the battle of gog and magog kills spirits it's a spiritual right then the earth is going to get its total cleansing because chapter 21 is a continuation john's standing after that saul what a new city come down now until we had a prophet we didn't know what all this happened but brother brown said that a mountain's going to push up right over there where the other one did in jerusalem the mountain's going to push up brother brown said he said look he said same place abraham fed cafta melchizedek is the same place that that mountain's going to push up right there in palestine right up there so actually he was looking for a city and it was right under his feet in a natural sense the mountain but see that mountain's not the city that mountains where the city's going to sit on i mean i can see that's so plain that that mountain is going to it's going to come up you know and it's not going to be just a straight shot it could be you know it could be just like this it's going to be 1500 miles so they may be 500 miles between a dip and a right and a rise a dip in their eyes there's one thing for sure this is where the lamb is going to sit and the throne will be and then what's going to happen i believe is is guess what that part is going to come from here set down on this and and i put it for illustration two lines but in actuality it's one line right it's just going to sit down right on every curve and nook and cranny those houses are going to just sit right down and you it's going to be you and i standing on that mountain and then what we're going to do is we're going to okay brother branham gives the illustration that we'll go up and see that he's the on that will worship him all right that's what it says on the bottom and then now you're going to have your wall which is going to be 212 feet high which that's not too high 1500 miles is gonna be way above that then you're gonna have your your your gates three gates on each side three fours is twelve they're all going to have the name of the apostles and all that foundations are gonna be abraham isaac jacob and joseph the four corners all right let's read i saw a new heaven in the new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away there were no more sea and i john so and that didn't say that didn't say ocean i said see okay well don't worry there's going to be water there's going to be an ocean now john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and what do you do when you're a bride you start with your body and then what do you do you put on the garment put on this stuff and all that stuff put on them real tight things to make you look skinny on that day but you don't put on your worst you put on your best and that's what this city is going to be it's what you and i have been putting on down here because this city is built on the word of god which the word of god is in you and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men now that god is the same form and same i got a circle in my bible i looked it up it's the same as genesis 1 1. right same because you look because it's god with the people treaty it's not god it's not big o.g anymore god's with his people in the beginning god because remember we were there with him in in theophany right in the beginning god that same god is the same in the greek as this god so i wrote my bible back to the beginning and that's exactly what it is it's total restoration from where in the beginning god started this thing and that same god that started it is going to finish it and you and i are part of it behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death no sorrow no crying there shouldn't be any more pain but former things have passed away he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new now you see that remember daddy preached on that not too long ago why is that not in red every other thing that jesus who is almighty god has said has been in red letter because he's back to the all in all he's back to the beginning why didn't you why didn't you go back to the beginning because everything that god spoke into existence is not in red letter but that creator god was jesus christ right but he's come back to his original form you and i are with him now outside of him so he's come back and he's who's he talking to you and i you don't have to be in red letter all right behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega now who is alpha omega people always talk who is for the media the bride he's out the alpha bride no mega bride it's the same right he's sending me and he's done now i'm alpha omega the beginning and the end i was given to him the thirst to found the water of freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things i shall be his god and he shall be my son which are fearful and unbelieving and abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the label which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death showing that john's saying hey these people are not going to be here they were but these people are not going to be here all right and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit through great high mountain and showed me that great city now he don't sound here and show him a bunch of people but by revelation we see that the people are the city because he said he said come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and say come heather and i'll show you the city huh because if you were to read this i'd read come heather i will show thee the bride of the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and there stood a great bunch of people they didn't say that he showed me a great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god which goes back to chapter 21 verse one and two having the glory of god and her light when you say the city of lula turned out for a parade the buildings didn't all walk up to the edge of the road and the houses all of them didn't pack up next to the road and wave their little flags no the people of the city of lula but when they say it they say the city of lula came out all right all right and he had it and had a wall great and high let's start right there stop right there her light was locked into a stone most precious even like a gas stone clear as crystal all right so i gotta answer uh sister got a question but we may take one more because i want to finish that chapter and go to the next one so you know keep that in your mind for a few weeks put it on hold pause and we'll try to get into it all right kathy will you uh when you were talking about building houses okay you said there won't be no man-made stuff won't you just speak the word well i didn't say there wouldn't be no man-made stuff i just said there wouldn't be no listen you ever thought about this everybody gets so carnal when they're supposed to be spiritual and they get so spiritual when they're supposed to be carnal think about this you think well my gosh i'm going to have calluses i'm going to be sore i'm going to no we're thinking we're thinking in human terms but let me prove one thing to you well i get this cramp out of my foot back in the bible there was a man named solomon solomon remember david said god i don't want you to dwell in a little tent i want you to dwell in a house and god said that's wonderful build me a temple then david did what he did with bathsheba and god said i've taken that away from you but your son will build me one now what did the bible say happened to the building in that of the building of that temple what'd he say what'd the bible say there was not a sound of a hammer how in the world can you build something so glorious as a temple that was uh solomon temple was the greatest temple that ever was and the bible said there was not a sound of a hammer brother branham said those pieces fit together without any hammer and nails that's during the sin curse that's during the earth when we were building things i believe it'll happen the same way if you have one time in the natural i won't worry about it right here so it will be like it is speaking the word but i think we'll put the thing together i mean i'm just dumb enough to believe that solomon and if you'll remember in the book i think they cut the stones away yes they did they did and you remember who that was gentile that's right gentiles solomon made a pact with this man and i because uh i'll find it for next time because brother uh uh tim humes was preaching on unity fellowship when we started going to the medicine meeting and he preached on solomon and whoever this guy was this guy was a gentile and he lived on the coast and he had the river frontage and all that stuff and solomon just said hey i need this and so and that's and so and thus and so and the guy just brought it to him and all they do is when they brought it to israel they just went like a like lincoln logs and they just started putting the thing together all everything fit fit perfect i don't see why we that same thing can't happen now we'll do this because we want to now i believe the millennium temple will be constructed by the jews right because the bible said it would be built by their hand just like the pyramid they said sure exactly there's no way you could have a machine that put that together like that well it's all going to be because of the spoken word so this is like donnie said the spoken word made the first temple god said solomon you'll build the temple for me right won't be no sound of a hammer it won't be no sound of a saw it'll be put together in other words what he was doing he was showing a prefigure of this and this right only in earthly terms way back in the old testament because he never wanted to dwell in a city but he always wanted to dwell in this eternal city because who is that eternal city me and you that's what he wanted all right good questions\n"}, {"id": 23909, "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE:

eternity let's talk about jesus let all the worlds away the power and majesty of such a wonderful let's talk is jesus is let's talk about jesus such as is is amen that's wonderful let's all stand this time we'll change over the service send a black notebook number 28 open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart yes i want to see you shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy holy amen that's your desire yeah do you want to see him amen amen he's resurrected sitting in heavenly places yeah we're already raised up supposedly into another dimension amen maybe when we get in another dimension we won't have time changes we'll have to worry about right little donny that's right you know me i announced it at the office several times not someone else too my brother chris forgot something that's okay in october you can forget and all y'all that are late will be an hour early but when you do it this time makes you an hour late so but goodbye to the house of the lord we still have to go through time i'm still here so you love the lord had a good week today seems like a special day to me i don't know to you but this seems like a special day i was um texting bro tom ernest sent me a text this morning said to tell all of you hello and that he loved you and that uh that he said soon probably so that he's out in wichita his home church so you got your bibles let's go ahead and turn to first peter three and get started i didn't bring my diagon out this morning so we'll just read it out of the out of the regular scripture i think you kind of got the the gist of what the diagrap was saying the original being joint heirs instead of just heirs being joined heirs together of the grace of life and that's what we're going to talk about today but the role of the man in doing so there must be headship because we are sheep and we must be led there's got to be someone above us to lead us and guide us like the holy spirit is our god he's to lead us and guide us into all truth is that correct amen all right so let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father we pray today lord that you would again come among us lord in a special way father not as a bystander but an active participant you take over this flesh lord and take over the ears and the eyes of the of the hearer than the seer lord that that we may see what's given to us in this endtime lord we've given we we've been given an opportunity to fulfill your word something that paul and a lot of many of those people those people in the old testament and even in the new testament could not do lord they could not completely take the whole word of god and break it down and and line it up lord where we line up with you but now in the end time you give us that opportunity you sent a prophet lord you sent us the word through that prophet to give us strength lord and to break these things down for us and we take his words and we read them father we know that that was you speaking to us lord so now i pray that as as we speak did it not be man's words or not be a a man's quote but let it be a living reality let it be something that we take home lord and and take part of father and if anything be said that that's not it's not smothered just smothered with the holy spirit lord let it be taken out of our life lord just let it be totally saturated in you lord when we do that then everything falls in line father we pray for the sick it's not here lord be with them and bless them be with the sickness here among us in the sanctuary that should take it away from them father as the word goes forth may you seek and heal and save the lost be with each one father take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit we pray these things in jesus name amen first peter 3 chapter 1. likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives we'll get into that a little bit more when we talk about the wives but today is going to be the role of the male or the husband while they behold your chaste or clean conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that half of be that outward adorning of planting the hair and wearing of gold and putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament that's what it is now see but let it not be let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament what this is the part that's not corruptable the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price for after this matter in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well there's a stipulation there we'll get into that when we get into the to the female part and are not afraid with any amazement he's taking fear out remember fear is what got us here likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor and to the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being joint heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered and you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we come to the time now where we've we've got the uh the marriage part i hope you've really really enjoyed the marriage part now we're going to break it apart and when you break things apart it gets a little more touchy because you got to get down to where you live now you can kind of you can kind of hide behind the husband and wife roll because we're married we two are one you know amanda i'll hide behind him should you get behind me no we're gonna see today man you gotta be first you gotta be first in everything right you gotta be the first one not the first one that thinks of everything thank goodness because we're not infallible sisters today i'll promise you one thing you'll learn we're not infallible right but there's one thing that is infallible and that's the word of god amen if you take the word of god and use it as your head man coming down to the sisters if you stay in line stay in the line of the word then you will not ever fail all right because the words infallible all right so now just to review a few minutes uh you can go ahead and pull that quote up if you want to uh the first one but talking about three-dimensional love everybody understand that we you there's two dimensions in the world that love and that's your body and your spirit but if you don't have that inside of the inside that third round that soul where you can connect now we're not soul mating right now i don't agree with that i don't think that you but still but still in every error there's truth somewhere in there in error there is truth because if you truly are one you're not the same soul we know that but when we come back to eternity or if you have the new birth and i have the new birth then you do have the same soul all right okay so we can safely say we're not soul mating down here but we can safely say that god's doing it all right man now when god put something together that's why the bible says that's why when jesus come he said whatever man puts together may not be right he said but whatever god puts together let no man try to take it exactly let no man try to take it away in other words why he's wanting to put it together is he not perfect he's perfect when he puts something together all right so when you're together as one in christ then then you're perfect we've got to understand that even our role of husband and wife that we saw all of our fallacies and all the things that we did wrong and then the things that we did right we still see that as human beings we're wrong most of the time as human beings right but like i said before you're going to see today if everybody will take their position you say oh my position is way on up here well prove it yeah pretty much now i'm not saying that back i'm not saying that boastfully i'm saying we gotta prove it we gotta prove it right but we gotta start in these primary things if you can't be the head of your own house now before we get started like i said the other day some of you don't have your wives here some of you don't have your husbands here i am these quotes i took off not singling out any one person okay now i'd be lying and standing here and i'd leave this pulpit but i i didn't have one person in mind but i know a lot of you don't have your spouse here but i'm going to read to you what brother brown said i'll let him tell you then you can talk to him about it all right i'm just going to put you the quote down and i'm not going to you know skewer it or or put my own interpretation in it i'm going to read you what what it says so if you look at this one remember never argue have respect for each other all right i thank you man's filter this is the last one we read last sunday so in the review of what we're doing here listen over the grace of god that he will give us understanding of such great mysteries as paul spoke here further on down in ephesians speaking of the husband and wife saying said this is a mystery what is a mystery he just tells you right how the woman should be in respects to their husband right great mystery even the second place i believe it is the entire scripture that reverence was ever spoken to said the woman seeing she reverts her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life now that's what we're going to talk about today the role of the man seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god man because if you don't she's not right and you know what if you don't and she's trying to serve god you're out of the picture i'll read that to you just a little bit because if you tell her to do something contrary to the word of god your husband tells you something contrary the word of god he's not your head anymore exactly but now brother ram does tell you to still respect the man because that's your husband that's the man you marry all right and if and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man reverend and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of god then the woman children and all women children of all should respect that servant of god with reverence and everybody says amen is that right now go to the genesis 3 16 this is why that we have this situation we talked about something last sunday but genesis 3 16 until the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee amen all right so there's where your double covenant comes in where man is the ruler now over the woman or the weaker vessel amen thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee all right now under the double covenant this is what we're under right now we're under that covenant where man is the ruler right he's the head he's the head ship sisters whether you like it or not i'm going to read some quotes that that that you may not agree with but you're disagreeing with the prophet you're not disagreeing with me first corinthians 11 3 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ that's the first thing that's the first thing there's that third dimension yeah because without god in that in that soul who's your head satan's your head because you're only you're only two powers amen the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god so we see it every bit come down through there christ when he was on earth he had honor to his father which was in heaven is that correct he knew the one inside of him was greater than this one right here than his flesh man all right he wasn't two people he was one god but he also knew that one inside of him was the one that ruled everything all right is that correct that's one that don't bother me that's one true living god because you know what this is going to get back to when you see god and adam and eve in the garden if you were god standing looking at god the way i explained it yeah he see one that's right you see three right right you see one if we were to look and say well no no there's god and adam and eve no there's god and god made flesh in another form right and then god made flesh in another form amen and then god made flesh another form but what happened satan got to eve and it stopped that exactly right instead of it being god made manifest in another form dick addison sanger dale et cetera et cetera et cetera saying stopped it right right then we had to wait a little while right we had a little wait a little while till that head could come back amen right he didn't leave we're using these words for our own good god never left right yeah we left him right exactly so he couldn't get to us that fellowship was broken by what fear right adam said i'm afraid well then god said i'll put enmity i'll put a division between me and you in other words you're not going to see me like you should until i come back and i come back in flesh and identify who i am he said if you see me you see the father so he was identifying the father right that was in him right then he's telling us now in corinthians which the corinthians had a problem right ephesians didn't have no problem right they were a mature group of people but the corinthians always had problems with marriage and divorce yeah so here is paul coming in in verse 3 of chapter 11. he said would i have you know that the head of every man is christ starting right there right then or and or even the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god right so guys if you're born again you're in the most godly position you can be in according to the scripture right i said according to what you can be in right right excuse me you want to hear that one more time man if you're born again you're in the most godly position you'll ever be in if you stay a man be a man be a husband be a father you are in the position and sisters you're going to see that we're going to talk about that revelation with the sisters where paul said this is a revelation right that a woman reverence her husband well let's go spiritual let the bride reverence christ amen same thing okay you can't separate it but we gotta separate it to get the role of the man under the double covenant we gotta get the role of the man where the man is the one and i'm going to read you some some things that brother brown said that'll shock you maybe but let's go to ephesians 5 and 23. now what is ephesians paul doesn't have to explain so much to the ephesians right exactly because they understood just like we should understand today excuse me my brother andre was saying you know we we've we've got it all here brother claude you know we we i don't say we got it all but i'm saying every revelation has ever been preached in this message have been preached from here so being preached from here then if you didn't accept it you've come out from under your headship that's right let's get back lined up under our headship amen and our headship is christ for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body all right now also but now look the husband can't save his wife right if she's lost he can't save her right right but let's look at that a little deeper if she's a christian and he's a christian she can be saved by the husband i'm not talking about saved and baptizing into the body see i'm talking i'm getting double double scripture here he is the savior of her body right you're the savior of your wife's body right because she can't be circumcised you're circumcised and she's under you that was in the old testament but in the new testament we are all under circumcision but still i'm gonna read you some quotes where she'll never have to give an account for us but we're gonna have to give an account for her so if we can bring her back under that headship savior of the body everybody understands that too far out i don't think so because we're supposed to be one flesh right all right now listen to this did we did you put this up brother joe the note yeah listen the man needs to understand that's what we're going to talk about today both services are going to be on the man so the females you can come back this afternoon you still beat them we're still beating on the mail a man needs to understand his role i looked at her a few minutes ago and i thought man they either didn't turn their clock forward or or uh everybody decided to go fishing but gary crash was here so i know you weren't using this boat a man needs to understand his role so he can know how to act and react to situations in a marriage that's your position man and be obedient to that position the female should also understand what the male's role is so she can help him right you're not gonna pull apart right so if today if you sisters will listen let god and let the prophet and the scriptures tell you what you're supposed to be looking for so even though you some of you young ladies that are not married are looking or maybe on the internet that's looking this will help you to find somebody that maybe is already in that position and thank god because boy your life will be a whole lot easier oh yeah right right i said a whole lot easier i didn't say easy i said a whole lot easier the female should also understand what the male's role is so she can help him she's supposed to be to help me right right what one given to help all right fulfill his role you take to help me out so she can help him fulfill his role according to god's word because if sisters if you rule the house you have not you have not only dishonored yourself you've dishonored your head right now you've took him out of his position you took him out but man if you know what you're supposed to do and you let her take him out it's doubly on you the man can put the woman back in line but the man has to put the man back in line a woman can't put the man back in line everybody understand that right i mean you can get all jumbled up there but the man is the head he's the one that's going to put his self in christ should put him in line brothers we got to listen to god we got to listen to god and in the situation the things we do we got to listen to god and do the godly things to bring our sisters maybe that are not in the sanctuary with us or our brothers to bring them under that but how are we going to do it if we don't understand our role right so he can know how to act and react to situations in a marriage i know we've all reacted wrong yeah right there man to into a lot of situations we've reacted wrong why that's what i said you know a couple of sermons ago pray before you fight that's right then fight nice yeah but i always told the kids you don't quit fighting i said fight nice but look man be obedient to that position right you're not this great big king ruler that has nobody over you because right there with you is the king of kings amen he's the ruler he's the one that rules but then the female should understand though that through you man through you you can be put in line through the man the woman can be put in line and be under subjection and do the right thing for god everybody understand that say amen amen all right now a few things i want to say that i didn't have that i didn't write down but we need to sisters you need to compliment him you're you're not an accessory like a purse or an accessory like a a new belt or a wallet or something no your your june is me mate manifest in another form right amen but it is another form and it's another form that you've got to deal with right she's not made like you man's made masculine we're made to think things out we're made to do you know do different things we're we're supposed to you know build the nest not sitting on the eggs right right i know i don't know there are some birds eagles certain things that sit on the nest but in most cases men are not supposed to have babies so that's what the female female is more of a homebody right she's more the emotional she's more of the of the you know you say well we're going to go out and eat you know we're going to go out and eat and we're going you know i come in i i brought the i brought the money in this week and we got some extra money we're going to go out and eat she's like honey we ain't got enough money to go out neither or i'm not hungry or something you gotta agree compliment him say hey i appreciate that but now remember one thing you got to support him yeah you know what support me that's like you got an army out here fighting you got to bring up the support you got to support that man but now look you said well i wouldn't support my man well you know what he may not be in his position yet or you may not be in your position yet but we got to understand our position you've got to be supportive right whatever it is sarah supported abraham amen in two things that seemingly we thought was wrong i'm fixing to give my wife to a king telling you're my sister and she said okay she must have no they've got her ready right read your bible they got her ready she went standing in there fussing and throwing us flinging hair pins and no she was under subjection and that's why she called abraham lord because she trusted him there must have been something there yeah she trusted god enough to believe that abraham was doing the right thing and it's for our example in the end time all right that we are sarah we're supposed to to be like that to abraham but abraham she called him lord or ownership in other words sarah was saying whatever this is he still owns me he's my ruler we took each other and he's my ruler he's my owner he owns me not a slave but he owns me all right and we'll read we'll see in just a little while that that god didn't kill sarah because of abraham amen right god couldn't go and get sarah he had to go through abraham to get to sarah that's why i said if you've got your head shipped right christ your head man you're the head of the female or your wife i'm going to use wife because you can't be headship over women right right okay for your wife all right then what's going to happen is then there you go savior of the body god has got to look at abraham before he looked at sarah he saw a righteous abraham and forgave sarah because brother rabbi said you were reading them in he couldn't touch sarah because she was part of abraham amen and they weren't not like adam and eve they weren't they were not in other words sarah didn't come out of abraham but under all the the the word of god and what god put together let no man take asunder they were so much one that god couldn't destroy sarah without destroying abraham amen all right now what about that today he said oh that's back in the old testament did we tear that page out and throw it out that's come to here let's come to this day to this age all right so let's go and pull up quote number one which is titan church age now this is going to kind of put it all in perspective now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male excuse me that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat right but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail because i'm going to tell you something just a few minutes i'm going to show you you females are sisters you don't have to worry about getting a sermon together you don't have to worry about the souls of all these people in this church no you got to worry about your home right i listen but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted i didn't say that he did any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertains to a man or cut her hair right she has never wear a garment that's pertaining to a male or cut her hair and i know this is closing on holding this but he put it in here i didn't when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself right and when a woman invades the pulpit which is command she must not do she shows what spirit she is being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true in their words man be a lie right amen all right let's go to number two is your life worthy of the gospel may you men that's got your wives and let them be the boss of the house and lead you around may the god of heaven give you grace to set your foot down and bring that woman back to her right mind again she must be crazy i'm going to read that again that's what he said yeah and realize that that's your place in christ right not a boss now but you are the head of the house remember she's not even in the original creation she's only a byproduct we went through that last week she only byproduct of you you see how personal that is right you don't know about adam and eve she's a byproduct of you give by god to you to take care of you what to be your support or your accessory or compliment you but remember we're not infallible we do make mistakes right but if we're god led god's going to keep us in line hey god whips us amen god whips us i actually whip this morning with you cause we're the first partaker i'll read that in just a few minutes she's only a byproduct of you give by god to you to take care of you to keep your clothes clean and fix your meals and so forth she's not your dictator you american women run around with a gob of pain on your face and your nose up in the air it rained and drown you yeah didn't think you're some sort of a dictator you are to assist him but not to a real son of god you are to a but not to a real son of god right all right number three just one more time lord let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you bring back the old-fashioned prayer meeting old-fashioned repentance when they stayed to the altar until they were dead and finished with sin you never seen a woman go to the altar and die out the sin the next day come back with bob hair paint her face there's no such the holy spirit teaches nature does nature of the holy spirit you've never seen women going out and dressing sexy come in and try to cover themselves up you never seen a man that was afraid to stand up and afraid his little wife would leave him or something another because he took the initiative there's a word we're going to deal with he took the initiative well man were man in them in them days they spoke they were man they were they governed their house they were the head of house but this fancy america all right let's go to second timothy two we're going to talk about the head of the house remember what i said about initiative this is where we're going to start now this is where your sisters i want you to understand this is what god is wanting us to do as men as head of the house this is what we're supposed to do the husband that laboreth that's the th on the end of that so if you're married you're going to be laboring every day for years a long time anyway the husband that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits consider what i say paul said the lord give the understanding in all things right okay so men the husband we're the first partakers of the fruit we are to be the head of the house now i've got the definition of head on here but they don't right there but you pull up the next one if you want to head beans top or beginning the head of the chattahoochee is where the chattahoochee river begins that's the head the headwaters all right so it's too it's to it's at the top or the beginning but now look brother brown said you got to take the initiative initiate to instruct in the principle of something to start brothers to start to initiate to take the initiative whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband you're going to see we're not going to talk about much about dating but brother branham hated it that the women were calling to me the boys and things like that he hated that because why that took the man out from under the roll it's put the woman up as the head calling the boys i know what happened this day and age but it didn't change i mean god hadn't changed the man's the male should call the female whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband his role is to initiate whatever is needed to line up with the word of god amen amen his role is to initiate start be the first one be at the beginning glory his role is to initiate whatever is needed to line up with the word of god now let's go to number four quote number four excuse me let's read the whole quote oh my poor dejected friend the devil might have took you sister out yonder to a place where you never do desire to let your hair grow might get you the place where you think that some pastor is nonsense when he's preaching you pure holiness the way you should dress some of you man out there that goes around and does these things you ought not to do and you men that let your wife do a thing like that and smoke cigarettes i got a little respect for you even as a man now that's exactly right you know a man's the head of the house as long as he takes his place you see what the prophet said as long as he takes his place but i but we i i don't i like to see a man a man a man's not judged by how many muscles he's got that's a beast a man's not judged by the brony muscles but he's judged by the bags and the knees of his pants where he's been praying that's what takes a man let's go to the next one number five expectation let's go through the underlying part now brother let's get plum back office territory talk about satan all right let's come back to god come back to the altar rebuild the altar again that's been torn down and build up your home take them cards off the table and all them old love story magazines and open up the bible and read the bible and pray and just don't get down and say bless my family mary and joe and john and all them and get to bed no sir stay there with god oh my that's desperation but you know what to make a home desperate the male the husband must initiate we're the stronger women sorry we are the stronger you're the weaker vessel we're supposed to see things first now that doesn't mean in human terms and human things right you women sometimes are more you know uh thoughtful about even praying for people i guess more than males because you have more feelings involved but i know a lot of times and i've seen it happen in in dad's life and i'm gonna go ahead and say this but my mom's not here but a lot of things mom would question but dad wouldn't give an answer why did you do this why did that happen and jim said why we're waiting on god we're waiting on a clear-cut answer from god whether your opinion is right or not at the time we still got to wait on god now god listens to you sister sure if you don't cut your hair because if you cut your hair he's not listening to you right so just be patient you're supposed to be reverent to the man right man not like um dave ramsey says the last thing a man needs that's down on his luck is a barking chihuahua dog chewing on his ankles so same way in the gospel no those little yappings you're all a dog napping at your ankles when when you're waiting on something from god now it says if you're in that position right that's the question you've got to ask yourself first husbands am i in this position if i am this is what we're going to do amen if not then you get in your position you seek god for answers to your questions all right let's go to the next one number six greater than solomon is here in 1963 and you men that can't stop talking and looking at women and morally dressed the idols of the day you man that haven't got enough real grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such a thing as that the love of god isn't anchored in your heart don't be called the son of god you're still in sodom a man that can't take over his house god ordained him to do yeah and you deacons it's mad two or three times of course we don't have that problem here we praise the lord and you men that run out on your wives and try to hold your profession you women that cross the other way no where's the head yeah you women who's trying to be the head that's what he's saying you women that cross the other way you people that hit behind the cloak of the church shame on you he said yeah shame on you if you don't belong to your crew you have nothing to do with him shame on you shame on your men that won't do what you got to have grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such a thing as that what dressing immorally that's what he's talking about and the men and the men and the boys gawking at the women dressy morally if he would look that in this day in time he'd he would have probably been like uh like somebody was saying one time said lord just put my eyes out yeah you know so i don't see any of it but never where you look in this damn time it's there so let's go to the next one number seven identifications now if you find your place sister don't let don't let me hurt you or brother but you'll find your place in a word as a christian not what the creed said that's down here in this lower cannon fodder that's going to be destroyed right so that's nobody that's born again everybody's not born against cannon fodder right sorry that's what he said your cannon fodder because you're going to be here when he's talking about you're still going to be here when the destruction happens correct see you find your place as a christian because your character is molded as christ amen you are zoe the same as he was zoey amen amen if you're born again today you're as much as zoe is the zoe that's your head christ then if the bible said for a woman not to cut her hair how can you do it right you say a man to be a rule of the house how can you women be what's the matter with you men that sons of god see see you don't find your place see we're wanting to be placed all up in this headstone and we're wanting to have all these places up here up here in the sky have we got our place at home yeah if you say no if you say no don't talk about the other things what brother brown said he said you start climbing up here and he said you think well i'll just have godliness what'd he say you'll fall yeah problem people you'll fall i didn't say that brother brown said that let's read the rest of that you're invited to take come and take his character by having his character in you it mows you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do amen always he said i do always that what the father tells me right let me go one more quote and then i'll uh make a comment this is the token now listen to this they should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now right it's time for to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe christ love and honor and respect one another man respect your wife you respect your home bring your home together because remember now what's he talking about what was the token the blood on the doorpost was not just for the mail it was for everyone in his household but the male had to put it on there first partaker if he was lazy and didn't do it it wasn't just him it was his family was cursed right because the firstborn died right right and you gotta remember if he was the firstborn from his mother and father he died yeah right right it wasn't just the father was exempt and all of us know if he was the firstborn standing there he died man respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one but the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love each other and believers should separate themselves from the world you remember brother around i'm telling the story about the the kid you know walking up to the to the dad inside the house there that night at the of the passover and uh he said that is everything all right he said son everything's all right that's right daddy are you sure everything's all right yeah everything's all right now if he was a dilatory dad and he said yeah everything's all right he didn't put the blood on him and he didn't get his put into his position then his children died and if he was the firstborn he died right and he didn't say okay son why don't you go peek outside and see what's going on no he was the head they come and talk to him he was the one that was responsible for that family and husbands you are responsible for your wives all right so don't think we can sit back and and you know sit back in our easy chairs and say well let's god if we get them lined up no what i'm trying to tell you today you gotta line up first right amen man initiative right you take the initiative she is naturally a follower right sisters you'll naturally follow somebody you trust right because you're feeling your emotion you'll follow something you trust all right so if they can't trust in you brothers you're not in your position so forget about that position right you'll never get to that position until you get to your own position in your house right all right now let me make a comment before we go to governor to initiate or to take the initiative i'll give you an example brother joe canada sitting in the back back there he's the one that does all of our computers and he a lot of times he doesn't get to participate out here in the in the service but he is a man that i respect because he takes his children and what does he do he teaches them he started to teach his children about god is that right that writes this phrasal verb he started teaching his children he took the initiative why he was the head he took the initiative to start a little bible study and those two kids probably know more about the bible than i do that's why we don't let them play bible trivia right on sunday afternoon we start playing a little bible trivia and sometimes you know and sometimes you ain't got a clue right through so-and-so's brother of half-brother of so-and-so and his name's about that long but but as far as the basics of starting something brother josh felt led right see husbands you got to be led yeah you got god's already took the initiative this is this big word right here this eternal word of god he's already wrote down what we got to do he already took the initiative hey he don't need us he could have stayed eternal and stayed by himself for an eternity and still existed he didn't want to right he didn't want to because inside of him he wanted fellowship right he wanted something that he could look at and talk to and commune with right right but he could have because he's self-existing so he didn't need a wife to exist he didn't need friends to exist right but he wanted that so he took the initiative to build a world for us to live on right then he took the initiative to make a man yeah and take a woman out of a man and say here fellowship now i can fellowship with myself right people are like mine but then we know what happened in the garden but you know what god didn't destroy the world he didn't take every human off the earth and start over again no his master plan was starting to roll right his master plan of having head ship he was the head adam and eve right right so brothers what must we do we must take the initiative glory i'm saying everything right but now your wife's gonna come up with some good ideas so don't just we're not saying it's a single thing i'm just saying what god said the head of the house is supposed to be if you're under subjection to your husband he takes the initiative right because listen folks if we make a mistake we got to answer for you and for and to god for me and her all right man if she makes a mistake she's just got to answer to me really i'm talking about a human mistake ain't talking about not being i'm talking about born again believers trying to get in their headship where they make a mistake because remember what the brother brown tell that woman she committed adultery on her husband right she said i've confessed that she said you didn't do it to god right he said you did it to your husband you've got to go tell him remember that's what she didn't want to do right oh it'll tear up my marriage but come to find out he did the same thing but you know what brother brown said they came together confessed their sins and left and brother brown said that they're christians now he was making a comment on how they become real good christian but see she had that so much in her though till she had covered it that's the one that he said that that a 55 gallon oil part owner wouldn't do any good because what she done she had done that and she had stacked it way back into the gable part of her soul she forgot about it in other words but god didn't forget about it right same thing with you and if you ever want to get anything from god you better do the same thing you better come down and confess to your wife have we really confessed to our wife because brother brown said you go confess to him say it then see god's already left you yeah so that didn't mean she was not savable it's just that god wasn't going to hear her until he went to her to the husband now what about a problem here with the village fixing to take this woman that he thinks is abraham's sister and then god says i know you're a righteous man or i wouldn't have told you this right tell us you've got to go get abraham right i bet a villain's head just started spinning around what i didn't do anything wrong no he went to abraham right and abraham restored that kingdom back because that man had to go through headship abraham was the head at the time abraham was the head he had to go back to abraham and apologize for abraham lying to him but that's the way god wanted it done same way with i'm talking about your sisters and men and brothers you got something you hadn't confessed you pray to god from now until the rapture takes place and you probably won't be in it you gotta confess to your wife confess to your spouse right then both of you go to god and say god don't ever let me do that again i'll stay right here under my headship my ruler but teach all right let's go to number two governor govern means to rule or be the lord govern and rule means to what control direct or strongly influence the actions because we can't make you sisters do things the more we try to make you do something it's the worst thing to do right you know i mean if your wife's cutting her hair or she's not coming to church starts throwing her makeup out the window and throwing her scissors out ain't gonna get it right that's right but you can strongly influence her action by the way you act right right you gotta see it in you first she's gotta see it in you first she can't see god no other way than through you to control direct or strongly influence the actions and conduct of others now not to control with an iron fist like brother brown said are to direct god doesn't god doesn't control us with a with an iron disposition or with he with what love grace and all these things he governs but we're supposed to govern right we're supposed to govern but man is not to rule with an iron fist but with love and correction right so we don't control as in dominate right but we control in the fact that hey you're doing this wrong let's listen to what brother brown said or watch what he said let's go to genesis 3 16 though first and read it again until the woman he said i will grate them all apart like sorrow not conception and sorrow thou shalt bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee that's where you governor the rule part all right what's he going to do to control and he shall control or direct or strongly influence your action yeah that's what he's saying the male is going to from now on from now on he's going to to take and he's going to try to control and direct you in a loving sense of way not in a not in a demanding way let's go to first peter then three and read what we read this morning for after this matter in the old times the holy women also who trusted in god adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands trusted god being in subjection even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well know as long as you do that and are not afraid with any amazement right now there's times in our marriage that that that honestly when june and i were were married there was always a fear of losing her because i wasn't born again there was no typos there was no there was no sure i wasn't a christian and she wasn't a christian but when we become christians that just took that thing just exploded that thing out of the way wouldn't matter if she left and went you know went on a vacation talk about going with her sister somewhere she said are you are you you know okay with that i said yeah i'm okay with that i don't have any problem at all because i trust her why do i trust her it's not maybe that i don't trust her i mean i trust her but i trust the goddess in her right man so i trust the goddess enter now she's not born again you better watch out right even being born again saying contempt you enough is like uh it's like we always told the uh kids at the youth banquet it's you we trust satan we don't right right so if you put the two together we don't trust you if you got the devil in you all right all right but we do we gain are not afraid with any amazement in other words right no surprises no surprises jen and i confessed ourselves to each other 12 years ago we're clean we're done that's finished no more to happen again not a problem with that you know what i can do i can put that over here on the shelf and forget about it because that thing's clean man done finished so i'm not afraid of that anymore when we start getting this fear factor out of the way because that's what god started abr adam was fear he had fear in him why you done something wrong right right he does something wrong he was in fear of what god would do to him well if you take a godly person a godly husband and a daughter and wife you gotta worry about that you don't have to worry about it that just takes all that out of the way i want those things taken out of the way glory because remember brother i'm talking about those filters or flues getting stopped up see that stops it up i got this fear i got this fear now brother brown will tell you and i didn't bring the quote but he said have a godly fear is different than being afraid having a godly fear because fear and reverence go together right he's afraid that he wouldn't serve god so there is before he had a fear right that he wouldn't be serving god but he wasn't afraid we're not going to be afraid of god right never are we to be afraid of our husband you're never supposed to be afraid of your husband right all right if you're afraid of your husband and your husband's not in his right role your husband's not in the right role if you're if you're afraid to go home somebody's saying man amen yeah quote number nine do you know ladies it's wrong to wear slacks do you know that do you know it's wrong to cut the locks of your hair off do you know what's wrong mister for you to continue to smoke and act the way you do do you know it's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house your wife get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and say yes bless your heart honey i'll come right back you have not been married for 32 years and i slept on the couch one time that's because the kids were sick and i just sleep on the couch i'm gonna sleep in my own bed she might go somewhere else but i'm gonna leave my bed i heard this one time and it's kind of funny but the guy a guy said he bought these real nice beautiful couches soft leather and all that stuff you know and somebody said well man what'd you spend so much in the couch he said cause i'm gonna be sleeping there most of the time just wake you up a little bit how can you listen to this did you know how can you be a tender at the house of god when you can't even control your own house that's exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not only your husband he is your ruler god said so because that the husband was not deceived the woman was deceived and you preachers will continue to make women pastors and preachers in church knowing that the word of god condenses it now we know who he's talking to he's not talking to us he's talking to the denominational world when he's talking about that but how can you be a tender because remember excuse me a um a bishop supposed to be the husband one wife but he doesn't exactly have to be married to preacher to preach right paul wasn't but if you're a deacon you need to be married who said be control of his family in other words how are you going to be a tender tender or are somebody that has some you know authority in the church how you going to be that if you can't even ruin your own home all right so if you can't control your own house how can you be attended at the house of god that's exactly right your husband's not only your husband but he is your ruler all right so let's go to what's the neck coming up okay while you're looking at that let me read this but being the head and being the one who is to initiate things also means the man is responsible you're responsible anyone in a leadership role is responsible for those who they are to lead and will answer to god for their role right that's why jacob said this is a fearful place the house of god right they're saying that this ain't something that this ain't a job that that i wish on anybody but if it's a job that god gave us to do we're going to do it right now okay but we got to make sure that we're right we're first protectors brother dale's first particularly of the fruit just like we read the husband so see we can spiritualize this a lot but let's just let's stay down here all right why didn't abraham why didn't god kill sarah sitting right there denying and lying right in the face of god sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk said why i never said that she said i never said that uh oh my tell god that he's a liar to his face but he couldn't take her why she's a part of abraham amen he couldn't hurt her without hurting abraham now you women see where you belong and the bible said you women be like sarah was which adorned herself and modest apparel lived honest and true to their own husband loving him so much that i put he that he no he said he and he said she that's what brother brown made she called him her lord ruler ownership all right to initiate and govern brothers we got to remember we're the initiator but we're also the governor got it all right we're the governor of our home we're also the ruler of our home there's things that we must do to clean out our home answer to god you will for not doing it right all right but the best thing to do this is this is just to make it all come together and we'll stop in just a few minutes so i just got a few more quotes we'll stop for this afternoon we know what's right and wrong if we're a message believer or a born-again believer let's say that burning and blood we should know what between right and wrong you know even though if you've been in the message two weeks two months two years you do have a you do there's one thing you know we are supposed to live an exemplary a life better than everybody else exemplary thank you yeah you're supposed to live that before not only your church members it's easy to live a christian life right here easy oh you get the feeling and worshiping the praise god and my brother's over here praising god and my sister will be praying but we hear the message of the hour and we sing our songs and and and i'm being real but go to work go out here go to walmart drive on the highway somebody cut you off man you're supposed to be exemplary you're supposed to live an example life it starts with us not the sisters exactly it starts with the men when we get to acting up it's just going to happen that the women are going to act up it's going to happen yeah sorry but if we get ourselves in line with god and what god wants us to do i'm telling you people i'm going to make this plane and i'm going to make it clear and i may make it clear and plain again we as men as husbands in this message if you're born again believer born again born again and believe the message of the hour and try to live it our life should be there should be somebody say something one day like ain't nobody ever lived a life like that before you've changed you've become a new person a new creature a new creation not just a god your wife your family your neighbors what if the neighbors see you walking around in shorts and smoking a cigarette well i thought he went to that church up there that they didn't believe in that stuff i'm not saying you did it i'm just telling you what what a role you and i should present i'm talking about males now females you can say amen all you want to because i'm on i'm on the mend now you're supposed to be the steward of your own home you're supposed to be the guy that makes the decisions the final decision now not just the but the final decision you're supposed to get the last word and it's not yet there now we're not supposed to be we're not supposed to be that's what i always say i'll get the last word in every argument but you're supposed to come together but sisters if you trust if you trust there's one thing i believe that sister peggy give you believe her husband and trust him so if he said honey we're gonna drive off that cliff keep shaking your head we're gonna die if we're gonna drive off that cliff god's got something in store now i'm not joking because she reverence her husband yes right and whether he'd be wrong i'm not saying you know i'm just for an example will they be wrong she trusts that man enough to know that if he's a godly man he got off somewhere but god's going to bring him in line but he's got to bring him in line first he's got to bring me in line first he's not trying to line up sister june he's trying to line up brother wayne then sister june sees by the way then there's the example is that too far off sisters you gotta look at your husband where's brother joe oh that's right y'all remember brother joe he's in california with us with his daughter and remember her for cancer i just missed him when i walked by there back there and didn't see him here but and that's another example too brother joe's one of the kindest men that i know very helpful but you know what he's that way at home away from us that's what makes a difference he's the same way right he's the same way we should all be the same way we shouldn't we shouldn't put on our robe and our and our priestly uh garments to come to church we're supposed to be that home amen and sisters you're supposed to look up to your husband right look at all your lives i want you to just not today but sometimes go home and just look at yourself and there's always people there's always regrets oh we're human i should have but like brother david marlo and i were talking about his wife uh becky today was 30 something years and she had passed away and i remember when i was younger but he went to the grave he come in today and he said man he said it's a bad day his wife and i thirty-something years ago and sister baker was a godly woman i remember and he said i'm ashamed of all the things that i did afterwards and he said the devil tells me that i'm lost but he's sitting here today i said brother david the reason the very reason you shouldn't believe that is number one that was a liar and the father of it number two is i said sit in sit and sit in here and just get wet get under the fountain you're going to get wet just keep coming to the fountain and i told him i said if it took god to reveal to me today that god take my human life today to save my children let me drop dead but see that's not gonna that's that's making a deal with god you don't do that but you can also say that as a human though and that's what i said brother dave when i said brother david her passing away he said well it might have been different no it's not because that's not what happened but that woman went down with the testimony she was a godly girl pretty girl never know her to even you know say anything wrong i remember when i was little there's the testimony there's the 30-year testimony that goes for eternity that testimony will last right up into glory you know what he said he said he went through the grave yesterday and he told me he said i want to see her again i said you get bored again you'll see her again stay here stay under the fountain stay where you need to be because a life live is better than any sermon and we fail and we make mistakes but men you need to stay men so that your wife reverence you so much that whatever decision if y'all come together and sure it is you need to come together to make family decisions and financial decisions but ultimately sisters the male has the last word in any decision if you decide to do something together that's okay but remember if he's a godly man not just what brother said brother i said if that big word if he's a godly man you got to trust that god's dealing with him in some way to just back off say okay lord whatever my husband decides that's what we're going to do amen but now remember we're going to talk about this afternoon if he does something out from under that if he comes out and says no we're we're no we're we're going to go to the baptist church tomorrow you can go ahead and start cutting your hair wearing come on people right you'll know one thing's for sure he's not under the headship of the holy spirit right right right so you don't have to do that all right there was a situation happening a few days ago or about a week or so ago there was a a person leaving a church him and his wife and they left the church but then they told the pastor they were going to this is a message church they told the pastor they were going to i think claude told you about it when does he not go to his church but they left and then the the man that left told the pastor said well well my wife wants to go here but i want to go to brother clark's church but we're going to start coming here and where's the headship in that right you know what i tell my wife i tell you she wants to get in the car and go to another church go to it right but i'm coming here right because i believe that's what this for the words at right okay but for me to tell the pastor of the church i'm going to that i don't want to come to your church but my wife does so we're going to do what she says in other words that's not right that's not right right and your sisters we'll talk about it this afternoon if anything your husband tells you to do this outside of the word of god then he has taken his self you haven't removed him god has removed him from your headshot right now because he's not coming down under the word of god you're here he's now moved over to here now you're not going to move up here you're still here because you're still supposed to respect that man anyway right i'll read it but brother brown said you respect him but you don't have to go to church with him or don't have to cut your hair do what he says what god's directly speaking to you he's your head right when it comes to matters of the word but when it comes to the matters of us living together and us being husband and wife tell me one thing answer me a question what would happen if one day that did happen one day your husband wants to come up and say we're not gonna go to church there anymore we're gonna go to the baptist church i'm gonna talk about another message church baptist church what would you do sister when you love that husband you love him so much but now let me tell you something this is what the prophet said i didn't i didn't bring the quote but i'm gonna go this way just for a few minutes but you do one thing you still reverence that husband you don't separate yourself from that man please don't because you'll you'll you'll do something that'll cause him to do something wrong maybe same way with you men you know the bible says that if you cause your wife to commit adultery that you're guilty right you cause your wife to commit adultery you're guilty of it not your wife i mean she's guilty of it but you're guilty first but you're the what you're the head you're the one on top you're the beginner on the top you're the one that's supposed to initiate you're the one that's supposed to govern but you'll answer for your role but she won't have to answer for europe but you gotta answer for your role and her role all right let's go to the last quote number 11. but you men are responsible listen now i think that we get that man and woman now a woman is let me get this right good now so that you can see it woman is subject to her husband and the bible said that a man should rule over his wife but how they've changed that the woman rules over the land now you stay home john we're not going and that settled it yes my dear see but let me tell you something mister you're going to have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you you are the head of the woman and god is the head of the man now listen that's in everything right when that double covenant come it wasn't just a double covenant for just adam and eve it stays forever i said forever down here goes back up when we go back to glory right sure you are the head of the woman and god is the head of man therefore he said let the man cut his hair because of christ and let the woman have her hair for his for if she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband see what i mean or what the scripture says all right let's go to 12. questions answers too if i seen a man come in here with long hair hanging down his back like a woman i'd say mister why don't you go to the barber shop you look like a woman see but men usually don't do that in other words men don't even come in with long hair see not as man now not as the infallibility of man they're just as guilty as the woman and by the way a man that'll let his wife do that he's guilty double of it yeah because when you urge her for authority and she's doing it and you're saying it's okay that's where the double part comes in you're guilty for saying it's okay she's guilty for doing it and you're guilty for letting her do it all right i'm sorry this is the prophet not me and by the way a man that'll let his wife do that he's guilty double of it because he's supposed to be the one that has to say so in the house and that man can't even rule his own house how could he do it in the house of god all right i'm not scolding you to be mean i'm only so happy for you i just don't want satan to get foot in any way anywhere see i want you to move upward not backward yeah don't never let no man deceive you by some enchantments or something another looked like or something saying oh well it don't see that's the way satan interprets the word to eve see you believe just what the word says all right all right last one you know i'll make a few comments we'll stop right there and we'll start on uh that god is still the ruler over the woman if her husband is not born again or not a christian questions and answers on hebrews listen here the man is a ruler don't you think don't you think you can rule the house holding the system you're not the ruler of the house you're absolutely you're not a slave now but your help mate and adam the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his wife now read and see if god says that now and then he read the scripture somebody asked a question about that but we've got to be good stewards amen we got to be good stewards of our home that's why a lot of you are taking those classes with the uh financial peace university which is it is faith-based the bible tells us to be good stewards of our money remember remember the guy that went out and buried his money actually god took that money away from you because you didn't do something with it you got money buried in your house i'm telling you what the bible says fixing the spending he said makes his bill fall down it goes the dollars are so folded like this until they won't come out you know they say i'm just telling you what the bible says remember he gave so much to one guy he gave so much to another and so much to another and this guy just hit his money and didn't do nothing with it and the other ones went out and did something with the money what'd he do it was an increase these other ones came out he used their money right they did right things we're supposed to be that right and i'm telling you people exemplary we're supposed to be where they everything we do in word indeed put it in scripture do all in the name of the lord jesus i'm gonna tell you something i heard dave ramsey the other night we we were there and and kind of shocked some of the people but i'm gonna tell you something you us in our finances his daughter bounced the check i told you before june june bounce one check 1981 we'd never bounce another one he made his daughter go to the bank and apologize to the bank president for bouncing the check amen you know why he said because you lied to that banker when you write a check knowing there's no money in your funds you're lying to the bank and saying that it's there and folks that's not godly ain't nothing godly about that it never will be godly and it's never going to be god you'd be a good steward because you know what people are looking at you people are watching you you got it don't spend it right right that's right ain't got it don't spend it right sorry it's like the banker told daddy you know about man's parents you know he didn't he didn't say that because we bounced checked he didn't say that because we foreclosed on loans did he because every time we went to that bank and we needed some money he loaned us money guess what we did we did something very strange we paid it all back yeah on time and ahead of time but you know what you say well that's just that's just man no i'm telling you i'm going to read it this afternoon in a leadership role everybody's looking up to you right so men if we're in a leadership role that's why when jim bounced that check in 1981 i took over the checkbook now honestly i gave it back to her about 10 years ago just in case someone what happened you sisters i know a lot of you control the checkbook and that's fine i don't mind that but you your husbands need to know also so i gave it over to her so if i were to drop dead she wouldn't be lost and not know where to find stuff what bill to pay and how to pay it and all these things uh you know i'm sorry but you're going to give an account for every idle word right right that you do in life but don't say forgive me lord and then do it tomorrow yeah that don't work either right you've been drinking all your life stop drinking right simple it don't drink no more man don't say god forgive me god forgive me god forgive me that's one thing god won't do he won't remember what you've done but he knows your heart right and if your heart's not right see god god is god is willing and saying in the scripture to forgive you why because you got to forget you got a heart that wants to be forgotten that's a problem with a lot of you you don't like change and you ain't going to change because you think you're the big guy standing up here you won't change even in that even in a leadership role we've got to still be soft and pliable we still we never never be hard right never be never be where well bless not if you either got to do it no but if god tells you to tell somebody that yeah you better listen to what god said through that person stop the nonsense all of us males take our role as the head of the house keep your wife under control in godly fear and ungodly love because there's one thing's going to happen if she's not a christian she's going to rebel yeah so you've got to know how to handle that you got to say listen honey we'll read it tonight says listen honey let's just sit down and talk about this don't start going in this blessed goddess bless screaming no say look let's discuss this we i've come to a junction in my life where i'm not satisfied with me god's not satisfied with me and we need to get this thing all back together again because like brother brown said without the home in harmony there's always going to be friction there's always going to be those human emotions and sisters you all have the human emotion side more than the man does but i just want to make sure that you understand that because remember when we start talking about the man is a leader we'll go back to ephesians 5 this afternoon as man is the leader he's under the leadership of christ right we lead christ leads us we leave the body or the woman we'll read that this afternoon so let's stand let me read this one thing i'll read it back tonight be careful how you use a role of a leader yeah be careful there's one you need we'll talk about this afternoon be careful being the role of a leader right all right or a ruler because you can be a ruler and become a dictator right or you can become a ruler what brother brown say power without character is satanic or dictatorship but power with character respect to what rule amen what not just this man but your whole family right man we get us in line you know i i don't i don't agree with the if we get our wife lined up we're going to no i believe if we get lined up our wives will get lined up right hey man is that the way it's supposed to be right i didn't make it i didn't make the rule but god told us that our headship was christ and that the woman's head right was the man we can't change that you know what he made provisions for us to live under that and be happy right you hear me one more time he made provisions for us to live under that kind of headship and be happy with it man is happy with a good wife wife is happy with a good husband in this role of leadership let's know 37 inspiring 37 inspire book let's sing praise lord he can't mold you if you're already hard but when your clay and water is there you're pliable he can move am things of the world you know not the world but the things the day-to-day action that we have today let's support glory where they come from oh absolutely oh is we all shall see amen he doesn't leave with iron fist so we should he doesn't leave he leads with nail scarred hands just take this and man it's wonderful when you put it in your mouth but paul said it was real bitter when it got in your belly why but it was starting to become a part of you and you were going to have to live we got to live this thing people we cannot there's not going to be 1160 sermons in glory laid on the shelf somewhere no we're going to be that 1160 sermons we're going to be those 66 books of the bible we're not going to have to go adam said or over here and jeremiah no jeremiah's going to be there i mean it was a part of what he wrote right right he's going to be there glory all of them's going to be there but you know what you know what so what a blessed feeling is you're going to be able to tell jeremiah the revelation glory of what he was talking about exactly you're gonna be able to say jeremiah you remember all those symbols you saw ezekiel you saw that wheel in the middle of the wheel you saw them four beasts ezekiel never witnessed those four beasts in his own personal life right the line of men and eagle did it but we do but that was what we pull out of the word put in us in our heart and we don't have to read ezekiel i mean we do you understand what i'm saying but we don't have to go to ezekiel to get it that's that's real that's catholicism right if you're traveling today sister sister and brother benny let me read over here this traveling saint he wants to read you this prayer because he's standing there beside you now no that's catholicism right right that's just being good readers yeah right but we got a reading study but but the role of the mail we'll finish the rest of it this afternoon but but guys we got to step up we got the ones that not take control as being a a dictator but taking control of our our life taking control of our family if something going right in your in your house you're responsible right that's right you're responsible man that's why brother brown said you apply that token just like that man did you know what if it'd been me i'd have made sure i would have not just put a little bit i got the biggest lamb i could find that had the most blood and i would have absolutely took that hits up not one hits a branch i pulled up the whole i pulled the whole tree up and i shoved it in there and i made sure why i wanted to make sure that's what we got to do check up and make sure but when that father went inside son says daddy is everything okay right because he's the firstborn son his life's on the line right his daddy says son everything's okay okay all is well then we'll dismiss right oh o'clock is foreign is is is is oh you\n"}, {"id": 23910, "text":

your word keep us in your love in jesus name Matthew if you like to read Matthew 5 and then we'll go to 2nd Peter one we've been on this part while speaking on this topic in and we'll try this afternoon to how you know to be able to that questions and answers and times and be able to just to discuss it no when I go when I'm going to use the spray okay i'm getting a word to pull the string that clip sr when i'm going to use it we just read the scripture okay to matthew 5 4 43 you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate down the enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you what that ye may be the children of your father in other words you may have the nature of your father because that was what he had right that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven or he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust or if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so many summed it up by saying one know where this is the way to be like the father right be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect alright let's go over to the first Peter down to stick of it a scripture first first Peter I might've said second Peter by the first Peter first Peter one when we get reading the verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that khurshid do it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and glory or at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet being believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul of which salvation the prophets have desired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should comin to you searching water what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed now once these revealed them that it wouldn't happen in their day speaking of us coming down right unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel and to you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which sings the angel is desired to looking into we're for now watching gird up the loins of your mind of the sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ and they succeeded the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word nobody get it too hot lately may have to click a little about her where we can survive right but now as I said I've been trying for a while to speak about something that I'm leaving it's been needful to each and every one of us in it and trying to bring it now its message 18 and I know I'm pretty slow but that's the way things go you just keep on going and do it too to understand the the word and I you know you can't you can't exhaust the word so you just keep believing it enough we've been talking about the topic of what be there for perfect now and a human morals realm life me and you you know us there is no way for any human mortal to be perfect he calls that the way we're born is the psalmist David said we were born in sin shape with an iniquity equipped with three scriptures together and we were spouse from our mothers wound and go forth a liar you you you don't want to say it about them but you look down in a little baby you know and you see it and you say well that value is a product of mother and Daddy through the wedding bed you know you know coming forth but still it's born in this realm out here we're all born in a realm which belongs to the devil like one that even the Lord Jesus or remembering the temptation there that Satan offered him this and he offered him that offered him he said all the kingdoms of the world well jesus never argued with him did it hide he just said get behind you say no cuz it even out of argument with him about it because Satan does own all of this all of this out here in the world belongs to Satan in his domain and that's why the trouble is so horrible among the other thing around the world today is it Satan knows he had just a little season the Bible said so he's doing everything he can to tighten it down and everything else and you know and destroy mankind because that's his purpose but see the lord jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect well now that's the requirement he didn't say maybe you will my hope he will think about it you know whatever he just made a statement be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect well then if he made that statement our requirement that he must be able in some way to produce that whatever would take to be able to make a person perfect and we as human mortal we can't be because we're bored ears our mind or are thinking this is a whole messed up because of all of the things that happened in life and it always say to you about a little baby you know we love them and they're so sweet but yet they little baby when it opens his eyes in the nursery Verena in the hospital the first thing it here's the first thing it sees it right and then it here's a couple of nurses and they said well if that blankety-blank little baby come in here messed up her to all our whole day you know and we were going to have some funds another in the poor little baby he starts out wrong right you know you said well I don't an open well here you go back to very different lives it does you know and then they're always said my head yours a full moon you know we're gonna have a bunch of babies tonight so what you know but it's it's the fact in a way that we're born and perverted all right then it's surely a fact if we know that we need salvation that's right we know that without even having anybody to talk to us about it we realize that we need salvation and no matter where you would go in the world you would find people that have never even heard of Jesus Christ or something like that and you'd find them worshipping something right you know totem pole miles animals whatever you know and as they're doing they're showing what it is in man panco we were made for that price we were late for the point to where that we need a Savior all right so then the only way that mankind could ever come to a thought of thinking about being perfect it wouldn't have to mean that God would have to make away his self and that sits within it that he would have to make away right all right you said well there's none of it perfect i greatly we're predicts exactly right we're not perfect all right then you get the points a lot of people say I'm not perfect I just forgive it what i don't realize if you're forgiven if God forgives you then that wipes the slate clean bad he doesn't remember what you asked him to forgive me write you about it's gone and the Bible caught it in the sea of this forgetfulness and you know you can can go out there and then you can't find the bottom of the ocean know where they go down as moment and they still just keep going but you know I'm sure they can technically now find things but this the point of it is our sins are in see if we're giving us and God all right now if they're gone you know now i know we we grandmother's and granddad's to talk different than your other people now you know our kids always said my kids hello with a little horny you know because Richard kids are gently the meanest ones you you know and deacons phone right behind that but yes and they pointed each other you don't say much the other one but there comes a grand babies you know and they come along and you know what we saw everything in the world our kids done and then when the grandkids came I mean our kids to tell you don't get on the bed you get a woman we're getting on the bed we're here comes the grandkids you right up in the middle of the bed this Max's morning mean because it kind of gets we're using you your you don't see as much I'm trying to show you how God is you know right now the great grandkids come along it just gets the worse and worse and worketh anyway no they just don't do anything wrong I mean they didn't matter what they just don't do anything wrong we'll see take that is an example of what God would be with his children that he looks down to you and I and he sees us not as sinners cuz he's looking through the bud abbott all right now that's what i've tried to express see if that blood of the bulls and goats in the Old Testament when they would offer the lamb you know and the gun at each year for further they hold you know group of Israelites and that covering would cover them for a year ma you know that God couldn't see them as I tried to explain to you were bailiff company in that time you know and he tried to show God the bad parts of Israel he looked at her and CEO nice called a hundred parts you know look down and see look what they're doing God says I don't see him Haven one was it he couldn't see him now being the omnipotent omniscient annoying and everything we know that he knows about it but yet see he had made a sacrament with his real man that if they would make the sacrifice they would cover their scene right he abides by his word yep that's where I love about the word of god I love to read the Word of God card i love to regency it promises man no i don't i said really and it said one day said you'll be there with your offspring we know what I believe that okay well but I let they gotta be safe too but I believe they're coming to that point you know the worthy will but I just believe what I say alright so we've looking at it is ruining season but yet he's covered they're covered by a covering of the blood of an animal it would offer but you know that animal could not saving buddy it could only cover their sin all right year later they had to make another atonement leave a year later they had to make another atonement it had to be done on the yearly basis all right but then one day the all of that came to an end event with that God Himself came down to pay the price because the animal has no soul they could not come back upon the belief and it's just an animal it has a life it has a spirit about it it can be trained to do things they can even teach them to call and things but they can't make decisions like the mortal human being because that when dealing with their soul of that person so the animal has a life he has a spirit about it you can give me talk but yet he still feels his bird that's the same way you know we got a couple o rabbits we have to deal with all the timing you know they're smart enough to figure out how to get out of the pen but you know I've rewired everything I'm thinking about putting an electrical shock all the way around the whole thing yes now then booters are smaller cubes the mother day of nine one of these we call it dog chain fence things you know and the boogers went right in the corner and over that money up you got out that's not well they pretty smart now really looked around to see if I can find anywhere pliers if they took the paint looks with you because linea I'm you going to get to wireless when you can't make me with your hand you go in a try no but you know but anyhow but they still can't reason it out right because of acceptable let's stay in that be I know what goes to of the neighbors has got dogs and they love rabbits so I'm chasing rabbits to keep him on getting the dogs and getting to Lamar but my point is that rabbit he can't make pain but if he was he'd be coming at the back door knocking won't get my but he gets thing I and that's the difference a human mortal tomorrow baby a baby no matter how small they are they thinking right I mean they're very something begins inside of them to motivate and it's amazing to me to seal I always wanted to be able to some way scientifically take about faith the legs but little Matthew is and take him and be able to some way get into his brain and here when you love to just get into his brain to be able to see what he was thinking he's looking at Cindy's grinning be seeing them man i got it made look at everyone leading the whole plane wasn't it anytime the only thing i just go man they just room I mean you think they don't think I lately though because that's the soul of the baby it's beginning to develop within and which sold means real you that's what it isn't so lead you let's that's the difference of what the animal doesn't have that interior he has a body in a life we have a body spirit and soul to make us an individual come on but I get the point that animal I couldn't come back so God came himself down in human flesh according to the scriptures Emmanuel God with us and he paid the price I thought he died did he might release him life right as i say of it many times we have the only religion in the world that required that our for our instigator are the one who started it maybe had to die the end is nigh to give his life that you and I my legal right that simple simple doing in it says he gave their life then there was an ability for that life to come back alright so there are in the Bible He gave His life they put him on the cross they didn't kill him right my sins and your sins is what killed Herod right all we had to do he said I can call twelve legions values we come delivering that's 12 Legion that's 1200 for 12,000 close out huh wormwood destroyed the world water just that would take one right so he could call all of that but instead of that he he stayed there for you and me then we might receive that life that was even he answered mmm do we may be able to receive Jesus Christ as our Savior right can be able to accept him and let him become the one they would be living within us all right now we know God is perfect right right no problem good run going is perfect all right joy he put his lap within us yep right now he breaks his life and gives it to you and I who were that lastly that would have to be perfect because that's what he done he made it perfect right I am coming and living in US makes that sold our body spirit i'll still the sunny yeah I here in this body that that I'm here I'm still a sunny I have problems with this body is getting older it's all they think are happening do it right and I have a spirit within late which is rim the memory reason concerts effects it done in that real I have trouble living in life but as a Christian inside of us the our soul has been my eternal by the new birth whatever you want to call it being born again salvation your words you want to use coming to a place to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior not just a little talk that's what a lot of people teach and believe that salvation is a mental thought but it's not it's an experience of Jesus Christ coming and living within you cuz that was the Rings again he could give us a little talk without having to die true right and with us did you know but he had to die to release his life Evan that life to come back in me and you yeah and to give us then his own life well I've been his life is perfect yeah bad right as I said we look at the baby and we say what's perfect in our eyes it is the little grandbabies ladies man they can get you you know t ho I want a puppy with you and I gonna be alone you'll have a puppy one because it if you just can't stand them little eyes looking at you talking you know and all of that this gets in the heart and everything we know that's the way God does us he hears our prayers yours are crying out unto him saying Lord forgive me I guess I didn't mean to do that I didn't need to go that away I need more rest more in you and just be a Christian not to be worth if we look at somebody said well you think you're perfect know I know I'm not perfect but he's perfect he's living inside of me where he living that part is perfectly good my Bible said God will dwell in an unclean vessel all right now if he won't dwell we're seeing as that then it would have to take away the sin and that's what he does he comes to you and I we accept him as our side here and he comes to the lives in us to make our soul eternal right all right now I know that a lot of doctrines of people is it like we're going to get eternal life over there that's the sign that's you're looking at but why would Jesus cries out to die if it's gonna be over there he died to release his life now I to make this as we read there in the scripts right about the children of God Oh Congress is all free man what about being the children of Almighty God Evan and you know the thing of it is we know the truth about it we god no how no grandchildren he ain't like of us he don't have grandchildren he had sons and daughters all right now the reason I'm saying that is and sometimes he asked a witless right then that can tell you he's only one that ever got a spike in of the grandkids and I really whooped him good i mean i just really you know one day like that and he cried for an hour but because he didn't know pop all can do stuff like that well little happy she's come along you know we've had to i minus her a little bit no he it's just the way it is but see you're trying to raise the child to were that the child do what's right no you heard about that he was going up down the ladder never taught me two years old about three and lisa well i used to take him out set him up home instead of reading right up on the top of the peak of the roof of a house that was dirty foot off the excite and he just said sorry you know and he said popo i'm flying us now you're not you can't get off he set up her Whitney you know we we would be working on times but thee sometimes you have to correct your children's by and God has to correct other side don't we already his offspring and he wants us to raise up to be right but you raise a child to be right I don't want to raise a child up to be uh you know they're bad enough as it is because living in life but you don't want to raise them up to worth it there this to spoil brat sometimes you gotta say to the kids no you don't get it I don't like it of course like I said now the grandkids come along and they say daddy I want it near more in for more lenient in on maybe in half get back to the story salvation comes and lives within each one of us i saw crash 94 that's right he died to give us his old life to make us a new creature we've been talking about a new creation me we're not still the same as we was inwardly outwardly we look the same salvation is not in your body it is not in your spirit is in your soul it makes a soul eternal alright then from dire is supposed to work out where this right the life of God out through you and I to were that we can accept Corrections and in doing you know and be his children to be his offspring but one because they said now the blood of bulls and goats imma let me do was cover right but the blood of jesus christ he release the life right yeah cuz the animal heads instead alive and he has a blood and think but it is no solar but when Jesus Christ came up on earth you would body spirit and soul oh mighty God huh the Yeti was in flesh like we are his body was a virgin born body not either he demon huh Mary didn't produce the egg because we did that would have made the body coming from from area and that will work or the virgin birth is the creative old egg and sperm and put them together all Mary was with an incubator all right you see that today man right right we're in a day when when the virgin birth can be seen easily won because you can go down there they can have a test tube baby right right right take a journey from this one of the sperm from this one put it in our Joseph virgin birth and what it was a man that God created the egg his firm remember what the words you want to use German whatever the words you want to use Nikoli for it Lee and when he did Mary was it was an incubator right that's why he never did show in description he never called her mother right now listen I got a little sense I may look Don but I got a little since I know when he was a baby called her mother right right I mean he did go around saying who are you he knew who it was he called her mother but when it come up in his life to his head of his men entered his ministry and begin to preach she never called her mother anymore he called a woman why because even she rejected him as to be in virgin born the hell up to the time he's about 12 years old remember the temple they come back hunting him and she said your father and I right there was really saying Joseph is his dad he turned around and rebuked her he said I must be about my father's yesterday but she showed up and hurried it because she knew that he was correcting her the word was what was doing it right because it was God coming down to give his own life and you and I right so you could come to this place of being perfect right man Marnie now it may have been down through time that we didn't understand these things we understood that you earth and the things but we might not have talked about it but I've heard people arguing discuss it what Jesus were talking about you know i'll be there for perfect and you know over what i just read it i could say as he required it and God made away and he did so in the end time at the revelation that's why we read in Peter the race that is to be brought to you and I at the revelation of Jesus Christ in the meantime we are to receive the revelation to finish of all things you agree no that's the purpose of us being here we were to come down to this end time and we started all regarding Peter where it said that the appearing Jesus Christ all right now the other scripts you'll find at the coming of Jesus Christ cuz he can appear along today and that not literally be his coming he's coming is through the revealed Word and then it brought to you and I that's right he appeared in the end time wants to pay the price all right so everything's pointing down to where we're at right we are the people at the end of the earth of coming home honey we're the ones that Hebrews 11 40 says they without us cannot be made perfect right that we're perfect means of completeness full age you know you look at a child you say they've said Luke look Lou Matthew a specter knees he said well he's perfect but that means he's got every part unless something goes wrong with him in life you know some happen he's got his fingers he's got his toes he's got it dude he hung out some teeth before long then you know when I'll Lydia start biting Matthew for calling in Matthew ace mr. days Matthew but do he'll see he begins to develop would have but against no new parts right in the Christian life we don't gain hearts as we go along we gain growth development we grow up right you read the Bible then you read it but then you go back one day you read it again and it begins to open up you begin to see more we go back you read it again you begin to see one because a growth development is happening heaven so then you don't dare turn around a little little ace when he gets about five years old and you handing the keys to him and go get out of the car no no no goes its growth developments not enough right when you're 25 you can rust amenities you notice that I said 25 no no that's we all kids are they power start out they have all the wrecks in the first year that's why when they hadn't come along you know the boys egg roll clunkers it didn't make them here long as they got the earth it didn't matter Volkswagens or road trucks or whatever you know low and chanukah long you know everybody is you gonna buy a new car huh we found her a four-hundred-dollar toyota corolla for the bureaucrats headed we bought it nana looked at it she said daddy you mean you want me to drive that that's it n and many kids in schools got a car 16 years old got car none so I said drive it I was in the first year so if you have any reaction or Nothing right turns up any honey well when she come alone after a while we bought her a nice ricardinho honey one because she learned her to drive that's the way God does he starts at all and he lives out of races and then he knows how to raise children don't let him he did well sometimes he says no you can't have that yeah but daddy I wanted no you're not old enough yet alright so Ashley does in the Bible that in the Word of God he he gives us gradually what we have need of habit our growth development starts to wear that we can comprehend dammit that's right the funds all right and to do that means that grace must be hard probably read that scripture brought to you too grace that is to be revealed at the revelation of Jesus Christ Oh grace is unmerited favor but it's a wonderful word of saying you don't deserve what you're getting that's their right much call American fight was a good webster huh but it's saying you don't deserve it but I'm gonna give it to you right I'm going to give you the ability to grow up I'm going to supply you with the word i'm going to open it i'm going to to give you an opportunity to be able to study it study the Bible you will never wear it out amen that's right you will find out that it will constantly keep unfolding right they like a book that you read you know like what was it about a hundred years ago when you got sick you know what you're done they just somebody else or find a nails out and let you bleed a couple of pints yeah and your body you know what procreating you blood and and all I Kevin and they killed a lot of people by stood in that but that was her way of trying to do now they knew if he took the old blood out and you blood comes it brings healing car when I we don't want to read that medical journal today do it I mean we go down and dear you're already an e making you you go down to the doctor a doctor it okay rang me the pliers now I'm gonna pull off a couple of tone I open no you're already anemic you know they've learned a lot yeah right let me learn how to dr. us and take care of us we don't got it out to learn you already knew how to do have a drive to a sense trouble our way you send problems our way to see how we will deal with have it run we call it test and trial honey and extended my way that we learn how to deal with those son but the way that to me that I've always talk to your way I believe it he's by the revealing of this word I learned to overcome yeah he's a running man I tried my reading and studying God's Word I learned to overcome a man what I'm really learning is is the nature of my father all right Evan at that right because that way I'm learning that my father didn't do these things right people will say what I can't have it do it now that's alive you go ahead and blame the other thing I don't blend the deal for everything I think we got a lot of problem ourselves that we we come up with our own say what you see God will trash ditched us to prove it right and then like driving a car you you know I mean I'm 64 / got a bride bicycle but I describe slow you know all right but after a while you learn to drive right yeah first time I was in the car I remember coming up the whole store right there in front of the house used to be when i'm back to having the road I mean I had the whole road at all the parking lot I went over to railroad track back talking you know next to the track no you know I thought I really know how to drive I found out in a hurry I better take it easy I'm not going to hurt somebody but see God knows how to train his chew em I think you're right but he does it's my giving his word you know you spent a lot of time today and people do and that's wonderful and they want to know who their mama or daddy is maybe they've been raised up there's more fun or so and they want to know who their mom and daddy really is we'll have always told you my way I'm sorry if I would have been an orphan you know and somebody had adopted me I've always thought that would be my mama daddy you know because they raised me right but that's not Gordon all mankind no most everybody wants to know where they come from but I'd like to meet my daddy will you daddy's that throws your way when you're the baby and you want to me you know that's all right i'm not against way people do things I'm just honest I just tell it like it is I wouldn't want to know who my mom and daddy is if I was orphaned and somebody raised me I take you over who I had for my mom and dad right you know what not what my father to have all the honor and glory for raising me right right Evan I won't even reveal yourself to me through the words rang it on and show me hey Jimmy its nature show me his waves through the word I lead in the word and I found out it you know he would turn the other cheek what I need to get that nature I want that nature of him there of his nature his character because i'm wanting to be a new creation the word creation our creature is the same word which you know it is it's really Jesus Christ came down upon the earth he was a new creation I thought that he was not of the old he was not a product of the virgin birth prove that he was not a product of the old nature of ways of man he was a new creation event all right he proved it in his life and living happily when he was a kid whose kid I'm desert I don't believe he was in living I'm going to hurt a lot never have thought nothing like that I'm always thought he was raised up he was raised in a good family and good home and taking care of you know all of that and you heard a trade he was partner you learn a trade with somebody right you know and you went out making his own living oh you know really furniture all right but in that it was Almighty God showing himself right as I said even had to correct his mother when he was like 12 13 years Overson because she was wrong you see then when come down to words it was that she learned enough confidence in him because you remember the first thing that happened he went to a wedding you remember in the Bible when it first starts his ministry and he went to a wedding and they were running out of wine since she's goes to him and said no Jesus they're running out of one he said my times not yet did you know but she didn't take that house she doesn't sing him all through it laughs and seeing the way later than what he done should she goes over the pic would say whatever he says do you do it right so we turn to reading okay pour water out and it became wine all right now he had the nature of God because he was gone all right then we need to have the nature of God heaven living within other it would solve a lot of our problems you know there's like I say the kids wear that little band around on her arm you know what would Jesus do well that's good as long as they're doing it right you know but you know you say well walk with Jesus doing it so if I say something you punch him in the no that's not exactly the way that Jesus was doing that you know I think it was a kid but yet he was a wonderful kid at a man that's right you know but just think about it now that's what I'm trying to get you to see at the revelation of Jesus Christ another word here at the end time when God has opened the unto us I given us the understanding of God of these words to be able to see who we are I think what we're doing and what's happening then you know in life and do it and we even know by reading the Bible what will happen when we leave here I think God will turn to Israel and save them right we know that there will be a millennial reign is recorded in the Bible and for a thousand years of perfect peace upon this earth and thanks and then they'll be an Armageddon or battles and things that will take place alright and then there'll be a future home if we read in Revelation 2 21 22 right in there we know all about this one because he's given us his word that's right and by giving us his word he's given us that revelation of Jesus Christ right Emmett thought is the prophet of God said if you read the Bible and they'll see Jesus and then reverse back reading again mmm well I admit I read the guy she lunch what we got short sojourn to open got cilantro until I got tired of reading so intro we got so and so but then I realized one day that right in the middle of all that it would say something that would be a real key that I needed an understanding so I went back and I read it again right all right because it was showing the ledge right now handling it would come down to where this lineage come from this and this group come from this and I needed to know those signs not that I had to have it as a Christian but to know the leads of God coming down through mankind would come out to Jesus Christ that's the Langley that's right that's right you can see who we are and what we're doing is the hour that we're living right this is the time to come to understanding who you are right Luther taught the judge shall live by faith we believe that Wesley come along call sanctification we believe that the bag has come along with bringing back eternal security and immersing by going daily water you know and bringing back the baptism not going in the water with it cuz imagine this had got forth with the sprinkling is that i'm not against all that i'm just showing you that each one of those and a truth for their time and then we came in around the zoo the street and there you come in what you call a Pentecostal people as they begin to speak in tongues and Sons & wonders begin at a place and that's where we're at we come down here to an end nor God is people unfolding right to the end of quote Monaco the end of the earth is come you used to enter look around a bit when I talking about tomorrow and whenever code I've never been concerned about when the end of the world would come I'm concerned about getting ready to accept Jesus Christ and walk off the earth well I'm not concerned with dates and times and seasons and Paul said I'm a scared of the eye because you do those things right but that's just people trying to figure out things right all right we come down to where we are the end time that the word is open unto us not a sinister the word through the way of a profit that would leave came and brought us to life stay messy all right do we believe that and we want with it but we don't make that profit God we don't worship no man we worship Jesus Christ we do as Paul said won't sit follow me is I Pollock rock all right I'll follow anybody that follows christ ever had right because we need someone to help us we are human morals that need someone to guide us and better all right we follow anyone who would lead us to it you said I believe in all of the real cute true genuine Christian if we follow HYFR then we walk in the light yeah man all right then when we do we come forth as being one God wall right he wants his nature to be instilled in us then I'm just to be babies right you don't want us to stay babies we just a picture all of all the kids from the baby was born up to there whatever age they were but I was looking at that one day my thought we ought to be good you could pick out an age and say well I was late at that one did you say that our tariffs has happened and at that one you know but you know what if I stayed are we with the hell no Matthew and Josh it we will now know that right so it's really selfish to think about what we do we shouldn't want our kids to just remain right as they are they brought into the world for the purpose of growing up right and having their own family now I don't believe in pushing them out and make them get married no I believe you just wait around long enough you find a rough life than ever and then when you do that'll be your wife I'm leaving praying no for a wife all right in the Nano that'll take care of it but you what I'm saying we are new creation in Christ Jesus and he keeps unfolding his word to show us his ways and what he wants out of your night we're not in the days of all of the things that would happen in the bag on days we're here in the end of all things and we're saying Lord come on the scene now and give us what she wants to have because that is the grace grace God promised it right he promised to bring us to the place that they could be a change of these bodies there could be an end of all things they can be a rat sure that we spoke out of me of that he promised that well like I said to start with them when he said me therefore perfect if that's God's Word then God is required to make away for somebody to reach that so he did to himself amen alright George we're going to take a change to the body we're going to have a rapture whatever words you want to use and terminologies see then he made from he promised it lion you better believe my kids my grandkids I what I had to do they say daddy can we nice and we'll make well they just got ready yeah oh they knew whatever possible could be done I do it because I would give him my word me and I didn't want to break it I wanted to do what I could do that we see God when he gives his word he came right back heaven he got to keep it I that's why he says our description Romans 10 hell you want to be excited than what is the clue believe in your heart confess with your mouth right now it's fine to believe in the heart whether we don't confess with thy mouth more but it's good to believe in the heart but if we know you know if we don't have it in our mind our thinking I do believe and then confess alright so what do we need at the revelation of Jesus crown can we believe that Jesus Christ with Almighty God that drivin now know the Trinity doctrine and etc is the oneness I know both sides of the doctrinal issues of the teachings of the Godhead but yet I believe what your mom will say hey there my old said he was born Lord the Christ the Bible said he was a man you and God with us all right he came down to play the prize it's you and I and that would opportunity to be cited hey all right then why are we looking for another gone or another thought right that's right yeah but we've been taught that us that's fine because you taught that you come down to life yeah but now let's

reading and Revelations three we thought we was going to be through with that but we just keep on going so we don't worry about it we the Lord will take care of it right amen Matthew 5:37 but let your communication be a y nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you this not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall Sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel the to go a mile go with him Twain give give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate and that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you why that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and soul be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen let's just go over to one scripture Revelations 3:14 is the message to this age and what does it say and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of candra these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying for quite a while on this part of being therefore perfect and uh we've come down to a conclusion that we in our last message and we won't get through with these notes tonight I'm sure but I wanted you to read them and so uh keep them until the next Wednesday night and uh we'll be uh speaking on these things or carrying on the thought but you know the message to this age each age got a message a special uh revelation of about God and you know his ways and doings and things and we we just uh look at our age and we see that it says he's the beginning of the creation of God now what was our thoughts about reading from Matthew there in the scripture that we've been reading for quite a while you know of Matthew that uh it's talking about the uh fact that the Lord Jesus he had come from the the be Beatitudes of saying blessed are you you know because of this that and the other that persecutes you and thing but then he started changing kind of a course or order of of uh talking and as he did he be to talk about how the children of this new creation having his nature and all would come to the point that we would be able to uh withstand Satan when he comes after us and the ways that he always does and that we would be of that new race of people and that this age would get the special revelation of it of a new creation amen now each age got the new creation each age got the new birth all right but this is a summing up of all of the things and bringing it out to where that we can see you know the age that we're really living in amen and understanding then a a new creature as we read there in Matthew where it says uh this will be you you you'll be the children of God then you'll have this kind of a nature so he was saying you know this is the nature that is is expected to come into to you then he says be therefore perfect because that way he's saying that there's no way that you and I could uh have the nature that he spoke of right now uh think on this for a minute it is not our natural nature to turn the other cheek uh it's not our natural nature to if we're sued to give a man more than what he sues us far that's not our nature it's not our nature to do those things but if we have a new nature a new way amen then the Lord Jesus could be smitten on one side and turn the other one that's right all right see he's showing us as I said the only way that you and I can come to this place of where that we could ever think about being perfect right would to be to the basis that we could get rid of ourselves right right man and take take on a new nature or new ways a new thought all right and see that's why I I tried to to bring it to you there in the the last message as speaking about it that asking who was this man that could it's possible that the psalmist David would say and and Romans would say and brother randam would bring them together and and say it you know we brought those things out that that they would say blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin all right and see you could get all kind of definitions of certain well you know so good of a righteous person you know a good person and this that or the other or you could come into the message or the hour of people you know that well uh I was a child of God always was eternal so I don't have to worry about anything see and it would go into disgrace right amen upon all of the ways that we would try to understand it but I hope you picked up the point cuz I'm trying to make things so simple until you know uh an illiterate person can understand amen that's right and and that way then anybody can understand it that's right you know because you know you bring it down to a basis of a person that doesn't have much intelligence and and you just tell that person say now listen what you need to do you need to New Birth right right and they'd say well how do I get it right right well we can go through the the process of saying well you've got to do this and you got to do that but according to the prophet people ask about being saved and he said we try to tell them what to do and not do right but you see the the whole thing is to what repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's simple amen but it's true right it's held for 2,000 years amen as a simple thought right but now what would you tell the person then that would ask you that you'd say well now I know a lot of people that has repented and they have inde did sure and a lot of people got baptized in the correct way you know yep mhm and still didn't get saved no that's right you would agree with that wouldn't you that a lot of people don't well what's the problem now they've done what the word says mhm they followed the channel of the letter Y right mhm and they could even say now Lord like I've heard people say you know well now the Lord knows my heart and uh if he don't save me like the one man did and he was true about what he was saying he said Lord if you don't he was out in a a field play praying and he said Lord if you don't save me said you'll find a pile of bones laying here in this field when you come back well that man had a sincere heart and he meant it that's right amen but see how many people could go out in the yard or anywhere or do whatever and say now Lord you said it right and the prophet said the Bible says it in the prophet of God that we claim to said if we repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we shall be saved amen so now you said it and you meant it why is it they're not saved that's right come on you don't ever think or those that's right yes sir amen now I hope you understand what I'm saying because a lot of people are saved because that's the way they do it that's the way you got to go y right but what's the difference that was what I was trying to express to you the last message in so simple a terms of one thing before there can be a new birth there must be a death of the individual before they can receive a new birth amen not a killing of physically right but dying out to yourself MH and accepting Jesus Christ in your place to where that you are dead right amen cuz that that is the you say well no Brother D the the qualifications of the new birth is we got to be justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost see that's good right that's fine but you know there's a lot of people that are Justified a lot of people that are Sanctified yep and never receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right why because they never died amen right cuz you can't get the the the life until the death comes right death comes first first amen right this what I was trying to express to us and anyone else listening we don't hear much talked about dying we just hear all of this great about what we are and who we are and and what we was and how we was here and what was here and yeah and never talk about simply dying out to yourself amen cuz it can't be a new birth if you're not not dead amen amen right it just won't work that's right that's the message to this age right what that we must die out to ourselves that was a message of Paul's age that's a message to every age has been required a death right but this age right on this age is required more than just a death to get the new birth because it's going to require change of the body amen all right and if we can't die out to ourselves and get born again how in the world could we ever come to a change of a body right that's right amen are you listening see then that's where our trouble is see we must die out to ourselves to be born again amen then it's a continual dying to yourself amen all the way through life that's right and if we can become dead enough see then God can change each bodies that's right amen now if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight I want you to get this point before there can be a birth there must be a death amen before there can be a body change that's right are you listening there must be a group of people that are so dead now we're talking about body change right are you following me that's right I'm not talking about trying to dechristianize anybody or whatever I've preached that for 30 years told you 30 years or more ago that most of the people maybe even myself would not be able to have enough Faith to stand there for a change of the body the change in a moment the twinkle of an eye so we're going to have to go by the grave right you say well it's just old getting old we're getting old that's part of it right but there's a lot of young people that's in this message are dying also that's it's because and not de christianizing anybody that's right but if you and I can't die out to ourselves and become a new creation then we're not born again no that's right that's right then and this is the whole message tonight so then we'll back up and then we'll read and start again him then there comes such a sanctification under that six seal until the world is totally purged of sin that's right you agree man right the Jews are placed in there for the cleansing y the foolish virgins are there for the cleansing y but we don't have to go there amen cuz Jesus Christ has done paid the price yes sir amen amen so that means that we go in a Rapture before them amen but if all of us die and go by the grave who's going to be there for the change right right so why can't we contend that we are the people that will be changed yes sir amen and if it is it's going to take a dine right the prophet of God was praying there one time he said Lord you shed me you know like cutting a sheep cutting a wool off of a sheep you know sure every how you pronounce that word sure sure he said Lord you done it one time yes he said you took my wife you took my daughter y he said do it again Lord now that's how much he thought about it amen what he want to lose two second wife and another kid now that's about as dumb as anybody can get so that's all you can think about you in a terrible shape that's right he was wanting God to bring him down to his knees Amen to where he needed to be a death to himself amen all right see then we can't expect to have a change of the body I'm talking about you me all of us that's right until we learn to or bring that body under death man from the inside person amen right right amen it can't be done in their outside doings right right there's no way out side that you can can whip the body into to dying the more you whip it the worse it gets so it must be that we've got to start from the end inside so then this age gets a message then y a special message that he's the beginning of the creation of God Amen right all right and then there's no way that you can connect that to Natural things right amen and all must be to Supernatural spiritual things right all right and see he so died until he was the one that was telling us these things turn the other cheek do all of these things then he said be therefore perfect in other words be just is perfect in other words take on my nature right right right all right cuz it's only the only way that our bodies can be changed we've got to have this body's got to be if we don't believe in getting another one amen and that's why most people were talking about that earlier about it I've always told you that I told you the reason people don't believe in the people of this message I'm talking about a lot of a lot of preachers preach we're going to get a new body and they're talking about another body some say they're going to get a new body and they kind of leave it to where whoever wants to what group they're in to where you can decide what you want to believe about it right sorry it's just a way I thing right see everybody says they're going to get a new body don't mean they're going to get another body you talk to them a while and that's oh no I mean we're going to get this body redeemed well that's good but I'd rather just be blunt about it nobody don't have to worry about what I'm talking about that's righten but you see I've told you this how many times I made this statement the reason most people don't believe in getting that they want to get a new body they don't believe God is capable of redeeming this body right right that's it now they believe that he's capable of saving their soul and if he wants to he can heal the body yeah now you say well no no no no we know he can heal no that's that's the basis of it most people think that if he wants to that's what they do we'll ask the Lord to see what he wants to be done we'll ask the Lord if he wants to heal us you ever done that you ever said Lord do you want to heal me or is it right for you to heal me we're not supposed to do that right we're supposed to say we're healed amen see that way then people believe that you could be you know maybe if the Lord wants to he can heal you then they say well we're going to give some new body cuz you don't believe he's powerful enough to redeem this one now that's not the message of this age that was what hit me I had notes in this to go on with another point tonight but it kept hitting on this cuz I want you to make sure you understood what I was say in this past Wednesday that you and I must die amen we've got to die for oursel to be born again amen see Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me right right right he had no point or thought of his own self cuz he believed he was dead I was noticing there we was the other day listening or either today reading or yesterday or something brother Brown said that I died 32 years ago m now my daddy died somewhere about 1945 it'd be hard to condemn him of or bring a case against him about a crime today wouldn't it because he's dead but you see that's the way we're supposed to be right we're supposed supposed to be so dead until we're not alive anymore cuz you can't be a new Creature if you're alive did you understand what I was trying to bring out Amen to be a new creature Paul said that you're a new creation you new creature there in what it 2 Corinthians 5:17 or first one a new creation well if you're a new creation then the old creation can't be alive at the same time cuz the prophet of God said he's not dealing by that ways and see there's no way for us to to still be alive and Christ alive in us too right he said no now brother there we're still yeah we're still alive that's our problem man because there a body and the spirit to be dealt with right that didn't die to get a new birth right it was only the death of the Soul right right and it wasn't the death of the Soul like taking the soul out and throwing it away it was the death of the nature of that Soul right yes sir amen which was of the world right that's right see then God can come in and live man but if we're not dead he can't come in and live that's right you you can't claim to be a new Creature if the old creature still lives that's why you're born again in your soul not your body and your spirit see in body and spirit we're still of the old creation right amen even though we've been given a new spirit that still is not the Holy Spirit right right that's just a new spirit cuz you couldn't stand your own self the prophet said right he said you had to get a new spirit to be able to even fellowship with God and in any form right that's it you see why the new birth is the most important thing in there is amen I reading today where brother R said when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you get everything he said you get all the power you need he said you get all the healing you need he said you get all the Deliverance you need that's right when you receive the new birth he said but you just got to keep drinking and pushing out right that's right see that's our part right is to drink in and push out God supplies it but you see then it's a dead man that Paul is talking about that God won't impute sin that's right M it's a dead man the psalmist David was talking about because there's no way impute sin to a dead man right amen if he's truly dead mhm all right and if we're not dead we didn't get the new birth right come on is that true right MH see the problem with most people as they say it they'll take the word follow the word right to the l y I've had people to tell me that say brother Dale I've done everything thing that God told me to do and what's wrong why haven't I received the New Birth when I've done everything he told me to do I said I had received a new birth well now doing what God says to do is wonderful or don't do but I thought we believe that even Abraham received an unconditional Covenant y amen and that we are the Seed of Abraham by faith amen by the new birth now justification in this day don't put you in the body of Christ so your sins can be chopped off and that's good you can be Sanctified right cleansed and set aside for service wonderful but that's not death no Amen Brother Brad on a future home if you'll read it right about 15 16 right there somewhere you hear him saying this he said when that Holy Ghost comes in he said it burns out everything that's left that's right amen you said well the unclean Spirit went out you know everything went out what what's left you and I yeah that's it amen that's what's left you and I right what would we be y turn it loose right there you just go right back to the pig pin right but you see we've got to be to be born again we've got to have a death amen right amen and that's the man now how is it possible for you and I to die spiritually speaking it's easy to understand natural death right whacker got's head off at gone right but spiritually speaking see we must die out to ourselves right we must come to a place we saying Lord there's nothing I can do that's right I've done all I can do I've done what you asked me to do right now if there's anything wrong let me know if not let me die right and when we talk about dying to ourselves that means we give up all rights yep amen she don't have no rights we give up all the rights everything well bless God I I'll tell you what you you fool with me I ain't turning the other cheek you're not dead right amen I told you about it that was one of the things I always wondered in my life even after becoming a Christian I thought cuz I it just that way I understood how that two men could take gloves and slap each other's face and because of an argument turn around take a gun and just shoot each other cuz that was an insult see this you insult the person and they're dignity is demanded and they must shoot or kill you know or die I can understand that because that was the way I was made don't say good that I ain't never lost a fight yet I might have run away from a few I never lost one but now listen I can understand those things right and I always wondered I thought Lord is your grace sufficient I I don't know Lord I believe you I believe I'm born again and all that Lord but you know and by doing that you know what it meant it me I was opening up that door for Satan to try me that's right and I shouldn't have been thinking that way but I was just honest ain't you right that's the best way to be with your own s and the got there work one day you remember something happened and he slapped my jaws I mean he rung them good and I just stood there grinning and looking at him I thought it's gone I mean you seen what a expression come over this man's face when he just slapped a guy that was as big as he was and you know and the guy didn't move I just stood there grinning at him he just turned around and left and I mean he got gone he stayed gone for he's supposed to repair what I was doing you know he stayed gone quite a while and he come back he said I'm sorry about what I done I said that's all right see I found out that at least at that point that man was dead right sure now you know I spend a lot of time explaining things as we've reading in Matthew in Matthew it says if a man sues you for your coat give him your CL cultural now I mean now how does that work out you know all right now that's M okay now brother call you sued me from there's my coat all right just take everything else I got now is that what that means now come on be sensible is that what that means the guy sues you for your coat give him your cloak also is that what that means words you just give him everything you got I don't think that way that's right I don't think that's what he's trying to make the point the point is if a man sues you for you coat and your cloak all right and the judge says now I we just take your coat well then all right I'll just give him a cloak to I don't think it means to be just give everything you say yes it does well okay I'm just making a good point because that's what I mean by death right that's that day there was something there when that man slapped me there was something there that I had no thoughts about hitting him whatsoever right I felt sorry for him and no thoughts of striking him I want to hug his neck he done me a favor right right he let me know something but now let's get on that point but now does it mean that he comes back and he he says well I tell you what let me just do it again turn the other okay go ahead then he turns back hit now after a while you're going to end something see we're not done right right you don't just stand there and say well here's the other cheat here's the other cheat here's the other cheat here's the other cheat no no I'm not that a mate I'm I'm sorry maybe you are maybe that's what you think now I'm just telling you there was something there that day that was letting me know the next day if that guy slapped me I might have hit him back you say brother Dale I'm just telling you like it is that's the way I talk you won't talk that way but I do you want a goody goody so much until you do it then first thing you know you blow up and you lose it and then when you lose it you don't know what to do see I don't I don't have to worry about it then I believe that if one of you SLA me again that'd be fine I can take it but it's just like I told a man one day he said I'm coming over there and beat you to death I said you won't come over here I'm pretty good size well guy you know and when I don't green I look a little bit tough you know you won't come over here why not I said cuz you don't know whether I'm going to hit you back or not and I said I really don't know either do you get over here I'm just honest what are you sure and what I'm getting at is one thing what does it mean to die Ain got know forgive it what does it mean to die you die to yourself and you become born again right but you still got a lot of problems right right a lot of troubles lot of heartaches need a lot of trials and tribulation need a lot of patience you need a lot of virtue and knowledge and Temperance and things right and God understand that you know got to understands those thing right so he gives it to us when we need it thank God for that that's right but you see he gives us enough to get born again now the rest of it now this is what I've always tried to preach to you from the day I started hear in any form of preaching I've tried to preach one thing salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9 you accept it God accepts you brother R said if God don't accept you you don't have it he said whether or not you accept him is not the point he said it's whether or not he accepts you that's right right right see if he accepts you that's fine amen but you say well I've accepted him all right wonderful and that's if that's a genuine acceptance right that's it he'll accept you right amen but if it's not genuine it's words thoughts and our mouth wiggling a lot but you see even after he gives you the new birth right we got a lot of dying to do right right there is when we can really start dying to ourselves right what we' done before then was accepting him as our place you know in our place or what he done for us accepting him as a savior and then he accepts us but when you become born again now here's what legalists don't like and and disgraced people don't like the way that I preach I'm sorry I just like to tell it like it is cuz you see when we become a Christian we we become responsible right right that's it amen yes sir come on we become responsible y amen that's why I know know always T you you know Paul said you know they they got to the point they thought that Paul was saying well let's just let's just go out of sin where we get more grace he said where could abound he said God forbid amen whatever you make yourself a servant to is who your master is Right amen paraphrase but you see once we become a Christian then is when we can really start dying right the nature change has come the new birth is present we're a new creature a new creation not I that liveth Paul said but Christ that liveth in me amen but see we fail to read the rest of it he said and the life that I now live in the flesh right yep he brought his body right into it right he said I live by the faith of God Amen I Die daily he said right what about a man that's beat five times and Shipwrecked all these other things and then he he doesn't say a thing about that is being any of his death right amen come on read it he doesn't bring in all of the things that happen to him as to be anything of a death right he just says I Die daily but are you following me the new birth puts us in a place that when then we can start yielding ourselves right right turning ourselves over to him yeah now is where a lot of the word has to come in yeah I've always taught you that because I believe it I believe the stature of perfect man can only be added because of the revealing of the word amen that's right not because you desire to have patience and you to say well I'll have it no people say I tell you I've heard people say this then well I tell you what I I didn't know whether I was a Christian or not but I read in the Bible one day that the that The Godly in Christ you know she'll suffer persecution said well I've been in a lot of persecution so I know I'm a Christian now I've never said that cuz I don't believe it way right amen I believe there is a lot of persecution a lot of troubles right amen I believe you must be born again to be a Christian amen right become a new creature the old man's got to be dead to be a new creature right I I love the story The Prophet told about the man you know that killed the the the King's son or what it was there you know you come down to see him and they wouldn't even feeding the guy they wouldn't doing anything cuz he killed the King's son he asked him said why don't you kill him he said well in the fit of rage I'm sorry he walks out you remember the story he sent him back down there with clothes and and everything to wash him up clean him up right to destroy all of his records amen and bring him out so now you're my son amen put the robe on him you're my son amen yes sir you know what that King was actually saying absolutely he was saying that my son that I had and fathered and raised up and you killed no longer exist right MH thank you Lord come on think about it that's that's the way I think of the story yes sir my son no longer exist records of my son have been destroyed records of your life has been destroyed not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen a new creation Romans 6 and2 he says that we' got to be dead to sin that's right you ever do anything wrong Brother D every day brother randam do you sin every day he said every day now you got to explain sin why because that's the way people run with it they don't think about what a man is saying was brother around him saying that he disbelieved God's word no but he done explain that the only sin that there is is to disbelieve God's word is that true right amen but yet he said he sinned every day so there must be something about Sin that we don't understand he said it's not a sin that drinks run around all these other things but he said if we don't repent we're going to have to answer for them that's right right so you're going to have to answer for him as a record kept you know what that means if a record is kept against me I'm not dead right see so right I'm not dead if a record is kept well don't you think you make mistake yes I do but brother R said when a Christian makes a mistakes he said he immediately says I'm sorry right how would you like this quote he said you say you're sorry he said and it never was yep accounted right y because God knew you was going to say you're sorry mhm amen that's how pure it is am right sir how about one I've got it in and probably get to it later with it how about one where that God sees you when you're born again you know how brother around said God seen you when you were born again he said he seen you just exactly like that he saw you before the world Amen that's right that's it MH now that's how beautiful a Christian is amen he sees you just like he saw you before the world Amen when a lamb was stood and slain mhm to cover everything can be taken care of see what it means to be a new creature not the old creation made over 2 Corinthians 5:17 the new creature all things have become new now how a man could be see right if he's alive it's not new right but if he died to me the best way to to do a a a point of what we'll be thinking about I know it's carnal but there's such a word as we call it Amnesia and something happens you get hit or something and you just forget everything wouldn't it be great right amen wouldn't it be great if that could happen right now right amen and you know what I'd be glad to take the hit on the head y right if you just make sure it worked I don't want the hit on the head and it not work the Amnesia yep you know we you don't remember see then all things has become new if it's never corrected which generally is you know true time and things happening it's gener corrected but if it never was corrected you know what you have a total new identity amen would that be something sure absolutely amen well you know that's what God done for us sure right that's right by giving us a new birth thank you Lord amen give us a total new identity amen let's just read a few I got a whole bunch in here I got 21 I think it is and some of them's got about six paragraphs all right so uh you just take them home read them we'll get back to it look what brother Brown said about us on the token 1964 uh 308 1964 of the token now the promises make free from sin CHS that God hasn't hasn't recognized your sin David said all right listen blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin too and God will never impute sin over that token because the token is the paid price that God has already received it and you got a token for it the your faith has bought it amen and you have the purchased price of your redemption in your body mhm to worship him and show forth his promises and power see it even comes out into the body course you bring the body under subjection you begin to let the man die look at the next one this is the serpent seed 1958 9:28 the evening service did not David say blessed is the man to whom God will not reckon sin and impute sin too God don't hold a sin against this creature I gave you that one the other night but I wanted to read it again this creature he doesn't reckon sin to the righteous right now who's righteous none of us Jes right amen none of us is righteous amen right that's right but God is righteous so if God's living in you then he makes you righteous right see let me let me explain something right there does he make you righteous now watch we'll get on down here in a little bit you understand reason I'm saying this does he make you righteous because you ain't careful you'll have something there you begin to try to work something with it and you'll try to take the old ways and try to make something I does he make you righteous or does he impart his righteousness right now which one is it amen that's see now if he gives his own righteousness is not making you righteous right he's not making you righteous he's imparting his righteousness to you right right amen that way then you become righteous right sure but see if you ain't careful you'll say he made me see then you get your big self in the way well look what I had something to do with it cuz he made me no no no no no all he wants you and I is to die amen that's right if we die he can live amen he died that we might live amen amen that's all he asked now look what he says we're going to get a good bit of reading here in the minute off for some of this oh we read this in in Revelation 34 that is the beginning of the creation of God look what he says 336 of the church age book now he's but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing us Noe see that we still like it but if you read it right he'll get to us right but just remember that he comes before to us amen is that maybe I'm crazy but as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation Now want you this has to do with the church yeah but who is the church this is a special designation of himself right so it's not you and I it's him right right he is the creator of that church now watch what he describes CU see then you come right back and watch him this has to do with the church this is this is another creation and then he jumps right down and explains what he comes in and how it takes place see watch The Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride amen now as the spirit of God no yep as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born he's either got to be making that that as a personal point to tie together or they should have shoved that down and made another paragraph cuz it looks like he just changed thoughts I'm not no English major but I know one thing when you change thoughts you change paragraphs right that's a sensible way of looking in English but he ties it all together and gives you the conclusion Sal from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very s in the wound of Mary for that body it was not enough for that the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human over him supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that's right now watch even if the Holy Spirit gave birth to what Mary was doing it would be a sinful body you read it come on Sir amen that would not have produced the LI Adam of him it was said l a body thou had thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation right man and God met remember the other week Heaven and Earth kissed each other other righteousness and peace all right man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race and he tells you who that is that's Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become a new become the new creation of God right Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus under good works Ephesians 4:20 and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of ever Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation right he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of Man by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation not another creation special designation of itself is right where we started at who is this new creation what possibility does a human being have of being a new creation right by dying to accept and accepting Jesus Christ right by the new birth right the only way it can be done what did he say he talking about church God body right right come on you reading all the way down you got it in front of you take home read it reading done it he's talking about himself he's talking about his church he's talking about what the church is the church is him not another person not another creation it's the same creation now look what he says this is a true revelation of God what is the true revelation of God that God by him coming into human flesh made way that he could by being the beginning of the creation of God Amen that he could become into you and I right and brother Rand said we'll get to it in just a minute where he said it he's the with the rest of that creation right look the true revelation of God what that's why we're not Oneness man Oneness is that Jesus was the life form of God no the Bride of Jesus Christ is the life form of God Amen that's right then there be a dispensational change goes to Israel right they'll be the light form but right here in this Gentile dispensation we're part of the Revelation right a special designation if you read it off the face of himself y That's Right not you and I why cuz we're dead come on we're dead if we're dead we can be a part of the new creation but if we're still alive his death didn't do anything for us this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age where all would be over and when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pip by his own decree he elected the members of his new creation right 38 brother we had to pull this in now he's got to come up to pick up another one it's 3A on the back of your thing right proven his word 64816 look what he says that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God right y then the whole world whole earth right now watch it what's he meaning what's he getting at and the whole earth has to have baptism yep you know this world is going to be a new creation yes sir absolutely right they won't be annihilated remember so our bodies won't be annihilated right right the world won't be annihilated where you Prophet the future home spend all the time talking about it right mhm it's burning off the sin getting rid of all of the sin and the death and things that's right it'll be a new creation thank you Lord this world y yes that's right you know that's what so lot of the people of the message they saying we're going to a future home in New Creation and then say we got to have another body yeah ain't that something my mind don't comprehend that way no that's right I'm sorry I just don't think that way then the whole earth has to have a baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down in a city to dwell upon the earth and the Tabernacle of God is with man and dwells with them God has Tabernacle here on the Earth this whole Redemption plan justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as it is then amen you know that in the Millennium when we ride back with him we are the anointing to the temple right Daniel 70 weeks come on you glad to get you the quote we are the ano oting to the temple that's how much God thinks about his bride amen that's how much she's a part of him y right like I've always said my kids is not a milles uh-uh they wouldn't be my kids natural adoption don't work in this situation no natural adoption can't pass DNA right right but look a new creation and the world even comes out to be a new creation amen MH a brand new recreated Earth a new creation amen we're in dwell of righteousness not the old made over brother brand said as far as Sin has went will how to be cleansed or purged amen so as deep as a hole as there ever been in the world that's how deep sin went that's right 2 3,000 5,000 ft whatever how many feet there is are these all Wells what they're digging that's how far it's going to be cleansed out in the atmosphere as far as man travels and sends a rocket has got to be cleansed you said well that ain't no problem because there a rocket going out there that's right anywhere sin goes God's going to destroy right amen right but he won't destroy the core of the earth he won't destroy the whole world he just destroys the world order Cosmos so he doesn't destroy your body M right yeah you don't have to get a new one right cuz he doesn't destroy your body he redeemed you amen he makes it Eternal but to do that we got to die out to ourselves to come to that place because that's what he done with a new birth he didn't destroy the soul he destroyed the nature of the Soul right amen and come to live in it amen not the old made over no that won't work that's right that will not work let's read a couple of what he's talking about and then we'll quit on it number four brother we got brother Bob Brother Richard back there tonight we got I told Tyler when it come in cuz we always saying you got to do this you got to do that if Josh is not here he got to go run the table I said Tyler you're an absente de replacement I said anything you see missing just go stand there I said if I don't make it out you got to take over that's right so he's he's an absentee replacement that's right thank God for all of these amen that's right all of them yes sir all of you your job work look what brother rown said though the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost is the presuming let's see yeah number four that's right the Holy Ghost is the power of God that sends you into the heart as a witness of the spirit you're born again your life is cleaned up the world is dead and all the stink of it it's like the garlic in Egypt see you're far away from it you're a new creature in Christ Jesus old things has passed away you become new allog together a new creation born of the spirit yes sir your whole members of your body submissive to his spirit and you're moving in the Holy Ghost and not listening to the sound of the world your eyes are on Heavenly things that's that's that's when you're really God is vind ating the thing amen that's what the new birth is Amen to just make us a new creature I wish you'd think about that right am a new creature mhm you're not alive anymore what is that song they s you know he's not here anymore he's gone yeah he don't live here anymore think on it look the next one the marriage of the Lamb 19621 the evening service paragraph 102 then we become not artificial name but by a real ity of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are rais from the dead things of the world and sitting with him in Heavenly places amen I like that don't you don't you like it amen Heavenly places yes right we're not even in this world right spiritually speaking we're not here right we're in Heavenly places amen right am amen you know you can be in places all by yourself just worshiping and just having a good time and just just right Heavenly places so it goes to show you're not here anymore you're in heaven right you're a new creature you're deaden you been resurrected right in Heavenly places in Christ right I like that see tonight we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see resurrected with him dead to the things of the world and took on Christ and when we take on Christ then the world is dead then we no more care for the world now that's where we stop always do it because of just honest you take that statement right there and and every one of us is said in this bu is going to die and go to hell right right oh you talk like that brother well have you done anything worldly today I mean did you eat did you take a bath did you drive the church all those things are worldly right but now are they worldly of the point of world worldly come on are you thinking is that worldly to take a bath I think I hope everybody does it sure smells better amen amen amen that saying is you know cleaning is next to God that's not in the Bible what good saying but what is he talking about dead to the world right mhm is it wrong to live is it wrong to work make money have families enjoy life is that what he's talking about no no Jesus Christ lived ate slept done all the things was that worldly that's what I mean see we we get those things in there and then we we Shuffle it down and sometimes we can't understand and we say well are we worldly we're not worldly for living now if we make it worldly right right that's right MH see then you have to determine what's life and what's worldly right right the story was told of JC penies did used to go to church and used to tith and used to do all the things need to slow down cuz he got so big got so many businesses and places so the preacher finally went to see him Pastor did he said well I've just been so busy he said I can't I just can't serve the Lord I'm so busy you know doing this and all these new buildings and all these new things and no preacher said well okay let's pray and I'll leave he got down and he said Lord Mr penny is just too busy said would you you burn down a bunch of his stores and make a crash on everything and get him busted the preacher said he felt a hand reach over on him said I got the message right nothing wrong being worldly the turno which was the big tractor place or what you call a big machinery that was up here at TCO it was you know made all kind of heavy equipment the story was told of him said he started out giving 10% said he decided to okay I'll just see what'll happen he just set up in his tithe he wound up giving 90% he couldn't spend what he had left now is that worldly JC penage was worldly when he went into the world and wouldn't go to church right and wouldn't pay his TI and keep up with serving the lord that was worldly right that's right amen right amen true so now we're distinguishing worldly but what does it mean worldly there nothing wrong with living in life enjoying life that's right as long as we don't let life rule us right righten when we let life rule us it's worldly no matter what it is eating too much fat but you see what see when I when I come across this I think what is the people thinking right the brother brand said we we we're not worly you don't think that way when you read some things he stay he says you know Church we're just not worly let's go and get hamburger when to get through I'll meet you down here we we'll go we're going hunting tomorrow we're leaving out going going to California I mean going to Colorado going to be gone hunting two weeks well brother Brown I sounds like whirlings no because Jesus told his disciples come aside and rest sure you remember right because they we're tired worn out been preaching going come aside and rest nothing wrong with life so when he talking about world what's he talking about when he talking about Sin what's brother R talking about when he's talking about Sin and he said he sinned every day but then said sin is to disbelieve the word brother you disbel the word every day now we try to prop that up with some kind of a way just be honest about it there's a little word sin the Bible says there's a sin not under death right amen but there is a sin under death then we don't even pray for it you see where me as a pastor I try to look down and see what people are thinking try to get what's what's on your mind it's not a sin of us to to live and be life and enjoy life right that's right but when we go overboard then we're turning it in to a point of turning down God's word right forsake not your sing yourselves together is God's word that's right that's just as much now brother Bram never said that's going to be a good one brother R never said that assing failing to assemble yourself to church you know is not sin they said drinking G and smoking EXA running around he said that's not sin right right but show me where he ever said failing to assemble your together was sin no he know that see that that's right amen he didn't have to make it right right don't that's her choice if you don't understand I've always told you I wonder what happened if you come up here one night and and I wouldn't hear well brother son home home yeah okay pull it back up brother amen pull let back up cuz we're not through marriage of the Lamb number five can you pull it back up takes them a while in our jugle the books okay but look what he said then the world is dead then we are no more care for the world yeah the world is dead to us and we're and it's dead to us and we're dead to it you're a different person different personality because you're a new creation right different personality creation not the same creation polished up right not a a man that's turned a new Leaf but a man that's dead and been born again and become a new creation in Christ Jesus and the spirit of the Living God lives in the person right think on these things let's get one more I told him we were going to try to make it to eight but we won't make it down to number eight look at the next from 1962 uh 621 which would be confirmation and evidence now I feel religious why we are dead and our lives is hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost I look back and see where I once was that William Bram died 32 years ago there and now we are a new creation in Christ already raised with him set with him now in Heavenly places with the authority of his promised word that ever devil shall be subject to us and nothing shall in any wise in other words right going down get an excellent Richard let's go the token 1963 11:28 the evening service paragraph 183 but when really the product the new life of Jesus Christ comes into a man or woman he is a new creation the old man is dead he is finished he's done that token must always display all right let's get to the last one on number eight then we'll quit Christianity versus idolatry 19611 1217 if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's a pool full of water here and when you raise up out of that water you're rising to walk with Christ in a new life you are dead then you are no more temper and everything is everything's gone away You're New Creation in Christ then he raises you up by the Holy Ghost and sets you in Heavenly places with himself far above all powers and of this world right so keep the rest of those it'll be on the new creation when we get back to it CU we ain't got the time but listen church I'm just honestly trying to talk to all of us but if you take a line like a lot of people think on something that's run a line across you're going to condemn every one of us I mean there's no hopes of any in individual nowhere on the line of what most people call Sin what people most people call you know whism I've had people to condemn me for deer hunting that's worthy ISM well is it yeah that's all I do right yeah right that's right that's where is that's all I do you know in other words I let that stand in between me and the Lord right that's why when we go hunting you know and we've had to miss times because we had to where we'd be but 99.9% of the time we're in church when the services wrong that's right not me I didn't call we even tried to find the church and we couldn't find nothing I said go down to the Catholics I ain't never been to M I ain't making a joke out of it I I ain't never been let's find us a Catholic church we'll go in and sit down wouldn't make fun of them make no lie to them ain't never been there want to go to church I felt bad all day Sunday yeah why because we our church that's right that's I mean that's just true and I'm not a legalist on that point but I am one thing I love God's people and I love to fellowship with you and to be with you and to get together and sit around what's wrong with that is that worldly I mean we gather together and we Fellowship of Christmas we do it for for Easter we do it for for uh Valentine's Day we do it for and is that worldly if it is where's your spirituality I just mean that obviously does it make us more spiritual because we don't do these things what is world is see we condemn everybody in the world all things I do you don't do now listen I believe brother random was an image don't you amen sir but you take check the dates on the tapes and see how many days between the dates that he preached that he wasn't preaching and sometimes it'll be two weeks sometimes it'll be almost a month that you won't hard to have any services but the man was wore out he had to get alone absolutely amen he said I'm out there said said you see this but he said it's nothing he said when I'm out there that's when he's speaking to me he said I'm out there filling up but I do like what a lady over in South Carolina one time her husband said brother Brown went hunting to get out of the spirit you know to go help him you know in life she said honey you don't need to get out of the spirit so that's good point cuz you can take that and make it wor is right but what is sin what is death just dying out to ourselves and letting him live that's right the de I can get and listen this old boy got a lot of problems I'm a human but I try to keep him under the blood right right that's it and I try to pray for you and myself every day over and over and over amen wake up in the middle of the night and just start praying I said well San you wake me up you going to hear me talk to the Lord and I go back to sleep that's right right you know after a while he begin he won't wake you up too much so some of you that's got what is that a word inia what is it can't sleep right if you can't sleep start praying for me that's right there you go and I'll guarantee you you'll fall asleep in just a few minutes that's true right cuz Satan ain't going to let you do much praying so just keep praying you say well I stayed awake all night my wife told I've stayed awake all night all right pray maybe that's what God wants you to do that's right right right yeah just stay away and pray maybe he's using you to pray for somebody that's right maybe he's interceding through you amen yes sir that's what brother Al used to tell me he said wake up at 3:00 said I pray for you I said Lord wake him up at 1 you know a couple hours extra that's amen why can't we be that way I don't let the devil get credit for anything brother Neville I remember what happened come on brother mus this brother Neville he failed and U I got to hear him preach one time we did when was up Tabernacle and a wonderful guy but he fell off of a porch or something and broke his arm or done something and somebody said something to him he said no way in the world that wouldn't he said that wouldn't the devil he said that's the Lord said I'm just getting out too far said he needed me to slow down where to pray said he put me on the back let's qu ring on the devil right right I've always told you we always use that saying the devil made me do it I don't blame you for everything I do I do a lot of it myself how about you just be honest no it's the devil always brother Dale with me yeah okay all right but what about a new creature to have a new birth you must die right for us to get a change of the body so somebody's going to come to a place that we're going to be dead to ourselves and alive in Jesus Christ and then God will change the body a new creation this is this age this is the age of the new creation because it goes if you understood what I far it goes from the new birth in this age to the change of the body right to the change of the world yes Amen in this age yep that's right no other age could ever do that let's stand together that's right there was no way any other age could could operate like this age it's a special age that's why I brother around said it's a special designation but he said it's of himself

forgive us and cleanse us because we want to stand completing you that your light shine in each one of our hearts in Jesus name amen Ephesians come on everybody would be I use the same scripture for you know to stay on the topic and and that way at least you can say well we get to know that scripture anyway because we State on Revelations one for 25 or 30 services and now we're making this number 10 on this one reading from Ephesians so I hope you'll read the whole read it and see it's the whole Plan of Redemption is right here in the in the first chapter of Ephesians this is verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us untrue the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he have to bounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself to do what now that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now Titus is hard to find but right behind Timothy I'm glad to have Timothy with us too and I haven't seen him in a while and saw him back there this morning because it'd be kind of hard not to be able to see him yeah he's pretty big fella and glad to see you Timothy Titus the second chapter and we'll begin reading about verse 11. for the grace that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men teaching us I like that I got written in my Bible grace is teaching us Titus second chapter verse 11. for the grace of God that bring us salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us now what denying the ungodedness and worldly Lush we should live us live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God In Our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself Forest that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself that peculiar people azaleas of good works you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been on predestination and we're still on it you know because we haven't covered it but we've been trying to talk about you know how it transpires and what comes to pass I hope you've understood the things I've tried to bring out about it and we will keep saying things about it but the main point is to see that God is not a respecter of persons uh so he has a way of doing things that uh the thing for him can't say why did you form me this way because it's not that away we form ourselves but then predestination see is actually the word is we're using it now and I'm not a English major whatsoever so forgive me but see predestination is actually a past tense when you put like that onto it and we'll talk about it in a minute of redeem and Redemption but see when you're talking about predestination it means that the destiny is already the term you know determined in God but yet it has not maybe been fulfilled right because see you're saying predestination if you just said predestinate see you you could stop at a point and and and do that but not not in the basis of when you're saying predestination because you're dealing with a finished product but now like I said watch it it's not necessarily that it's already finished but it's meaning that the one who done the predestinating you know was capable of looking all the way through and seeing it totally finished all right because that's predestinations and that's why I kept emphasizing what wrote around him had said that predestination now even the finished product is still looking back to foreknowledge because that way then you're dealing with the one who done the thinking you know and knowing that he's the one who can predestinate and then the full Destiny will be finished one day because you know it's not over yet and even when we walk out of here in a Rapture it's still not over you got the Jews and their part that there's a predestination to that and then you've got all of the other things coming but see that's what I want you to think about in the word redeem that's the reason I chose Titus in to using the word redeem all right we all know that the word redeem means to bring back or buy back all right we'll get to those things but see Redemption is meaning the the completion over here anybody listening the Redemption means that something has come already into existence and it's already in the process of traveling Through Time to to bring it to a place that it can be a finished product but now whereas the word redeem the is not traveling forward you know the word Redemption she is looking out dire see you're looking out there to something but the word redeem if mean if you're going back that away you're trying to find out where you came from right all right now keep that in mind and it'll help you you'll understand why I've emphasized it you know the word Eternal means that you go just as far that away but if you can't go just as far back that away is you can that away with your plan of of Eternity then you you there's no way to know that you're correct right but then the only problem you see the the part I said is you go back to find out who done the predestinating and that's what we've been trying to do is to see how God could predestinate and make it a predestination to go all the way through and not be a respect to a person and come out to the to the right way all right now so we want to do with the same word redeem we want to make sure that we can look back because in the scripture we read here in Ephesians it talks about the the Redemption yeah and it's a basic word that's used more than the word redeemed the word redeem in the New Testament only used I think twice I believe that's correct it's in Titus in the is one other Galatians all right and uh so then think with me about what I'm trying to say to redeem something is to actually take it back to its originality right all right see now you say well I'm going to restore a 55 Chevrolet that's what we think about a redeeming part but it's impossible to restore one you say no no no no we put every piece back on that's that's not the point that's right if you're going to restore it you would have to build it right you know and it's not building from used parts that are 100 years old it would be building it from the original right off the assembly line and that's impossible to do right so then we get our mind hooked into what we think Redemption means and things like that and and sometimes it doesn't mean especially in scriptural terms so get the point now and then we'll we'll back up and go on the when you're talking about Redemption watch it hey Redemption through his blood so we have a finished product but that's what God is looking at because if we haven't fulfilled that we're still in the travel process so you'll see that in the scriptures you'll have doing it but now Hebrews 9 15 calls it Eternal Redemption all right now I like that now we can go back with it as far as we need to go back with it on Eternal Redemption because just remember one thing that one time God stamped something he can never change his mind right you can't have another thought you can't think of another way of doing something once he says that it's finished we agree yeah well you know see it's hard to keep preaching because then when are we going to believe that's right that God has set forth the whole plan he just wants us to believe it right and to walk in it right right and that we're just as eternal and soul as we'll ever be right the soul is redeemed yes yes sir man past tense all right but we're still in the Redemption of the body because it's coming true all right so now keep these in mind and we'll we'll back up to it a little bit more in a minute but I want that thought in your mind of the point of what I'm trying to get across to you all right now so we ended up this morning on talking about the predestination and and my wife said I read something wrong this morning so when I read something wrong you you put it under the way it's supposed to be you just look at it and come into my ignorance and and forgive me and I try to do the best I can but to get in such a big hurry trying to you know you have a 23 notes you want to read and you're trying to to help the people and you're standing there reading and you're thinking those people ain't they want you to shut up they want you to shut up they want you to shut up that's the thoughts you're getting you know yeah so you know give them the notes I'm going on but uh forgive me all right but now listen we talked about that the prophet said we always was eternal right do not believe that but see that's looking at it from the way God looks at it right because me looking at it I realize that as I gave the quote this morning that there was a time I had a beginning so it definitely can't be speaking of this body so let's get that all out of our mind see that's that's what now forgive me listen now I try to explain something and I know that it's hard to do which see you said well I ain't got my money my body's not involved people would swear to you about that and fight you on the basis of saying I'm not talking about my body well I come out of the Baptist Church and as I said this morning they had the the doctrine of one God all right and that argued that there was only one God I mean they would they would you know I would I would be you know it really Stern there's just one God the Bible says it you know but see in my thinking I was thinking because that's what I've been taught that it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity that's when brother Modi said what do you believe in that's what I told him and he said you're just this trinitarian this the rest of my person's a personality personalities and individual individuals a person you just this Trinity is any Trinity and I looked at him and said it I didn't back up I said don't believe that no more well see I've seen that what we were doing was words from our mouth was saying one thing but thoughts in our heart was believing another thing all right now are you with me right see then that's the way we can be about predestination right that's the way we can be about Redemption if we can swear people will stay but but brother Dale I'm not talking about the body and then you said this moment you spend if I told her there's more muscle has been you know stretched and pulled by people in front of the mirror you know reflecting their muscles in their head by weight lifting I mean because we all have that idea see this body is involved whether you like it or not this body is the one that's portraying amen what is within it right and you know you start changing your styles there's something wrong with about what you're doing evidently no you didn't like the other style and it may be forever now but you know you're calling your Higher One Way and then you start calling another why well I just want to come out another way no you saw somebody you liked it or something you know see we're still tied to this old body and this body is controlling us whether we like to believe it or not and he's still involved all right now it is that way so much until the human body of the Lord Jesus Christ I had a controlling Factor now I don't know how to say it no education but it had a controlling Factor upon his life because he was laying down in a ship one night asleep because he was tired now I know what wrote around him I know the old messages are going but you've got to keep him to where he's tired and then you gotta then you can bring it down to where he says that he would just really back here acting like he's asleep he won't see what they do you know I know the story so let's just get all the story all right but now listen we say we always were you know I always was eternal like I said in the same message that that's within the prophet said if you have eternal life so now I emphasize that the quotes I gave this morning is not all of what he said about it you know it's just some some ones you read all of them to where the Prophet was saying if you have eternal life you always was eternal right meaning what there was a time you didn't have it there was a time you received it and the day you received it you were just as eternal as you ever will be now that would be in your soul it's not talking about your body and spirit right but then I was trying to emphasize that that one day there will be a foolish virgin given eternal life but we would agree wholeheartedly that in the Earthly journey of that individual there was no place that that individual could claim originality of eternal life they couldn't say when I was down through there and I felt now they find out that they missed it but they're giving eternal life but when they're giving eternal life then they can say this he liked this life I now have as Paul said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God in other words I have eternal life see then just remember that if is the question right right if you have eternal life the eternal life you have see then John's correct in the basis of saying if that seed remains in you you can't sin that's right why it's not that you can't do wrong because we sin every day right it's the seed it can't sin all right all right she didn't get into that basis and thinking about it then we must realize that the quotes that are used can be used in any form we want to you know and and thereby we can prove a point by what we're saying and you can get into where people don't want to talk about it and they ain't doing us thinking about it the other day do you know what a uh uh in the court of law they have that thing there that you you can't answer you can't ask certain questions because it's called a form called a leading question all right and and by that you say okay now brother Donnie you answer my question yes or no now you're not allowed to comment because that's where they make it to you see you answer this question yes or no do you beat your wife anymore you see what I'm asking if he says no I said your honor you see he would guilt in doing it because and they surely don't want to say yes Joe that's a leading question I find that used in the people of the message because they lay down a situation to you think that even you will answer and agree to the situation that's being laid down but then in the final analysis of the question I can say to you okay now Brothers now we believe everything brother says don't we we believe everything he says all right now so I'm gonna cost you something see if you believe it you always was eternal I see answer that yes or no if you say no you're denying the truth if you say yes you're making a false Doctrine so you can't answer that yes or no can you so much you got to do when they ask you a question is you got to turn to the judge and you say your honor I will answer that question only if you allow me to comment see that way see Donnie could say now I'm on the way I'm going to answer his question is allow me to comment and see if they don't allow you to comment then they can't use it then you'd say when I listen the way he stated that and I answered no and had no reference that I'd ever done it before I never would do it again see you've answered the question right no now that's the way to me that I look at the Bible and the prophet's message you gotta agree with what the prophet has said right you'd be a total idiot not to not agree with what the Bible says all right and then where someone like Dave and he said Lord not word have I hid in my heart then I might not sin against it me knowing what he's done right then it turned out that it must be revealed to us what is being said if you understand David do you ever do anything wrong man I'm the worst of all well how can you make a statement like that see what everybody thinks now here's the point and it's got a truth to it now see it's what I'm I'm laying down some little things for you to think of them see there's the truth that David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin you could say that's pointing down to a person with a new birth okay that's the truth you see David said it in the spirit and even though David sinned Nathan said David you will not die right from that David brought forth blessed is the man to whom God will not impute I reckon or keep countless sin see listen bro survival that away let's approach the the message of the hour that away that we wait for God to reveal something to us instead of just saying I can show you the quote I don't agree with you because right around says so and so we'll bring it and let's put it in the message with it you know it doesn't bother me whatsoever for you to bring it and say well look what he said here I enjoy that because I realize that if he is a prophet and unless it is some human error that he has made which we know he was subject to those things are saying five hundred five seven five thousand seven hundred whatever we would realize that things will have to come together and then we'll realize one thing for sure there is no other way to say it then the way brought around said it there is no other way of saying anything than the way the Bible said it they have tried let's see what was it I've mentioned another day a while back they have tried to improve upon which one was it is it John 3 16. come on the Lord's Prayer believe it truth the Lord's Prayer all right they've tried to improve upon that he said they've always tried to improve upon that one prior you know we're teaching us to pray now not John 17 that's right he said there's no way they can add anything to it or take anything from it because it's so perfect so at one night when brother Harris had a kidney uh stone that was killing him and I've never seen a man hurt that much so I mean it just it would hit him and just hit him into this that kidney stone you that had him and we were sitting in a place eating and he looked at me and he said God damn he said I'm dying from Pain and then from one second I saw a black man almost turned white I don't mean that wrong you just turned real pale looking and I mean just started sweating just running off of him I realized he was in pain you know terrific pain they and we prayed and we prayed and we prayed and finally we all got together and we said the Lord's Prayer not sure he went on to the hospital and had to have it removed Etc that's fine but you know what all at once he was just totally free of the pain see they can't add to the Lord's Prayer okay I won't charge you just try to get a point to your mind because you see that's the way I do when I look at the message of the hour I don't look at what quotes I can find to prove my point I actually look for things to see if brother Branham said something will tear down my point I spend as much time to tear down as I do trying to build up I just get and go preach it yeah and that's why there's so much happening do a lot less air off we just took our time yeah you may be nervous but I'm not you know I'm trying to do the best I can but see we can look at things and we can say well this is what I believe well why do you believe it that way now we were talking this morning right at the end worth it you know we were talking about the the seed and the finishing up and we're not finished on that we will get back to it you know so I wanna I want to read a couple of things before we go into the red part of redeeming so look at number one a now I brought these and it's you know I do it I pick up things later and get to thinking about it so look at 1A the message called communion one of the the great things that they spend a lot of time dwelling upon and you know people do it's the last message wrote around and preached which would be paragraph 49 the communion 65 12. what was it there was another William Brown see a little spot of eternal life down there and show everybody says see there was born with a spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there okay now remember it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed right 154 Church age book then I looked up to the trees I've seen you fall off last year and what are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here it was the eternal life working in the body then one day as I walked on to what that voice talking don't never Smoke Drink and so forth the young Fellers and all I got older and see there was something moving we get all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brown there's something calling Mike my little eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open it up I want to come on there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more see now we stand Justified as though we never had sin in the presence of God so now everybody takes that and they take it and they'll use it like I said they use that quote we were talking this morning always was eternal and then this they shut their minds off totally and won't listen to any uh form of understanding and I know what that is because I I know what it's done you talked to a a good uh any any denominational person especially something that are pretty well read especially say a badges and you try to concern him the the truth of one true and living God and he'll say this I can't accept that Doctrine because if I deny the father I'll deny the son and he'll quote you scripture and it's true what he quotes If you deny the father then you automatically denying the sun because it's one person but the scripture see is saying If you deny the father Son and Holy Ghost as being one you're denying the truth but you can't have one God without having Father Son and Holy Ghost all right so if you deny you're a Tunis you know you cut down one you cut hey but you see we want to make it to work that we want something down in there and see then it you know it can be we want something to hold on to and it's identically the same thing as saying I've been good I'll quote brother random brother Brown when he was shot by that gun and was thought he was dying and was falling and you know in the trance and things and going downward what did he say he said Lord the only thing good I've got to see people say boy that just turned him around right there and seen him right back that one what turned him around hey what does what people will say dude look at that the only thing that he had done was he had committed adultery so that turned him around all right and then you find out that type of person has got to get an adultery problem somewhere back to their lineage or through their their families or something and they're trying to justify things all right but now listen people want to take when veteran made that statement then they want to jump over see and and try to pick up something let's just keep on reading let's read on Christ the mystery God revealed was preached in 1963 728 page 67. you can't commit adultery you're already impregnated Glory he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed than anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has to come to life no world can get in oh oh and we'd like to stay on this for about an hour I'm sure you understand Christ in his alone already finished the seed was Dire the seed was already seed was already listen when was it put dark before the foundation of the world so now you have a statement from the prophet that looks like that some kind of little seed was born in there something about the word and then you have him telling you where that when that was put there it was put there before the world began so was she William Branham back there before the world began as a person for it to be able to be put it in asking the question is he saying that he was back there what part of him was back there any part you put back there you see where the trouble would be he says it was put there before the foundation of the world now before the foundation of the world we could only be in the mind of God which one is correct going down works as Faith expressed 1965 11 26. now here predestinated plan is in plain view just as other seed the word of God is a seed that must have the ground prepared beforehand if you shall see just throw it out there on the ground you wouldn't do no good the birds were picking up you throw it among thistles and thorns and choking out pretty soon Jesus's Parable said so the ground has to be made ready first all right now keep reading so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you you for the foundation of the world to receive him in this age before you knew you by four not his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you now did you come into the world with eternal life did you come into the world with a seed dwelling down within you if it did where was it put and when it was put when was it put though he said it was before the world he said he prepared us before the world so we need to consider then it's the seed he's talking about the seed is his word now we've done been through where the little woman at the well she had representation from predestination in other words God knew she would want to be saved sometimes well did she have to have something stamped in there is my point or was it God's foreknowledge that all he had to do was cross your path yeah which one was it do we talk about redeem but you better be careful because you might redeem yourself out of existence that's what most people do with it me all right now I believe what the prophet said because he's trying to explain the difference between the we call it Bride is a word where you use it or chosen of God and everybody else but you know in explaining that he calls it non-seed hmm and we preached on it a while back on that what is non-seed let's not see no none seed is a seed that can make all of the popcorn you I mean though cornbread if you want but it has no life that's why you look out here and you see it all across the land that's what John saw on Patmos when he saw the church of the church because it's beautiful look at them out there he flew the church right across over here they're feeding the poor how many of us are feeding the blood on a certain day they'd come by here and pick up food are we doing that what's the difference then none seed you mean you tell me that those Pharisees wasn't religious you mean you tell me that if you're organized religion today is not religious yes they are there's a lot of difference in religion and Christianity but the difference between the two is one of them with the seed that's quickened alive and the other one you can never be quick unto them because in none seed we've got it right over the next page you'll turn over to number one on your notes and then start you'll see and I forgot to bring this or I read you what it goes this is 152 I'll read you what goes right before 162. most of you know it anyway we've been over and over and over we did not become seed by rebirth we were seen and therefore were reborn now that's not on your nose so don't for only the elect can be Reborn now reborn means to be born again right right and that's what Jesus said to Nicodemus and Nicodemus knew the natural he knew exactly the wording the man brought he knew that to be born again meant you would have to have a another beginning Nicodemus knew that he wouldn't have done it Jesus didn't say what you needed to be saved not bad he said you must be born again Born Again means to be doing it again you see Nicodemus says you mean if I do it again I go back to my mother but he couldn't understand what Jesus was saying because he knew the word re coming before born means that some way you existed before you got to go back and come back through your mother again because that would be reborn see when you put that Ray on there that means that it existed before it happened before you see Jesus was telling Nicodemus your first birth is what killed you you must be reborn my original says You must be born from above in other words born from where I come from I'm going to have to die give my life before this can ever transpire she's not all written there you know because remember some way oh ever who wrote that Matthew you know he must have heard that from somebody else because was he sitting up there when Jesus and Nicodemus was together I don't know maybe he was but maybe he heard it later too because like Luke and some of them she was Luke and Mark were not original disciples all right but my point is what listen we did not become seed by the rebirth so then there's got to be a seed some way that we can get to bring it correctly you remember what we were bringing out when we preached a couple of messages on The Germ of life you've never seen all you want to but for German life is not in that seed it will not reproduce correct and what is the germ of life it is totally invisible science cannot find it science cannot find the germ of life it is totally invisible all of their x-rays all of their doings can't find the germ of life but you you know I don't like to use the natural story so much but them old chickens them old dogs and horses and them cows and they eat things and and then once the tree comes up where'd it come from the grass comes up where'd it come from you didn't plan it it was in that you know the thing the chickens dropped but where could you find it all right now if that be true then you know that you can't find the germ of life well then you couldn't find the germ of eternal life the one we read the prophet said you had in you the gene of eternal life because remember in in uh studying your biology I guess is what it seemed isn't it which one's it in other words you go from a gene to a germ and if they can't find a germ you surely can't find the gene because a gene is the process beginning before the germ my point is you can't find it all right everybody got that all right then you couldn't find the word that was in you thank you so brother Brandon wouldn't say it when I was born into the world there was some kind of something displaced down in there but he said it's just like that I was in my father he said I was in my grandfather he said I was in my great-grandfather the DNA now if you can chase it back for hundreds of generations prove and all of those are direct descendants all right then we must be able to redeem back the reward redeemed must go all the way back past once you've had as a human being and what would you have before the work if you can't find the germ of life for the human being and then you keep going backwards where are you going that's what I said now if you can't go you can go that way you talk about it that way but can you talk about it going backwards if you can't then you don't know what eternity is right all right so now can we get down in a minute we got your quotes on down here where you say but brother Dale we bypass start theophany right all right now see by your own technology or what would be the word your own terminology excuse me you're going to try to make it to be something that when you do you you start the word redeeming backwards and you're going to clean out of the existence and you prove you're wrong it's not going to get touchy before we get through with it because if you can go that away with and see the end of it is something that's fully redeemed if you can't go that far back that way you don't know what you're talking about well I just believe right now we don't have to understand all them things you're just too deep of heart your profit is the one I'm quoting why don't you call him deep but now are you following me we did not become seed by the rebirth I agree with that 100 all the way down you didn't become a son of God this is way down the road you didn't become a Son of God by the new birth do you have to always be one because that's the only way you could be born again I want you to think I want you to pray you said you're you just confusing me well then that gives you a chance to pray for God to unclog the the things because like I've always told you I'm not confusing you I'm exposing our own confusion I said our mine as well as yours because we've got to get the whole Plan of Redemption because we were sick there's a reason we could be quick so you say well now you say you believe that we were seed but you but you don't believe it was some kind of something put there why does it have to be put down was it in your genealogy coming down that something was put there how was you in your great grandfather it had to be a gene connection something you can't see right a lot of what they tell you is this flat theories you know right they can go back so far with their machineries and stuff but then after they go so far there's this theories of this and theories of that you know we quoted as being true but see this is what I want you to get this point and then because I know we won't get on Redemption the way I want to but looking out number one on your notes because this is continue 152 that was 152. this is continue on reading hold this in your mind yeah you did not become seed by the rebirth you were seed and could be born again you did not become and be careful now remember and take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own don't know if he bought it back it meant something that went wrong right we sold ourselves I hope you get that one of these days we God didn't put us in a pawn shop and then go get us out of the pawn shop we put ourselves in the pawn shop our representation of our our genetic back through time put us into the existence that we're in Adam and Eve only represented us right they didn't make me and you do what we done we've done it cause we wanted to right I hope that'll down on this one of these days the shed Blood Bought back his own he bought back the spoken word see bright so that meant she was away from me she was lost doomed and on her way to hell and deserves every bit of but yet it's predestination let him look down through didn't you and he knew what we'd accept see you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep now see there's you got one now you've got about two more where brother Branham says that I was a Pig turned into a the Sheep so now what's he doing you see contrary to his own quote no he's explaining something now he's explaining the word word seed you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind of there is no change in species he's taking you all the way back in the word redeem but we were born of cocoa butter you want that quote and he said as long as we're in this body will be sticky I just don't know which one to believe why not believe it all right right because if you're sticky in your soul then you're lost right right so inside of you can be eternal life beautiful and wonderful but your body and spirit is still weak I mean still tires the new birth never converted our body and our spirit it only converted to Soul all right see as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God we've heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son Save Me Oh My Father I'm returning to thee now look at the next illustration a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes it that he's a son and he goes and starts explaining about the evil the that you wouldn't you wouldn't the dog you wouldn't have picked is what God is looking at you always was his child right that's why you could be born again now what's he explaining whereas upon the other illustrations when you're talking about a wolf and a or something like that or a Thistle and turned into a wheat he's talking about what the bird does you know that little eagle he wasn't born to chicken he thought he was but he wasn't born the chicken they didn't put a chicken egg under the hen and it's hatched out an eagle come on he said you can go a long time without recognizing it how many years folks is it taken for this message to be preached to us for us to recognize and see by the word of God who we are when we were born again a long time ago but we're now recognizing it right sister Gail recognizing Who We Are what we're doing here do you think we'll take that the story of the eagle said see there but remember he wasn't born a chicken if he was born the chicken and then turned into an eagle you could use the illustration he was born an eagle you just recognized that he wouldn't that year was born again that old kookaburra turned into a wheat an old dog turned into it a dove an old snake that we used to be turned into a dove because that's what the new birth doing but then we'd go a long time before we ever realized who we really are see this message is the only thing that can show you who you are there is no message no words else can show it to you right the denominations had all those years and even in the great teachings that they had and the wonderful things that were even true today stand up and say I am let's see if you'll swallowing this could any of them stand up and even how many in this message could make this statement I am not a son of God that's only my title right for you to reference too all right see I say things ahead of time see how you'll relax you know I give amens out of it and then I get old knees when you really get down to what I'm talking about but one of these days you'll learn that but you see I am not the child the son oh Sam and Hannah Dale and we're not denying our natural birth right come on don't be silly run around and wouldn't denying he was William were flatter them he wouldn't William no more well what do you call himself he might not have lived too long after then because that was the 12-12 that's in December the 12th and he had to wreck about the 21 20th 18th 20th or something I guess the rest of them days he said my name is swordsman I'm not William Brown well brother Brown I'm not brother Brandon no no no I'm not brother Brandon I don't find out who I am well who are you I can't tell you I'm not with you no no he went right on it's like I've always said to you about the Lord Jesus run around and said to the Lord Jesus never call Mary his mother right right would you think that I would be calling him a liar to say that when he was a baby going in a cradle he'd look up and say who are you no he said Mama come on probably the day he died he said but right for him he said Mama I gotta hope you do you do it oh no brother damn he never called her mother no he didn't he never gave her the signification of showing that she was his God but he always gave honor and respect to her his life staying on the cross was what John he holds your mother take care of her right see we get all these great doctrines that we think are so wonderful I believe her brother Randall was here today I'm screaming the amen when he said he never called her mother he's meaning he never gave her the place our position to be his mother in the the point of something Supernatural but he honored her every day with the fact of who she was but he never made her higher than him because if she was his mother she would have been greater than him a mother is greater than a son we never gave her the the point of showing that she was his mother that way but she was his mama she brought him into the world she nourished him yeah that's where we think we know what we're talking about a son can go a long time before he recognizes who he is I've been in this message 40 something years you know what I'm just now beginning to realize as I am about 1971 if I'd have said that I'm not a son of God you'd have looked at me real hard wouldn't you you see brother Mo I think we better talk this over because I think brother Dale's getting lost in just a little bit there you know because he's now saying that he's not a son of God he's saying he's gone what what's wrong Jesus you agree with it this morning this was God made manifest called a son but he wasn't a son because the son has a beginning that eternal life inside of him never had a beginning right amen that eternal life in you makes you what people call the son of God right because you're God in another form but it's what you are you almighty God where his offspring the difference between us and him and the bases of coming we can look back down through our great granddaddies and things and find things we don't like because that's DNA but you don't have anything about my father I don't like it you know Paul said he came to him one day and heard him pray and said Papa get come to the place with God to him was his papa and you know what God had come to the place that that was not just his son standing there but that he was standing there in another body and that would connect us to it see where his offspring we are the children of God right the children of God as God made manifest in another form I thought we believe that's what the bride was that she was the amorphy of God I thought we believe that's the way that it don't turn out to be Trinity sometimes how that God can manifest himself in many forms but it's the same God we want to hold on to the Eternal son there's no such thing there's not an eternal sun today if Jesus wasn't Eternal something we can't be an eternal son we can be the children of God that are Eternal yes and we can call them ourselves sons and daughters and he's proud to do that because we're his children but he looks down and sees his own life but like I told you now I'm I'm stopping here because I can't go no further with these notes like I told you if Adam was away most people thinks he was then God created a body in a spirit and put his own soul into Adam and that'd make him God he wouldn't be at him no God made brother Brown said Blasphemous names Adam a moving leaving human being he made him a body of spirit and soul then he put eternal life in his soul that didn't make him God that made him Adam but you know who he was he was the son of God he was a little God it was God standing there in flesh but connected to a soul of a human being that God had created yeah man that's the wonderful story of redemption if there is something about us that can be redeemed because it means that it was there to begin with they think on these things sit back and use I call it what is that word I use I call it the law of elimination thank you somebody said it so I look at something from the law of elimination if I say something that doesn't work I just eliminate lemonade you know if I look into the Bible and I see something that exalts me and you as human beings I eliminate that but yet when I look at the Bible and I see that the Bible is showing me that I am God made manifest call the Sun I want to accept my position but you say well brother they'll look like the dirty part now listen I'm not talking about somebody that's living in sin now that's not what I'm talking about it's some kind of a sinful person that's coming up telling me look boy bless God I'm god well that when you start saying it like that you know the man don't know what the world he's talking about but if a person says God has made me this and I want to live the life that I can I want to walk that I can I want to talk the things I can I want to be what he wants me to be about you I want to exalt him not myself I want to live come on musician yeah he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love you do wrong brother Dale every day so but my desire is not that let's get it right now right now until there's just no no I won't do love till there could never ever the Lord is that your desire I want to live you don't have to heal me to prove that emotions me or put it on that basement like that and said God if you love me you'll heal me what's wrong what's wrong I love it anybody call my love is not on condition I'll love him if he helps me what kind of person or God didn't why wouldn't we want to be what God wants us to be with what he made us oh wait foreign what he's taking us from look where we come from what he's made is an Old Farm Boy when you listen raggedy Club shoes you're gonna get a second about where you come from Rush's words what else could we want oh foreign we just ask you to be with us as we go our separate ways and Lord let your love be made manifest to each one of our hearts and lives May what we've said Lord be worthy of being said we we need you father just come on the scene and speak to us as we Endeavor to try to speak about you because we want everybody to know about Our

now we'll read uh second Peter and revelations in a minute as we get on through into the message but we'll just read from uh Ephesians 1 right now so remember the this weekend now remember Saturday night 7 o'clock we will be having services and we'll be doing our fourth of July weekend that we started here 40 years ago and so God has been good to us and like I said if you think we've been 40 years around the mountain maybe we're fixing to leave it I hope so and and you know I believe it maybe we're going to quit this marching around you know and around and two tonight if anybody had a problem we're sorry that the internet system may not be working all right so that they can do the live streaming tonight and but uh you know they'll have it back on the other part of it but it's their problem it's not us it's something wrong with the the wiring systems of the internet system it's not us but maybe it'll work maybe it won't so we don't know they're trying to do everything they can to to get it to going so just remember that and also remember if you will now we want you to PR practice in the church you know your song and things like that but see when you come back you come in and you start practicing and you start fooling with the sound system all right you know it throws it off to where that nobody don't know what's going on because now you got to figure out where what's wrong with the sound system to where that you switch it over to what you think it ought to be you know and and it messes us up so we're just asking you we saying please practice don't misunderstand you get your little feelings hurt then sit down on them forget it but you know just if you're going to practice just ask uh Josh or Tyler say first if we not here ask Richard to come up and make sure that what you're doing with the sound system that goes back to the balance of what it is you know because if you come back there anybody I've come in here myself and even turned on the the sound system when we would start the services and you know and find out that somebody had changed the settings myself you know so I know a little bit about it but not much but I just know which one's got to be Which Way But Richard and Josh and Tyler they know which one to put where and everything to do so if you use it please just just ask one of them to make sure that everything's balanced and put back in order to where that you know cuz if you don't then you start singing a song and it's off right it sounds all right when you're in here with just maybe one and you're doing but then when everything starts back at the rest of the system then it's off and and you'll be up and down and and all kind of things so if you will just please ask and and do that we want you to practice but we want it to be where that we can't won't lose what we're we're doing to set up and have to spend half the time going back through to get it balanced up you know to where it'll be all right so if you would please do that just ask Tyler or ask Josh to help you and if they're not here ask Richard to to come up and and that way everything won't get messed up okay all right so just remember that so as I said Remember the 4th of July this weekend will be coming up I'm looking forward to it brother Keith Reed going to be with us to preach for us on on Saturday night and then Sunday morning and then we will be having a dinner together and it is Catered for you because we appreciate you because the 40 years has been with you uh and all and we we certainly appreciate it and we want you to be happy about it so that's we've decided to do it that way and you know ask the Lord to bless and just keep each one of us all right so let's go to our scripture Ephesians 1 and if there's anything else uh yes two we will be eating together but there will be no evening service CU we'll be eating together and just fellowshipping together and we'll have plent plenty of time and there won't be any communion foot washing or something we'll switch it on over maybe to the next weekend or whatever because we are moving the Bible study from the first Saturday to the second Saturday of this month of this coming month of July to where that we can get everything balanced up okay all right father we thank you and we love you and we ask you to just help each and every one of us and Lord just direct us all into what to say and Lord what we would try to say our own selves you control that to where that we would only bring what you want to be brought unto your people because we we we just depend upon you we ask you to help us and to guide us and give us understanding because you know that's our prayer constantly is Lord give us understanding of Thy word not just intellectual concept but understanding by revelation we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto it the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I hope you brought back your quotes from Sunday and everything cuz I didn't run any off and everything to get it uh you know for tonight because I knew we just continue the same point cuz I'm wanting you to see something that you know I believe the Bible proves you know the prophet didn't come to give us another book or anything like that he come to give us the understanding of the Bible that we already had we were the one that had ones that had it confused it it it it wasn't confused it didn't change you know that was what was so amazing that one day that I found out my Bible didn't say for me to baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost right you know I thought it did I mean I read it and we done it you know cuz we thought that's what it was but we come to find out that wasn't what it said right well then the prophet didn't come to to give us a new Bible he studied other translations and things and used them and that's fine you know to and I do too I use it to compare and and and to see what's you know the uh points and all of the of what the the maybe the commentators would say about it or or the different Bibles I I like to do that that's fine but I do it for the point of of understanding to help me to understand and see the truth right but now we've been talking about you know adoption and we've been talking about and got up to the stage of speaking now about uh Romans 8 and 23 where it says to Wi the Redemption of our body all right that is the adoption that we need right now uh I I've tried to make it plain as I could as much as I know but that's why I try to teach the adoption in three stages cuz the prophet said you bring everything in threes and things amen and and that way you can understand it better but I tried to bring the adoption to that point to where that you know when you're born again we were we were just totally annihilated from the promises of God we were we're not not in no form to be able to claim inheritance of any form right and you know Gentiles and and it would have mattered if you were a literal Jew uh you still can't claim anything on that basis but see then we had to be adopted into the family of God by the new birth amen now that's what I believe that that would take place because what Paul said in Romans 8 about 15 that we receive the spirit of adoption right amen that's why he called it like that and brother random I know what he would bring it to and and talk about the adoption as being the uh the checkbook and the hear you himym and the the things of that order of the re of the Matthew 17 I know that I know he also taught that we've got to be born again you know and and by doing that God had to bring us into his family right by the new birth right all right well why can't we just say that he adopted us into the family because that's what he did and giving us all rights and reserving everything and then we studied for quite a while about the uh the fact of talking about the uh the you know Matthew 17 to where it would come down to the checkbook and your name just as good on the checkbook you know as your father Etc but then we started the past few Services talking about the where Paul get down and he he doesn't say that this is the Redemption of the body see that's where our our troubles has been we've tried to implant into things that's not there it's talking about to wit and the word to wit is to understand or to be witty smart you know intelligent but see when you even put it to the intelligence form and you go back to Webster it draws it right back down to to the word to wit or wit meaning that you know a witty person is a person who has knowledge right amen I mean that's the sensible understanding that it has knowledge and see Paul then is not talking about the literal change he's talking about a group of people that when the head and body unites in the body of Christ and that's the way I tried to bring it that when it comes to the second stage of the amount of transfiguration that Jesus said and you know came to yeah then he went forth and bringing the message of eternal life right through the opening of the seals and everything and that was the way we compared it exactly with the way brother brandom went right right through you know with him and his coming and his restoring the faith of the fathers and then 30 something years to do that then his message comes and and we' give you all of these quotes to give you better understanding to let you see what he said right uh but we see then it's coming down to understand the Redemption of the body that's right cuz we can't get the the the body changed until we understand how it's to be change right that that shouldn't be a problem with anyone everybody said brother Dale's an intellect I think I'm a dummy but it's all right I prove it most of the time but see it it's coming to a place of understanding that's right amen now that's what we need you say oh we need to change of the body we we need to understand what transpires not the uh chemical uh part that it starts here and it works here and goes there and this turns and that turns and we start with A Little Bit Of in in eternity in the middle of the Bailey and we work our way out I'm not talking about junk I'm talking about that we need to understand the Plan of Redemption right well I understand the plan justification sa baptism all ghost well why is a lot of the people still looking for yeah a new body to come body that's right amen and they're doing it in this message they still believe that they're going to get a new body that's right you see and and and all like that and this this world is going to be destroyed yeah well the Bible says it yeah and the prophet said that we didn't understand what the Bible said so we used those the other day now let's just turn there in Peter and use these These are the scriptures that brother randam used and the main point I'm want you to get tonight is one thing I believe in a Redemption of the body right all right yeah I believe this body will be redeemed right amen all right I believe this world that we're standing on will one day be redeemed and then the future home and that's why I've asked you to read that message over and over there is where the city can come down upon this earth right all right now see then in the Plan of Redemption we'll see it very plainly that justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't annihilate you no that's right it only cleansed you and set you aside and then God come and filled you burn out the things now you all we're in the message see so then why can't we see that the same Plan of Redemption is for the world right all right and if you've read the future home you don't around what he said he said the world was justified in the days of Noah Sanctified and Jesus dropping his blood and one day we'll receive a fiery baptism to cleanse it and claim it you know cleanse it and set it aside to where we can come back and live here that's right all right now in doing that then see why can't we see that these bodies right see these bodies come out of this Earth all right and see then coming out of the earth then the body to be redeemed will have to go through the same thing right as the soul has went through to redeem it and as the world will eventually go through and the only thing that what we do is and that's that's part of the mystery you see we embodying things we step ahead of the world that's right amen see we go ahead of the world right all right now we may not get that far tonight but we we Step Ahead see the world was justified in the days of Noah Sanctified with Jesus's blood was having to wait for a fiery baptism but we step ahead of the world right and we're going to go into a change and go out of here in a moment of Twinkle an eye and all of that before the world will get its fiery baptism amen all right but see that's the secret that's laying in between to where we can understand but the main thing I want you to understand and people on the internet systems to understand that see we used to believe the world would be destroyed y you know I mean that that's what we all Tau I don't know what we thought but I know what we thought I guess we thought it was just going to and and then God would have to create and start back over again and and you know and all of the things and but we come to find out that wasn't exactly the way God had said it that's right amen all right now that's where we want to read in Peter to see that according to Peter that in the flood the world was destroyed that was his word amen but we're still here right right see so we missed it standing on the thing and said y back there know the world was destroyed well what did we do did we all get up and not ride over an ark and and come over and come down did that Ark carry us on up to another planet set us down on it or some kind of something I don't know right these all kind of man's ideas but just get to point now so let's read what Peter has to say about it to make sure look at verse 5 of Peter second Peter 3 and 5 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water now but the heavens and earth which which are now excuse me first see we by the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it didn't destroy right it only destroyed the sin right now you think about it you you that have studied anything and know anything that like up here in in Kentucky they find fossils of alligators they dig down in the ground and all of them great big animals and all kind of things wo over the top of them and you know what you got the church riding on them yely right cuz you got the oil right it took all the pressures and all of the things that made cold it made you know all kind of things and see it was made out of those bodies of people that's right and animals that's right that was destroyed in the flood amen right but all it was destroyed was the sin of the world right the core the outside was just moved about and and great changes took place and and and all kind of things around the world took place at the what we call the destroying of the world right amen but it wasn't destroyed right it only destroyed the world which is the cosmos right World Order systems all right then as I said you can go to different places you know and they're finding all over they find uh they found whole elephants you know just totally in inbedded in ice that had to happen so quickly until they had the green grass GR in their mouth and their digestive systems and everything was was full of green stuff and all it happened so fast that's what's called a destroying of the world right but it didn't annihilate the world Amen so that's why your prophecy when he picks these up as we'll read him he said that was something for me to see that that's right so Peter says it you know all right where by the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store he just moved everything about right reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men all right drop down to verse 10 but the day of the Lord shall shall come as a thief of the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that therein shall be burned up right looks like one of these days is going to be another Annihilation yeah and we'll get to it in a minute and read where the Prophet said see there it's not that it's the cosmos the world order that's destroyed all right then we go over to revelation 21 that we were using the other day 21 and verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away brother R says same word see and there was no more CA and now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and I heard a great voice out of the heaven said saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and what does it keep on going and it looks like one of these days is going to be a great Annihilation and it will be there will be but it'll only burn off sin Cosmos World water all right now what I'm trying to get us to make sure we understand there if we can see that's possible that this world can be redeemed now this is what I was trying to get across Sunday afternoon but I just said well I better hold it and back up a little bit and if we can just see that this world can one day be redeemed that's right you know that's right and that the new city can come down and John saw it he evident was on Earth and looking up he saw it he's standing on something and he saw it come down somewhere so why not you know all right but if we can see that now here's the point of the message if we can see that this world can one day be redeemed right why would we have any trouble about our bodies being redeemed that's right am why everybody want to you it right I know what it was in organized religion we didn't believe God was capable you said no no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah we didn't believe God was capable of doing things we wanted doctors to take care of our bodies we didn't need healing we needed doctors I reckon we thought God was supposed to give us doctors and thank God he gave us doctors sure but the point that see we look at it and we've always mankind has always taught it is going to get a new body yeah that's right why can't we believe if we believe the soul can be saved and we believe that the world can be redeemed why can't we believe our bodies can be that's right amen now they're not going to be 70 years old no no right see we've heard we understand the message of redemption amen we're going to go back to a young man a young woman you know everybody's going to be 18 20 years old or something because that's going to be the setup that's right the babies is going to come up in age the older ones like us is going backward amen see and some of you the 1820 were going to meet you in the middle but that still won't be you cuz you got to still be changed right that's right all right but that's the main point see and when when we read what the prophet has said then we can see that the Bible is not saying what we thought it said right we thought it said it would pass away and John sees the city coming down out of Heaven to land somewhere amen amen why not just believe it's right here right we stand on you got a millennial reain you got a cleansing of this Earth in the millennial Reign amen you know before the Millennium comes you got a a a a transforming until it be back to a Garden of Eden that's right amen and then we going to blow it away see that's why but the people of the message see they don't believe that because they don't believe in the Redemption of the Soul they believe your soul is annihilated no it's the nature of your soul right right the nature of your soul the prophet said was of the world right amen and it had to be redeemed right amen all right but once it's redeemed see Satan can't get his hands back on it right amen that's why I want you to read the future home and just go backwards and for and look and and and think with him when he's talking there's many statements that he's making in there that will sound just exactly like that he's he's talking about Redemption of the soul and he'll be talking about the body he'll be talking about the world read it very carefully dissect the message as we call it right take it very carefully there is a statement let's see in the church age book where when they put it in the church age book they they were talking and and and one little paragraph brother brandham is covering River Jordan and he's covering Mount of transfiguration and they put it all in one thing and see it's two entirely different events right but the way it's connected in the paragraph little short one it looks like brother R don't even know what in the world he's talking about but see that's why the Holy Ghost is supposed to set these things in order you remember the the board you know you know brother R saying our language is messed up you know about board but remember the before and after describes it you know come on board and pay your board cuz I'm bored with you well that's just explain what I'm saying you know what I'm saying about the word board then so it's the Bible clearing and understanding amen and the prophet didn't have to change it but see everybody with the big education you know yeah oh it's going to be blow away when he days I got them words and brother R come along and he said well here's this word and said U now this big old word here he said I have to spell it to you cuz I can't even pronounce it but said it don't mean destroyed y said it just means to pass from one form to another one and here's a big old stuff shirt you think he on stuffed his shirt no come on he walked out of there and said he don't know what he's talking about y like aons and eons you and all kind of things I tried to talk to my brother-in-law one time about that the hell wasn't Eternal and he could quote them big old words cuz he'd been to college but what was the problem with him he just didn't understand how own ID idiot like me with a ninth grade education could know what them words meant and could tell him y all right but you see it takes the holy spirit all right that's right it takes the prophet's message so now let's just read a little bit and let brother around and then if I have time I have some more on the back here I'll try to get to but if we don't I just want you to understand one thing and the anybody listening of what we believe we believe in the Redemption of the body amen we believe in the Redemption of the Soul we believe in the Redemption of the body we believe in the Redemption of the world and that none of it means Annihilation it means Annihilation to the natures of it or the cosmos World Order of it right or the the top of it or the the trash and I believe it's far that's why it says heavens and earth because as far as man has went out in space to the moon and whatever these ships are going on now Way Beyond there and going on out into the atmosphere that's got to be cleansed y right see because why because mankind that put his ear mark on it right right see all right let's let's just read some and think about it if you have them if you don't then just go get the book and read it that's what I said I I almost R run the whole book but let's just start off this is page 14 of future home pre 64802 now now notice how G makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he makes plain when he didn't understand it always he he come to an understanding one day how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans of anything such a glorious thing continuous reading how he led us to himself a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've taught that at the beginning I never changed since of course now they're saying that brother brand says they're quoting brother brandham and saying that brother brand said it's just the Holy Ghost now no I believe it's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said here I know it's two times in this message he said I taught that from the beginning cuz he always taught it kept his trees running collect right page 13 future home he said it's only the atmosphere around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed now we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere above he's talking about the thistles and the thing it's only that to be destroyed y sin will be destroyed all right going down page 13 still in the future home and this existing Heavens are atmospheres and the Earth which is now this Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that see it was made by God the Creator but all now what's where he put and all of our bodies that we live in now we're put in the earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out here when God himself created it you were in his thinking and in him the Great Eternal was the thought which is the attribute all right now it's like I told you a little catch there if you'll notice in your Bible that it said when Jesus went down he preached to the spirit that were Spirits in prison and it stipulates to those who were disobedient in the longsuffering in the days of Noah right yeah now why would he STI ulate it why would God stipulate it like that see it was 2,000 years right from the creation to the flood right but brother Brown said that your body was justified when the rain fell on it in the days of Noah what about those people before then give you something to think I so Jesus had to go preach to those who were in The Longs suffering in the days of Noah see he had to bring a witness a witness to them that there were some people that were going to be redeemed right right that's right was that not his witness exactly right other words didn't he go down and tell them you missed it y but there's people that have took this message and lived they people that took Noah's message and lived right amen that was 2,000 years remember a world a scientific world but see just just drop a little point to you right so then we know that Peter says according to page 14 future home here the Apostle in second Peter here the second chapter the fifth ver it's really the what's the third chapter yes I've got it it refers to three stages of the earth see he he gets three stages of it notice how he brings them the old world stood out of the water now that was the Andel luian now the one that is the present world we live in now called it a world the old world that stood out of water Genesis 1 now the world that is now present and then again he refers to another one the the world that is to come the new world three stages of the world so then now the three stages is going to stay the same as for your soul justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right it's going to stay that way notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he may explain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare that with our own eyes that God has done to redeem the world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable God now I quoted that one more ago and I want you to get it how he led us to himself a Tabernacle in three stages of Grace just like he led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've talked that at the beginning I've never changed he said keep your threes straight all right page 14 still in the future home the old world the Andel livan the world that's present now the one to come the W ages that he begin that he brings to us see his Plan of Redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes just getting you to see something if we can get to hopes of seeing at the world and how it can be and remember what I was saying remember my point to Wi to understand the Redemption of these bodies so we can understand the Redemption of the Soul then we can go over and understand the Redemption of the world it'll be a simple matter to come back and understand the Redemption of the body that's right maybe a little uh there that we have to get but it's still there because you're going to say to me brother Dale how can your body go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's very easy but I won't say it but that's very easy we just hold that if we get to it tonight we'll get on to that point if not we'll cover it later going down page 15 future home God makes it plain to us if that wasn't a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from God when I see this and see that since a boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've always taught those three stages of Grace notice if it isn't true now it goes on down page 17 how striking he takes a place where we are to dwell through the same process now he's called The Church through justification he called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire and took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before it can come into it notice he done the world where the bride's going to live in the same way his plan of of Salvation notice the and deluvian world after it had repented by through the Bride of that day now watch it look how he would tie the the the world to cleanse it it's a message you remember that prior to this message it's a message brother had a message there's got to be a message to go with it all right brother dick and I were talking down while ago see that's what people don't understand it's two accounts in the book of of what is in Luke I guess but anyhow it's two account in the gospel maybe one in the book of Acts that when Jesus appeared to the disciples when he appeared to two on the road to M he opened their understanding of the scriptures that didn't give them the new word right amen they to go to Pentecost open the understanding to the disciples after he met them right that didn't give them the new birth they had to go to Pentecost to get the new birth but he opened their understanding see brother random has come and preached a message to you and I that we ought to be able to understand the Redemption of the body in the world and the Soul at least our understanding ought to be opened right that us whole lot further beyond the the understanding that we previously had right but I want to re am I want that to become personal to me amen amen like I was tell in W the other day but I mentioned it brother dick you know I've told a lot of things around here that God's done and I've seen and things like that well you know if you want to take me to a lighter detector's test I'll go with you cuz there's no way in the world you're going to get that to deny what I saw Brother Gary is talking about it man sees a pink elephant take him to a lie detector test and the L test would show he seen a peak elephant right you said no it don't exist it did to him yeah amen the machine will show that what's right if you got something within your heart there's no way for Satan to take that out of you you have the new birth there's not enough demons in this whole world to get you to deny that Holy Ghost that's inside of your soul cuz if it deny you deny you don't have it there wasn't one born again Christian that denied Jesus Christ in the FX of book of Martyrs now there was a lot that didn't have it right that turned and walked away a lot of difference in where something's personal or not after 40 years we already have an understanding of brother Brandon's message right God has opened our understanding but now we need a revelation there's a lot of difference between a head knowledge and a revelation you can't walk on the head knowledge pink elephants you can't stand on them right cuz they don't exist but if it was a revelation you could walk on it that's why you can't take away what somebody has seen right brother BR said if God told me to go raise George Washington from the dead he said I'd invite the world that's right to come and see him raised amen why cuz he had something real right yeah see he was dwelling in a reality all right so why can't we understand it all right let's see you page 17 future home notice the Andel livan world after it had repented through the Bride of that day day Noah he gave it a water baptism covered it over with water then justification showing that he's on the road to called his Fallen World from Eden back to its restoration again then Christ came and shed his blood upon it cleanse it and claiming it see that's the world that we live in now that's why Satan he goes on down he said that's why Satan tried to give Jesus the world he showed him everything and said I'll give it to you if you just fall down and worship me see but brother R said what he had an ear marked if he done that that's why he couldn't do it going down not did you notice Abraham when they tried to give him the land he bought it with so many sickles of silver before the people as a an inside said he drop down he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it see then Satan could still have claim on this but it had to be bought San would have a claim on this world y if Jesus hadn't paid the price amen but when he paid the price Satan has nothing to do with it scripture say what Jesus there one day said Satan's coming and have nothing in me right now I want to get to that place amen now I may be there and so by the new birth yeah but I want that to be said about the rest of me right you said well I don't think you'll ever get that way well that's all right I now striving for that's right am you remember why I said that they quit on all of this stuff you know they're not going nowhere anymore why cuz it donees reach interplanetary travel and the prophet said that's the type of the Rapture so there's not a push to go right oh yeah they want to travel around but they drop back down right they watch let's just go on over and read a few for the world Listen to The Prophet page 23 future home for the world is number 13 if you're looking on your notes with me for the world is one of his attributes right now why is he so overjoy about redeeming this thing why wouldn't it be an easy matter to blow it apart and build and speak another one he's not going to do it but look what he says you realize that if he blowed this world apart he blow your body out of existence and you would have to get a new it right where'd you get it from Venus Mars Pluto or who still all the same Earth I thought we believed at least in some form the prophet did about the The Big Bang Theory he said everything come from the you know the S said everything come from the the one ball of gas that just blew apart back in the beginning yes so all of these PL and everything out there and they're still even moving we're moving we're not sitting here we're moving science can prove all of these things to us but look for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes the world becomes one of his attributes because it was God's thinking in the beginning to have a world to be on a throne to be a king to be a redeemer to be a Healer that's his attributes we like the Healer like the Redeemer what about he's going to sit on the throne work here in this world we're going to sit on the throne with him too work here in this world Amen a kingdom all right going down 25 so as old world frame did not destroyed by the waters when it was washed off the frame of the planet the old frame the all the dirt all the stuff that God put on the Earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed and the Bible said it was destroyed but it never destroyed the frame it destroyed it just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it the framework remain but you see now listen to this one but you see as justification as you Baptist the m just want to think of you just justification believing in being baptized that's not enough you wonder right back into the things of the world Bob your heart and wear your shorts and everything else see there is nothing happened yet just look back and seeing you done wrong what did justification do the world it never done a thing to it it started right off again just as much sin as ever it was that's the way a man does and that's all the father he goes Y what happened to the world sure it was justified but what it do started right back off amen did it change it when Jesus dropped his blood on it the world never even recognize other than a a shaking of an earthquake and and things right but it was not like even the washing when Jesus dropped his blood on the earth it didn't destroy the world and neither did it make it a fit place for God to live cuz it's still a junk right see the old framework 26 was not destroyed by the water the world was only washed off that it that got its baptism it was baptized so will the framework remain though it be burned by fire it don't destroy the Earth it just destroys the sin that's on it notice here some of you Bible students especially Dr Veil looking at me now in Peter in the second chapter of Peter here third chapter rather he uses the word world as a word Greek word Cosmos which means the world order the Earth will pass away melt the elements with firment heat see don't mean that the Earth the planet's going to pass away but the world Cosmos it don't mean the planet's going to go but the world Cosmos the Pol politics this boy that's a bad amen the Sinners and systems and sin I never realized politics this profet come along I always said that I've had my own definition of politics I know what ticks are and you know they're just blood suckers and that's what politics are but that's their business let them have they fine fun we get out of here Peter said all will melt with fervent heat and works therein burn up not the planet The Works therein The Works of man all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations and man-made schemes will go all go with it when it burns heaven will pass away with a great noise did you notice here Heavens will pass away with a great noise listen the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases in the earth and explode it exactly still on page 26 future home Peter said to S and Earth heaven and heaven will pass away and Earth with a great noise such an explosion will rock it because it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn everything there is to be done the fire burn it up and remember it's not all together just a literal fire listen to it it's also a holy fire that's cor that will take away Satan and all of his all of his Devils both Heaven and Earth amen will pass away killing all the germs all the insects all the natural life on it and around it even the H2O the water will explode think about it cuz H2O is two part hydrogen one part oxygen a deadly explosive right that we didn't even realize and I don't think we still realize the stuff you go up down and drink can blow you to pieces all it's got to do is just be changed right right who knew that uh what was it it wasn't fertilizer what was the other one ammonia nitrate who knew ammonia nitrate would blow a building up right we put a lot of it on corn and it blowed the corn up you it made it grow but I never realized it bow up anything right if it had we' have had fun in our day I told you about we shot 17 sticks of dite one year that's where I don't talk about these kids about their little simple things right you it's not that way I I don't like to be what everybody think well you lived in our day we lived in a big we live in a good world we all with a bunch of junk doing the things goling down the Moonshine we knew about the herbs and the things but you see everybody wants to condemn the young people well all right it is wrong to do wrong right we know that but we done our thing we had our bell bottom pants we had our ducktail haircuts brother Dale oh yeah we look like Elvis Presley yeah Sideburn I never did have that at the duct tail I never did like Sideburn never have my own personal opinion I don't like them can't trust anybody got Sideburn that's my opinion I saw that's my opinion but now look he goes on to explain the big word and many of you want to put down this word that's page 27 the Greek word pass away it comes from the word he come to find it and it's the word p a r e r e c h o m i a and he says it doesn't mean Annihilation it means changing from one form to another amen so the word world in the days of Noah was not destroyed it changed from one form to another when this happens in the end of it it will change it from one to the other now he goes on and gives you a lot of examples he said Paul used it when you want to put it down in Titus 3 and 5 Paul is using the same word means regeneration of men y that man is passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated when a man's changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed person he's been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated Jesus used the same word I'm reading from future home page 28 Jesus used the same word Matthew 19:28 now not 281 19 1928 he said to them you set with me and my king father's Kingdom regenerated the changed when you're changed he used the same word he used the same word he said when he said to the cult said loose the cat and let him go you remember that in the scripture said the same thing it's a resurrection of Lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loosed it'll be loosed from politics it'll be loosed from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God now I want to ask you a simple question and I want you to answer from your heart not from your head a simple question do you believe the devil will be destroyed amen or is that a quote that's right cuz that's a holy fire that's going to destroy the Devil and all of his angels and everything he thank God for a prophet we wouldn't have never thought about it even though though the scripture said that Satan would be destroyed what a great God that we serve he's not going into the future home he will be there even un kept under cover in the millenum because he has nobody to work through but then he's loose for a little season he goes forth to bring forth all of the people but then in the end of it he's annihilated amen the thing you're afraid of Y will be annihilated that's right I preached a little sermon when I was in the Philippines I preached it year before when I said according to the Bible Satan will be one day like a man laying along the side of the road that's according to the Bible and said who's afraid of this man it called him a man in other words signifying right that he doesn't have his supernatural abilities that he has this day because he does have them he even passes out gifts brother bandam said Supernatural gifts Satan can do all those things he's a prince and power of the a he's do all of these different sure but what about him being destroyed amen and the Bible said you'd see him like a man laying in the ditch and Brother Dean back there in karate you know was a time he could just about jump over this building but you see Satan will be like a man laying in a ditch yeah not even enough energy to get up you afraid of him brother random saw Satan right he said he come at him saying boot he said well I'm going to just see what will happen he just booted back at it well after a while Satan was just gone Satan is our servant that's right he's not our Master he can only bring me to God and help me by attacking me pushing me through this right but he can't destroy me but there'll be a day he'll be destroyed amen so as the old saying goes you know Satan likes to remind you of your past didn't he well there's a good statement among the people of the message I don't know where it come from where it started but it's a good one said when Satan reminds you of your past remind him of his future his future will be Annihilation amen just remind him of it when he tells you about your past to say Satan what about you tomorrow what about you when God decides to destroy you oh of course he's going to tell you God can't do that but we know the truth Satan will be annihilated see the prophet said the next thing you receive was the baptism of the Holy Fire and when the Millennium is over God's going to give the world a baptism of fire it's going to blow the whole thing up the heavens and the Earth will be on fire it won't be annihilated that's right now it won't be annihilated see the reason it won't be annihilated number one it's an attribute of God we just read that didn't we you remember the quote the world is an attribute of God Amen all right then how can Satan destroy an attribute of God it can't be done amen our bodies came out of it I'm just making sensible statements that's what I like to do I like to look at something see what the prophet said see what the Bible said then make my own conclusion of course that's what people don't like they don't like you to make your own conclusions no you don't have no right amen I just make my own conclusion got if it's an attribute it cannot be destroyed that's right that's right okay and if my body came out of it come on and if it's destroyed then I'm going to have to go to Mars to get me new one that's right or so Planet that's right no brother Dale God is just going to speak well where did he speak the first from right amen he spoke our bodies right out of this Earth that's right amen no I come by Mom and Daddy yeah I did but you explain to me what that Prophet said and I'll listen to you because he said things that even you women argue about today cuz he said a woman in her thing comes down say many eggs comes down and Sh says there only one comes down now who you going to believe all you women going to believe the doctor that tells you that only one egg comes down read your profit right right he said there was millions of EGS he said there were millions of germs come down right and he said it was not the the first one it met that produced the body he said one from way in the back crawled over and come back to one way over here he said how did you wind up being a redheaded child out of all blackheaded people he said somewhere way back down through there said great great great great great grandmother was redheaded took all that time to get it out you see we're arguing with the message y well now brother D brother Brandon was just so dumb he didn't understand about the eggs now he might know about the Bible Well if he know about the Bible I think he know about the eggs you know and like I've always said they say which come first the chicken under the egg we know for sure which came first God didn't create an egg he created a chicken he didn't create a male and a female egg he created a chicken but you see sence says well we don't know I don't give a who what sence says that's right what does the Bible say what did the prophet say there's a lot of things brother random said that totally went against scientific knowledge but a lot that he said if the science would have listened to it they could have found out a lot more about right scientific knowledge if they just listen to him that's right what you see folks now I'm going to make a few statements and then we'll come back and I'll cover this again so I'll keep these notes that I've got L here now but I want you to think about something we've got a lot said about the Redemption of the soul and we believe it that it goes through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and we now have things that we've read through what the prophet has said and we tried to study it to the basis of seeing that the world will go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but we got a lot of open questions there that still left in our understanding what happens to this body with can't afford to do as the brother in the message says that we'll walk out on our ashes in the Millennium now that's a big man in this message he said we literally just walk right out on on our own AES in the Millennium and then somewhere out here down by some way some P some something we going to wind up back up there with it you know and make contact well I just don't see that I'm honest I don't see it that's right because why would you want it changed why you going to change something and annihilate it why you going to resurrect something and annihilate it right see that's what I said I'm just making sensible statements well we ain't supposed to reason about the Bible I say the Bible's only things reasonable the Bible says come let us reason amen the same one says to cast down reasoning so what's he talking about cast down Mankind and his reasoning the cosmos the word order the atmospheres the situations of life right we certainly don't want to wait on our body to be redeemed in the fire that comes after the Millennium that will destroy the world right amen Cosmos we can't afford to wait that long can we so we got to know something about it and remember my statement it doesn't say that we are the adoption see you you come to the adoption of the hear ye himym and that's headstone but then there's another stage high The Headstone yep and that stage is to Wi Paul says to understand the Redemption of the body didn't say the Redemption of the world are you listening right Paul didn't say we need to understand the Redemption of the world I believe we do because they put it in the scripture but get my point there has to be a mystery and we must annihilate all things that cannot be true you know that's the way I study something you know we used to take what do you call those multiple choice or something like that multiple choice questions you know two School teachers sit back there three of them in here you know they laugh at me dmy talking about but what do you you get a multiple choice well what's a mul choice no matter what they ask you two of them is so outlandishly wrong until even a a dummy will understand that they're not right so you you just MK them to off right then you have to study on which of the two is right and we used to know you know true and false it was every other one was true and every other one was false you just get your orders and numb right but anyhow listen to get an understanding of the Redemption y of the body right I didn't make a lot of statements Sunday because I didn't want people and I'm glad the internet system went down maybe tonight cuz it'll make people want to stir up later and come back and listen but just listen to me we can't afford to wait until the Fire Fall fall over there after the Millennium right to get a glorified body right that's right amen see we have to step ahead of the world right you know why where the world can follow us amen our bodies will go ahead of the world and then the world can follow us we're the king pin in the middle what you want to call it the Keystone we're in the middle we have heard the Redemption of the soul for 2,000 years right right right but very little has been taught of mankind about the Redemption of this body that's why basically all organized religion and high for this message believe you're going to get a new one right yep where's it coming from what planet what place what position what where's it coming from see there's some keys that brother brandham made in the message of the future home to give us understanding about this bodily Redemption we've got to have a place to Anchor it to we got to have an example a TI a shadow right to precede our thinking because if not we won't be able to have it like up in the scriptures right so did you read these things in the future home or did you just read over it and say boy he's your goof there how about page 44 future home it's not on yours now don't look for it when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open Now where's this at River Jordan right where everybody now saying he wasn't God he become God he thought he was God somebody's God we don't know what God is when he went up out of the water the prophet said when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open the prophet saw it now who's he talking about John the Baptist he saw the heavens open and here come descending Out of Heaven a form of a dove and a voice say now what does it say over there what does it say there in the scripture about Matthew 3 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and Etc ET ET Etc tells you the things he does but now here's what your Prophet said it say it now let's read it and see if it changed if he changed the interpretation or was he telling us what the Bible was really saying now reading between the lines is fine as long as what you read is upon the lines correct we don't believe in Reading between the lines to get something contrary to the lines now your Prophet didn't say that he said reading between the lines is reading about Abraham and Sarah and how that they went down here and took a 300 M journey and here was great here was Grandma you know yeah you know her granny call her he didn't call her grandma cuz she wasn't that time we called her granny I think and here this man comes out and he wants to take her as his wife I mean my wife I think for 69 years old is a beautiful woman I'm not saying that cuz she's here I've always told her she's pretty when her mother at 45 was solid wheh headed I thought now she get 45 she'll be wheh headed well she's not she's not whitee headed but I still don't think that too many 18y old or 20year Old Kings would want her as a wife when they could have all the others that around is that honest that's not degrading her is it now when she was 18 it's like Richard said when he saw a picture of her when she was 16 right before we married he said well you was a model she said I was I turned out to be a model wife see okay so we just read between the lines but we didn't read contrary to the line right right and we wound up reading eventually that her and Abraham that were both of them totally Beyond childbearing right Abraham done all right but he still done got to that point you know he done lost it right and when he did it says that they were both Beyond they wind up with a baby yeah Sarah dies and when he seven more kids that Abraham had or something like that he married and seven more or something right we just read between the lines didn't we we didn't read contrary to the lines cuz that's what the line said we just didn't read it right so now when we're reading Matthew that it says you know this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell let's read what your Prophet had to say in the future home and he went up out of the water and he said I saw Heavens open the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and here come descending Out of Heaven a form of a dove page 44 future home and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed that's right and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest and the whole world I spoke it into existence by my word Hebrews 11 and Satan's held it all this time but I've come to redeem it so much of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it amen now the brother R said that's what the Bible said all right now yours the catch to it 3 and 1/2 years later later he receives a change agree but God said it was redeemed that's right there was no Redemption to be brought later there was only a manifestation of what had already been spoken right amen would come into view m p 44 future home John said I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her her husband what and where did it settle on just exactly like it did there upon the Earth one day it's going to come down on Earth just like it did on earth work Jesus was part of that Earth Earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon is that right and remained upon him forever it can never leave him it's always there he and God are one always has to remain and so so John saw the holy city of the New Jerusalem descending like a comet or a dove coming out of heaven and settling Upon A redeemed entire Earth to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth far every man that was ever what that was represented in eternity and every woman is redeemed then now where was your body redeemed remember what we kept reading in Ephesians everything's predestinated in Jesus Christ in him before the foundation of world Amen I've kept reading that over and over and over hoping somebody jump up and say hey I see it everything we get is in Jesus Christ that's right whether it be Redemption of Soul whether it be healing for the body whether it be a body change or whether it be a world to come down and live on it's all in Jesus Christ right amen and without him we don't get anything right amen okay to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth for every man that was represented in eternity and every woman is redeemed then she's been scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his fiery Temptations in the wilderness for 40 days after that notice it was ready for his it was ready for his ministry think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon the Earth Jesus and the Holy Blood and watch out I hope it don't go too deep for you page 19 future home now notice now as we take this this place we are to dwell in now the Andel luian repentance then brought water baptism then Jesus came and shed his blood upon it to cleanse and claim it the world are you in he dropped his blood on it to cleanse with cllean it right where was your body right okay so Brother D you got to make this live for a minute okay I will Lord willing then comes the next destruction of the world it is now and sin that's in the heavens above pick up on these other quotes let's ask you another little simple question was our bodies physical compound elements of our bodies whatever you call them 16 elements pot ice petroleum Etc was that in Jesus when he stood there and the voice said this is my beloved Son our natural bodies was not in there right we don't come out of Jesus by natural uh DNA genetics true right but he redeemed that to where that he could redeem soul body that's right and the world yep would be all made in Jesus Christ right all right now that was the beginning of Jesus's Ministry we just read he was ready for his ministry right that's where these people can't understand the anointing that come on Jesus on the River Jordan that's right it was an anointing for ministry that's just simp simple because he goes right over this a little bit in in Luke about the fifth chapter fourth chapter and he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because had anointed me to preach the gospel right that's simple but get to point now where does your Redemption of the body start so well it was done in Jesus Christ all right there's another one of those we don't want to wait until this that or the other form we need to understanding to it to understand the Redemption of the body not to change the change comes on an automatic process because we understand the Redemption right will you go with me that way amen the change will come because of the fact that we come to a position to know that we're redeemed and understand it will you will you go with me I don't ask you to amen cuz most of you ain't and like brother says you know amen is when you shake your head yeah you know and none of you ain't shaking your head so you ain't Amen in got one amen but think about it now what did we cover here a few months ago the Lord Jesus Christ had to have a river Jordan experience right that was his identification true that's what your Prophet called him he was identified on the River Jordan he was identified he did not have to have the new birth did he no cuz he was the new birth but he had to have that anointing to come upon him right to bring forth his ministry right now but you and I needed a new bur right so his first stage of adoption was that he started off on the River Jordan that's where your Prophet covers it now go ahead do what you want to that's right and then he comes to mount of transfiguration as to hear you him and then he goes on to the opening of the seals and has a has an understanding of the Redemption of the body right you remember that a few weeks ago when I was trying to say that you might not have been listening you want to go back and listen to some tap I've already preached most of this you remember when I tell you hey this is Mark number one you were to write it down what I say because I'll eventually get back to it huh Jesus didn't need a new birth okay but he went through that as an example right for you and I that's right and his body was redeemed right there amen 3 and 1/2 years of the most horrible time could ever be that don't have anything to do with it right he was already redeemed right amen that's why Satan couldn't touch that body Jesus Satan never killed Jesus no Roman spear killed Jesus no Jewish spear killed Jesus no beating on the back killed Jesus that's right he died of his own accord because of your sin and my sin amen that's right he paid the price amen agree but see brother r said when he dropped his blood on it that cleansed and claimed it amen our bodies that were in the earth y you see it's not only just that's not used in the who is it somebody get the scripture if you can I can't remember it but see I didn't mean to go this far you receive receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire right remember Holy Ghost and Fire right right you said well why does it say Holy Ghost and Fire brother R says because that fire that fire that's right comes right there as that Holy Ghost is coming in and says it burns out everything if you read the future home you heard him y said it burns out anything that was left that's right and the holy Holy Ghost comes and lives in you realize then that when Jesus set up a kingdom cuz that's what he come to bring wasn't it right when he give you the new birth Brother Gary he cleansed and claim that body he burn it out to a degree and he's still burning it out that's right cuz your Prophet says 49 of the future home that your soul is redeemed but said you're waiting the Redemption of the body he said it's growing on I've give you that quote three times already right it's growing on already started who is this MDC y he said it's already started see when he gave you the new birth right there he left lay claim on that body that you're living in yes sir Amen brother dick there's no way can ever be annihilated right you can burn it trash it do what you want to with it can't be annihilated why because he laid claim to it right that's why I believe we're not going to get a new body that's right is because the Holy Ghost come to live in this body right and now we don't like this remember a few weeks ago when I preached this way see when it says about Jesus it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell see we say one of these days I wish I could get to that place well then you don't have the new birth that's right that's right sorry right if you think one of these days you want to get to the place that that God could be pleased to dwell in you you don't have the new birth that's right because the day he gave you the new birth he come to dwell you amen put his own life exactly right redeem this body come on that's right you want scripture right you want scripture for those who Justified he ha already glorified amen well I just don't see and I'm looking that's exact what you would have done with Jesus from the River Jordan in 3 and 1/2 years of the most horrible beatings and life happenings and what he could go through with until a day come that that could be made manifest and his body would be made Eternal right you wouldn't see it back there either I don't believe in getting another body Holy Ghost is dwelling in this body right amen if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's pleased to dwell in you now I'll say it cuz I don't mind being blunt he might not be happy about it he might not be happy about living in you and me in the bases of us being and the sin that we walk in right oh brother D ain't a sinner you know you're the biggest liar in the building that's right but he says he's pleased to dwell I've got notes one of these days I want to get back and preach on sin again I preached it here back a few years ago I want to get back on it again but see you say well what do you sin with brother Dale I say this with love in my heart if you sin today and you're a Christian if that sin is in your soul you're lost right absolutely amen but then you tell me you don't sin and then you try to justify and you say that where brother brandom said the the uh Christians are the only one that has sins you say that it don't say Born Again Christians there I'm turn it I'm twist it right that's right with love in my heart don't twist it right don't try to use scriptures like that that's right your Prophet said he sinned every day now where did he sin at was it in his body was it in his Spirit or was it in his soul right you say well we're just a soul have we come all of this way to divide Body Spirit and and soul and then want to wind up and sum it up by saying we just a soul I know that's right we are a soul we are a being right but you must divide the body spirit and soul according to Hebrews 4:12 if you sin in your soul you're lost right yes sir so where did the prophet sin if you want don't want to take anything and twist scripture quotes from the prophet he he said he sinned every day yep where did he sin at in his soul the soul that sinth it shall die all right you were probably rejoicing over the things you first heard and the talking about the body being redeemed when you receive the new birth but what about your rejoicing now I leave that we with love and respect of all things if you sin as a Christian you better make it in body and spirit right that's right but if you sin and your soul you're lost if you're just a soul then it makes you a sinner I love you let's stand you see it's to understand the Redemption of the body it's too wi to understand the Redemption of the body you know what will happen when we understand the Redemption of the body the body will be redeemed the world's not waiting on the Sons and Daughters of God to just be a signs and wonders you remember that because manifestation means what to make known signs and wond sure makes God known and we covered that no Divine Healing no Resurrection Divine healings and things is to make known God Among Us but the world is waiting on the Sons and Daughters of God God to come to a place that they understand the we redemption in the body right it must start in your new birth and work its way out what we got 87 read book 87 anybody have a need let me bless Lord the way leading straight to the land ofing everywhere the my way every

where you find him right in the word good to see everybody in the house of the Lord good to be here considered a great pleasure to be here Amen to speak to you a lot of the people came you know and uh so maybe they won't be disappointed because they was thinking probably I'd preach something and and I will preach something I preached before but maybe we'll take a little different avue where Tau in some lines to where all but if you like turning your scripture turn to Colossians 1 can a great clever is I I spoken I standing back there and kind of thinking I spoke to in churches where they were hundreds and Y you know I felt no more big churches and things around doing and even some places overseas to speak you know I consider this to be a pleasure amen that's right to be able to stand here yep brother Collins to speak for him and to let him know that we love him and we want to at him in any way we can and we need need his help too he came up and spoke for us that's right and we really had a wonderful time that's right matter of fact I didn't think he had it in him just honest you know I've known him a long time that he just opened his heart that night and spoke to us and really blessed us that's right and I hope that the way it would be tonight in the morning to to help and to try to you know just Endeavor but I have I I feel the presence of God here more than I have in a lot of the big places I've been and feel no behind to where that you know that's right say well you know I'm afraid to say this or afraid to say that I don't have no problems tonight that's right so if I open up my heart talk to you okay um we're going to have a watch Night Service on the 31st and there's a brother Tommy or Tom Ernest from out in Witchita Kansas some of you may have known him he was originally out of Florida and and he will be with us preaching the watch Night Service and the Sunday service afterward and the Sunday service after will be at 1:00 instead of our our regular time so if you want to come be with us we give you an invitation come and have a good time with us end this year is worshiping 8:00 8 starting at 8:00 we generally have what we do we generally have the preacher just sing a little bit and then how the preacher preach a while and then we start singing and we sing till midnight we take communion as close as we can to the midnight hour so come be with us and just have a good time Colossians 1 before we read his word the prophet of God one day said it like this and always stuck with me he said no man has a right to open a Bible or to read until he asked permission the author of the book amen so let's ask his permission father we truly thank you tonight for your love and your grace unto us thank you for an opportunity to come down and fellowship with our brothers and sisters we ask you to just bless and have your way with what we would say tonight and forgive our sins lead us Lord in thy love and just let your light shine to each one of our hearts that we may see you teach us to wait Lord upon you and in Waiting then we will come to that place to work that you want us to be guide each one blessing little place Lord amen May there be a light shining protect it guide it Lord let it be in your love in Jesus name amen amen Colossians 1 be very familiar with all of uses that as we read God's word and just speak a little while Colossians 1:15 now we're going to speak on we're going to talk about the Christ of God the Christ of God you see the scripture read it oh but we want to lay down the foundation and then we'll be seated and we got a lot of scripture to read but I love to read his word that's just my way of doing it I love to read his word and and let you see what he said and that way he said that wasn't what brother Dale thought that's what the Bible say right verse 15 said who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist right and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the pre preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now we know who he talking about the Lord Jesus Christ right let's just drop down to verse vers uh 26 to say the reading between even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and for Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory you may be seated now I said I want to just take a little thought and just talk about we say we believe in one true and living God yes and we're not Trinity but we don't go that route that's right and and we're not oness because we don't go into that route that's right so the truth is uh somewhere in between the two that went one one way and one the other and the truth lies between well the truth is that there is there just one true and living God and the Lord Jesus Christ is that God now when I get down in a little while and start talking and when I talk about the Christ when I talk about the Christ or if I say Jesus Christ now I'm I'm telling you up front so you know let your mind be to where you'll remember this that don't uh think that I'm talking about the flesh that flesh had a begin about 2,000 years ago to fulfill the scriptures Hebrews 10:5 a body thou H has prepared for me all right the prophet of God said in body he was a man that's right but said in Soul he was God all right well that's the one we're talking about the one true and living God yes sir okay then that way then he was born Emmanuel God With Us that's right uhhuh he he was born Lord the Christ so then we we we lay it down and just think about it that who he is and and where he is and that's what we want to do so if you'd like to I I like to go in the scriptures and look at something so let's go to Matthew and we're talking about this one that we call the Lord Jesus Christ as I said now if I say Jesus Christ or Christ I'm not meaning the flesh amen everybody everybody got my point and I'm not meaning the flesh if I mean flesh I'll tell you about the flesh but I'm meaning the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir brother almighty God Amen cuz I asked my church a question years ago and and I hold on here I asked my church years ago a question and I said when you think of the Son of God I said when is what do you think of and they said well 2,000 years ago you know and I said well that's fine but I said according to the Bible and according to the prophet's message right that the son of lot the Son of God was the Loos that come out of God in the beginning absolutely that's why he's called the Christ yes that was the way of doing it you know because that way you you you keep it to the Christ yes and then you can follow that that's what we want to follow through the Bible but I want to First establish who it was was that was there that we read about oh yes and let the gospels declare him to be who he Isel look at Matthew very familiar with all us Matthew 16 the Lord and we'll read this from Matthew Mark Luke and John we're going to read the same thing and I want what I want you to watch is that each one of them describes him uh and they all totally compare to say the same thing that's right but each one will maybe one will say a little bit more than the other that's right and that's why I like it because see if Matthew said it Mark said it exactly the same all the writings Luke said all of it just all the writings John would say all of it U it would there would be no need of having Matthew Mark luk and John that's right you you would just have one yes but if you'll notice then you got as the prophet of God taught us that you got your Lon the ox of man and the eagle the combat Beach yes sir all right so he says line Matthew see Mark o y man Luke uhuh and Eagle John that's right and if you'll read in your scriptures you'll see that each one of them is explaining the same person but yet they're using their own human ability sometime and wording to express that from and I love that yes all right so then you'll find that in like in in Mark you'll find the Mark 16 you know about laying hands on the sick you find a lot of healing things all right Luke you'll find he's more or less like he's he's using the shrewdness of a man to break down who this is that's right and Luke is the only one and remember Luke was not an original disciple no that's right right he comes on with Paul all right he's not one of the original all right so you do it but look at look he says having perfect understanding and he was the only one that said it that way that's right but then you get to John John is more prophetic right bringing in to show you the prophetic side of almighty God keep that in mind now as we go along look at man Matthew 16 very familiar with us verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi guessed his disciples saying who do men say that I the son of man and they said and they said some say that thou John the Baptist some El another J M are one of the Apostles one of the prophets excuse me and he said to them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right now Jesus went on to tell him said now my father is the one that had to reveal that to you yes brother R in reference to that he even said it this way he said Jesus was saying my own life right did not reveal that unto you that's right see it took the holy spirit cuz he's the only revealer of the world right all right now go over to mark okay and when they compare totally we just read to verse 29 all right because basically what the others are saying and he say unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answered and said unto him Thou Art the Christ all right now so what do we got over here now Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God whereas Mark he just more or less shortens it to the bases that D the Christ yes okay now pick up Luke which is Luke 9 we'll read this 18 and 19 and 20 and it came to pass as he was a long praying see that's a little different from the saying of the other so it's not something that you say well well one of them is contrary to the other one no it's four different men writing of the situation of life around them at the time but each one of them is led by the Holy Spirit to to publicly pronounce or deire who this one is absolutely now as far as their their small amount of their words and May different in the wording right yes sir but their pronunciation or their statement they make of him is all the same oh yes but came to pass that he was aone praying his disciples were with him and he asked him say whom say the people that I am yep and they answer and said John the Baptist but some say El and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again see that's not listed in some of the other but it's still the same right and he said to them but whom say ye that I am y Peter answering said the Christ of God oh my listen yes Hallelujah but is there any difference in saying the Christ or the Christ the son of the Living God or the Christ of God right right amen is there any difference in the no it's just different ways of expressing it if you'll notice in the in the writings you'll find that uh one of the gospels gives uh one blind man one of the other gospels gives two Blind Men so people say look like contradiction no one of them saw one he didn't see the other one the other one saw two and you got to remember that if it's Luke that's writing who claims to have perfect understanding by the Holy Spirit remember Luke is having to take what somebody says yes right that's right so then there one seeing one and one seeing two that make contradictions see people do that to try to make make it a lie and fail to get that each one of them is describing who Jesus Christ is to them that's right and from the Revelation they're receiving so Luke here says he's the Christ of God yes all right let's go over to John now and then we'll get into more our thought John 6 verse 67 then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away now that's not listed in Matthew Mark Luke but that doesn't make it a contradiction that makes each one of them see in a different situation and then describing it and sometimes now if you know the history of the writing of the Bible basically uh in other words they wasn't going along as Jesus said something and they pin it down P it down no that's right that wasn't what they done no it's a long about ad50 oh my which was almost 20 years after the death of Christ right that that they started really writing down the records and things and you know it it wasn't that they were just going along writing it down look he done this he they were doing the most of it by memory but remember the memory could not be different absolutely from the god of the world absolutely so then God truly was the if they were writing it down you could see it as one thing maybe but I'd rather have it the way it come out because that way it came out by the Holy Spirit leading Matthew to write Mark to write Luke to write after hearing from and John really Mark was not an original right oh we only have Matthew and and John but Mark and Luke were not original disciples right so they were getting there from other things but the holy spirit is perfect in the way it say amen all right cuz they were describing who they saw right all right now John what did you see then said Jesus unto the 12 will you go will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go that's right watch what he says Thou Hast the words of eternal life we got a description in ain't that prophetic yes we we're talking about the Eagles see right the anointing Ministry and we believe and our sure that thou art that Christ oh L amen yes sir notice that in your scripture now thank you Father thou art that Christ right the son of the Living God yes now you think about it when it says th that Christ Y in other words he's prophetic in stating that there's no way to be anything else other than what you are Abol absolutely oh you're that Christ yes now who was that Christ oh right oh that's the point yes he emphasized the word that uhhuh so then what he's saying is is the same thing Matthew was saying same Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God all right here then John picking up Peter's answer and Peter is saying thou art that Christ yes oh the one that was to come yes and that Christ right all right now we're not talking about anointed ones of that word Christ yes okay cuz the word anointing means Christ and back and forth that's right but there's only one God right and there's only one Christ am yes amen and that would have to be Jesus Christ so what was Peter saying what was the Revelation that he got oh yes yes if you remember and read on down in Matthew you'll hear this flesh and blood is not revealed that unto thee but my Father which is in heaven but if you go back and read above that you'll see Jesus is asking who do Man say I the son of man am yes sir Peter never got the Revelation oh this right right of what God was asking right that's right but he got what was for the time because he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against this revelation of God see the son of man according to Luke 17 oh my yes would be coming in the end time mhm he knew he was the son of man yes he did oh but he had to build a church upon the rock yes which is Christ to reveal word that's right now so then that would be that if we believe the Bible that if we believe that Hebrews 13:8 is correct then he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right see that's why you can't have all of these doctrines and ideas of God here in the end time that are running so wrong because it won't fit Hebrews 13:8 right because if he ever was God he would have to be God and he have to always be God if he was ever the Christ he have to be Christ he has to always be the Christ absolutely that's right you see my point th AR the Christ yes so we got a great Revelation in he oh praise God yes he got the Revelation that's right Peter was actually saying you are that Christ am that Christ that always existed you are the Creator right are you listening right Peter was actually declaring that God had revealed to him that inside of that human body was standing the very almighty God right that created the world you can't have another Creator no you can't all right and we read there in Colossians and all things were created by Him by who by Jesus Christ it said abely I say it where you won't get mixed up not Jesus the flesh but the flesh wouldn't bti Sirus Christ that's why we don't believe in Eternal sunship that's right that's right right that's right you don't believe that no sir you can't have the sunship existing in the form of Flesh that's right right but he was the Creator God yes right John 1 1-3 says that all things were made by him you know in the beginning was work work God work was God work we going through but we failed to watch most of the time when he say and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made that's right brother who was the maker Jesus Christ he the son of the Living God true the one the prophet in the the questions and answers of Genesis said it was like a little Halo of light went out oh yes he said it's like the father there and said like a son playing before the door yeah this little Halo of Life called a little go theop all those big words that we talk about but break it down into simple terminology we don't believe in many gods but we believe that God can change his form right that's according to scripture in Colossians that's right he can change his form yes he can to where he can appear in different forms all right so then what do he just changed his form and stepped over into the word and begin to create the same God yes he did not another God oh sir this was not the prophet said God creating Jesus and Jesus creating everything else he said that make him less than godhead absolutely y so that can't be so he was the Creator God or are we're all Mally confused that's right listen amen so John declares it and says all things were made by him yes oh my Hebrews 1 1 and 2 thank you Father God speaking in Su town and diverse manners in the prophets by the prophets in is the correct right sir in the prophets right then he comes down to the lights says these light spoken to us by his son by whom also he made the world yep read that Hebrews 13 there yes or 1 2 right right now let's turn over to Ephesians because we done cover Colossians that all things were created by Him oh praise God let's turn to Ephesians and just read what it says about this one Ephesians 3 who is the creator right verse n and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hided God who created All Things by Jesus Christ right oh my listen all right now so then Jesus Christ had to be almighty God and not Jesus the flesh you don't get your M Jesus the Christ that's why did you go over in the book of Acts and you'll find in the the message that um was bringing there I believe it was by it was Peter once bringing it and you'll find out that he was the one that spoke to Moses from the burning bshs who the Christ amen who was the angel of the Covenant amen Paul declares it was Christ yes absolutely yes Christ was the angel of the C who was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel that's right the Bible declares it was the Christ yes oh yes the Christ of God yes that Christ yes oh the one who was back gued said let there be yes God in another form yes the prophet of God said when it come time for man and we had sinned upon the Earth he said God couldn't send a son he said you wouldn't do that would you send one of your children to die or would you come yourself that's right amen he said he would not do that he said he came himself he said he just changed his form oh yes amen and he just stepped over that's why the people can't understand it see that's why the Trinity is wrong because You' have free running the r and then they'd be arguing over who done the Crea and what went on that's right oh and you leave the father out of the creation because the son would be the Creator but if the son was God himself the father made manifest in another form yes listen then it's the same true and living godr yes sir brother see then when he stood here on the shores of Galilee he was Christ the same yesterday today forever yes he was amen that's why he can stand there and say before Abraham was I am oh yes thank God yes y amen he said in other words I spoke to Abraham yes Abraham met the Christ yes he called him eles yes amen oh my see many thank you Father Moses saw the chist he oh my remember the story Lord let me see you yes oh that's always amazed me that amazed me when I was in the Baptist that a man who stand up there and the Bible said he talk to God lip to lip in other words face to face he and then he turns right around in another next few verses he said Lord I'd like to see you yes he said anyway I see you they been in his presence he been on the M he been he said Lord I like he said go stand in the Cliff of The Rock how did that rock get the cliff that was the one he smoke over there when the water come running out of yes it cuz that was Christ yes see where Moses got in problems when he struck it the second time that wasn't Christ telling him to do that that's right Christ told him to strike it the first time who wasn't in all those prophets that were speaking to mankind amen oh who was it when when brother R gets over in Exodus 32 about 32 right 30 32 when he gets into that situation where there that Moses you know the children of Israel have sinned against God and made the golden caves and the thing and Moses come up to the place and he says I'll go up I'll go up said pre-venture how can make some kind of atonement and we w't get on that tonight oh you might get that tomorrow cuz all I want to ask you is what did he offer oh my that's right yes that's all I want to ask you yes Lord what did Moses you got from tonight till in the morning to find Moses what Moses offered check it out that's right come and tell me what he offered yes said pre- Adventure I make an atonement remember that was the story when he said Lord if you blot out their name they BL block my name out also that's right brother ROM said and I got these L here if you want he said that bothered me how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something oh L he said I seen that it was Christ and Moses yes absolutely yes that wasn't Moses that stood up there and said take my life that was Christ inside of the man but the man was human but he submitted himself he was willing to die for his people yes he was it's like Abraham feeding m C yes the Bible Hebrews 4 Hebrews 7:4 called in the man M amen he ate the C and talk to Abraham and said can I withhold anything from Abraham seeing he's the heir of all things J the Christ who was it back there that was speaking them yeah the Christ who was it in Moes that could tell God a better way of doing something it was Christ God listened to him right he said go on he said I'll deal with them when I need to deal with them but said it's your word I'll still pardon cuz that's numbers I'm love father listen that Christ was the leading the children of Israel right who was it in David when the said he would be singing in the spirit it says he was singing one day and he said the Lord said unto my Lord oh yes thank sit down on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stool who was that in those prophets brother R said when Moses was speaking to the children of Israel they had to put the veil remember over his face and he came off when he was speak he said he was God to the people he said when he stepped back he become Moses about because he was a man right yes but in the presence of the for the people they had to really call him God right because that's what he was absolutely he said you're God and said Aron's your Prophet yes did you say you can't talk get him to talk for you absolutely but you see what I'm talking about right that Christ that could come all the way down to look at it in all those like I said David as he would sing those psalms those hyns yes oh he get in the spirit and he say in the spirit oh yes one day he was singing away and he said blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin was it because David was such a good guy now he was a murderer adultery he was all kind of things deserve to die yes amen but the prophet that he said it to him Nathan remember turned back to David and said and David said bring the man up here that's done that and let me kill him oh Nathan said David you're the man oh God that's right watch it if it hadn't been a prophet they' have killed Nathan yes I mean killed David right there yes that me for the prophet Nathan the Nathan said but God told me he not going to kill you he ain't going to let you build house Jesus study your Bible and see that Christ follow him down to there as he leads the children of Israel and that Pillar of Fire would move oh yes and the cloud by day would move the children of Israel would move in it amen thank at the words of a man God would listen and excuse me for saying it cuz I don't have any education if God had changed his mind he said now wait minut okay well that's good we know God don't change his mind that's right he knew what he was going to do but he was fixing to kill them people that's right he was right he was fixing to kill him now don't you think he knew who was going to step in the way before he got there sure amen he was coming down in the garden yes he was coming down in the garden he was going to kill that Adam and Eve sin can't stand in the presence of God you got to have an atonement amen oh God see before he could come in there and destroy then he himself had to kill those animals yes it did you said God did my Bible says it yes it did that's right prophet of God says it l yes it is that God killed those animals yes Oh my he said Adam and Eve was back in the bush he having church it's the words he use really thought they were doing good my said God right made right amen amen why before the foundation of the world he said all names were written in the lamb book alive he stood the lamb slain so he couldn't kill out need what took care of Adam and Eve the minutes or seconds they were standing there if it was ever a day or how long it was that they were standing there before God after they both sin but took care of them that's right God promised it right amen God promised it then he turned around he's running them out of the garden right you're prophet of God says it like this he said there he was he said God could not let them leave like that even though he had done major skins to cover them and done off he said he couldn't let them leave like that said as they started out of the garden said he turned and said Adam the seed of the woman will come yep to take care of everything that's right it took 4,000 years right for that Christ to be able to be born upon the Earth see then when they looked at Jesus they could see that Christ yes that was what was revealed to him you are you are that one that has created you are that God MH yes right you are that Christ yes oh the one that was promised to come yeah to take away our sin yeah but Christ amen the son of the Living God if you notice in I believe what is it in Hebrews where it said half in these last days spoken unto us in his son son that's all right you know God's still speaking am yes sir yes sir I believe God still speak he said no brother brand was here and he only one spoke well then he's not Hebrews 13:8 right so you goofed up somewhere right cuz you got him talking you got him talking you got him quitting come on no sir he's still in his bride that's right when we read Colossians to start with that it's what what happened on that day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down from heaven as a mighty rushing wind oh listen yes and sett in the church yes y Paul said is Christ in you abely the am thank you Father praise the prophet of God said it like this he said to the same God that created the world Amen is now living in you in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you a new birth oh yes Hall see that makes in Hebrews 13 that's not another God another situation that's where you w this Miss see your Trinity we know they were wrong CU it can't be true right but the oness see they hold that Oneness Oneness Oneness but go find you want and ask him he'll tell you brother R will tell you that oness is one like your finger abely go find you one brother s he went found any one yes he found somebody that could express you know what a one this Doctrine is when that Jesus was the life form of God right that's a one this doct that's correct Jesus they believe was the life form of God y now I don't believe that amen I believe the bride is the life form of God because it's Christ in you the hope of glory not another God not another thought and idea right amen is Christ Living in you right yes it is oh my speaking brother said God wants to use you Amen to speak that's right to the people y you go out and you testify to somebody what do you think it's doing if it's really right now if you're just trying your best to convince them that's not Christ that's right that's you and a little bit of God I say it that way because you do have some truth yes yeah you want to go out and do it yeah but when you really l oh my now listen heard of a man in the church one time and won call where it was because they might not want it because it was told at our church but this man was R driving down the road one day he looked over and he seen this woman walking down the highway and he knew what she was she was a prostitute he pulled over to the side and roll down the window and he said how much for your time she said so much he said crawl in she got in the car and he handed her the money he went parked stopped the car said I have your time yes yes he said I want to talk to you about your soul am he said God spoke to me told me to talk to you prise God you know she scared of death then she'd never heard nothing like that right in her business she's in she' never heard nobody talk like that right but you know in a little bit she became under conviction and came to church got amen that's right I'm just wondering do we really know the voice of God y right well see Satan can tell us sure especially now after we hear the story yes see Satan can tell you walk you know would stop you remember R random saw this young girl walking down the road about 16 years old didn't have many clothes on twist anyway he said I'll go back and talk to her the holy spirit said you do and you'll be arrested y so you got to know it's God it's got to be Christ yes if it's Christ it'll be right yes oh God wor about it that's right but is God still talking amen sir I believe he's talking to his bride she's the last form now the the 144,000 will be the form of God after we leave right so it's all not over with that's why they told me when I first came into the mission they told me it said Redemption was over 60 3 and I said well I'm sorry I don't claim the Holy Ghost but I didn't claim it just because I come into the mission I seen I didn't have it because of the Prophet the way he was expressing it and I mean I was a deacon at 23 years of age I was teaching adult Sunday School classes when I left which was the deacons and elders and they their F you know them the older people but I saw that I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost well don't you think it's something when I come into the message and the first thing they told me said you can't be saved got 63 I said well according to the prophet and the way he says things is one thing but I said you know according to my Bible is what a call see I had a good decent memory of the Bible I had more of it then than I have now cuz I've lost a lot of it but I said according to my Bible Redemption was over before the world ever begun amen that's right yes sir but all names were written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of that's right I said you're telling me that I that redemption's over you see that was the point I was getting I said even after we leave out of here people when I told him I said there is a Redemption going to Israel the 144,000 will be the form of God for the period in time and even that the white Throne judgment the foolish virgins and those people will be given eternal life do you agree amen then Redemption is not over until all die that's right brother amen let nobody don't run around say one said Don't listen to man s listen to God that's right you see I was 2 years before I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes reading six books a day and listening to two takes oh yes I had a wonderful job and a great opportunity not just packing everything I could get brother Dale you you say you didn't have a that no I didn't I knew I didn't I knew I was justified and Sanctified because I heard what the prophet had to say and I knew that that person that he was speaking of was not in my heart oh listen yes church because I saw that person when I was 11 years old standing in a church Lord that I wanted that God in my heart see God is still talking yes he is he's still speaking through his bride where he really wanted to be oh god oh when we say when that which is perfect is come that's which is part has done away we know that's not doing away with the gospel right that's right amen it's coming to Perfection but you know what I believe that which is perfect I'm looking at it I've been preaching eight or nine sermons already on perfect oh God yes Hallelujah on the word perfect I'm looking at perfect amen this is the Perfection that's coming to change our bodies this is where we can actually stand in the in the last days and the ch abolutely these bodies can be changed Martin Luther couldn't do that Wesley couldn't do it they could not do that it takes the word to bring that which is PR John in what we read in there said thou H has the words of eternal life that's right he knew he didn't have eternal life but he knew he was standing before one that even is worth was eternal life what about you and I amen that's right Paul said Christ in you the hope oh what is he said that's right hallu you doubt I mean just a hope when you receive the new birth you reach the condition in existence that you realize right I have eternal life in my soul that's right but I wonder about this body cuz that's what we used to do we used to all teach and get us a new body they still doing that in the M but still teaching get a new body that's thir is the same mind I ain't got time to F with you see according to my Bible my Prophet Jesus even raised R nail Prince and his body so it must be the same one amen that's what the prophet said and what the Bible said sir amen but you see they don't believe that God is great enough to redeem this oh my why why if he can put it in the soul why can't he bring it out into the body right if he can heal this body yep why can he not give it eternal life that's we got to go to the one that's got eternal life absolutely absolutely we got to go to the source of eternal life amen that's what John declared thou Hast the words of eternal life you are the Christ you are allight God hallelujah and Jesus is that brings a hope when you receive the new birth yes that's right come on that's what Paul's talking about absolutely when you receive the new birth in this age now the ages down through there they could only have a hope of redemption that's right are you listening yes Luther and them they couldn't teach to change of the body because they didn't know right now they can read the Bible yes but it not been revealed unto him so they were dealing with a hope yes but that hope make us not ashame that word hope doesn't mean hope yeah look it up it doesn't mean that it's the same word as Faith yes oh my it's just the way you're saying it yes because the new birth brings you in this day a hope yes it did an understanding that these bodies can be changed how by the Christ that's inside of us amen amen Oh Glory yes so then he was that Christ yes he was and he's still that Christ he who is it to you brother there he's that Christ amen that's right he's that Christ that spoke the world he's that Christ that guided the children of Israel he's that Christ that can tell God a better way of doing so and God listen to him amen oh he's that Christ and who are you Christ in you then who are you uhhuh come on come on folks I think spending a lot of time think about it who are you come on right you are that Christ amen hallelujah what Christ the Christ is going to take a change in the body amen yes absolutely the Christ is going to bring us to a change Resurrection ra the Dead I told my church probably 30 years ago or more I said the way I see it there's going to be a lot of people have to die before the change you know the moment the twinkle an eye the change comes I snap my finger where you mean see what I mean the moment the twinkle of an eye a say they're not in going to be in the Rapture no way but I said there'll be a lot of people go by the grave because they won't be able to stand to take that chain because they won't see who that Christ is Buried one just the other day and we sprinkled his IES I told my wife 20 years ago or old I said Don come back he back and went I had problems but I said he'll come back that's right before the end he came back amen I think God still speaking amen you think that was your idea when I stood and told him my son back there would be come to the Lord all the years and he back to Liv and I kept telling everybody else he's com that's right Joy Fon she can wi me said you know Danny I come to her one day and she was talking about it I said Danny Choice has coming forget it oh I mean Danny's coming I told Joy I said Danny's coming right I said forget it and you know what he fell off a chicken house might got killed you know what he's the church today oh my yes that's right you see I kept telling him my son's coming cuz God showed me you know what he showed me the Bible says you'll be there with your Offspring yep right that's what the Bible says Y and every time I see that I mind I said that's me that's me he's talking to me then he came back to the Lord I went to my wife from d and said there's more to the story now she said what I said you going to be standing in pooping preaching with me well he's preaching in the morning out down here see I believe God's too that's right amen yes sir you know you don't think about it a lot of times but you're doing a lot of speaking yourself that's right true you know like yes why don't she just speak I don't have any problems with telling somebody the Lord told me something and then it don't come to B Butz I would say the Lord didn't tell me that that's what the Bible said I said it presly but if I said it in it comes to P then it wouldn't me anyway that's right it was the Christ absolutely the same one that said let there be light yes amen AB that's right brother amen say your son will be in the ministry beside of you oh thank God the same God yes that's right why can't we believe that but you see we doubt it right something comes to you your thought comes to you and you doubt it why when not speaking amen oh yes but I've never been one like this now I'm not one that I'm straight on what I'm saying I I don't believe in speaking something that takes 100 years for it to come to p and another generation does yeah I don't believe in that right God tells you it's going to come to P come amen that's right and it'll come pass your lifetime and you're do it Y and it ain't well I think somebody in here might have a wreck one of these days well about 20 something 20 Oaks or something you know average percentage if we go for 20 years one of us going to have right right right but see that's not God speak no that's right that's not that's right that's why they done that with brother R see and he said one of these days I'll show you that wasn't right said it only exposed them Absolut he would stand up there into discernment and things he said that would have been used to start with he said but it exposed the other why cuz God don't have to have none of that that's right he says it that's it I believe he's still talking amen I believe he Hebrews 138 that's right amen and if he was back there he's still here right amen when are we going to believe that's right when are we going to accept it right you got a love one that's lost speak the word come that's right that's right what if it don't happen they're lost what what did you add to the problem yeah right they're lost what did you add to the problem did you make them more loster good word no did you did you make it something that couldn't be done nope speak it amen yes sir that's rightward amen is that what God Said to the prophet why cry speak he yes amen oh God M I read the day got it in my in my briefcase at deot if you want it brother around said please to honor your word please to honor your word because it's the same Christ that's right the son of the Living God Amen what do you think about Christ I

about your word and Lord help us to walk in you forgive our sins and keep our hearts and lives directed on you because no matter what comes or goes we want our desires to be centered solely upon you and the word of the hour guide us now in Jesus name amen Ephesians one we begin in verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're at now in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood to forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time now here's the the whole thing that you know bringing it down that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ now let's go over to First John 5 just one verse verse 20. and we know that the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding now if you have the new birth the Son of God Has Come to do what now to give us an understanding see and we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word what is eternal life to know him to know him is eternal life and who is he and he's the word right so then to know the word not letter not quotes you know the letters on a page that'll kill you but to know the revealed word is to know eternal life right because that's what we've been trying to to talk about we've been on predestination now for uh this is about tonight's message and uh we've been trying to get you to see a point that you know we want you to stay on and hold it that we see that predestination is what people say is a bad word but it's it's not a bad word it's our understanding of it right it's what we make it a bad word the word itself is okay but you know what's what our understanding and our understanding of predestination has always been based on not everything is really on the Bible is based upon our previous understanding right all right now if we've been taught the truth come on then you know we can can uh uh you know we can have it understand it but if we've been taught era right see there's no way ever to come in error listen to what I'm saying now you can't come in error to the truth right there's no way era can bring it to the truth right right it can't do it it can't bring you to it it takes the truth to bring the truth all right now you know to find out we're an error to get rid of it yeah that's a good point because that's what we need but error will never bring truth you have to see truth and then error automatically will unfold when you see one true and living God see then you can see that the white horse rider would have to be the Antichrist Etc or whatever because it would be something in opposition and you know in that then that's why we've stressed that the prophet says that there's not too many uh genuine new births one because the word is not taught correctly all right then when the word is not taught correctly then what are you going to get you're definitely not going to get you know genuine verse out of it it just won't work so you you know you have to uh uh try to find the truth because you shall find us and know the truth and the truth shall set you free all right but what is predestination the prophet of God said you know that predestination looks back to foreknowledge all right or it looks back to election that's the two different points that he uses all right now so that means for knowledge is first if predestination looks back to foreknowledge then that means that for knowledge was in existence before the predestination all right and it means then that what is predestinated to be is because of the foreknowledge they you know that then should be a sensible uh understanding let alone a spiritual Revelation that would just be into our hearts to see that God then would not predestinate according to his desires but he would really predestinate according to your desires amen see he would predetermine it because of your desires and your thoughts and he's the prophet said if you wanted salvation then God would have it ready for you when you got here all right see now ever and then you get into that then then you can just keep going but we spent time on that laying that Foundation to not get away from that now and then we started moving a little bit now into going back into the the you know into God and his ways and and uh as I tried to tell you for over and over and over we saw oh we were just in the mind of God well that's wonderful that's a good quote that's all right but remember Judas was in the mind of God I mean at the same time he saw uh Jesus coming on Earth Me by his for knowledge abilities he would also know that Judas this carrot would be there all right and they would both be from a thought in his mind but remember now that Jesus would be predestinated eternally and Judas would be predestinated to go to destruction all right so then God would have to have a way that he could do that and so he does it by foreknowledge you know these foreknowledge allowed him to understand got to have her brother back there with us good see we always say you're a visitor one time and two times you're just a part of us so make yourself comfortable no so then predestination is not hard if we follow it correctly we try to make it to be what we have been taught as I said all of our lives right and in doing that see then we come down to a conclusion that it is not as the prophet said the person everything in the world if if God if I always say that to us let you you're the question not me if there is a God he said well you're saying therefore is when you're down there no I'm not doubting them that's in your your point that's to you you're the one that's saying it not me all right if there is a God and he can't keep things straight and run it right then one worship him I mean let's get us a totem pole and have a good time and forget the whole thing you know yeah but if there is a God then if that God doesn't know the very beginning and the ending then what kind of a God are you serving well in a way I guess you know in a way you know that uh maybe he knows a little bit well that means you know more than he does yes no that's the reason I like talk fun you know blunt see if you think that God doesn't know everything then you think you know more than he does well see that puts you in a bad position but anyhow I mean then we get into looking at as I said about for knowledge and then how would God predetermine things to be is because he could look down and see the Bible says Jesus Christ is a lamb slain Revelation 18 13 8. then he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so then if he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world we know that wasn't a physical happening right because some 2000 years ago then there was a physical happening that Jesus Christ had to die on the cross if it was physical back dire there was no reason for him to come down here and die again so that's not real but they're in the physical that was in the mind of God so then he could look down and he could write her name down or leave her name out because of our choice that's what I said there and I've tried to make the point over and over to you see the reason people don't want to believe in foreknowledge they're afraid of it they're afraid of four knowledge they want to be some great big spiritual thing about oh I just believe you know like who was it the old guy you know stick his hand in you know Napoleon walk around and they just want to believe that all oh yeah I've resisted sister you know what does that do any good but you see then you start saying yes but now God predestinated according to what you desire all right now here's the one side then I see people don't want that because they know it's based on what they do you say now salvation brother the hell is not based on what I did I didn't say anything about that that's right that's right but what we do and don't do has got a lot to do with it but we don't go out and live like the devil don't want to die like Paul me so then what we do is is we wind up making the Bible false prophecy by taking our own conceived idea I'm saying this is what it is then we turn around we take the message of the hour that we believe that God sent us a message and then we've come to that basis and we we want to make it line up where we want it to line up to be able to see it so people's afraid of foreknowledge because you're sitting there right now thinking something all right because it's impossible for the human mind not to think right all right so you're thinking you know that God knows that thought yeah that's right and he not only knows the thought he knows why you had to talk and he's going to know the next thoughts you have about the thought right now if he doesn't he's not God all right so then what you have to do is you have to to bring it to a basis of where you say wait just a minute now God knew I was going to be saved to have everything ready for me the only thing I can do is accept it all right now me accepting him is one thing amen but him accepting us is another thing amen now him accepting us is based upon a higher level or reasoning or some you know reason for it to be done and uh then that way we want to go into that point to see that and like I said now if we just deal with being in the mind of God whether than Judas this guy it was in the mind of God that's right the at the same time Peter James Johnson and all of them was upon the Earth Judas was right there and in the mind of God he knew exactly what they would do he knew exactly what Judas would do all right see then the thing formed the scripture says can't say why did you form me this way because God never made us wrong that's right right like I'm trying to tell you all even into the Fallen condition God gave you a perfect soul I didn't say eternal a lot of difference in the word but how could God give you an imperfect Soul well it's God's fault because of my problem here now you're talking about the flesh but still it doesn't make no difference because the a baby is as perfect as it can be when it's born unless there's something wrong physically in the body so then God gives you a perfect Soul a perfect spirit and he does the best he can and that's putting the distance blank that just blank as I can make it under the condition we exist in he's done as good as he could do about bringing us into the world hmm but see then what we do after then is what salvation is based upon because if you won't accept it well if I'm predestinated I'll be there all right the predestination is whether or not you accept it because he could predetermine but now as I started saying a moment ago then according to about 154 churches book it's not the person you know but you're looking at the the people we're looking at from God it's the seed our word that's right all right now so then that cedar word can be predestinated and it will take place but see in doing that then if you believe in it that he would predestinate the word like we'd say forever Age The Prophet would say it they would be a word and God before the world predestinated it and he knew where that would be director so when Martin Luther walked out there to preach the message to the just shall live by faith that was that justification was the predestinated seed all right now Luther the flesh was predestinated by foreknowledge of what would come upon the Earth and all of his trinitary and Doctrine they had and believing I think he would neither one that said the Jews were to be taken out and killed was Martin Luther you see because he didn't understand what the that part wasn't predestinated eternally it was that word for that day but it would have to be somebody on Earth to take that word and preach that word to bring It Forward all right so then that would be the word would be predestinated eternally thank God for giving us the word that we can believe it because they're deceived forever ages you live in see then nobody can take your place but God's waiting on you and I to realize it well I've always believed presidentialize the word well how do you believe it well I believe I come into this world with eternal life that's the way some of the people of the message never believe well that's their belief that's nothing to do with me and you I'm not going to argue with them about it that's their business you can believe what you want to you can believe you're a big toes God but I always tell you don't stick it up for me to kiss it cause I'm not going to do it I might hit it with a hammer because I'm just not going to play around no all right but as far as what you believe you believe what you want to I've never tried to convince nobody of what I believe I try to preach the gospel and unless you make up your own mind all right you see then I believe before you can have eternal life that you must receive eternal life that's what I'm trying to get over Wednesday that night there you know and and everything and I've had these notes so you forgive me when we get over at a while and you got x's on them because I've had these notes for a while and then Joe's having a joke on them backers and forth for them to be able to get them on the internet but still what I want you to think about today is did you come with eternal life that's the way some people believe wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if it was true but I don't believe it would that be a wonderful situation you think about it you wouldn't have to worry about a thing that's right you just live like you wanted to and then you're going to help me anyway because we're eternal because I don't believe it I believe you must be born again that's right I believe you must receive eternal life as the prophet of God said even your little Virgin Mary that you call the mother of God said she had to go to the upper room to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I believe that anybody would have had any right to us to have hollered and screamed about eternity it was probably her that's right because she was a carrier of almighty God but a carrier didn't make her to the bases that she had eternal life she still had to receive it right that's right all right now somebody tell you you don't have to receive eternal life you just tell them say well I'm sorry I don't believe you cut away that's right ain't no need to argue with because you ain't gonna do no good because they got quotes Let's see we had quotes from raising the Baptists because I could quote to you and prove to you that there was one God when I was in the Baptist Church because the Baptist Doctrine is one God but then the way we explained it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity coincarnal till then you can see we really didn't have it right we just had words you know words will kill you all right but you say but I came to the world with eternal life let's read some of those things if your Prophet had to say about it and I don't mind reading them when he said something you know I love to read it because I believe it'll all come together and do it now I've been trying to get these notes done for three sermons now so all right you know and uh so you just forgive it you that are visitors you you try to bear with us because you know if I do it in another sermon I'm going to be waiting four sermons to be able to say what I'm trying to say so I'm going to just go ahead and try to do it and then if you don't understand me you talk to me I have a service about it because I believe that you must have you must receive eternal life right that's right now we'll get to it in a minute so we'll we'll run around and said we always was eternal all right that's a direct quote Jesus told the people said you know the disciples said search the scriptures that's it right there instead of in them you think right you have eternal life right amen now that's what Jesus said yeah and I believe that's what brother Bradford was saying search the rest of the message you think you have eternal life you know what as far as God was concerned if we believe that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain according to revelation 13 8. if we believe that then in God's mind as far as God was concerned then anyone that would ever receive eternal life in his mind they had it then is that true Amen in his mind right but remember now his mind would be dealing with looking down through and coming back to his foreknowledge that's right and that's how he would predetermine and I've always told you see people say I if I just thought I don't want to be a thought in God's mind I'm just as honest as I can be I want to be a part of the one that done the thinking because that way of giving me eternal life if I'm a thought of in God's mind you can see me that I'd be dying going to hell so I don't want to be a thought in God's mind he said well that's just a carna we're putting it well it may be but that's the way I believe it I want to be a part of the very one that done the thinking then I don't have to worry about it right right I've got everything under control you know as long as if he's in command no but you see as far as God is concerned because I said every person that would ever receive eternal life before the world he could he would believe that they had eternal life now here's our point that we've been trying to get I gave you a few quotes back on it to show you you can go down through there and read them as you as I'm talking we talk about eternal life what is your thoughts of eternal life like I said we take it and we say and read Around used it and it's a good illustration that eternity's like a circle which means it has no beginning and no end well in mathematicians you would know what I'm saying take the circle and Tool it like this and what have you got you see my hands turn one's going one way one's going the other grab the sides of the of the thing and twist it you've got the Signet or sign of what they call the infinite which is really not a circle right like this it goes up and down and back around and up and down and back around that's the Signet of what you call Infinity all right but the point is good and wonderful about no beginning and no ending but I tried to get you to see a point and I keep making it over and over it's easy for us to look at eternity is going that way and I believe it and I believe after this world is over with I believe we're going to preached to you for 40 years about it that we're just getting enough understanding here by the new birth and all of our great mentality we have we're just getting enough ability to be able to comprehend when we Step Beyond the curtain's time do whatever you want to call your happy hunting ground or whatever you want to call it or Heaven we're just getting enough the prophet said we get a message of tear down to the endless ages now how can you take an eternal word which would mean that word never had a beginning and it can never have an ending how can you comprehend that with the human mind but it said we make it a circle but my point is we can go that way looking at eternity and talk about a great time of coming to a position in eternity and that's wonderful but now if we believe that eternity had no beginning and no ending we ought to be able to go just as far that away going to be able to look back through time until time becomes non-existent and we can step back into the great eternities just as far that away as we can go that way amen all right now the prophet would say in the beginning before the eternal Now where's the human mind can comprehend that right that's right we might as well forget it you can't comprehend what he's saying he's just simply explaining eternity right all right so now there's no beginning there's no ending all right that's why we don't believe in an eternal sonship see because the sun has a beginning that body that Jesus we call Jesus dwelling upon the Earth two thousand years ago that body had a beginning and that body had to be one day made Eternal right in the resurrection Ascension Etc all right you see it went from a time element to Eternal position all right and I don't understand why we can't see that our soul come into the world lost and doomed and on the way to hell born in sin shaping in an English past my mother's womb go forth a liar according to the psalmist David right and that's why I don't I don't understand if Jesus had to go through to that to be able to hit body be made eternal yeah I don't see why we can't comprehend that his body could receive eternal life why is it we can't understand that our moral part of us which is all of us Body Spirit and soul why we can't receive eternal life you know one day the body you're looking at here will be made Eternal we don't believe in getting a new body that's an old denominational Doctrine right Jesus raised with nail prints in his hand showing that that won't work now you don't need to arguing with nobody he just raised when they'll press in his hand right but yeah we've been taught by Mom and Daddy uncle and Sudi and and all down through time that we're gonna get us a new body you know what they're doing still doing the message now they're still preaching we're gonna get a new body we're going to walk out one of these days on our own ashes in the Millennium then we're going to walk around in some kind of a form or something and then we're going to walk back and at some way that's going to come come back or something I listened to him I couldn't understand it but that's their business we we're here right but do you see that eternal life has no beginning right and we don't believe in Eternal sonship see that's why I said the the denomination teaching uh you know God is three persons Blessed Trinity co-worko eternal now how could see that Doctrine they believe each one of the three and then they'll say oh no it's not three it's just one but yet they make three personalities and they make them co-equal and co-eternal yeah yeah well if if words is words co-equal means co-equal go equal means identical same substance so what kind of a theory have you got but see we believe in God being made manifest the Eternal God condescending from Glory down to where we are and in doing that he took upon himself human flesh he could dwell here as melchized he could dwell into the Old Testament at the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant all that was wonderful but one day he stepped in the flesh to show us what we had to do that he had eternal life because he was God he didn't become God as they're saying now on the River Jordan that's they're Doctrine did he become god well no you got a problem he he was God Almighty or you got a trinitarian concept you got to do this more than anything else but that's that's other people's business I try to preach the gospel I believe almighty God came down in human flesh to fulfill the Bible and then him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he said I come from God I go to God he said if you've seen me you've seen the father all right all of that to show who he was show us the father they said Jesus said have I been so long waiting you didn't see me if you see me you saved the father right but they couldn't comprehend that but if he had to come into the world and then had to receive eternal life into that body why can't we see that we come into the world lost and his purpose for dying was to save us to where he couldn't part eternal life to you and I yes but I just believe Brother David I just believe what the prophet said when you're going to believe I almost said all right if eternity never begins and Eternity can never end so then Eternal sonship goes out but now we do believe in eternal godship sir amen all right so you believe in the Eternal godship that means God can come down and live with us the great Eternal can live right here with us and we can handle him as the Bible says all right but you know one day the Bible says we'll be lacking because you know we we will because we'll be like him right in other words we're going to keep advancing forward we receive eternal life by the new birth that doesn't make our body and spirit eternal neither did the eternal life dwelling in him make his body eternal he had to live for those 33 years as a human being in the outward realm amen right but then one day that body stepped into eternal life right we just keep walking in the word and one day we'll step into eternal life that's Body Spirit and soul man all right so your denomination said we got to get a new body because they don't believe God can can redeem this and if he can make it I don't think he got no problem about redeeming it yeah but now Brother David he made me like it no he didn't make you like that he did not make you the way we You Were Me The Way We Are we volunteered for it when we become of age of accountability he paid the price we didn't have to do it we put ourselves in the pawn shop of life right we blame God for doing it or at least try to blame the devil for doing it ain't gonna blame you need one we've done it ourselves we put ourselves into the world of lost condition God was right there when we reached that age of accountability that's what accountability is accountability is the the ability to give an account is that what accountability is in other words you reach to a place that you're responsible we'll see if we hit right at that point had we realized we're responsible for what we're doing and we stopped right there and said God save me that's right but what would have happened right but we didn't do it did we know all right so think about what he's saying look down at number four you know it's because I don't want to read these notes as much if these have been before you before but look at the one down where it says E6 of have not I sent D 1962 uh 124. eternity never begins never ends see never had a beginning this is our brother back there I have a copy somebody to make sure he's got a copy of how do we believe right around him was a prophet and we believe that you know I don't know who you are and how you believe but we believe that God sent a prophet in the last days and I sure like to read about what he said we don't believe that Prophet to be God no don't believe nothing about it being God but God used the man to bring a message and if you're a Baptist then God used John Smith to bring you a message if you're a Methodist do you use your I mean yeah you use John Wesley to bring you a message if you're a Lutheran the youth Martin Luther to bring your message so whatever Church you're from you got somebody back there that was doing it and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ all right that's right do you say I'm not gonna follow no man who are you following you walk around and look and you'll find out you call me her a certain way you walk a certain ways because somebody ahead of you you liked it that way right my brother-in-law got his arm blowed off years ago right in here and he would you know he didn't have a hand to clap with so if you've done anything he doesn't know if you know and he hit his hand well you know his little grandson you know that little grandson he didn't clap like this thank you because that's what he's saying so just remember that all right now look what he said he turned it he never begins never ends see never had a beginning never had an ending you can't explain it but anything that had a beginning has an end now watch so you say What About Us brother Branham well as long as your natural human off the Earth here you had a beginning now everybody knows because if I'm standing up here today and I said well I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm gonna pull a hat I'm gonna I'm gonna pick a day in the year and I'm gonna pull a number out of that hat and I'm gonna give the one that says they were born on that day I'm gonna give them a hundred dollar bill well if I pulled your pulled out to your birthday you jump up and run up here wouldn't you do you understand what I'm saying you realize you you know your body wasn't eternal right right it's not now if he did but I'll tell you what I'd hate to stay here like this if this is heaven Forgive Me Lord you know yes because I'm a human see as long as you're a natural human of the earth you had a beginning but if you're born to heaven you're part of God and that Spirit never had a beginning because it's part of God it's Eternal that's the only way you can ever live forever is to have eternal life that's right and eternal life but anything that has begins has an end all right now if anything happened beginning if you can't go with your understanding of predestination or existences or whatever but if you can't go all the way back and tie that and be just as Eternal as God is then you've missed it now here's our concept that we've had and it's all right Jesus was God manifested in flesh called a son right right he called a son now that word that come out of God in the beginning the logos is called a son of God that's why the trinitariancy believe in it's a Eternal sonship when there's no such thing as Eternal censorship there's Eternal God but not eternal sonship all right now do you believe the new birth makes you a son of God okay now how do you believe that if he was the son of God and had no beginning he was only just called a son to eternal life doesn't make you a son of God it makes you eternal God now you're going too far brother Dale no we just think never went far enough yet we're not getting it you explain it to me the new birth May son Oh you mean you won't admit that that's what it is you will say it from your lips and make many Eternal son or daughter how could it make you an eternal son or daughter it can make you God manifest right in another form called son that's what he was he was God manifested in a form called a son amen we are his offspring yes sir we're his children right what do we believe so if you're born of heaven and that's what Jesus said to to Nicodemus when he said you must be born again you go back to the original translation you'll find that says You must be born from above in other words Jesus was saying to Nicodemus you've got to be born from where I come from if you're not going from where I come from you don't have a new birth that was what he was saying he said you got to be born from the same place I came from where did he come from heaven so he must have a Heavenly bird all right no you keep those and stay with it now let's just get over here and read a little bit look at number nine on your notes this is the one everybody likes to use okay and I believe exactly what he's saying future home page 34 1964 802. there's your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal thing it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day this you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved amen and Jesus came to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with that sounds really what really shadow of that couldn't we yeah boy we don't have to worry about nothing do we like I said while ago we just feel like the devil and don't worry about it we always was eternal but what did Jesus Christ have to die for yes did he die to bring you an I'll ask you a simple question I left questions you know what they make you think see if it's like what most people think that we always was eternal then Jesus must have come into the world and done all he done and died to just let us know we always was eternal well what didn't why did he not tell that to Nicodemus and then go right on back up to heaven and not have to pay the price you sure put him through a whole lot by your thinking that I just come in the world eternal life that's what my pastor preaches well I'd find me another Pastor because that's what the prophet of God said he said you stay with your pastor as long as he stays the truth said he gets off the truth lead the pastor to find you another pastor and stays with the truth I stopped trying to brush churches or doing nothing I tell them what the prophet had to say about it I don't want you here if God don't send you because you've been hinterest to me and I'd be a hinders to you hey that's what I told my son-in-law when he was dating my daughter I said I want you to lose because you you're just moving there I said I want you there because of the word uh that's just I'm sorry that's just the way I am but while you're looking at that one see that's in the message future home let's go over to number 17 on your notes get on over that's why I like to read all the prophets had to say like the prophet of God said one day he said I can show you one scripture said Judas went and hung yourself and give you another scripture that says you go do likewise now I told you two scriptures go hang yourself huh but that's not what the scripture says that's taking it out of text that's not saying what God Said you're making it say what you wanted to say look what he said here out of the same message that was page 34 that we just read now here on page 37 in the same message he says now you say well look at this priest wasn't he a son of God he proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what now you know he's talking about the priests they they made in Belgium did he say I believe the Bible was sure he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that's been back before him and it's the same thing today see I know that's strong but it's the truth that was the word as spoken exactly for what day and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not have representation of predestination she only had the predestination he see only the predestinated will only be the one that does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be a part of God all the time because he's the only one that's eternal now them little words right there there's a question there we got in the message of one time it looks like we just all Eternal everything's Eternal we come in the world eternal life we don't have to worry about nothing don't have to be saved don't have to do a thing no we're just eternal but then he asked the question or makes a statement that's really not a question if you have eternal life you were a part of God in the beginning now he's definitely not talking about her body is he that's right he's definitely not talking about our spirit and our soul of our natural human mortal or mortality immortal you're not talking about that but being a part of God as I said when Jesus spoke to the disciples one day he said it's I and you that's easy to understand isn't it he come down give his own life come live in us but read the rest of that sentence you and me I and you you and me it's easy to understand that we received a new birth he can we talk about as I said eternal life if you've got eternal life today the eternal life you have always was eternal not you man and it didn't make you eternal until you received it well that's that's making the beginning no it's not that ain't making it a beginning that's making exactly what it is if you have eternal life that eternal life that you have never had a beginning right you know you go along through life and a lot of people you know you more than the family and one day comes on somebody comes along to you and say hey you realize you wouldn't Dale and you realize they adopted you you said who am I so everybody start searching I haven't told you my concept on that of course my concept don't Mount the yellow beans but it is mine my concept is if I've been a Dale now for 70 years and somebody come along tell me that I'm not no Dale I was a McGillicuddy well I'm not going to go change my name to McGillicuddy now here's what's going to break your heart because you're to say I don't mean it but if I could find out I was a McGillicuddy and that made me heir to the throne of England I would never change my name to McGillicuddy because I'd be a hypocrite so you don't believe that away you think Money Changes thing now I've had the opportunity for money to change this man it ain't changed him yet I could be a multi-millionaire from what comes in this church but it don't go to my pocket that's just flat but you understand what I mean you mean my family would take me and they would raise me and feed me and then one day I found out that I wouldn't a Dale I want to know who my daddy is I know who my daddy is my daddy's once took care of me and fed me man that's just brother Dale's concept but that's I like it that way you see you say yeah you know you're giving the money and he changed well you go do what you want to see I'm a child of God and there ain't enough money in the world to talk me out of being a child of God giving the whole world the Bible said and I ain't gonna lose my soul and take it the devil offered to you so you didn't you're not as trapped if you're sitting in that you understand what I'm saying yes but I want to know who my daddy is why well I just never did feel like I was part of this family yeah cause you didn't like it cause you got a weapon your daddy raised you right you didn't like it that's blood takes one thing about it I never knew my doc my daddy in this world because I was four years old when he passed away but my mother but she could whip you good and you remembered all of them but you know when I got to be about 25 years old I thanked her all right you know why because she said something in me that's kept me all of my life she said Son you look get in jail I'll come and look through the bars at you I knew she would none of you she's getting out because it was still her ways I told you about it I seen her take them the wooden ring off of a I mean a metal ring off of a wooden barrel in there about that much real heavy metal take it and pull it off of a barrel and hit my brother with it you call that child abuse he was 18 years old he said I'm leaving home she said you're not leaving mad go in the house until you calm down then you can leave he said I'm leaving she said you're not and she pulled it up you know why he never left home you see that's child abuse take it what you want to but he stayed there you know what he realized this mama loved him absolutely you children don't want to be corrected and things I hope you have enough time to live up we sit at the house one day and the boys retired I said boys you remember when I used to tell you that it hurt me anymore with y'all than it did for you to get the whipping and I said yep I said now you've got kids of your own you know what I'm talking about don't you they said yep all they had to do some whipping all right we'll get off of that trying to make a point but listen then I gave you all of these as I've been wanting to read and you take them home and you read them I hope you have I reprinted them to where you could do it and we won't go through it we'll just give the tape you want us give it for the tape but look how many times what your Prophet had to say 32 things that are to be 1965 1205. if you got eternal life then it always was eternal if you got it if you've got eternal life that's the title of the sermon if you got it that's not a question that's a statement if you have it um Revelation chapter 5 part 2 61 6 18. and you can't have eternal life unless you're saved you've got eternal life do you cannot burn in hell for Eternal you'll be punished for your sins with your natural life but you cannot have eternal life in hell if you've got eternal life then you cannot burn forever because there's only one form of eternal life identification 1964 to 18 or 216. talking about all of the Zoe and he says if you've got eternal life and if that's God for you was in his thoughts on the eternal first we would see Jesus 1964 304. now if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and has no ending so if you have eternal life you are an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him sure as we would see Jesus 1964-18. if you got eternal life read all of these because they're underlined voice of the sign 64s 321 if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life we just read that one from future home God rich in Mercy 1965 with 0 19. 019. if you've got eternal life if we have eternal life then we always was because there's one form of eternal life we always were excuse me I'll use words and the reason we were because we are a part of God and he's the only one that's eternal except because they're repeats when their eyes were open 64 312 if you got eternal life you always was what read the rest of these I'm just doing it for the type situation people out there where they can do it proving his word eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life you were his attribute who is this male chedded at 65 221 the evening and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but to shape and form that the infinite God me all right thinking man's filter 65 8 22. but when you're born to the spirit of God then you've got you are a son of God and you always was the son of God and you always will be a Son of God there's no way to separate it because it's you have eternal life and the Eternal never had no beginning take them home and read them now that's just a handful that's nothing comparative running down your computer always was in our eternal life and just run run all day and look at it so not trying to preach to you the prophet is saying to you and I if we have eternal life the eternal life we have right now we hadn't got to this point but we will but he said the Bible says that his seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin yet the prophet says we sin every day you know what's he saying Paul was the one that we're talking about for the sins plural was he contrary to John that would say his seeds remaineth in this and we cannot sin then you've got a problem but if you're looking at it to see that that's mortal human beings are doing wrong every day yes because we're mortal human beings we have problems but that seed that that new birth which is a birth of that seed which is a birth of the word huh that always was eternal as I was saying even the other day then one day the foolish virgins right Matthew 25 where they got to five wise and five foolish one day those foolish virgins will be given eternal life you agree well you know what they're done lived their life out in this world they've done diet they've done went beyond the curtain of time into what situation they could exist in and maybe you've been there for thousands of years and they're not eternal they'll be taken up and brought before the Watcher on judgment and given eternal life you know what that day they can raise their hands and see I always was eternal run because the eternal life they have never had a beginning it never had an ending and God's thoughts about them was always eternal yeah so the day you get the new birth raise your hand and Shout Gloria Hallelujah I have eternal life always was what the eternal life so that's the only way we could be in Jesus Christ if we wasn't in Jesus Christ when he walked the shores of Galilee then where did we come from where did eternal life you have come from it was in him see then before the world ever begun God knew whether or not we would want eternal life he had it ready for us and his thoughts about us has always been eternal right what is eternal life remember my definition of what it goes just as far right away but if you can't go just as far that away you say yeah but now I can comprehend back so far and here's where you got your blockage at you need to try it you need a uh you need to get that huh blockage out of your hand you see yeah but if I go all the way back I'm going to wind up being God I'm glad you thought of that because that's what I'm appreaching right that's the only way to have eternal life is what to be a part of God amen amen that ain't talking about this body spirit and soul as you're looking at that's right that's right you're talking about eternal life that God gave me 1969. he gave me eternal life that made me a part of God right an offspring of God a child of God called a son then we're called the children of God we're called Sons and Daughters that's wonderful but just remember that a son of God is God in another form that's right thank you Lord or else you got a second person involved somewhere right right we're not a second person we're either God made manifest in human flesh upon the earth called the children of God are we a second person what do you think about eternal life throw the prophets right we always was eternal you wasn't saved on no certain day God before the world it's all you saved and wrote your name down in the Book of Life that's where we'll get back to it when we get time I'm gonna go and redeem this evening because we want to go on to that word next but we'll eventually get back to where we can go back there and see how the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for joy in eternity my brother Dale I was born with a seed in me where was it at and when was it prepared what do you mean when did they put that foot down when I was born I wouldn't want your Prophet said you know Gordon he said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world wow that's right that's a lot different than saying when it would come into the world he said it was put there before the foundation of the world what in God's mind as a part of God amen see the Plan of Redemption is simple if we get it in correct order that's human Mortals can receive eternal life that's only in your soul your body and spirit is not eternal I don't care how much you think it is how can it be that's what's keeping us from stepping into eternity right is the spirit in the body right those virtues have to come forth from the soul out through the spirit and bringing the spirit under control then the body will walk bear him right amen what is eternal life right and no beginning had no ending right see as far as I see God going that way and talking to me that's eternity but then I look back down through there and see that he said he had fellowship with us before the world that's what he told him to disciple that makes pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of the seed or eternal life I just don't believe in pre-existence of mankind like Mormon doctrines of Soul Etc I don't believe in it I mean I believe we come into the world law doomed and on our way to hell and deserving every bit of it God came down and paid a price come on come on pay the price and all I got to do is accept it part is not pardon until received is one but if I'll accept it then I can have eternal life but see that's what I said though we're afraid of foreknowledge because see that puts it on the basis of what we do and don't do it see then you'll come up in your mind when you ain't worth it salvation I don't know what we do or don't do it you tell me it's not on you tell me you don't have to receive eternal life and I'll tell you you're in the delusion to the devil I'll tell you about Jesus don't Nicodemus you know the law you know all about it they claim they knew him so well they could take a scroll hold it up stick a pin through there and tell you every letter it went through because it read them so many times but when that the greatest because Jesus called and said go back to your original and read it he said no our deep teacher D teacher meant he was the highest greatest ranking of all the teachers of Israel he said you must be born again Nicodemus and he said how can I do that he said I can't talk to you about these things ain't gonna leave me talking to you about anything else you see if we don't get born again they don't need to talk about anything anyway my brother now I'll have you to know I've been born again I'm tired of you bringing it up maybe that I'm not well you know what that proves you're not safe because your attitude toward what I said proves you're not saying if you get offended from me saying you need to be born again you're not born again is that simple enough I've offended people saying it that way run them off but I'm sorry that's the truth whether it be me you're an idiot right if I get mad at you because you tell me the truth there's something wrong with me we need to be born again in the morning again because nobody no man can call Jesus a Christ except what by the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's stand together what do we go through 539 is final book 539 anybody have a need always was yeah if you have Daddy eternal life you have always was eternal possession of looking down watching that Apostle Paul he not fall off that horse and down onto the ground yeah every from old new bird Knock You Down in fact it was made Chef Jesus Christ is his savior what you know in the Bible the message is ours how long have you been in it we must be born again and foreknowledge is still involved let's run around and said your gifts are predestinated eternally cloudful Ministries predestinated eternally just wanted to tell who was it Jeremiah one of them back I knew you before the world and ordained you into they didn't make Jeremiah before the world that made that guilt foreign concerned about him and we don't really enjoy watch my dad do to me salvation Ally pray and Believe on it father you know our sister you knew her before the world knew that the nature and ways you'd be and all we're doing here today is just standing here fulfilling what you saw before the world and we can just look back there and see Lord that you saved US dollar true but it's got to be transmitted down unto us come to a place that we can realize and hear upon this Earth and then it's not just a knowledge in our mind because that's all you would have done with Nicodemus you told him you already got knowledge he must be born or Jesus our sister said she needs it and you we ask you to just come to make her a candidate for you for you and just fill her with our holy spirit because we believe you thank you just commit everything to you now so you with our sister about what she has to do we can do it but we want to believe you you father is accepting what you've done believe and say thank you Lord you say one of that or else it can be Gloria Hallelujah reality you do it the reality that yourself thank you for the University now that you'd go with us as we just meet us and go eat a natural meal and come back your scene and with us to understand help us to see that we truly must receive eternal life but then once we receive that eternal life then that eternal life existence and goes just as far one way as it goes another it doesn't have a beginning it doesn't have an ending there was never a time that eternity could begin because it did it would it would have a time to end Lord and it can't do it eternity is eternity that's just all the words we can use we can make examples and thoughts but still is one thing for sure there's only one eternal and that's God's own life the only way we can have eternal life is to die out to ourselves and accept you as our savior and then we have eternal life and we wouldn't save them no certain day no we wouldn't we say before the world but it was transmitted down to a time that we accept to hear upon Earth we love you thank you and father and just have your way bless each one knowing they're finishing up with Brother Dean and their things are just blessed to be with him be with all the others that are not here today I wouldn't just let your manifestation be with each one of us we love you and we thank you and Jesus is your name you're dismissed if we're never again all this Earth my precious friends me a meaning ful there was a Rapture some sweetness dear my loved ones let me say sir he will come again and catch and catch right go and greet him and I'll see you see in the Rapture so ciety forever and I'll see I'll sing in the rapture\n"}, {"id": 23916, "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2013-01-04 - 11-1012 - Complete Plan of

for you on that Thanksgiving weekend to tell you how much we thank you you know for all of your comings and doings tonight and we'll have a a Sunday dinner on that uh Thanksgiving weekend we'll see what it is I don't know what the exact dates but uh should be pretty close to the last anyway cuz it's always the last Thursday so I don't remember the dates all right so just keep that in mind and we'll try to see if we can get something catered to tell you how much we appreciate it all right Job 38 our heavenly father we thank you for all things you said you give them to us freely but Lord no matter if you do just open up the he Windows of heaven and pour them out on us we still need to thank you we still need to tell you how much we love you you know we do but we still need to tell you cuz you tell us you guide us and keep us and I pray that you'd just be with us tonight and open up our understanding that we may see you Lord open our eyes and just help us to look to you the author and finisher of our faith lead us now to thine understanding as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts that we may walk in you and be led of Your Love keep us now remember all of the sick among us cuz you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you you we thank you we ask you to just bless each one now in Jesus name amen Job 38 then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge GT up now thy loins like a man behold I will demand of thee and answer thou me Forest thou when I love La the foundation of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding see the only thing that brother BR said that was wrong with job that he was a little exalted you know within his own self and a little bit to the point so that's what the Lord is doing he's just simply asking job said well just tell me now if you have all this understanding and things tell me where this is see then it it takes him down in a hurry don't it says where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth declare if thou Hast understanding who ha laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who had stretcheth the line upon it whereupon are the foundations there aist and or who laid the Cornerstone thereof that's when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy oh who who shut up sea shut up the sea with doors when it Break Forth as if it were if it had issued out of the wound all right and he goes on he tells about making the clouds of thickness I left that off of it in the darkness but the main thing we want to look at is where were you cuz he gives the the key to it if you'll notice in verse six right all right you don't have to put it back up wherefore whereupon are the foundation there of fashion who or who laid the Cornerstone y so we'll get back to that in a minute you may be see SE the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we spoke on this back a while back when we were talking in our journey and our discussions and all in the message bringing it talking about the things taking place in heaven and I said I'd get down to it and we would come back to this uh again so I I want to try to take it up tonight in a way that maybe will give us a little understanding of something but I want to tie back to uh this past weekend cuz I want you to think about it because what was we talking about do we have a negative confession or do we have a spiritual Revelation right you remember what I was bringing now that anything whatsoever one step down downward whatever you would call it one word backward whatever whatever you would want to bring I was trying to get a point to you that anything out of a positive confession it would be re leaning into negativism all right right so I I hope you caught that point of what I was trying to bring because see I want it to be positive amen I don't want it to be to where we say well uh this is what I think you know what do you believe uh what is your input upon this I don't have no input we've either got thus sayith the Lord from the prophet of God are we in bad trouble you know but see that was what I was trying to get to point to you about is we don't need a negative confession right and anything out of saying it positive you're leaning to negativism and you say well no it was partial realization but now I hope you you don't get the wrong Point see partial realization is perfect realization right right right partial realization Martin Lu with the J shall live by faith that was the perfect complete y uh statement for the time amen right all right cuz that was perfect y all right you follow me see that would have been called partial realization compared to what we see now but remember anything imp partial realization is not talking about something negative am all right so don't get that thought into your mind see of what I was trying to bring it that we need a positive confession right and get away from our negativism amen you know all right now and see then we covered about the book of life and our names being written in the Book of Life and we talked about an open book amen now an open book because that's what our thought was you see the books it says in Daniel and it says in in Revelation that the books were open all right now we know that that goes to the white Throne yes and we will be sitting on the throne with him not standing before him at the white Throne all right but see then the books were opened now you remember what I was trying to bring out we'll get to it in just a minute and TI all together with the night's message the Lord willing that has the book become a brand new book to you like I told you I've heard people that have read three pages out of the seal book just is a point you know and they say the Bible's become a brand new book cuz they heard the prophet say that now the only way the Bible can become a brand new book to you and me or anyone right is for the seals to be broke right amen that's when the seals broke to the prophet he said it become a brand new book right not in the 50s Not in the 60 early what when the seals broke to the prophet right all right now when the seals break to you and I then the Bible becomes a brand new book right amen not just because you read the seal book and and can quote that quote see that's what people will say oh boy I come into the message and and and you talk to them about 2 minutes they don't even know what in the world world is sealed is about no that's right but yet it's Bible's become a brand new book well let's don't get caught into that business because if we do we we won't even be in partial realization that's right come on we'll be in sin right amen because we'll be in negativism right so you see the two messages I was trying to put it together to where we can see it and and really if you know the truth about it then God came here on the message on the open book and he opened it up to me here while I was preaching right as to how to bring it and and he did tonight just before the the service here that I had the notes and he said no this way so we go the way he told us to go that's right all right but now you follow what I was trying to bring we must have a positive confession about our faith amen amen MH the Bible says examine your faith you know examine you see whether you're in the faith or not right amen why are you worried about your Revelation right most preachers won't tell you what they believe you know they pedal are around it you know yep they won't come out and just tell you what they believe right because they don't want nobody to be able to you know they they don't want you to hammer it down say wait a minute that ain't right right n right so they want to put leave it to well that's what I was talking about I've seen people do that you know you you come up to them and say something and they oh yeah they go then you say something that was what I was talking about when you know that one what just talking about right all right but now see the open book then is only this Bible was open to the prophet when the seals broke right yes that's right you fall in my thought right that was what I trying to get across this is the book this is the Bible it had to be written yep before it could be opened right yep all right now so then we're in the book when it opens up it's going to reveal not only the day and time we live on the earth that's what most of you preachers preach about what's happening out here in the world yeah is our day no it's going to reveal our day in this message right what the revelation of redemption right right all right now that's what we want to get on to in a few minutes see the revelation of redemption but now get me then we can move on see anything outside of a positive confession is negativism right cuz you're not talking about partial realization cuz did you get what I said I'm saying it over again you say well Martin Luther didn't have it yes he had positive Revelation for his day right sure amen he had perfect Revelation for his day he had all that could be revealed for his day that's right but now comparing that to where we are yes partial realization but remember it was perfect to him that's right right Paul is not here but when he said you be Chang the moment twinkle eye to him that was perfect right I looking there today I believe was sometime when brother R said those prophets when they saw it he said it was was real to them right when non saw chariots Johson in the street that was real right right oh yeah he just as well as he'd been sitting right here watching them run into each other on the highway cuz it was perfect re Revelation all right but now remember what we're trying to do we spent about seven or eight messages dwelling about heaven and how real it is and whether God is real whether Heaven would be a real place or not and then we drop down the Earth and I we covered these things of like names written in the Book of Life we covered that while we were talking about it because that's what the Bible says happened there that's right so we covered then on this of the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy we we covered that and just you know hitting it going along and and to see then that the word has opened that we can see what's in heaven but we got to have the matching pieces here that's right all right you say but but brother Dale B guy was only in God's mind but if that does not come to a reality upon earth right that's it then what trouble is you've got that's right right amen you mean you got something that's in the Bible that would not take place upon Earth show it to me see you'd have a problem all right so then what we want to do is to see that what was in God's mind yes but if it don't happen here if Jesus Christ hadn't come here 2,000 years ago and died upon the cross that would have made the the Revelation 3 138 about the name written before the foundation that would have made that scripture anold right made it void that's right would have made it wrong all right so we're here in the end time right we are the ones now this could not be understood down Through the Ages like we're talking about it that's right amen come on they couldn't follow it cuz they didn't know it they couldn't couldn't bring it to the right place to they right songs there a new written down in glory in it's mind well everybody seen that say what's wonderful the Prophet come along and says good words ain't no re ain't no good Revelation to it he said because it all had to be written before the world right now so remember what we're doing now see we've left Heaven we've come to Earth and we're watching on Earth the things that we saw as we were talking while we were in the Heavenly reals right all right so now follow that thought and you you'll get the point now of what we're trying to bring all right when the more sons of God you know morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy we've been through this we've read it let's read it again might change something in a minute when we get to the real thoughts so let's go ahead brothers and and just read a little bit number one on her notes this is taken from page one which would be paragraph one I guess too the serpent seed 58 928 the evening and what what he's saying dear God the Great and Mighty God who formed All Things by the power of His Spirit as brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who freely died for with Sinners the just for the the unjust to reconcile us back into His Marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God as we are caught in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world you say where's that at that's in Ephesians 1 that he chose us or Ephesians 13 that he chose us in him that's right before the foundation of the world that's right he told the disciples we'll get to it in a minute maybe this one here he told the disciples that he knew them and had fellowship with them before the foundation of the world right well now brother Dale do you believe that we would back there yeah but not like what people are talking about right right yep would back there as people no with little identities running around some kind of something we were only there in Jesus Christ that's right we've been through that and proved the point all right but listen as we are taught in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of world when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy went back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus and tonight we're only got it for tast of the great Glory Divine which shall be revealed at his coming it'll go on into that but think about it look at the next one and we read these before but a lot of people out there haven't read them so if they see it maybe they can read it right adoption part two or number two 196 518 paragraph 151 so beautifully displayed in the prodical son I was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger and let no wonder when the Morning Star sh together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the Plan of Salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world God put in your name on the book before the foundation order well that looks like we was back there eternal life was back there right right God and his great attributes they were back there amen that's exactly right that's what the Bible said look at the next one the rejected King 196 5:15 the morning service paragraph 5 57 and brother brand actually what he's doing the girl is is rubbing his back while he was at the hospital having to do some test and things and started talking to her about the you know and she did about the oldest denomination and watch what he says roll it on that you can read the whole thing but this and I said no ma'am CU she had said well my denomination that certain certain he said no man' that was only about 200 years ago that organization but this organization started when the Morning Star Shang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the coming of a savior right to redeem mankind all right now what took place there let's go ahead and read the next one let's get to reading out of way go ahead and read number four it up it's serpent SE paragraph 82 he I want to ask you who is this job 2738 which is 38 when he said where was you when I laid the foundation of the Earth Earth when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that was shouting for Joy look who are they they tell Jesus told them that I had Joy with you before the foundation of the world we are not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last days no one can pluck them from my from the father's hand he gave them to me how you're going to lose see you're scared you're afraid y that's what he saying you're scared you're afraid you'll run around here and that's one of the best evidences in the world that you haven't been nowhere yet that's right it's a pretty good point you run around you don't get settled why not just settle down and say well I I'm like this if this ain't that you remember let me keep this till that gets here all right but I believe this is that you right you know I believe the prophet believed that going down let's read the next couple while we at it and then we'll get back and just preach a while Israel and the church part one or number one paragraph 59 look what he says with we had a little time to go to job 7:38 which is 3 7:37 which is 3 387 and see where he said where was you when I laid the foundation of world before I laid the foundation of world declare to me see where they're fing at or where was you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy tell them to Jo buckle up yourself like a man I want to speak to you now Paul says he chose us in him amen the church before the foundation of the world yep all right so now brother R was putting where he chose us in him before the foundation of the world right in with the morning start saying together sons of God shouted for Joy let's go down and get the last one now which is spiritual Amnesia paragraph 88644 11 now to be a true Christian you have to be the son we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him right I'm identified with him notice and he is in me and I in him notice then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning stars came together the sons of God shouted for Joy now he just answered it right if you have eternal life right what was back there right so we get to reading out of the way what was back there what happened back there you see we spend all of our time and I do too but I like to think about it I like to think about what that was and we spent a lot of time preaching about in heaven and seeing the things and in the eternities and coming down and how that's eternal life is the only thing you're dealing with you remember that it's not a people or little identities running around up in heaven some kind of form we were chosen in Jesus Christ according to the scriptures and according to the prophet amen and he had fellowship with us before the foundation of the world according to the scriptures right but what kind of a fellowship was that and what was taking place we wasn't back there as people we've been through that sure you can say this is in God's mind that he saw it but now we went through that too in a message or two that God's mind is a way under greater than anything we could think of even as natural that's right right amen he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways all right well we found out that we wasn't people before the world they that's the prophet where were Spirits back then he said no we wasn't nothing we was only in God's mind but just remember now how we brought down predestination that predestination looks back to for knowledge right amen then what is it tall talking about and this is what struck me tonight so I'm going to try to bring it down in just in plain language we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what was before the world we spent a lot of time in predestination trying to comprehend what we were that's what good I have too all have I said we but you know as I said there a moment ago the Bible says that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb's L yeah but you know if that had never happened upon the Earth that would have made the scripture void with but you know one day on this Earth to exactly match what that was Jesus Christ died on the cross right see in the reality is here no amen the reality is here upon Earth if we can just see it then we'll see why that one day heaven will even come to Earth right right the future home's coming down right right it's not going to do away with heaven right you remember the story remember the message not going to do away with Heaven Heaven's going to come to earth right amen it's going to be engulfed by eternity we see we do we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what we were yeah that's right when really if the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Jordan we know the Bible says it did and we know that that was us and we read where the Prophet said that that was when we saw the Plan of Redemption well you know the Plan of Redemption would be on earth right are you listening That's right The Plan of Redemption wasn't in heaven Jesus Christ never physically died in heaven that's right he had to come to earth right to die amen salvation wasn't needed in heaven that's right oh yeah the angels that fa yeah yeah that's true that but don't work for them does it but it's not talking about them see we're going to find out one of these days that we are as this world the center of the whole universe not because we're the center of it because of geographical locations right but we're the center of the Earth because this is where God wants to dwell with his people amen right that's right that's what he designed this far that's right amen I think it's about time for us to start talking about what is happening on earth now and in doing that I only wrote one little thing across my page that changed the whole message that I was going to preach maybe someday I'll get back preach something but we established that somebody that's going to be redeemed upon Earth saw that Plan of Redemption before the world while in eternal life right okay and we didn't get to come to Earth as Eternal people because if it did there would be no need of a Plan of Redemption that's right are you listening that's right why would you need a Plan of Redemption if everybody's Eternal that's right so it's not that way for God you he was going to bring us to Earth while we were in Jesus Christ is the only place you can put us because that's the Bible see then in Jesus Christ was the full Plan of Redemption and thereby we could see it not as our eyes see but we would know that we could not be lost now think with me the reason we were shouting is because we knew we couldn't be lost right there's no way to lose eternal life you remember we went through a message on that Adam never fell from eternal life in his soul God's not an ending Giver the prophet said he fell from the position to where he would have become Eternal in body and the world would have been become Eternal right he fell from that position to death all right so then the only ones that would know about the Plan of Redemption would be those that were a part of God right before the world ever begun but for us to have stayed up in heaven would have never brought for Redemption and we wouldn't have never come forth because we'd have been in Jesus Christ right we wasn't little identities running around I went through that over and over with you that's right right don't never think about that we were little Mormon doctrine of souls up there in heaven you know running around little peoples running out with you no we was in Jesus Christ right cuz that's when he came to Earth he came to Earth with us in him Eve was in Adam Adam was in Eve remember all right so then really what was happening back there was us looking at what's happening now simple little Point what did they see where were you job when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy was he asking him how far back he was how far could his thinking go back into eternity or was he asking him where he is now CU remember one of the quotes we read we read one we read two quotes in the beginning we're talking about could that have been when the their names were written on the book the third one was when we come to Earth you remember that go back to number three brother Joe okay can you flick it back up brother number four excuse me no number three number three you got it you got it when they seen the coming of the Savior to redeem mankind when they seen the coming of a savior 2,000 years ago like I said we spend our time A lot of times trying to figure out through predestination and for knowledges and what were we and what and we've left off what we really are now you know that we're living our predestination right you know that we're proving whether or not we did have any part to do with this situation by what we do you realize that if there was anything about us whatsoever it would only be the eternal life that eternal life would have to not come here Eternal right or there wouldn't be no Plan of Redemption writing our names in the book when does he write our names in the book according to the Bible it was before the foundation of the world but when did he write it in this book that's right remember this is the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne that's right this is the book that's in heaven right and you know that there was no way to reveal it until the book was completed right right that's right CS didn't come off the book and the prophet in the 50s he tried to preach it yes but he preached the white hor RIT or was the Holy Ghost right so what truth he brought was truth yes but it was not perfect realization are you listening when the book is completed the prophet said then the lamb takes the book all right now the book was completed when John wrote the life's part come on the book was completed right when John wrote Because he wrote of the church ages he wrote of the tribulation he wrote of all he wrote everything down right 95 996 somewhere in there right but it was wasn't opened right that's right it was a closed book amen sure we saw certain things yes and things were preached because that was the faith of the fathers they had those things and brought us those things it was written down and we could follow it to a degree but we couldn't get into the Book of Revelation right because the Book of Revelation had the Bible sealed up some things we could read and see and believe we could believe in Jesus we we could believe in the New Birth we should have been able to believe in one God right yeah cuz the disciples preached it y but you see the book had to be completed when it once it was completed it had to wait almost 2,000 years before the lamb could take the book and break the seal y right then it would become an open book or in other words an Open Bible M this Bible's open now you want to know what it says read it right you want to know what it means get the prophet right right ask the prophet what does that scripture mean why because it's an open book right you see it wasn't open until the seals broke right and it's not open to you and I until the seals break to us that's right you see when I tried my best to get you to to listen and and follow after those things of the opening of the seals right and yet people are say we sure we understand the SE my horse rider Antichrist how do you know it's an antichrist Prophet said it yeah oh y ouch try thank God Amen but what's your Revelation that's it well I don't have one I told you about years ago a man I preached I had a revelation of something and a man that used to be my best friend that sit in my home and eat and we Fellowship weekly and preach for him all the time he preached here and he sent me word he didn't want I done do me no more cuz I got off the message cuz I said I had a revelation he said brother bram's the only one who got the Revelation he said that's my Revelation that brother Bram had the Revelation I said well you know it's kind of hard and he said the same thing I did he said he had a revelation I said I had one right come on he even think about what he said he said he had a revelation that brother Ram had the Revelation well that was a revelation to him all I said was and I had a revelation of the same thing brother randam said and belied it right you see what we can do we can get tied up in our own little things but get back to what I'm talking about if if it doesn't happen here what was seen back there that would make that false prophecy right right you understand that point Everybody follow me right if it don't happen on earth right then what was written in heaven would be false that would be some man's idea opinion wrote down but when it happens on Earth exactly like that happened right now down through time they dealt with a partiality right right the book was open to the degree of what the discip IPL had preached right that's what I try to get the point in there the Bible opened to the point of what the faith of the fathers had talked about and you could preach one God brother around did before the seals broke Paul did Peter did John all them preached one God water baptism no eternal hell and all that they all preached it that was before the opening of the seals right but you see the book was still just partially open that's right brother R said we could what do he call it uh guess at it or Ponder probe probe thank you he said we could prob at it but said we couldn't see it that's right why because the seals did not come off the book all right 1963 the seals broke to the prophet he came off the book right amen then he could see the book right he could see what happened in heaven you know why because he knew what was happening in heaven was right then happening on Earth that's right come on is it in the Bible that the lamb T the book right what is that about five Revelation five Y where the lamb took the book amen see when the lamb took the book that Prophet went right there and started from right there he started in chapter 4 but he went into chapter 5 right and he started talking about the lamb that had took the book man and that's what he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and and there goes a white horse rider he said thereby that's got to be the Antichrist right cuz he seen that fell that guy read your first seal he seen him riding off right the seal was broke to the prophet but have they been broke to you and I that's right when they're broke to you and I we'll quit trying to figure out what went on in heaven we start trying to realize to what I what is happening on Earth does it match heaven right right amen right I preached that five or six years ago matching pieces When In Heaven There Was An Angel flew across when that angel flew across there was a man on Earth named Martin Luther that called the revelation of the just shall live by faith that's exactly the angel in heaven it turned the world upside down like I told you many people tried to protest the Catholic church but it didn't work the moravians how you pronounce it right you doing good was the ones that Tau taught John Wesley the truth of sanctification but that was not that angel in heaven right but when Mark when John Wesley preached sanctification and got it in the way he's supposed to be bringing it and match that angel in heaven now listen when this end time Prophet came on Earth there was a seventh angel right amen right right spoke of in the Bible he had a lot to do with it and he brought the message right then you can see that seven Angel where was he at he would have to be a prophet to match what was in heaven right because in heaven it already been written some scriptures Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 right somebody had to mat at down here right right when it was matched down here it was because it was already there that's right right we read there where the Prophet said we dealt in the reals of the immortal by having eternal life you realize what I'm saying the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is that's right y yep and what she's doing here he said Satan will be powerless right what he said amen well I tell you what brother I just can't see poweress what are you looking for him to be that's right see there's are negative confessions when are we going to start confessing it I mean we're going to confess that God sent a prophet let's confess it in rap way let's confess that God sent a prophet to fulfill all these scriptures to speak of a bride come on right that's right but you don't hear that it's only speaking of him is what people preach yeah spoken words Original Seed he said this Prophet would be pointing to the skies at a word MN bride that's right when we match that they would seen there that's right you say well where do we match I mean you say actually what part of that word do we match the Plan of Redemption has been understood since Calvary right but that was where he laid the Cornerstone y you remember we read that's right who laid the Cornerstone the Cornerstone was laid on the day of Pentecost right Calvary in the day of Pentecost Jesus Christ but the headstones coming the end time amen see Church those people down through time could shout about their religion they had we were talking the other day in my wife was you know the people will say it you know we come to America for for freedom of religion that's not why we came here we came here for freedom from religion we didn't come here freedom of religion and we brought the same junk over here with us we come here as freedom from religion to get away from the Catholic church and all those things this nation was not established on the freedom of religion it established on the freedom from religion see that's what they're doing now is they're forcing all religions together right under a One World Government y to bring it right back to where we tried to get away from all that stuff but you see Church it wasn't time down to there to see it like we're supposed to see it you followed me the prophet read and preached as a matter of fact I think all of these quotes but one that I gave you one of them I think is 64 matter of fact I think all of them are below all the six I gave you are below 60 below the 63 of the opening of the seals come on on the day of Pentecost they saw the Plan of Redemption those people were rejoicing because they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right yep amen that matched in heaven as each Church age came forth and a bride of that age was sealed in by the Holy Spirit they were rejoicing right because they match what that was Amen brother R said when the seals broke to John said he saw his name you didn't see John wrote down CU under the that the prophet said it's not Samuel Dale is not there he said it be that name it was before the foundation of the world John saw his name before the foundation of the world why because he saw what was taking place on earth right John is taking up to see what's going on in heaven right right John takeen to heaven to see what's going on but he's rejoicing was because he saw his name and he was down here on Earth go he s over there of P right right and he wrote no wonder the prophet would say John heard the Thunders sure that's just opening to me he said John heard the Thunders well because he heard the complete Plan of Redemption right cuz listen church that's what I'm trying to get you to see what I want you to see is this part if a bride of Jesus Christ don't become the word to raise the rest from the dead then all that's behind us is false prophecy amen that's right amen come I don't mind stating it that way you say you get in trouble with God no I believe that's what he's wanting me to say it's all depended upon this end time bride to see the complete Plan of Redemption not a partial realization that's right amen right but to see the complete Plan of Redemption yep that's right and Shout about it Rejoice about it that's right come on because if you was up there in eternal life y then you're looking down here where you got it at CU you didn't come here with eternal life cuz if you did you didn't need no Plan of Redemption right that's right amen that's right you don't need to be redeemed if you have eternal life right oh we just need a new body you know that's what everybody preaches y That's Right would you see church we are the people that's got to see ourselves amen but the only way you can know you're there is to have eternal life here right amen that's right if you don't have eternal life here and don't know who you are then there's no way to know you back there right right what I say it we spend our time trying to figure out what we was back there instead of spending our time in in our own Holy Ghost understanding to see that Christ lives in you and I now amen that's right the Plan of Redemption is what they saw they saw the coming of this Redeemer a savior amen they saw Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago right right come on you'd have to agree with that but they saw all the way down through time of each age and the Bride of that age and she would realize who she is and come forth as a part of the word for that age but there's a word for this age amen because they didn't see a partial realization that's right and if you was back there if that eternal life you have toight not wasn't back there it never will be there cuz you don't have eternal life right that's right that simple brother de don't know whether I have eternal life or not well then start seeking God for that's right amen that's right it's like I told somebody the other day that they told me that they had the new birth they had eternal life I said yep in the day I got eternal life from that day till now I said I've never stopped seeking for eternal life right right that's right what do you mean you got it you don't have it if that's what you think that's right so that's what you think that you got eternal life but that don't make you more desirous right amen of eternal life that's right and you don't have eternal life that's right right right and then it's the only thing like I said it's the only thing that I've always wanted to give away cuz I know I can't I can't give it away that's right like I told my wife we were talking today and she made a good statement about it I won't go through what we were talking about I'll just make the statement of what we concluded finishing up she said honey you got to realize one of these days everybody don't want to hear you I said I've realized that a long time ago right but I said if the day ever comes I'm paraphrasing it where it won't get around in wrong thing yeah I said but if the day ever comes that I don't have a burden in my heart that's for people that's right that's and want people to see this message irregardless of whether they want to hear me or not y if the day ever comes that I don't want people to hear the word I'm lost y that's right I know I was lost but it doesn't matter if people turn me down if they don't want to hear me I still want you to hear about Jesus Christ right that's right I still want you to hear about eternal life amen I still want you to know the truth amen I've always said God one thing let me preach eternal life to my kids y because I want them to have eternal life don't you amen that's right then let's preach eternal life let's live eternal life the Bible says you're written Epistles right right known and read of all man right if nothing else we got one thing that that people have all in common about well you ain't nothing but word word word L that's what everybody says about it right you ain't nothing but word word word I just don't know nothing else to be I'm sorry I love everybody and I like I said I'd love to have everybody and I'll do the best I can I'll keep preaching as long as I can right to try to get people to see eternal life amen but listen folks let's quit trying to figure out if we up our dancing around let's start dancing down here you know what then you'll find out for certain you was up there because we'll match exactly what was there when we match what's there it'll all be over with as I said Martin Luther when he matched what was in heaven the just shall live by faith had to strike the Earth that's right and a man had to carry the message when Malachi 4 and Luke 17 Revelation 10:7 and all that when it come time that it was to be made known on Earth in the days of the son of man that Luke 1730 there had to be a man on Earth Amen to cure that message that's right he said I wonder if them other Messengers seen that you remember He said Each messenger would get maybe another name change he said I wonder if they saw that you see he didn't see it until the seals broke right right that's it the seals broke to him then he could Rejoice about eternal life you say yeah but the most horrible life that he lived was after those seals broke I agree with you because the devil fought him in every way that he could I Ain talking about a horrible life that he done wrong I'm talking about a horrible life that everybody turned against him until he wound up preaching to a handful of people in a trailer out there when his early Ministry he's preaching to 3 to 500,000 or something yep you see they just couldn't see that's right I've got the magazines where they say fast and pray for God to send a prophet right M he said they feel the pool but they don't see the day that's right come on if you're shouting before the world then you ain't going to stop now you going to shout now cuz they didn't see a partial realization that's what happened on Earth they saw right a complete Plan of Redemption amen now listen they saw it for Body Spirit soul and world and they was rejoicing yeah that's right the prophet even said he said the first time Angel was saying they was in heaven he said the first time on Earth was when Jesus Christ was born right right but they sang in heaven when they seen us rejoicing about what would take place us not as people and identities but as part of almighty God Amen right that's right and we are part of almighty God now by the new birth so negative has become positive partial is become perfect what were they seeing they was looking down here seeing us what was we seeing if we're part of that back there we was looking down here to see what we're doing right now right we would back there as people we back there in Jesus Christ that's right yep but those children are now upon the Earth amen right and if we don't believe that we are them who's going to be it come on brother I'm just going to believe I'm one of them don't you come on let's sing that one of them because I I just want believe it I'm one of them we was at a meeting one time and this big certain brother he got up there and we singing that song and he got up behind he said which one of them because you got this group and that group and that group I didn't like CU you see I want to be one of them amen that's right I want to be one of them that was rejoicing in my salvation before the world 181 if you want to say anything brother Dale the best way I can make it to you ever who that was looking down look down here to see and sees this end time when the complete Plan of Redemption is made known why can't we rejoice and be happy why be afraid why worry amen who's afraid of what that's right oh look what they going to do look about this that no they can't do anything unless God right allows them to do it and if it is it's for our benefit right amen that's right so let's rejoice and have a good time in okay go ahead brother there are people heart I'm so glad I are you I'm I want with rejoicing back you know what you Prophet said if we have eternal life we were shouting with the children of Israel when they crossed the Red Sea we rejoicing when David kill theive let me be if we WR ready qu be acquainted with what God's doing let me shout Rejoice about what God's doing here we to see the complete plan the only thing we like is to make manifest he well in his time he make it manifest he made Martin Luther manifest he made John W he made a just

is we've got to call him on the scene so and there's a lot of people traveling so I need to pray for ready Yes precious Heavenly Father we thank you once again for the the place you've brought us to give this little from the church here in a little and brought all the brothers and sisters and what I call my family the father God that you've shown me I see the beautiful faces here on these days that we get to meet with this the joy of my weak Lord and I asked your father to this morning just to forgive us of our sins and as we go today to talk about you and take in your word Lord I asked it don't let us say anything or do anything and ever harm or get in the way father of your will and I asked Lord all of those today that are out traveling brother Bob brother Aaron Brother Wade any of the Little briders hear this out to him and ask you Lord just touch them and bless them and be with them and bring them home safely bless their fellowship with others father God and I ask you especially touch brother Wade and bless him Lord and let him speak those things you placed on his heart to uh come across those lips you've made a clay to those people that you sent it to the brothers and sisters out there that will be blessed Lord and that's just bring him home safe and that's all the other ones if I missed any names Lord you know who they are and we ask that you bless the bride

spirit that we might know that you are our God and we are your people we ask these things in your precious Name Lord Jesus Christ hope I didn't leave anything out um first of all that white lights that's okay go ahead anything will do to help I want to turn one of all my children being huh yeah they've been Fellowship okay let everybody cheer uh I want to turn to First Congress if we might I want to speak a minute about uh one person called King David I think his uh First Chronicles 28 uh 18. is that by there am I ready oh yeah I thought that looked real strange First Chronicles 28 First Chronicles 28. aha now this looks a little bit better and this is gonna I'm gonna try to work this into what I want to speak about this morning we're gonna start out first Chronicles 28. and for the altar of incense gotta know that in this part this is David talking to people and Solomon and Lord he's he's set up 28 18. First Chronicles 28 18. is that by there about ready yeah okay anyway David has set up with uh and it's about David's time to move on over and pass this thing on to Solomon and to fulfill what God has told him and brought him here to do and he's telling all the things that he's going to do and build in the temple and all the the gold the silver everything is coming he's telling it and right here I'm reading this and for the offer of incent for fine gold by weight goal for the pattern of The Chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord all this David said Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern y'all understand what David is saying there he's saying the Lord has done this to him he wrote it brought it out said this is what I want you to do my point here you're gonna I'm gonna come on down I'm gonna read 20. and David said to Solomon's son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed well the Lord God even my God will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord and of course he goes on and tell that the priest and all the Levites and everybody else will be there with him to help him and all of that and of course really when I read this 28 29 my heart is set a fire because of here's a man that had everything in the world they had it all and he it was time for him to do what he was supposed to do and he he put it right back to where it come from he knew that God would always be there with him and and David my my title is going to be we must be different as an end time people and I hope that I get the points across that I want to bring because to do this scripture of Justice you'll have to see that he said he'd never leave us he'd never forsake us he's there he's our all in all this is something I've been speaking about and I'm talking to myself I'm looking at a mirror when I'm telling y'all this because I want you to understand I have shortcomings as a human being a bunch a whole truckload have people that work with me know me every day and see these things and Lord help me forgive me for some of the things but these are things that we do fall into and you have to stop and go oh yeah turn around go back and we gotta do this thing right because being a child of God if I'm gonna act like my father I better be like this word because this word is who he is and that's the way it is with all of us here now I wanna I wanna read some things and this may I don't know how it's going to all work out but nevertheless Lord work it out uh I want to start off by reading them a little thing and and just to show you that we got to be different than what we're looking at here but how close is the difference how close is it Brother Gary Atkins and I was out there talking this morning about something he gave me a great idea about taking the scriptures and going back and showing through all the young people how scripturally what brother Brown brought was great and I was going I was going to get him to really come on out but we ran out of time but Lord willing one day we'll do that and that's what I'm trying to shove this morning a little bit anyway I'm gonna read from the prophets Palmer worm locusts canker worm and caterpillar and I'm gonna read a little simple thing that we all know about everyone else here knows about this because we've been taught this he and this is on the page 33 uh paragraph 223 through 224 and he said right here he said the we don't know whether there be any Holy Ghost and he's talking about uh Paul being out there speaking to those people right off the bat about how they were baptizing and of course brother Branham being the prophet it is brings instant understanding to this thing in about two paragraphs that we can all follow he said then how was you baptized it says in King James undo what read it in the original it says how unto what means the same thing unto and how means the same thing how was you baptized they said we've been baptized by John and the same man baptized Jesus now they're saying this is John he baptized Jesus you're going to go tell him he's wrong there's Prophet is going to say that he's going to tell it like it really is because that's a good baptizing by John and the same of the same man watered the same one that baptized John when Paul said that won't work anymore yeah he kind of stood him up when he said that and I know we've all experienced this when we've been talking to people about baptism simple things water baptism but it's not simple it's really not because those people are hung on this and you know if you deal with it this is how close it is to them that won't work anymore that's what Paul said that ain't no good no more he's done come been crucified because John baptized unto repentance not remission of sins saying you should believe on him who come Jesus Christ and when they heard this they walked out into the water and was baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ Paul laid his hands on them and the Holy Ghost come on them they prophesied and spoke in tongues is that right Paul consecrated me and also or two uh had been baptized by the same man that baptized Jesus told them they had to be baptized over because they wasn't baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right I say the same thing it's the same Doctrine now what did Paul say in Galatians 1 8. now he done uh that how many knows that the the truth says amen congregation says amen Ed and he said if an angel from heaven let alone a preacher out of a church or a denominational if any angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel then this let him be a curse I'm going to stop right there because we know the rest of the story and what happened there now he gets on them even a pastor missionary anybody um but I want I want to show you that that is like I said a simple thing to us but I want to now go back and read the word different and what it means I took four four uh meanings of it from the English dictionary number one it says an adjective partly or completely unalike not identical or the same out of ordinary unusual and I love this one not alike in character or quality um right now I want to turn over to Matthew 24 24. y'all can turn it if you like y'all know what I'm going to read because I want to show you that there are two forces here working at all times and when I'm getting to one point foreign get there uh all right Matthew 24 24. everybody there well that shall arise false cries false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect I wrote this in last night after I was sitting there having a duel with my computer that was really beating me up a little bit uh and just the daily things of life that people run into with little energy levels floating around uh experience attached to sometime but I was sitting there reading that and I was trying to pull up some other things on this on the prophet's message and I wanted to say that uh here we are that I'm looking at this stuff and what pops up on my screen right off the bat it was like it was the only thing on the computer William Marion Brown false prophet of the age now when you're sitting there trying to pull up something to talk to this group here listen we've heard the word here we know the word I mean we've got to produce you and when they're sitting here and I'm sitting there looking at this and this pops up on the screen I have to stop reading something drew me right to it said read it well when I got through naturally the devil's trying to get me off course here I said well I'll put this on the back burner I know what he said because that's about everything this um I won't say anything about him except he's an unearned person that would say these things about the prophet really don't know anything about him and all he was trying to do was pump up his own flag look at me I'm proving this guy wrong well I got news for you it ain't gonna happen because every argument the man had he shot himself in the foot on every one of them by Miss quote me by his own quotes I doubt he ever read anything from what I read but to make a point it took me to another place and when I seen that that's why I want this Matthew 24 24 because we are different we've got to be different and this is some of the things that we're going to be faced with we're faced with them every day because you get people come in there and they'll come up to you and they'll start talking to you when you see them out there in Walmart and things like that I I used to kind of like oh boy you know something inside of me said no no no you can't do that go talk to them brother random had that problem one time with a prostitute I think come in a restaurant where he was at Lord took him behind the barn talked to him a little bit didn't he well that's the way this this thing if it's going to work it's got to be that level it's got to be that level of love and understanding for the for God's creation because we don't know how this thing's going I mean we know how our part's coming because the words telling us but we don't know who else is to come in I mean you entertain angels unaware we do every day okay I'm getting off my subject here uh let's see I wanted to read some things right here to show God how he's how he's coming in in form and thing and how he has done a little bit uh I'm gonna read to you just a few minutes and then I want to get down to a one last thing that that I'm going to bring that I hope that this made sense to all of you uh and Shalom is the message Sierra Vista Arizona on a Sunday 640112 uh I've read there's 252 and remember when the full Bible listen and closing when this full Bible has been thoroughly Vindicated and there will be an eternal Shalom Eternal peace see he come and said he was peace on Earth Good Will towards men but the world didn't receive it see see he was peace to everyone that come to him for peace see so I'll understand that I said whoever comes to you get what you ask for from him because he's our father he wants us to be happy right he didn't put us here to be miserable or not get along one another because she had a loved one he was pleased to everyone that come to him for PC peace on Earth Good Will to men he was at peace at that new year beginning new day of God for why he was a a Vindicated light on that day see but there's more word to be Vindicated or a Vindicated he's got to vindicate more words and when the last word is dove Vindicated is Vindicated rather than death is swallowed up in Victory and the dead in Christ shall rise the Millennium will set in and it will be great peace Shalom let's lay up for that day brother and sister well that one great Shalom remember the Bible is the foundation of all wisdom and holds all holes of the future to the church Shalom let us pray now unveiling of God in Jeffersonville 640614 IN morning service paragraph 77 now when it was said that week so oh I'm trying to figure it out my computer kind of printer kind of messed me up there a weird thing like this the English word I'm going to skip that one okay because I can't read it clearly and so I don't want a spark plug there but I will read the other section of it that is he changed himself he he was talking about right here that uh the English word are the emptied poured out of him or see something went out of him that was different from him he was different he wanted this to come out he wanted it to be displayed but the word kinos in the Greek does not mean that he bought it up or something his arm went off or his eye went out to another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself you get it he himself poured himself into the people Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God poured himself into human beings into the believer poured out it was a part of his drama to do so God all the fullness all that God had bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or first person but the person God bailed in human flesh unveiling God I'm going on down to 79 now first Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God Elohim Capital God in the Bible referred it back anybody it refers to in the original it said Elohim in the beginning Elohim C and Elohim without controversy great is the mystery of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and we handled him Elohim bailed in human flesh the great Jehovah that covered all of his face time and everywhere was made man we handled him Elohim in the beginning Elohim and Elohim was the flesh dwelt Among Us uh going on down what this is the way the parts of drama that's the way he's to act it out God's provided way Prophet preached a message on that his wife of rebuilding himself to us as some different person okay we are mortal and he knows that we only understand as morals we only know as morals we only know as our senses will let us know and the rest of it we have to believe by man we have to say there is a God whether we see him or not we believe it any anyhow whether there is or not we still believe it because God said so remember that God said something I didn't say so God said so that's what you want to remember now this is a identified Christ of all ages Topeka Kansas 640617 you see all these things just portrayed Christ he was part of it God doesn't change his nature doesn't change he his character doesn't change he's still the word see Malachi 3 6 proves that he just changes his form from each age each age he has allotted part of the word which has been prophesied what happened in certain days well at this age comes along God just moves into another form see it's got all the time the word the word may flesh and dwelt Among Us now I want to go to Hebrews 4 and 12. right quick uh I love this I really do everybody all right okay Hebrews 4 to 12. uh and right here it says he's identified Christ of all ages now Hebrews 4 we find out 4-12 I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna read four and 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in Maryland is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I'm not going to stop there I want to continue reading neither is any creature that is is not manifested in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto his eyes of him what do we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession hold on that word for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmity but was in all points temping like as we are yet without sin Amen Let Us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need um I just to bring out a few examples of that and I think what a wonderful thing to be able just to go to the throne of God and say father forgive me I know I've seen and we have to do that I do I don't know about y'all but I have to every day every morning before I started my day I said Lord let me put the armor on because I know what we're going to go dealing with uh in our business we deal with people who are unfortunate they really are but you should see some of the struggles those people go through if you don't think you'll blessed people and you're different come to our house watch these people walk in there with their children listen they're scratching just to stay alive I thank God for every one of them and that he'd lift them up and I thank God he sent them to us because if nothing else I can walk in and see what we represent the word and a lot I'm gonna talk to us about it and and I hope and I know that once this seed is put out to them that it comes back and I hope it does with each and every one of them because listen we got to stop and think about the things that are in our lives that that we have that we don't appreciate I'm guilty I am guilty about that I just gonna go over this I got a few minutes y'all to get tickled at me here because I wrote down a bunch of things the other morning by 4 30. this just come to my head and really who was the first on my list of being different talking about difference uh when I first come to this over here y'all know I was different but I was called something brought me here and it was the love I felt for my mother and my daddy I could see all the hard work my daddy done his whole life he was like a mule he pulled a cloud he busted rocks but he got her done none of his sons wound up going to prison or got into any major trouble by the grace of God and we all were workers every one of us none of us sat down and were lazy people because he taught us all those things I got the best out of him and I will say that for the last three years it was a pleasure to have him as my father to sit there and talk to this man about the seals him 84 years old and he'd wake up and he'd say tell me what you know well it didn't take me long but I would tell him the best I could and he'd say well that's fine now let me tell you what I think he went through the seals Lord help he went through them in just a few minutes for the frame corn and I said Lord and then he dropped right back off and went back to sleep and I'm sitting there so tired I can't hardly stand up myself but when he spoke of that I said wow here he is barely on his last breath and he's still pumping this out what a volume it's brother Mark said and uh it's a wonderful thing we have here I want everybody to see that regardless if the day comes to an end if they walk in here and say you're done we're taking you crazy people out of here I hope this is an empty building and everybody piles in if I was in line I hope I'm the first one but I want to talk about this just for a second here kind of bring a little light to it because we're fixing to go up and get fed some real steak but I wanted to say that the indifference the first person I've seen I run into here wanting to make a difference in my life and he has with brother Wayne now if there's two people in the world outside that would have had a respect for one another way but probably two different because I'm one side and he's the other he's full of energy bouncing around all the time just going going going going and that's not a bad thing that's a great thing because I'm a slow person sitting down not doing anything so I need a person like that kind of stirred me along you know buzz me up and get me going but what a difference but once I sing the heart and I know he must have seen something in me other than I'm gonna I'm Gonna Fill his heart with what I know in his mind I'm gonna get I'm gonna put something in that mind that can go down besides junket he's heard all his life and he has done that the Lord is blessed by the way and guess what I've been blessed by it okay we've all been so blessed by this word that's come here from Brother Dale and the ministry in this church it's real it's proof it's all I can say about it and I wanted to go on down it's just like think about King David standing out there he had to go up against Goliath what does he do he goes down there and pick him up five little stones little bitty guy and listen folks they have found evidence all needed today that there were giants that live upon the Earth eight Footers 10 Footers they have found evidence science says so it didn't make no difference to David and David was different but when it got right down to it was the price that made it and today we got to reproduce that word called Jesus Christ every one of us do it and it's not something we can't attain to all we got to do is believe in taking this word right and remember that we are blessed people we're most people on this Earth folks we are it's been a pleasure to speak this morning I hope that something has come to let's break your heart a little bit and happier and I want to tell y'all if y'all don't think I love doing this it's a pleasure to stand here in this church with you and speak to you about him I know I wouldn't dare to try to match scripture with none of y'all hold it but I thank God that he's blessed me and put me here just go that's all going to be quota blessed okay pay attention to the state\n"}, {"id":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ9ncCt5QK0\n========================================\n\nit's on it so we're gonna try to finish up today don't start something else and if this works well we may go back through some other like major doctrinal stuff that we went through we'll see but if you got your Bible let's turn to Isaiah 65 because we've left one we left one piece of the puzzle out all right last Sunday week Isaiah 65 thank you we left we left one element out because last Sunday we proved by the message and by the uh Bible that it took one week of of Messiah Ministry to get us an interact with one week of Messiah Ministry to get the Jews in a rapture and it's going to take a one week Ministry to the Earth to get the Earth redeemed right gotta have all three all right and remember we go ahead of the earth we go justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the earth goes through a justification went through a justification under Noah when he baptized the Earth with water in the flood and then when Jesus Christ came on the earth he Sanctified it with his blood while his blood was dropping on the Earth you and I our bodies were in the Earth right so we sanctify the people and then it's waiting a baptism by fire right because we look and see that that in the Scripture it says Holy Ghost and Fire see God gives you the holy ghost at the new birth but one day he's going to burn you completely so much to where that the part that Mom and Daddy brought here is going to be changed back into an original creation all right or what that theophany looks like which is you so that's this Earth but this Earth down here has got to go through it too it's already went through justification already went through sanctification and the prophet said our body goes first and then read the future home then the world natural comes behind all right because the Earth was in a fallen condition if you read there in Romans we talk about the whole creation growth and travaleth waiting on what you and I to manifest ourselves so that the Earth can manifest itself because we're the ones that fell and then everything behind us all creation fell behind us and it's going to take whatever like we were talking about here the fall the fall what redeems us back is the same thing that the Jews fell from From Grace With God divorced her took a gentile bride takes her in the Rapture and then he's going to take this 144 thousand twelve thousand tribes 12 000 from each tribe 12 12 144. ain't gonna take them in a rapture after this three and a half years are 1260 days of Daniel 70 weeks that's prophesied in Revelations 11. but according to the Bible we've only accomplished 483 years to the birth of Christ I mean from the death of Christ excuse me for an 83 years Jesus said how many times do you forgive her brother well that's he's talking about you and he's talking about this Earth because this Earth's got to be forgiven too because it fell and I believe somewhere else in Isaiah I've been looking for it but I couldn't find it maybe we'll find it in a minute where God said I made this Earth to be inhabited and until a prophet came we all thought we were going to heaven somewhere off live on a cloud live in heaven go up come to find out we're going to go up for a little while God's going to clean this thing off and we're going to come right back down all right and live here this is where Heaven's going to be right okay so we miss those things let's let me go back maybe I can find it because I have it done right here turn right to it Isaiah 45 now is this not the word of God and it will live Eternal right Isaiah 45 Isaiah 45. verse 18. that's 317. this is going to tell but Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation you shall be ashamed nor confounded shall not be ashamed nor confounded World Without End ah listen to this for thus saith the Lord that created the Heaven God himself that formed the Earth and made it he has established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited so brother Joe there's no doubt in my mind the Earth was made to be inhabited eternally right right I am the lord and there is none else okay that's enough right there all right now let's go back to Isaiah 65. all right for just a minute let's look at the chart so now we see that it was 483 years a 62 week period and a seven week period brother Brown said there's three periods a seven week at 62 and a seven or one week I mean I'm sorry a seven week a 62 week in one week three periods 62 plus 7 is 69 and one more make 70. all right Jesus said in Matthew we read it last Sunday how many times do you forgive her brother he said 70 times 7 which is what 490 483 years already been accomplished so there's one week left after the Rapture or seven years all right for the rest of this to culminate not to say that that the uh tribulation period is not seven years um Jesus didn't through two prophets doesn't preach for seven years there's only three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ left to be preached on the earth to take them in a Rapture but there's time left to come to this 490 and the Bible even says in Daniel blessed is those that live to be in the 1300 and something weak or 1300 something days that's 1260. blessed is the one that make it through all right now we'll see because remember during this time the foolish version is going to be hunted down and killed the battle of Armageddon is coming in here right in here and then there'll be a millennium Temple set up according to Ezekiel 42 44 somewhere after the Rapture of those Jews brother random said the two prophets to Israel were the Sixth Seal what is the six seal destruction they call down fire earthquakes Islands will be taken out of their place I believe the scripture even says that everything on top side of the earth will be shook even the heavens will be shook this time all right what God is doing is is he's showing that this thing's coming back to original right right where where man destroyed the world by flood or brother Brown said it could have been an atomic explosion I believe so where it shifted or Tilted the world over and it's going to bring that world right back and then we'll go back to what we'll go back to those prophetic days 30 days 30 days because we're going to read here God's not going to do away with the moon and the sun right and all those things he just said here that he created all this to be inhabited he created I believe that everything that God created originally was eternal yeah in the mind of God what Adam done is he forfeited the ability to bring it all to pass by doing what he did but doing what he did saved a lot more people all right foolish virgins and all the Jews and all those things like that now we see how it come into into big but we've got to get us into the millennium to build this Temple so let's read Isaiah 65 and let's start with verse 16. that he who blesseth himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hidden from mine eyes for behold I create now listen that creates you and many times people say I create new Heaven and you work that's where everybody got the idea that God was just going to blow this one up and just build a whole new one we read in Isaiah that he wasn't going to do that he was just going to burn it off then the prophet comes in invisible oh Not Invisible Union but in um the future home and tells us that it'll be burnt off all right renew it right you renew it right because you and I when we're born again God didn't just kill this human you're looking at and raise up a new one he took what was already created and made it on you all right burn it off burn all the sin out of all the drops and all that while I'm still alive right here all right because he said I'll take my spirit and put it in your heart see he gives you a new spirit of sanctification which many people claim that as the holy spirit because it changes their attitude instead of their whole being all right but when you're born again what does it do God comes down and burns out the sin in your soul still got this old guy that does the center outside right same way with the Earth he came on the Earth he's always been here but look at all the sin look at all the things that that's going on and let's read for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth you notice a key there I create new heavens and he didn't say a new Earths right there's only one Earth okay there's many Heavens there's all the nebulas and all that I believe their solar system but there's only one Earth one Earth behold I create new heavens and a new Earth all right and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad I'm enjoy us forever and that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem or endorsing and her people with joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and join my people and the voice of the Weeping shall be no more hurting her another voice of crying there should be no no more fence in infinite days nor old man that has not filled this day the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be a curse and they shall build houses and inhabit them now some of these things you can put into the future home some of them you cannot because we don't build houses in the future home Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you brother random said that's the difference between the Millennium and the future home your future home he's already built the house according to your desire right but this is that they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build in another and have it that means I built my you know Daddy builds a house and then when he passes away I get it and then when I pass away the son gets it that's not going to happen here because you're not going to die right they shall not build in an oven habit they shall not plant in another eat whereas the days of a tree of the days of my people in my election long enjoy the works of their hands all right they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offsprings with them there's the promise and it shall come to class that before they call I will answer them while they are yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat strong like the bullet and thus shall be the Serpent's meeting they shall not hurt nor destroy at all my Holy Mountain saith the Lord all right so there's a millennium coming the 70 weeks of Daniel when it Blends into the millennium it has brought the Earth to not a total restoration but remember you got justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you got the holy ghost coming with fire Holy Ghost and Fire right because you and I received the Holy Ghost but we're not changed we're changed on the inside but this guy's still dying all right the Earth was changed it's changed here in the millennium but according to everything else it's still dying because the devil's still alive the devil's still here they're still evil but not where we're going to be the evil will be suppressed but the Bible said let's go over now and let's see where the Holy Ghost that's the type here of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Millennium is right because they're still sin baptism of the Holy Ghost half of the Millennium because it going to this day but it's restored the Earth It's Beginning a process to bring everything back all right but let's read now where the fire comes in over in Revelation chapter 20. well let's just read now because what's going to happen that 490 God's going to forgive this Earth he's going to wipe it off by man's fire this is going to be a nuclear Holocaust and it's going to blow everything up everything's going to be remembering Malachi 4 says we would walk out on the ashes of the wicked all right so everything's going to be turned to Ash all right and then everything in a thousand years is going to do like the Garden of Eden is going to just grow right back up all right what great fertilizer that's right then then people and animals and it's what you're putting in your gas tank now from the flood and all those plates turned upside down matched all the vegetation in the people in the dinosaurs and the cars and the buildings and whatever was before the flood maxed all that down and that's why out in the Gulf of Mexico that's why that oil is coming up because they made a hole and all that stuff coming back out of the ground and it's dead people they say all plants and animals and well yeah and people were there too Jehovah Witnesses one time when they came to the house they were talking about heaven and the fact that we were going to walk out in the ashes of the wicked and I said you know the Lord showed me something this week I said where are all those Wicked people they're not up there somewhere they're right here on Earth because they think they're going right exactly yeah I think they're all going to come up yeah but we'll walk out and we'll be able to build and inhabit our own home this is not the future home coming down with the mountain pushing up and the gold streets of gold that's not the Millennium all right does everybody understand that we may go through that maybe and maybe clarify that since our mind's fresh on it we may go through that maybe in the next couple weeks so and clarify that but here in Revelations Watch What Happens here chapter 20. now saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him in the bottom of the spin and shut him up and set a seal upon him that should deceive the Nations no more excuse me until a thousand years should be before excuse me to fulfill and after that he must be loose a little season now here's his loosing think now John stops said I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them I saw Thrones and they which is going to be us sat upon them and Jacob was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that would be headed for the witness of Jesus for the word of God which are not worship the Beast and our damage neither received the mark on his head let's stop right there but no it's going to verse five just the same time excuse me but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so all the people is going to die here at Armageddon is going to have to stay dead for that thousand years then they're going to come up in a white Throne judgment all right now listen to verse 7. this brings into being this is the Fire part okay the Earth is already going through her change in the Millennium right the devil's being suppressed they're still demons but they're not in us or around us they're all suppressed brother Brown said that chain was not a log chain it was a chain of circumstances there's nobody gonna be able to uh hey if we all had wonderful thoughts today that would defeat a lot of the devil just right now if we just cast everything away and not do that you know not be healed against our brother or our sister right that would do a lot of that what's going to happen in in the Millennium is that we're going to be see we're going to be in our full estate right here Bonnie spirit and so we're going to be Eternal right I believe the same thing for the 144 000. now and the ones that come back in this resurrection that died in here but you got a lot of people that died in here that I don't know about that's something another subject to get into but they're all going to have to stay dead the only people is going to be alive in the millenniums as far as I know for a fact is you and I are the bride the 144 000 and Jesus Christ himself right that's all that I know you understand what I'm saying because there are brother Reynolds talks about heathen being raised up in the Millennium that we preach the gospel to now maybe we'll get a little further deep into that but it says right here it says the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished okay but see after that Thousand Years the devil's going to be loosed for a season now one is a season we're Eternal season could be another Thousand Years wow but I don't believe it will be I just believe it'll be a time and what they're going to do is it's right here verse 7. and when a thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four corners of the Earth that had to come from somewhere and he had to be able to work through them and not us it can't work through us right Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle in the number of whom is the Sands of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and can pass the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them and they killed him and said devour them okay so there's your Holy Ghost all right here's your justification sanctification when Jesus died at the cross your baptism of the Holy Ghost into the millennium because what we're talking about we're talking about Redemption three stages of redemption but brother Brandon remember there was four bugs that eat it down four bugs you got to bring or four Messengers got to bring back to their life messages justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost and the word which is your justification certification baptism the Holy Ghost and Fire what's going to clean us up the fire that proceeds out of the mouth of God and the scripture is not a sword he said a flaming sword it's not a literal sword it's what the word of God right right so the word of God is a consuming fire and watch what's going to happen with this Gog and Magog we're going to come to the end of the Millennium white Throne judgment whatever you want you know we'll put all that in perspective but what's going to happen is is that fire is going to consume our devour those evil spirits and then what happens excuse me verse 21. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth now come from heavens to heaven all the dimensions are coming together because you can say to people in the sixth Dimension are in a half yeah right so there's Dimensions right all right chapter 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will pass away and there were no more Seas right and I saw John the holy sit and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven so what's going to happen after the Thousand Years this is what I believe God's Gonna burn this thing off again with a holy fire kill all the devils right well the Devils didn't get killed right here at the battle of Armageddon that just pushed him down under in another dimension so that they can't bother us then they're going to be able to raise back up but what's going to happen in this fire that's coming this is God's fire fire came down from God right out of heaven and devoured them so we're not going to see these no more and the devil that deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire Brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are in other words they're going to get theirs first all right and Shelby told me today and not forever and ever and then he sees a white Throne judgment coming out with books then here you got John saw the holy city and you Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven preparing as a bride and the Lord for a husband what John stall was the city with us coming down and settling on a mountain brother Brown proves what that mountain was remember it pushes up it's 1500 Miles Square at an angle a pyramid angle pyramid mountain and we're going to live on that because there's no way the Bible says you can see him day and night you can see the light of the Lamb which is I mean from here to it's 900 miles from here to Bartlesville I know that because we've been there before but you take another 600 miles past that and it's an incline from here to there well if you can see forever you can see that far that's not a problem right but it's almost a whole almost compassion to hold the United States as far as a square so it's going to be where we can see the lamb is the light because it tells you here in down in the verse verse 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it but the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb was lighting up somewhere in there to save time it tells you that it'll always be seen that way even if you had a wall the walls are going to be like 200 feet high Ivory and all these stones and Jasper and Jasmine and Burl and Onyx and all that he said man that's you can't see nothing but if it's in an incline you can stand outside the city and look up and you can see the top of the mountain always anywhere you go right and it's going to be in Jerusalem well see now now what's going to happen let's go back to verse three and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men now why didn't he say that at the millennium it is in the bride but they still other people that's got to come in and be giving eternal life and to watch their own judgment so Redemption is not complete until the Battle of God and Magog all those demons are killed now and you're either going to be a sheep or a goat right everybody understand that we'll go let's go we'll do that maybe next next week or so we'll go over the uh the difference in the Millennium and a future home and take it maybe step by step but in the millennium and I don't and I don't understand where it says an old man will live 900 and Center will die 100 years old and a young child will not die and all those things maybe we'll get in and see what the prophet said about it all right I just know one thing for sure during the Millennium there's still going to be a devil somewhere right but when we get in that future home they won't be no demons right right there won't be nothing but pure holy good because he said I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them excuse me be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death nor sorrow no crying you know he didn't pronounce it being no more deaf talking about the millennium because somebody's gonna die at the end of that Millennium all those demons are at least they're gonna die right they're real people as we're real as we are and God's got to kill them that's why he's got to kill this thing with fire to take it to Rapture because if you don't get this kill with fire you got to go by the grave and that's your fiery grave that you got to come back up through the Earth to get your body same body but to get your theophany back into your body that you're living in all right now do away with it he didn't do away with the Earth remember he cleaned it and he still hadn't done away with him with a future homecoming down but he burnt that thing off with Holy Fire where there is no there's no mention of the devil anymore all right after this and he that sat upon the throne I'm sorry there should be no more death nor sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am out when Amiga the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the verse of The Fountains of Water of Life freelance he that overcometh shall inherit all things and come down to the church ages seven times it tells about that it tells those who have overcome I'll give this and give this well see this is number eight that puts you into eternity Aid is always eternity seven is still Millennium you're still in seven sevens is 49 7s seven means completion but not eternity right right but when you get into that Eighth Day you're complete the 50. that's what brother Brown saw when he preached a future home he said oh brother Brown you run out of your types you got sevens you got sevens you got seven took them back to Leviticus and showed them where there was an eighth day a holy convocation and that's what we're talking about right now the holy this is the holy convocation that all creatures are looking for because everything's restored back foolish virgins giving eternal life a cup of water my name's been given eternal life Old Testament Saints or eternal we're we're Eternal before that 144 000 but everything else catches up through the Millennium just like you were the Holy Ghost she was born again with the Holy Ghost maybe 15 years ago did you understand the message no not all of them what you grew just like this in this Millennial we're going to grow in great we're not yes the Earth is because the Earth is we're already out here and the Earth is moving toward that time okay all right so it's moving but all's been forgiven when we start into that Millennium as far as because remember the 70 weeks was to Daniel and his people and the City okay so New Jerusalem is going to be the temple is going to be rebuilt but this is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven has nothing to do with this but we got to go through this to get there all right so does the Earth right the Earth just follows the Earth is catching up it is done I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give them to him that it thirsts The Fountains of water blind freely either it overcome it shall inherit all things and I will be his gun and he shall be my son fearful and unbelieving and abominable murders more mongers remember look what they happened to them the second death and watch your own judgment that fiery death they're going to be done away with right now anybody have any questions our comments I think first you already have one you got another one I always thought that when the devil was loose first season that that was the Judgment am I wrong about that because what's going to happen is it's gonna happen something we're in their clothes when the devil's loose brother Brown if you'll read in the future home he says he brings his army up against us that are hearing a millennium all right and then we'll get into it and read it because I knew there'd be some questions about it so we'll go into it maybe next Sunday but what's going to happen is he's going to raise up with a group and try to overthrow us because the devil still thinks he can he can handle us you know he just he still thinks he can he can do it you say well how can he do that and let's be Eternal he's still fighting God and he knows God's Eternal right he knows God created it uh he ought to be the one that knows it because that's the one that created it he just forgot but then you raise up after the Millennium and then brother random said all the saints will be brought off the Earth in other words put in another dimension and God's just going to wipe it off now what does it matter if the if the white Throne judgment's right in there somewhere that's fine that's okay where he burns it off and then then they're they're there no more but there's got to be a white Throne judgment whether it's done at dog and Magog I don't know where it says she raised our hands you gotta raise your hand I'll have my hand back okay I can't see that okay I was wondering about the not having no need of Sun or the moon that's not going to get rid of it no it says we won't need he said the city won't need it right outside I believe it's going to be daylight and dark right they like dark moon stars God's not going to do away with anything he created he's just gonna bring it right back to the original I was thinking in the city there will be no need of light because that whole hey it's going to be transparent gold and if we're glowing man gold glows when it you know when the when the light hits it so we're not gonna have to worry about that because it says you won't need it didn't say it be done away with he said you won't need it in the city we just don't know outside that City they couldn't I just don't think everything's going to be plastic like little flowers and it's never going to grow it's just going to stand in one place I just don't believe that I just don't believe that God's so um put these where we had seeds and we got garden and we got things like that he put Adam in an eternal condition he put Adam in the Garden of Eden to do what heals us all right I mean Adam wasn't Eternal yet but God was getting ready to put him in that condition the Earth was perfect in that Garden of Eden and he said there's no man here to tell the song right so he put Adam in human flesh so he could and I mean it wasn't by the sweat of his brow yet right I don't believe Adam sweat because now God said in Genesis he said now you'll work the rest of your life about a sweat of your brow to raise up your children and and you know take life and all that yeah God created everything a lot of people sure didn't I believe they'll plant trees and grow and not inside the city the Bible says there'll be a tree of life and that uh Kings will come into the city right and take a leaf for the healing of the nations take it back out now if that tree didn't grow eventually during eternity somewhere they're gonna pick that tree down to nothing it's well matters of fruit seed you're going to have we're gonna be able to eat we just won't have to explain that League it doesn't matter to me it's all for the it's for the Nations for the Kings right ain't got nothing to do with the bride ain't got nothing to do with us all right it's just there for God to um I guess as an example because what did Rome used to do Rome used to do that when they go out and Conquer they'd send gifts or they'd send uh leave you saw those things that go around the the hands of the of the uh Caesars and all those you know they had the little I can't remember what the name of those leaves are but that was because they had conquered somewhere and they was given that lead for our flower or whatever so that'll just be to show that that there won't be any more war there won't be anything going on because the people on the outside I don't know that they're going to live different than you and I but I don't see how God can make us Sons and Daughters of God give us all the promises in this Bible and then give that guy that changed your tire one day that never even thought God was nothing and God said hey I'm giving you eternal life right his somewhere in his knowledge of thinking he's going to have to be lower than you not saying lower as far as being a like illiterate like we are but it surely it would be illiterate because illiterate's not bad litterness just means you don't know they don't know anything about God and here you've got a group of people us can walk outside that City see they can come in the city but they can't stay we'll get into all that but they have to go back out but we can go out and sit down under a tree one day and just teach them about God teach them about all this you know oh that's just going now so we need to go then next Sunday and all of you that are dating I mean that's going to the uh um camping trip\n"}, {"id": 23919, "text": "################################################################################\nSTART

looking at God living in the earth so you can see him good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like turn in scriptures we have three readings turn with us we be going from 1 Peter 3 Revelation 6 in 1 Timothy 6 now remember the Lord willing the Bible study will be coming this coming Saturday I've had it messed up all this whole week I've been trying my best to get to Bible study even yesterday I said we got to get ready to go you and it's just I've been off a whole week somewhere I don't know where I gained one or lost one I haven't figured it out you but anyhow so just uh remember that Bible study we're on just what you call general questions and so come and be with us and have a good time in the Lord now remember that brother Fred Hooper he's a wonderful brother used to be with us for many many years here and he passed away this past week and they will be having viewing tomorrow night there in it's somewhere around kenstone but you you'll find words that and uh then the funeral will be on Tuesday at 11: they've asked me to speak a little bit because you know being such great friends with him over the years and he was a wonderful brother good little brother and I wait and I got to go down and be with him about a month month ago and pray for him and and all passed on so just remember the family pray for them that the Lord would would be with each one you've got the scriptures up there but we'll read them off and everything so uh you let's see I reckon that all announcements I'm supposed to make uh the Lord willing uh my wife and I will be gone the weekend of the 10th up to brother Richards for the weekend to ministering to him and I think Wade and Jun will be gone then the next weekend which is the fellowship meet weekend but uh you know we'll see how it works all right so uh First Timothy I be 1 Peter 3 Revelation 6 1 Timothy 6 Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for this day that we live thank you for Calvary thank you for everything we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence as we try to talk about you that you would come on the scene and speak through our hearts and our Liv lives that Lord you would reveal yourself unto us and Lord the main thing that we're trying to do right now is to find out reality of all things that we see that all things are becoming more real unto us and as they become more real unto us it means it's drawing us to a place to where that we can step over into the reality of what we need to have just guide us forgive our sins lead us bless the Hooper family there in the loss of bread and Lord just have your way with each one use us to speak what you'd have to be said in Jesus name amen amen okay first first Peter I could turn and read it off of that but I'd rather use my scriptures amen you 1 Peter 3 18-2 for Christ also who hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit that's right by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison number two go over to Revelations 6:9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long how long holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right now go back to First Timothy 6 talking about the period of the Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of Lord who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see y to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've got a lot of lot of the same yeah these two are the same no problem you will see the drawings are different and we will be using them toh go through it but what I want you to see today is we're going to talk about I'm trying my best to get you and me me especially thank you brother to see the real reality of things instead of just you know looking around and seeing what we see here and and all like that and thinking that uh these things are real well they are but just remember like the the earthquake the other day you know that they fell all across the whole uh I guess you call it the Eastern side of the United States right you know you can think well now if you'd have been standing down on Stone Mountain you know you know that rock would have been moving because it's so uh you know so much and they claimed it actually right around the cores and the thought the parts of an earthquake that is just like jelly and you know the the sand that everything just becomes Sandy just this there nothing holding but see we think this is real we think we beat on a a something made from wood and we think it's real and we think that uh the great things that have been made the great skyscrapers and things that have been made out of you know huge metal but we see that two planes fly in and there burns down a building and things cuz there's nothing here that's permanent it's just a temporary thing but yet all of the the Realms of God are more real than the realm that we live in right that's what I'm want you to see I'm wanting you to to try to to understand a little more about uh re ity you know as I've always tried to talk to you about you know saying that uh we say God is Elohim self-existing well I guess one day there was just nothing whatsoever and just a you know there and just and he was just floating around like a glob and and just you know some kind of a something that we can't fathom with our own understanding well I don't see why we can't not you know I don't see why we can't understand now when the prophet of God has brought us the message to show us the scriptures that were already there in the scriptures and and you know the things and just doing that but I'm I'm warning it on your mind about how real everything is and that's what I want you to do today with me stick with me as we try to go up through the dimensions and remember that each Dimension you travel into is greater than the dimension that you're living in right see if if you don't get nothing else out of the message today that's what I want you to see that see as we move in and talk about the fourth dimension well you've heard the prophet say it but see we we just it just blows our mind and we don't even try to think about it we say I don't want to get in them deep things I'll get all messed up don't worry about getting in the Deep things getting messed up you already messed up that's right we born messed up it's just plain language that's you know no need of playing with anything just be straight and honest about it and you know and we we look into things and we talk about uh seeing God and I've asked you many times the question is your God real or is it just some thought is it just some concept or some idea that you have something in your mind that you've you've made up and and and well brother Dale I just can't see he's real I've even been accused of making him too real now if if that's all I got to face god with when this thing is over with then I'll be glad to go to hell for 10 billion years on that one thing to try to get people to see that God is real CU what are you going to think about him is he you know you mean he brought you and I into being but he's not greater than we are right see then that way you make the creation which is US greater than the Creator see and and don't do that get it all into to something that you can look at now we're going to talk about the dimensions we've been through this many times in the years past and and the brothers here has covered it real good and but I read you three different three scriptures covering uh three different dimensions all right and the one is Jesus going to hell to to the spirits in prison all right the next is is to going up to see the souls under the altar which is the fifth seal Jew and and all of that and then we went into Timothy to show that there is a position or place that Jesus is in that no man have approached unto that position yet all right and and doing that then that's three different dimensional things okay and and I there's a quote on the back of your your notes on one of them and I don't know where Richard can grab that one I just gave them to them while ago but it's on the back of one of your notes it was an addition so I thank God for brother Joe and brother Richard we we've been working three days on trying to get some things together to be able to do it but there's a message on the the breach which would come on down to the LIC and if he doesn't have to put it on there but if he does yeah all right he talking about see and here is here he is as a mediator on the altar just a little longer until there's more has to suffer like you but now he comes from here at this life seal he's no more mediator he's King now and what does he do and if he's King he has to have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of Redemption then he walks forth see so then there is a place there that that we've talked about that no man can approach to immortality because immortality is signifying eternal life in a mortal being right it is not talking about just spiritual matters it's not talking about theophanies or or anything it's talking about uh an immortality of a of a doing and and that's where we want to cover it to try to see but the word dimension it says Webster says it's a magnitude measured in a particular direction or along a diameter or principal axis another words it's a measurement of width length height right see it simply means a measuring of a particular thing or the scope of it that's really what a dimension is talking about Cor in other words it's a it's not to say call it a cubicle but that's the best way of thinking because it's length width height breadth Etc you know and and we deal with those things so that is a dimension but what I want you to see is when we get through that these Dimensions so overlay each other until they're right here right because you remember the Lord Jes Jesus standing there one day and he said the son of man which is in heaven right well you know he evidently knew what he was talking about but he had the ability to be able to be in both places right right and understand and and I think that it will help us as we go along because what I'm get it again now as we go up through the mentions remember the next Dimension above what we're talking about is greater than than this Dimension you said no no it's not cuz we're here where we're we we going do no but it's greater because it has the controlling effect upon this Dimension the fourth dimmension is controlling factor of this Dimension right all right and see then you move up to the fith to the center dead we see then that would you know the the the people and then when you would go from dark to the sixth Dimension be the Christian dead well wouldn't you want make sure that they're more greater than we are right I mean what would be the reason why we wouldn't want to to come to a reality cuz remember you can think what you want to I have the drawing already made Joe's worked on it that you're going to see something one of these days that that the Lord willing from just a drawing that you're going to see how everything can come right back down here and and and and all but now I want you to get this point this is the key to to understand what I'm saying a a dimension it is a geographical a place whatever you know that you want to talk about whatever you want to make it you make it what you want to make your your point of seeing what a dimension is but a dimension always will have a limitation it's limited to that Dimension we can't go to the next one right right it's something that we can't do now God could take a profit sure and go through right but Dimensions is the things that you cannot you they can never be done away with no Dimension will ever be done away with now I'm saying this ahead of time so that you'll you'll listen to the message as that go along but see a dimension will always signify a holding area a position a place or a time whatever you want to call it that's why there's only seven dimensions right all right I'm going putting it in here to start with where that anybody hears it then I come back and say things then they can't come along and say well I didn't under now see we'll get to it this evening the Bible speaks of the heavens of the heavens I believe Heaven is more real than we consider it to be and listen Heaven that I'm talking about not the atmospheres cuz they can be called out we will cover these things the you look at your drawing you see on the side that that it says Heaven because heaven can signify atmospheric up from ground up to so far and then you got stratop feres and all kind of spheres that goes out to where that it gets to where you can't breathe and and all kind of things and the layers going up but then you got heaven and Heavenly and then you got the heaven heaven of Heavens all right Heaven that I'm talking about now not to the dimensional situation down here not as we travel Heaven never had a beginning right sure it will never have an ending right Heaven is eternal it is not a dimension right you cannot make Heaven that I'm speaking of a dimension that's right amen because when you try to say it's a dimension you're squaring it off all right everybody understand you might not understand what I'm talking about but do you understand my word yes all right then we will get back to that in maybe 10 messages down the road I'm not worried about it because I want you to see what we're talking about but as I said we read here in the scripture of three different dimensions three different positions right see hell is you know Jesus going sold under the altar under the Sixth Seal and then on up into the seventh Dimension where that Jesus is and uh so watch these as we go along and and then it will help to to understand what I'm trying to say about it being real so remember a dimension is like a thing that can be here and it's around us but we can't see it right something has to happen to our natural eyes to be able to do I I can't stand here and watch people go through this building right right but but if we had a television and set it right there it would show you that that's what's taking place right all right now you remember as a dimension to try to show you to help you you remember that when Lazarus died he went to what would be called the bosom of Abraham which is a place provided by the faith of Abraham not a big old belly that he's got and he wanted somebody to go back and help his brothers right in things but the Bible says there's a great Guth fixed even though that you could stand the one describing could stand and describe what they were seeing they could not cross that Chasm so keep that in mind now we're put scriptures in to where that you don't run off and say well that's just your idea or opinion see it is what the Bible is saying all right so then study that with me now as dimensions and remember in Bible terminologies it means a place or position that is different from the other positions or you would not have seven dimensions all right now see we don't have to take just the words of science but science can prove some of the dimensions I remember reading many many years ago and and I don't understand all of this about the radio waves and the things and all but I remember many many years ago that they said that that they believe they would come a day that they would be able to tap into hell and listen to the people well how close is it getting that's right when that what is her name that got killed over there the lady in the and you know the big princess or something Diana when you know now I know it was on the phone but don't get it don't get it all messed up you know they went back and pulled all of that and they could hear her voice they could still hear her voice see those dimensions are there we just don't know how to tap in and science has been able to tap in to a certain degree and can show these things all right so where do we live at now I'm trying to get a point to watch just some scriptures coming down to where that you'll see the and see it's it's backed up like I said John 3:13 where the son of man which is in heaven nourished it on Earth see it was possible for him being who he was to be in both dimensions at the same time right but now by way of the Prophet messenger and what we can read from science because we believe what they they say we can go through these things to to break down some of the things that we we talk about and and and you know to to be in a understand reality now I gave you a quote from Brother brandom Where that he said on paragraph 110 Souls that are in prison 63 that he believed he had been in both places now here's where we got to cover something because you're going to I don't want to leave leave any loophole see people's computer mind clicks real you mean brother Brown went to hell you say brother Brown he said he did that's up to you right now whether he went there as a person I do not think so that's my personal opinion but he went there as a Visionary you know some way that God could use him because he was a prophet he said I've been in both places right he said I've seen the redeemed the Blessed I've seen the Lost yep in where they were at yep now what about a prophet of God that could travel in those things and be able to see these things and be in totally two different dimensions through the ability of being a prophet of God like I said now I don't believe he went to hell as a thing but he did tell us that it's not burning sir he said that'd be a pleasure so it's not what we think about see we want to put things and just we just lock our mind I don't care what you say cuz you know brother Brown never went to hell but I didn't say he did CU we'll get to it in a little while when he talks about the sixth dimension in heaven and things and he said I didn't say I went right so then that's the way you're going to have to cover it to to do to be able to to handle but now let's just look at these Dimensions brother Joe and them done a wonderful job pulling off let's use the first one on this one and then we'll read it and you keep these now because we're going to be referring back to these all right maybe not necessarily the quotes we have but these that we printed off we're going to be referring back and you'd be surprised how long it took to get that down into to what I wanted because this is the way it was and I I'm not throwing off on nobody it was upside down to compared the way I wanted it because what it done it took one dimension and went down to seven see I told her Jo and them first up front I said I don't want it I said because there is no such thing other only thing you could go is down and I know you're going down if you're not saved I know that I know the quotes in the Bible but yet we've got to talk about a Christian so we don't want one going down I don't think the seven dimensions going down but we turned it over to be able to bring it to place that we could see that you know right here we can understand and let your Prophet answer these things now watch him it's off of the message uh present stage of my Ministry 1962 uh 9008 that's number uh would be number two on your notes now when we come along we remember that we live here in three dimensions I don't know whether I can name them or not one of them is light the other is matter Tommy you remember what the third is someone says something the editor huh Adam somebody must have said Adam Adam someone else says time time right now light matter and time we use I like Life Light matter because that's just held over from the old school days and and the things it's the same thing all right and our five senses contact them Dimensions because that's actually we live in the third dimension which would mean that you could break it down to a one dimension is life one dimension is time and one dimension is matter you can break it on down we don't care to do that we're care to just go along to show you where we're living all right if you see the drawing it's got the caste feel smelling here on it that I like that and because that's where you know that's where we're dwelling at is where we're at here we're controlled by those things but now I going keep saying this see we think those things are more real well then what keeps you alive when you go to sleep right amen what what happens in a dream right what happens in a vision uh you know what happens in those things the Y and and I tried to cover there the other day where the Prophet was talking about how that that our and we'll get back to it a little bit in the fourth dimension that our dreams a lot of times being nightmares because that we're we're Hy we're between the conscious and the subconscious and see we can't connect with brother brandom see his conscious and subconscious the doctors even said said we don't understand said you could dream a dream while you're standing Wide Awake said because your subconscious your conscience is together well see us human Mortals are not made that way that God made that as a gift you know and and and I like that but all right do you understand what I'm talking about we live in what is called the third dimension which is light light time you know matter uh we'll give you a quot to brother ROM in a minute where he even covers thoughts and and different things but here we're living in this we think this is so real and thank God for it cuz this is where we began our Earthly journey and that's why it'll never be annihilated I told you when when I'm finished with this if I do it you tell me I did there'll be none of these Dimensions will be annihilated none of these Dimensions will be annihilated but they will be incorporated into eternal life that's right you know all right see because that's what I think about eternal life that's what I think about God and how real he is he's just not some thought I mean to me he's a person amen he's not just well Jesus is one person God's no we can't go that way we supposed to be away from that trinitarian concept that's right and surely we can understand but all right let's go with that now and get these out of the way then we'll get back and read a little bit so then we go up from the third dimension we know that we go to the fourth dimension which you can see on the the drawing the fourth dimension is covered like the and it's perfectly put in there I really enjoyed the every who put these together and Aller what they done I just needed to rearrange it for my thoughts but see it's a good point put the tree of knowledge see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was a good point because that will cover the fourth dimension yep right because it is knowledge it is that and science has been able to break into those things that's right brother R said they broke into God's laboratory that's why they can do the things that that they're doing I never could understand how that brother Mo used to try to explain how that that they had a that you could take a it was cat was called now it went on into something else in the radio but you didn't even need a battery you didn't need anything it was a crystal and it was brought together and you had to line everything just perfectly up but you you didn't need a speaker you had a radio he said I don't believe that well see that's what the man told Brother mo one time he talking about them going in the outer space he he dips enough he don't believe that they a go out of space they just went out there in the desert somewhere well they did fly out in the Des but you know he just didn't believe it people ain't going to believe it and I'm not concerned about trying to get you to believe something my point is not to get you to believe how mechanically minded I am to be able to put all of this together because I told you if the devil hadn't made me sick I wouldn't have all the thoughts so you can blame the headaches and the and the temperatures for if you want to and say well that was his imagination well that's all right let's see if it fits the Bible if it don't then it's my imagination but we've got the fourth dimension which will be covering in the trip of knowledge The Fifth Dimension is a place for the unbelievers The Sinner dead y who died without Christ then you got under the altar which is the souls under the altar covering it with brother brandham you know and where he went to and that's the Christians who have passed on and then we have the place of called God alone all right and see we'll get back into it that there's an altar because that's where we are we're if you pass on you're under the altar right you know the different things were there but you can't go up into that seventh Dimension at this period of time that's right because it's still limited because we haven't reached immortality all right he can condescend to where we are and everything but we can't go into immortality because that's what he went into right amen all right we we've got the scriptures we're going through it now let's read what your Prophet had to say CU we were reading paragraph 21 a present stage of my Ministry now let's start with paragraph 22 23 24 now but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact that but yet they have a a tube or a crystal that picks up these ether ws and manif them so you see right in this building now is live actions of people in the a live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they they catch it on I don't understand the mechanics of of those things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension all right now we will get to it as we go along into the message brother brandham says cancer is a fourth-dimensional disease right amen all right and see then you will understand the things that has happened in life and we'll get down to it eventually to where that brother BR said like demons travel demons travel in that fourth dimension and in in backwards and forth all right now go on paragraph 23 Now The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to The Fifth Dimension is kind of well the horrible Dimension what do we get down to reading what those things are like a nightmare now this man and when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension now then you see the Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God watch it right into the presence of God Under The Altar and he's at rest well brother daily we go right into the presence of God Amen but yet there's a dimension where God is at right that is not reached by mortality right all right now we made the other one to give you more of an idea okay this is the same thing but it's more of an idea now when you look at it you're going to think that brother Dale is goofed up what he's drawing and all cuz remember Joe and them done this and don't blame them they draw what I told them I wanted but see you got written on it this all of your things over here then you have heaven heaven is an atmosphere that's why it speaks of heavens of Heavens that's why it speaks that heaven and earth can pass away right right I mean the Bible's right because there are Heavens right there Heavenly atmospheres there spars that you grow up into right see and each one of them now you look how this dra out see first is life you know T like time light and matter next is the tree of knowledge which is the fourth dimension and then you put in there and you see all of these horrible things Fifth Dimension is the siner dead h look it's just in a space right okay these were brought in w war it's just in a space it's not a you know you don't hear Brother random talking about when he went down to Hell and did he seen green grce and times no that's right but when he went to the sixth Dimension if you look up in the sixth Dimension you'll see it begins to be green look at your drawing it begins to be green you can see it probably here here and look at the trees and the things cuz in the sixth Dimension when brother R went there he said people come running over the hills and right people were running he said over the heels and over the thing comeing right man they real amen that's right so that's what I'm trying to get you to see who wouldn't brother R didn't want to come back right that's right right amen he wanted to stay where he's at wow it was a whole lot more real and better yeah then look up to the seventh see and you'll see that it still covers trees and things and all up into where God would be in the seventh Dimension we have an altar there because we are under the the sixth Dimension you're under the altar of God all right and Jesus is laying on that altar right okay now we have some more draw drawings to bring later to pick up what we're talking about but see then everything just ties into that green and just greater and greater and greater until you get into what we'll get this afternoon the heaven of Heavens there's about six or eight scriptures that will cover the heavens of Heavens all right now so let's get on with something we went through the dimension he called them light life and matter all right let's go down to number four I think is where we'll pick up to right right let's study a little bit about these and I'm not going to spend much time in it I'm just going to cover a few things to make sure you understand the reality of what I'm trying to bring and then connect to it in a way to where you can see that these things are real CU in no way did I bring if if you've seen what's lay in my office you know the uh Paper Company loved me and the computers you know the ink and thing but uh you know I'm just handpicking certain things now one in he a minute I'll show you that I had to handpick for a long time because I didn't want to bring out what brother around said I'll cover it just a minute look what he says enticing Spirits paragraph 38 19 and 55724 he's talking about healings and applying the things and coming down and the gross and the cataracts and the spread of diseases and tubercular and things you know and demons that's in a physical form now this morning we're going to talk about talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in PE people's body such as Cancers and and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth-dimensional disease now watch it that it's in another dimension y sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth-dimension disease the beginning of it yet yep see because see your minds collect on cancer as a growth right unlock it cancer doesn't start as a growth right we know the prophet's message right even cancer is a backsliding cell right right it is not a growth it doesn't appear as a growth if it does if something was wrong you might have been born with it that way but it still still in its natural beginning it was not that right the and there's a lot of growth in the human body a lot of things they can take out and they they're wrong growth and and would be things that would be horrible and can kill us but they're not like cancer cancer is that cell that has backsliding in itself and the bases that it can can come forth and and uh you know and be a thing and it it's a life now how much do I need to cover that you should know that anybody internet listening to listen to brother R anytime at all you'll hear him talk about the life of the cancer he said now the life of the cancer is gone out he said but the growth is still there he said your body has to counteract that growth or either you have to go have it cut out see and and doing and and you know and that's why that he says you can do those things and be away and but if you let that come back yeah right he said you can be healed of a thing today and and die tomorrow of it why because you let the life come back see you you let it come back into taking its place the unclean Spirit goeth out a man walketh in dry places find his rest you know and don't find a rest sick of n he comes back and finds a house SW and garnish you know the scripture right all right so it's a a Domin disease he said all diseases every disease is a fourth dimensional disease y all right that's why that there's no way to do nothing other than treat your symptoms in your body right actually all mankind can do is try to Aid your immune system right and that's what AIDS is AIDS is not a growth development that does something to do that it simply attacks your immune system and you die from other things you don't die of AIDS you die from the effects of what it's drained the body of the immune system and brother R said God put it into us in the garden the an immune system into the human body and that Satan is attacking that cuz he knows if he can attack these bodies see that's why it's just good to be strong and and and do the best you can you know and exercise and and and and and everything you know eat right and do right I mean you got high blood pressure go eat you all the pork you don't to well you're just you're bringing it on yourself then you doctor no it ain't doctor it's you see I know better than E I got high blood pressure I know better better than the the eat a garbage can full of pork but I love it it's one of my most favorite Meats I guess is is pork but I don't eat a lot of it why because I know see we're not like we used to be in the old days when you when you had the large bucket full of grease and it was going out in the field and and you go out there and burn it out you know worked it off and swe it's not done it's just building it's just building up into it it's killing us but you understand what the prophet is talking about Dimensions see in that fourth dimension those diseases are there now I hunted until I found this quote before I would would bring it out because I know that it can hinder people's Faith now there has never been an operation that could take away cancer amen when you go down and they tell you you're cancer free that means it's you're down to the basis this is 80 something th000 count right I believe it's the right number now if I miss that just you put a number there whatever if it's two or four I believe it's 80,000 count and the machine will not record below that so when they tell you you're cancer free cuz nobody in the world is cancer free everybody has cancer now you want the Bible though my skin worms de destroy my body and in my flesh shall I see God all right it's because of the immune system that can fight off those things and keep it under control but it means that there's if they say you're cancer free that means you're 80 ,000 every what is the thing that they're using there to count that that's in your body up to that point but they can't record any lower so they count you cancer free and I didn't want to read the things brother rman said cuz it was a good meing but I found this one so let's look at it number five which is God provided a lamb 1956 614 he's talking about Abraham the coming down said oh my young brother sitting there in the wheelchair if you could only see that promise tonight sunny boy calvar is before you if you can just move the Shadows from your mind look there are something would anchor down in here there would be nothing in the world ever moving you'd be pushing that wheelchair out of the building and around the cable Tabernacle and the place where you come from and you that's dying with heart trouble worst killer there is cancer doctors can hardly do a thing about it I heard on the radio the other day that it couldn't be proved that one time an operation for cancer was ever successful they called it a fourth dimensional Dimension disease but God's got to cure now that's what I want you to read so I didn't want to read all them other see God's Got The Cure medicine is remedies God is cure I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases all right see because how can you take out a demon a knife won't take a demon out of the body right it will take the growth that's right he said well if it's contained they say that your eyes the best place to have cancer because in the eyeball that they can literally take it out and it's contained within that and it you know it does but see you know what I'm talking about you got your limp nodes you got all these things that's why that they run all of their test and they do everything to try to check and see if it's anywhere else in the body but see I I thought I said I don't want people to think that I'm in unbelief I wanted your Prophet to say it but I didn't want to bring all of the quotes where he was saying that it's been proven that you cannot operate take out cancer right you can't take a disease out of the human body if it is a fourth-dimensional product disease God God has to drive it out right he's the only healer amen I don't care what you say that I went through this I went through that and it took care of that remember you're down to the 80,000 count you're down to the basis to where that all must happen is something to your immune system click and when it does it would start right back thank God for what we call immune system right amen I me thank God for healing he can take it away and totally cure the body but he's still going to there's still going to be those cells in there that's going to kill us there's still going to be those worms that's going to eat us up that's what you tell people you know and they just just cringe at you you know you say you ain't nothing but a bunch of worms that's right I saw a video one time of where they proven it you look under the layer of your skin with a high powered microscope and you look down and it ain't nothing but simply hollered out little things this G's already scratch and go it's just simple hollered out little holes under there microscopic small and there's a little worms just crawling all around sister gwy she wakes up in the night and go in worms again but they got to take care of right that's right that's why we got to depend on him all right I'm trying to put in a little bit with each one to where that'll be more interesting to just talk about a dimension that we can can cover all right now a fourth dimension is like the prophet was covering on number six of your notes where it's uh show us the father 1963 606 and he's telling you about the River of No Return where he said he caught a world record trout you know a lot of people didn't know that he caught a world record trout on that River and he was telling people to you know that where he's at and and everything the guide and the thing but he saw was it Merlin Monroe that was in a movie I believe it was Merlin Monroe in a movie and he saw her in the movie because he he wanted to see it because of the river he had been up and down that River and he saw her he said she was it never move see a fourth-dimensional thing a picture that was made and brought into a fourth dimensional scene right and he said in that Dimension he said we'll have to answer at the day of judgment are you reading I have to answer at the day of judgment do you say but I got by with it nobody didn't see me undress and nobody didn't see me make lud things yeah just remember in another dimension pictures are captured but nobody didn't take a picture of me it didn't it don't have to be because that's a fourth-dimensional place amen and brother Bram even said the color of your hire yep the color of your clothes and the things would be captured I've watched Joe with this thing my brother-in-law told me years ago because he was a photographer and this is talking about 40 years ago he said I said something about something had happened he said Sam I can take you put you in a motel with a woman and he said there ain't no way you can prove you wouldn't there he said I can overlay the camera and do things with it he said and put you in that room because it can be done you already to see Joe and I told him I said boy that'd be something if I had that computer I could do it he just take reach a corner like this and just peel off and just peel off you see like at you peel off overlays it was it Bruce Lee that they finished the movie with a stand in and then they made it uh animated form of it and tied it all together and they say you can't tell where that the original movie stopped and the guy got killed here in the movie being made and see the because they can do it you just think what science how advanced it can be and it's a fourth dimension right that's what I'm getting us at it's a fourth dimension that's right amen that they can do all of these things with trick photographies through everything and show you all of that doing overlays this trick photography and see every move we make go down to the next one go that's what he's covering so Paradox 1965 117 number seven on you not as I said in my last message you standing over there against that wall when I was here a few weeks ago every time you move your finger that goes around and around the world never will stop every move you make you'll see it at judgment television proves that it's here the fourth dimension cuz television doesn't manufacture that picture it only channels that wave into a tube and you see a picture color everything every moving object that's happening in the world is going right around through here now making a record someday your record is going to be closed and you're going to answer to that record that's right that's right so you kids think you're getting by with things right you think you sniffing a little dope you think you do a little drinking you think you do a little U maybe um unclosed a little bit in the wrong place or do this that just remember those are being seen sisters too you sneak around put a little bit of makeup on do a little bit of paint in your face up you know do a little thing just remember I brother They Don't Preach a lot about this right but every once in a while I lay down some things and when I do you better think that's right you said but nobody didn't see me right right you mean God can't see you that he knows before we ever even think about doing it amen that's right but see it's on record that's what I'm getting at Fourth Dimension is a whole lot more real than the Life Light and time or matter and time or whatever the fourth dimension is real why because there's pictures being taken of everything right you see or would there be any problems then to if you could some way tie those Dimensions together why couldn't you hear somebody in another dimension crying out dreams go into a fourth dimension nightmares and things fourth dimension and that's why they're so horrible cuz that's the way brother R described hell right he said hell was not a burning place he said it's a constant falling why because there's no bottom to it there's there's no scripture for an eternal hell see there's no bottom that's right no scripture for it so then it's just a constant falling that's going on down right see I gave you the next one on number eight of your notes I hope I can get through because I got a little bit I want to cover if I can but he calls them there the three dimensions and he calls it light air and thought now this is really after the other one where he was doing the time on but he called him you know light I'm giving that to just show you the case somebody comes along and said well I found this and works this way but see it's still what's the difference it's all the three dimensions whether you want to call it thought whether you want to call it that he covers it the same as being the radio W right right and he tells you where this the center goes to yep in that quote down there on the next about three three lines from the bottom then I think the Fifth Dimension is where the sinner dies where he goes now I think that when The Sinner dies he goes to this fourth dimension now listen I wonder if he made a mistake the first thing he cannot go into the presence of God because he is a sinner and his time is up on Earth I wonder did he make a mistake on that one because if you look in the way I draw it on this one or had Jo them to draw can you click this one back up rich it takes a second I know to do it but you notice I have archways I don't have straight lines cuz I didn't want straight lines you see the ARs ways right see that fourth dimension goes right up into the fifth it's only God can cut those things off right sure so you can go from one then a a maybe brother Brandon wasn't wrong when he was talking about The Fifth Dimension there and then he called it the fourth dimension right CU remember what we do in the fourth dimension is going into the fifth that we don't get it clear right right cuz that'd be where we go to maybe he doesn't make as many mistakes as we think he makes maybe he's more than what we think about it all right let's see getting off on my notes all right but you go right on down that's the countdown you just keep right on down if I were you I would there's two messages I would listen to one of them is called the countdown and the other one is present stage of my Ministry if I was wanting two tapes to read the books to to read or two tapes to listen to is to get the countdown and president stage of my Ministry and and watch him in what he's describing but he says if I would type it for you now remember he's still talking about this fourth dimensional things now it's like trying to go to sleep he talking about a fourth dimension you can't be asleep and you're in a nightmare you hideous things you're screaming you you're just all that's the state of the wicked dead and he cannot go into the presence of God because he is a sinner that's right he cannot return back to the Earth because his times up and he and he's caught between the two things in The Fifth Dimension he's got a soul he he cannot go into the presence of God because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner and he cannot wake himself up because his times up on Earth so there he is in a tormented nightmare y think of that now because before you enter in a nightmare screen many of us have had nightmares it's just because we're told because the two consciences are passing sub and first conscience and it catches between and that's the Nightmare and when you a sinner dies he's caught between caught with his soul between Earth and Hell in a nightmare there he stands now I didn't bring these because I told you I didn't want to bring a lot of thing but what about the the man out there is it um who is this Mel chz where anyhow brother Brandon would tells about the man with the Overcoat on that they saw the car run into him and went up in the air and flipped over you've heard the story amen right he said he between the two worlds well you know what that was that was between this world and that world that's right sure cuz they a seen the car lunge it was told years ago up here in Gainesville that there would be a a woman with a wedding dress be coming down the street they're coming where you go through Gainesville and you go around and j& J's over here and there's the cemetery and they would pick her up in town and she'd ride down and then they would she would have them to stop and they'd get out at the cemetery yeah you can say well I don't believe in all of that I do real I do I don't go around looking for it and every puff of cloud that goes by ain't a spook right all right you see something in it flashes it's a flash you know I mean what is it out in the desert out there they call it fox fire you know did you see this thing boy it's just dancing all over the place and all that it's fox fire they call it it ain't nothing real but you see what I'm trying to get you to see these things are real okay are you following me that's my point that's right get you to see the realness of what's going on but he goes on in that same message now to describe number 10 on your notes now the sixth Dimension is in Christ the Saints dead Saints are resting Saints now notice I like what he said the sixth Dimension is in Christ yeah okay now you know how that we've been doing chosen in Christ and how we've been bringing it down dead Saints are resting Saints who is completely work finished on Earth and has entered into rest with Christ under the altar beautifully you could parallel it like a wonderful dream that you didn't want to wake up it ain't a dream it's natural it's real but I'm just making a parable to you and of course the seventh Dimension is God alone right now you'll see the next one if you want to read it while it's up there number 11 on your notes is actually a repeat of number three you'll see written on the side of your thing so you read these they repeat cuz I wanted you to read them so you read them I don't have the time to but it goes back to number three to where they we're going to but look at number 12 which is 62908 present stage of my Ministry paragraph 25 to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he's awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows me where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on Earth and he cannot go into the in the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood amen and he goes on down if you notice in the last part of it is underlined he said I believe I was caught in that sixth Dimension right so we're going to have to cover that a little bit when we get to it he said he was caught into the sixth dimension huh that's the sold under the altar right okay try to get in a hurry drop off the next two cuz they're repeats go to 15 the fifth seal 63 322 and I said well I don't understand this and this is brother brandham when he said he was in this went to sixth Dimension that's when I watching that voice talking to me I never could see the voice that was just above me talking to me I said well if I have if I have passed on I want to see Jesus I said I want I I he was so he was all my life I want to see him so he said you can't see him now he's still higher and this is Brother Rand beyond the curtain of time right see it was below the altar yet see the sixth place where man goes see not the seventh where God is seventh Dimension he said the sixth okay he goes on down and gives you another beyond the curtain of time 1961 303 paragraph 49 he talks about how the multitude comeing you know the different things were happening they saw the lady there that was 90 years old and all crying and said I asked oh where is Jesus I want to see him the people replied now the other was the angel replying now I'd like to spend the rest of the day talking right there the people they were already near theophany right they were in their word form Souls under the altar they knew too see the people replied he's just a little higher someday he will come to you you will sent as a leader and when God comes he he'll judge you according to your teaching I asked does Paul and Peter have to stand the Judgment also they answered the answer was yes you remember he screamed out right I preached exactly all right now I hope you see what I'm trying to say to you of each Dimension being real and you know I had no intentions of telling you in the beginning but I felt led that I had to to tell you that the eighth there is not eighth Dimension right the seventh Dimension is where God is at this time and that would be the souls under the altar is right down under there and he's there and you know waiting a time he's not a dead body laying out on the throne you know there's not so no such thing he's got a lot of work he's doing right he's doing the Plan of Redemption right now if you'll study the church ages and the things brother random covers you'll get a a whole lot better understanding because if you'll go in there and read of those things of the throne read the message the throne there is a message titled at the throne read that one especially where he covers the Altar and a Brazen Altar and he said when he gets into the souls under the altar under the fifth seal he covers it on the seal book that he said now these were Souls under the altar he said they was under this altar he said but mine was not under that altar they was under this see showing the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament are the F seal Jew and the bride of Christ but there is an altar in heaven and one laying on the throne right now for you and I amen right it's real yes he's making intercession there's a throne read Revelations 4 Revelations 5 we've been through there Revelations 5 what four you don't see one necessarily on the throne Revelations 5 you see one sitting on the throne but then you got to see according to uh it's coming to me uh but said he climbs up the throne souls in prison page 26 I'm pretty sure he said he climbs upon the throne and sits down he said he becomes the one on the throne all of that's got to take place right cuz you remember when we were starting that we we can't go into his presence because he's still in Redemption that's correct we can't go into immortality because that would be mortal and immortality won't connect you can't do it you got to wait till a change comes to step into that presence right so then sold under the altar crying how long but there is a seventh Dimension to where that we would call it Heaven wonderful oh the Heavenly place is wonderful but it is a dimension it's a place for God to abide in at this time and the things are taking place I said if you would read those things read Revelations 4 and5 and all and look at the things that are that John saw in heaven cuz that's where he was taken up to see to that place where up into the to the seventh dimensional form you say well could he go up that way by Vision that'll be very important in a couple of messages down the road when we cover that brother brandham said I went to the first Heaven he said but Paul went to the Third Heaven Keep It In Mind no man has approached immortality but a prophet can go there by as I said a moment ago just listening he when he said I've been in both places he said I've been in the place of the lost and I've been in the place of the Blessed by being a prophet he could go there not as an intruder or a person that would be burning in a Hell right see but being a prophet God could transmit him to there amen he could do those things amen but you see then the life would be would be the not a dimension the heavens of Heavens you'll see this afternoon is not a dimension there is no ending to it there is no beginning to heaven right and I see it as a beautiful place that's right trees don't need no highways don't need them things you said but Brother D I just can't see how real heaven is I just can't fathom a heaven above something that you're saying above the seventh Dimension well I'll give you a scripture if you we'll cover it this afternoon you know we say that before the flood that there was no water in the atmosphere right you know that's true right but it didn't say there was no water in heaven because the Bible said he would divide the waters that were under heaven and above heaven so there was water in heaven but scientific man can't go no further than the seven dimensions he was talking science can't go no further than a dimensional no situation so we can't see even though the Bible said there was water up there s says there was no water up there and let me quote brother brand a scientific world back there and probably interplanetary travel was back before the flood it would not have bothered me none whatsoever had they landed on the moon or if they landed on Mars today and find a cubicle City sitting up there that wouldn't bother me none whatsoever i' shot Glory cuz the Bible says as it was in the days of you nothing new Ecclesiastes says under the sun right the things that have things that are have been so they had interplanetary travel that's right okay that's why I don't understand people you know that you never see U I'm saying something for a second then I'll get on the point you never see uh when they try to prove that there was some kind of a something going on is always drawings in the cave there's always been people that didn't know what was going on but if you'd never seen an aircraft and you was out in the middle of some jungle or something here comes an aircraft down and it lands and a guy gets out with a flamethrower and starts shooting it all around and all these things are happen you'd buy down and call him God wouldn't you then you go make a picture of him see they were scientific Before the Flood interplanetary travel would have truly been back there but now I want to say this a word to you and then you got the quotes to read it from brother around talking about eternal life I was in my father and my grandfather great-grandfather we don't have to put these up until we click over to the light for Richard but everybody can read it when I in my father in thanks go over to number 20 Richard guess heant no he had clicked there yet go to number 20 cuz this is what I tried to explain Wednesday tried to explain something to you Wednesday so I believe eternal life is real right now you can believe what you want to but you're Prophet when it said it in token 1964 to 8 paragraph 192 if God would have spoke to me back before the foundation of the world when I was a thought in his mind so were you if he just said what age would you want to live in I'd have said this right now it's the most glorious time there is he explains the next one that the only way you'll ever know anything is to understand the Spears of the spirituality of the inward man look at the last one number 23 Satan's Eden 1965 829 so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order to be contacted he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ as Son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in Fellowship when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I became his son and was born to him I was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of God we are children we are a part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning he had everything under control he turned man over to it in the Garden of Eden on freem moral agency said son is yours I was looking you can go through the next one back behind it on Satan's Eden or brother man Zach he says they actually uh you know know nothing about it but he said your father long for you to come right now he's talking about natural now he's only typing that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday right you see putting it in because I'm talking about heaven not a dimension to blank it off not a dimmension hey Heaven all right and up in heaven see there's no way brother collie that you could want to fellowship with your natural children that's only a story true amen come on all we want to do was what is it procreate all right we had no thoughts as I was trying to illustrate Wednesday with brother dick and sister Gail that if you had three and knew that was going to be then you could long on those three but we can't humanly do that right we only come by procreation we only come from desires you want to call that desires well I had desires from to be a daddy well that's all right but you didn't know about being a father you didn't know where's going to be a you didn't know where it was going to be a boy or a girl or what it was going to be right but it's not so with God that's right not so God knew exactly how many children he was going to have and what they were going to be y amen why can't we look back and see that he asked us where would you like to be why can't you see that God looking down through time remember this started on the day of Pentecost now we're not talking about the Old Testament we're not talking about all those other we're talking about the kingdom of God righten and he looks down and he sees oh Paul he says Paul where would you like to be well you know my ways yep and you'll fit down on the body you you said no no no you're making eternal life too much of a reality oh what would you like to be well if you don't want to I'll just place you in place so Paul your nature and your ways will fit right here you said now you're making eternal life in nature and ways why can't I make it his nature in his ways I thought we believed an attribute was of nature I thought we proved the point he said Luther I need a man to stand out and protest the world he said I'll take that place CU remember the seed comes predestinated eternally not the human body right so he said all right your name on Earth will be Luther but it's not that we'll cover that he said will you when we get through with the journey but your name will be Martin Luther you will protest who done the protested Christ who was that Christ who was that in Paul Christ Iranians Martin Columbo Luther wesle Elijah I thought we dwelt in the last days that Elijah would have the the nature and ways of the great Elijah that was back there but see that was part to do with William brandham on Earth but can't you just see he says I'll send you to Earth Earth there's going to be a fall C remember the prior message to this the morning star sang together sons of God shouted for Joy why when they seen the Plan of Redemption come into view you mean that that we just see it as a shouting down here where's your matching pieces that's 20 years what 10 years ago matching pieces see when Martin Luther match what was in heaven they wouldn't but one thing that man could do protest that Catholic church and do what he's supposed to do cuz that was the Christ each one of those Believers down through time now where are you at that's right why are you the last brother ROM said I want to be here because of the great glorious things that's taking place but why do you want to be here I want to be here to glorify my father amen am that's right I want my father to get Glory that's the glory the honor and all CU it ain't been a man it's been Christ so I didn't finish up what I'm talking about I just walked down and tried to illustrate a little bit with you cuz you remember now may I say it again my children was in me right yes but I couldn't fellowship with them yes and I didn't know they were in there as two boys boys and a girl right my wife Mis cared 2 three times what are you going to deal with I didn't know that and I didn't have no desire for them to it wasn't a desire in my body to fellowship with my children at that time was it in you no you were just getting mad having a good time and enjoyed everything letting the harmones run but say it's not so with God right he knew exactly every age he know exactly what you and I would look like he knew exactly our nature and our ways he knows exactly how to deal with us right he knows exactly how to deal with us our natur and our ways but you know sometimes they got to change that's right you know there was a day when a man sitting right back there I know him a couple of weeks he was tough as Sho I walked up to him and I rubed him oh he I twist him around do it I said you need a cup of coffee and it's going to be extra sugar this man sitting right here told me he said you better leave him alone he said he's mean he said he'll hurt you but you see I wouldn't have done this to brother dick that day but I can now see changes things takes place that's right you don't fool me on nature and ways I look down at every one of you and find a nature that I like thank you Lord find a lot of things I don't like but I find something I like right and I deal with you according to that nature that's right never been wrong yet CU I look down inside of you I don't look at your outside if I looked the outside I'd killed every one of us by the word right but I don't do it let's stand together I'm sorry a little bit late I want to get that last part just a little bit I believe in God being real I believe that he had a desires and those desires inside of him was me inside of him was a desire to come forth to be and that was me right and we're not the same and we're not the same in eternity we're a body of Christ you remember the other week I tried to express those we're a body of Christ then let me act like the that I am well you're thinking of eternal life it's just everybody being the same no right God knew what it would take to be in this hour yep that's and he put you here to face this situation in this hour why can't we realize that right Paul can't come and take your place am I quoting brother Brown can't do it no no way for it to be done what we got brother 204 204 anybody have a need there is com day when no shall come for in the No More Tears to me high all forever I'm you believe those me real more real than this oh I want to live in no our Dimension resurrect and send in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus

said this morning you know and it just what thrilled me the most is that you know and I can say in my own words what I want to say and I'm saying exactly what blood brothers let's try number uh 612 in the uh spiral book we didn't see thank you as a dear dear fire and I am afraid my version the other two higher and I only want her only always long time amen you know if you can just enter into that place of worship Amen Brother Ray Gabriel come and lift the offering for us this afternoon I appreciate it and we'll watch you uh the uh the offerings this afternoon right amen is Amy let's start over the five nine six amen hey you cry alone again always foreign foreign Minister for us this afternoon amen amen come on service is nearing and in Quire is singing just as I am here now where's the song is played personifying finding Mercy struggling time was because that's what this holder is for is the love that's true that's what this altar is for eign saw them back for you hearts are being broken lives are being changed they'll never be the be the same thing the time has come that's why what is all songs like blood thank you there's a love that's true though that's what this holder is Jesus go quickly now before they go foreign thank you foreign my heart I'll reach I'll reach how I wish see thank you Lord zombies foreign thank you my shoes on my feet foreign good evening amen I don't know how I get Rebecca and Rachel but I do that everywhere I go my grandma used to call my mother Martha her name was Alberta and she called my aunt Alberta and her name was Martin and I thought she was trying to cause a problem between them but I found out later in life is that what that wasn't the way it was amen let's try about about the G baby ain't got good already already went away you know like I said this morning um it seems like every message I pick up here lately it has to deal with the new birth and I know when I came last night to the little bible study that they were doing they were talking about sanctification which is a part of that new birth right and so I know they've been teaching justification sanctification baptism all in a person absolutely coming and dwelling in you that's what it is exactly it seems like every message and I mentioned it this morning if it be transformation where something changes right right where it's the statue of a perfect man where you can't even start up here until you have the new birth right and then I've been reading here lately in The Invisible Union amen and basically it's the same thing right it's a new birth there can't be a union without a birth do you understand that so just it seems like everywhere now it talks about the new birth I think probably one of the most misunderstood uh should I say I don't like to use the word doctor because it almost sounds negative in some ways but the most misunderstood doctrine that there is around the message of the hour is the new birth and I believe there are many many people who do not understand it that's right I believe there's many preachers in the Pulpit who haven't experienced it exactly can I tell you that because if they've experienced it they could you know like I said this morning if a woman says she's got the Holy Ghost and cut her hair remember Graham said the Holy Ghost will let you touch your ear sister that's right so if you got the Holy Ghost how can you spread a strange Doctrine out there because if you got the Holy Ghost in you it would he wouldn't let you do that and so when you see these ministers and I see it many places who come up with these strange doctrines as you one thing comes to my mind no numeration how could a preacher actually teach polygamy when brother Bram said and the seed is not air with the shuck polygamy is actually adultery right exactly is that right so we know you can't be an adulterous woman and be married to Jesus Christ but yet they'll preach a Doctrine like that and spare it out on the congregation so it pretty well identifies who they are so you know but I've been preaching a little series out of invisible Union I usually don't go somewhere else and in the middle of what I've I'm not even through at the series yet what I've decided to do is take the book of Corinthians both books and Minister on it and I really believe if you look at the books in Corinthians first and second you know brother Graham said Redemption is two parts right out of and into go look at First Corinthians and second Corinthians just bringing them out of and into it okay and it's a separation is what it is there's what a lot of people in the message of our have not come to as a separation so what I want to title this sermon tonight is a water of separation and put a friend there and I'm going to put a sacred trust right and if you lead an invisible Union brother Branham talked about a sacred trust that every woman is endowed with did you know that and a woman types the church we know that brother random said that is that correct so as a church God has given you a sacred trust is what he has given you and his expectation is that you're going to keep that trust does everybody agree with that and brother random when he talked to about the women see God gave the women and I'm going to be kind of playing Avail is that right and God expects you to keep that Veil right until you're married does everybody understand that so and Eve in the garden God entrusted her with a holy Veil right is that right but what happened was she traded that Holy Veil for a lust that this is what started us on the road of where we're at in this house that we're in right right so I just want to kind of talk about that tonight if I may if you would let's go to uh Romans 7 and 1. if you would I'm gonna read it out of the invisible Union can I amen you know brother Ram said this was his Thanksgiving message kind of an odd one don't you think but this was absolutely brother branham's Thanksgiving meeting let's see the date on it and this is way down the line he's just about off the scene here 65 11 and 25. this was brother Ram's last Thanksgiving message that he gave right that's right kind of odd to preach it out of Romans 7 1 don't you think let's read know ye not brethren okay for I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband right so then if while her husband liveth she is married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be joined or should be married to another even to him who is risen from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under God for when we were in the flesh motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death right but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter that's about our heads dear heavenly father we pray that you'll Quicken your word to us O Father Lord we love you with it with every fiber of our being oh God and we pray now Lord that you'll come on the same we know you're here Lord because we brought you here be with us now break the words of eternal life to us and we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated you know I was reading this uh book here the other day I started reading it after I'd done the the uh series on the Feast of uh or the statue of a perfect man I'd actually did the feast days went through them then I did a stature of a perfect man and then I I had a bunch of books there that I'd gotten out I thought I'm gonna go to 65 and read some there you know and I can't this book kept shuffling to the top and how I kept getting there I don't know and I was sitting there in my chair one day and I said well there it is again and I thought maybe the Lord's just you know and I don't believe in Ouija boards by the way okay I don't do that but this kept coming to the top and I said well Lord I said well I'll just read the book and if you've got something you want me to bring the people of course we read a book and we've got two messages right but if there's something that you want me to get to the church right now then you break it for me and then I'll Minister on that and I thought well I'll Minister one service well then I ministered two three four I'm up to five now and I've actually gone through a series and like I and like I say I'm going through the booker Corinthians and I don't know if you understand Corinthians or not the Church of Corinth is actually a Greek Church did you know that the Corinth church is 50 miles from Athens is where it's at to the West it was a city that was on an isthmus they call it which is a land bridge between the peloponnese and between the main uh land of Greece so Sailors would come in there and what they didn't want to do they didn't want to sell around these peloponnese islands because there's hundreds of them it made their Journey like 200 miles out into rough seas and they'd have to come down to back around to deliver their cargo so what they do they come up to Corinth they would unload their ships and then they go load them on another ship to complete the journey so they wouldn't have to make that 200 mile circle through rough Seas is the way they did it but to just let you know Corinth the Church of Corinth was founded by Paul does everybody understand that the Church of Corinth was founded by Paul so and then the Church of Ephesus we know he was a pastor over there right we know you know he was a church age Messenger to Ephesus Paul so he was he actually started the Ephesus Church he started the Corinthian Church and it was five years before the the the the books of Corinthians were written that Paul established them now we know that when Paul established the church he put him on the faith right I mean that's what Paul that was his part of faith I told the church if you think Paul didn't have faith he took 195 Stripes he was thrown over a long left for dead you better have some faith if you're going to go through that is that right so Paul lived his message of the hour Paul expressed faith if there's ever a man that showed faith that was Paul and he was a master builder he laid a platform is that right and you better watch how you lay on that so if you come and preach marriage and divorce any other way than what Paul preached it right you're cursed with the curse I had a man one time a preacher tell me and brother Wade he kind of laughs because sometimes we're on the telephone I had a preacher call me one time and he said well I want to come minister before yeah so that's I said and I asked him this I said you know and I'm like brother brother Samuel is a if you're an evangelist you better have a pastor or don't call me because if you can't stand under a Ministry I don't want you coming administering you understand it shows that you don't have leadership or you can't set it under a five-fold Ministry if you're an evangelist you need to have a home Church does everybody agree to that that's my number one rule for them number two you better be living this thing right and I asked him are you qualified well I learned to quit asking them if they're qualified because with their definition of qualified is and what the messages definition of qualified is is two different things and I asked him Point Blank I said are you called qualified he said well yes brother I'm qualified I said fine then come on I wrote him in on the day okay a week later I got a call from a brother that said you know this guy's in second marriage I said what I said I asked him if he was qualified he said yes so I called him up I said brother you know I asked you I thought how plain how much player could I be I guess you got to ask them are you double married so now I got to where I do that I thought you know you learn as you go when you're a pastor right right it's OJT it's on the job training when you're a pastor you hit all sorts of circumstances it's like wow now what do I do Lord help me that's what you do you get in prayer don't you and you say God here's a situation you guide me through it and he always does but anyway this guy man called preacher so I told him I invite him out and he told me when I told him I said oh brother you're double married I said I asked you if you were qualified he said but I am he said you need to go read marriage and divorce brother Branham brother Brandon changed that I said yeah brother I'm sorry but I don't quite get what you're getting at you know he said oh yeah brother Brandon yeah brother Brown made that clear he changed that he said you need to go read it because you know brother Brandon said we're going to have the same message and we are all right the trouble is when he was talking to me he let me know I was out because I didn't believe it just like he did that I that I didn't have the message he had the message right so anyway I went and I said I'll tell you what brother I promise you I'll read marriage and divorce and I'll call you back I read it two days later I called him back I said brother I don't get it I'm sorry I've read it and I said brother Brandon never changed the qualification right for the five-fold men do you agree he never changed that now what he did was he gave Grace to those out here and I told our church and I shouldn't say this because it almost they'll take you up on it yeah I told him I said I don't care if you've been married 18 times it's what I tell them it's kind of scary I really do care I was just trying to show him you know that God can forgive you for that amen for marriage and divorce we have the answer for it right when this message comes wherever you're at you remain as you are right right is that what he says you can't go out there divorcing it marrying and divorcing and marrying and nonsense has to stop right is that right is it nonsense has to stop it really does see I don't believe in really divorcement I believe in a death right because if you divorce somebody you bring them back for the occasion that's right is that right so the new birth ain't a divorce you understand I don't believe in Two Souls does everybody understand that because if you believe that then you believe in divorce right because you can bring the old man back anytime you want and a lot of them who believe that do right is that right usually they'll go out and get him another wife and she's always younger well yeah my pastor brother just said you know they they want if they want to do polygamy like Sarah and Abraham did let Sarah pick their wife he said I'd pick about a 400 pounder about a 60-something-year-old lady and say there you go you want to do polygamy you go duplicate look at these stuff will stop there right we'll double out getting my teenagers what they'll do right so I mean they are they don't even practice it right if you're gonna do it do it like Sarah and Abraham did it right don't do it okay like I told you the story polygamy is actually adultery can we just call it what it is for we're not wondering now or somewhere compared into a rest we've got the answers right we have the answers the people of the message are now right but what I wanted to tell you was he had marriage and divorce so messed up I said well brother I can't bring you in here like that and so I just I just had to race him off my calendar sometimes brother Wade will call me and I'll tease him I go hear this I'm scratching him off my calendar you know so medium's got in an entire joke about it but you know hey you know if you mess up around me and you're a pastor I'm gonna go you understand because I believe you ought to be qualified to minister the gospel it's kind of like brother Howard Carroll said and I really like what he says he said if you've got on and meet him or me and my wife's gonna fly out and the guy the pilot sitting there was shaking my hands and said I'm not qualified to fly this jet would you stay on the jam now I guarantee I'd kick the windows out to get out of that yeah so you're going to get on a plane that this man's supposed to take you up here you understand he's going to fly you out of here because you can't go as high as your pastor did you know that and he ain't even qualified to fly the plane you got to be kidding me right exactly is that right so there's some things you know marriage and divorce brother Brandon preaching Romans but we have to understand that in order for a union to take place there has to be a separation right a water of Separation does everybody understand that something the old Nature has to to die do you agree with that the rule of a resurrection is without a death there is no Resurrection so something has to die and you talked about it this morning me and you that old adamic nature that you were born with and that adamic nature is from the earth it was a lust Veil that was put on you is that right amen that's what it was you were born under a lust Bell Brother Brad said your mother was he was eat Trinidad sure was because you were born in sin shaping iniquity come forth speaking lies is that right and once lust is is conceived at bringeth forth sin once sin is conceived and bring it forth death you understand so that's why you have to be born again if you're not born again you have not passed from Death to life right so invisible Union is all about a separation is what it is and the old man cannot be alive does everybody understand that if that old nature is not dead then you are not married to Jesus Christ because Spencer says if you have two living husbands you shall be called an adulteress amen an ill-fame woman does everybody understand that you are not be the bridal Jesus Christ if you've got a living husband right because everybody understand that so brother random in The Invisible Union what's he telling us again new birth right amen amen statue of a perfect man New Birth almost through 16 360 freeways showing us what the new birth was it's like I tell people if you can't agree on anything else you agree on one thing something has to die all right something has to die and Christ has to be formed within you is that right there has to be a death that's the rule of Resurrection so as low as we understand that we're going to get somewhere now is that right so what we have to do and I'm going to explain to you brother Brandon said this was his Thanksgiving message is that right let me read a quote to you Hey Brother Branham I think you know he'll go on for a while then all of a sudden he says I haven't even got to my Thanksgiving message yet is that what he said listen to what he said you may say what's this all got to do with Thanksgiving it is pretty strange isn't it Romans 7 1 right yeah seems like a strange Thanksgiving message but no it's not he did right on constantly these little when you see these little stories that's right and these little uh Parables that he's talking about in a book go back and look at the title again I constantly when I read it I say now this is the book what does this have to do with that if you'll keep going back and forth don't try to interpret it just let it interpret itself you'll see that that little Parable that he was bringing forth has everything to do with that title is that right amen it does it go look at it and really ask God to give you the revelation of it and you'll see that those Parables hooked right up with what's talking in okay but listen you may say what's this all got to do at Thanksgiving what are you talking about brother Branham here it is quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their Newfound way of life a new life can I say it that way right right they left their own life and they came over to their new life does everybody agree with that at their old church of England where they couldn't Worship in spirit and in truth is right right they were so organized they couldn't worship the way they wanted to worship so what did they do they crossed over the water right amen into the new land the new life because everybody understand so what's rather than talking about water of Separation it's a water of separation is that right what is the water the word right that's the only thing going to separate you from your old life to your new life amen does everybody understand you're going to have to have the water the washing of the Water by the word is what's going to take you from your old life to your new life is that right and once you come over you ain't going back does everybody under saying that once you come to the new life you're not going to go back into the world of sin right so you can't have the old man and the new man does everybody understand this guy is gone there's a separation you know separation means death right if you look at the word change means that there's so many things like I say the rule of Resurrection is death right so you have to understand something has to die in order for Christ to be born in you is that okay the Pilgrim problems we're very thankful for their Newfound way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creed they could marry to the new anointed anointed right they can marry to the new anointed the anointed word for this day right can I tell you that word for their age see Luther was married to the word of his age is that right he was he was he absolutely preached justification it was the message of the hour he was absolutely adjoined to that is that right it was the truth for that day so what what are we absolutely joined to is the word for our hour is that right and new anointed word of their age for their day see I'm not live I'm not eating on some old dead carry-on right is that what he said right I'm not eating on a a Mana for another day this is Mana that fell in our day so I've got eaten on carry-on I'm eating on the unfailing Bodywork of the son of man amen is that right that's what I'm eating on so can we be thankful as pilgrims Abraham was a pilgrim wasn't he did God separate Abraham God separated him didn't he he told Abraham said Abraham you get away from your kin folks son you come on out here I want you Abraham you get out here with me is that what he's saying you know he said separate yourself from your kinfolks really he brought him with him he didn't do God never blessed him until he fighted did he he never really blessed Abraham until he got away from his old daddy his old daddy brought Idols over did you know that a lot of worshiper He's a fly in the ointment his old daddy died out now he was getting somewhere then he had to a lot of him where they gave her they argued all the time so he had to separate himself from lot once he did that now God right to start blessing Abraham is that right now he could become the world made flesh the this right right we talked about it Melchizedek the word made flesh could now come to him right is that right couldn't do that until he had a separation you got to separate do you understand that all right you can't have two living husbands expect to be joined to Jesus Christ forget it it'll work that way we understand it right so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all of our Associates yo young people this is what I see one of the biggest problem in young people is they want the message of the hour but they won't separate themselves from their own friends right now I'm going to tell you if God could not bless Abraham until he separated he will not bless you till you separate because that old friend if he's got fleas you're gonna get fleas you understand now that's the truth whoever you run with that's the influence brother Brandon preached the message influence of another until Abraham come out from under the influence of another and God under the influence of Melchizedek that voice that he heard is that right then God could bless him at that point does everybody understand Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all dead religions right I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what separated us been open to us a new land a new message for this day for this day right okay now brother Brandon before he read Romans 7 1 I want you to see what he says it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it really isn't to me it's a prophecy amen a prophecy for the church in the last day so this message of invisible Union is a prophecy is that right and I'm going to tell you you must be born again was never preached after Jesus preached it until this day by our Prophet does everybody understand that you show me where Luther Wesley go look at their writings you won't find where they use the title ye must be born again I think it was one of the Mysteries they didn't understand don't you they knew they had to be saved they couldn't explain it we can explain it next day we can explain what died this day if you understand is that right and so for you in order for you to be married to Jesus Christ that death has to come to that old nature does everybody agree with what I'm saying now that's what he said now I want to go back to the Old Testament okay and I think brother Wayne almost got on it last night I told him you need to be still his mama wouldn't even talk I wanted him to be still because he was hitting what I was going to preach I thought if he takes my fire I'm gonna be mad you know what I mean but that's okay I know and he about got on it I said oh boy I wish you'd be still man because I really believe one of the biggest problems around the message of the hour is there's many many many many many people with no new birth right right and we don't want to make it through such a mystery to you do you realize everything that you receive is a gift from God if you go in the book of adoption and that's the final State isn't it adoption that's it it's where your words are his words whatever you say it'll be that way you sign the checkbook he'll cash it you write the check right now that's what full adoption is it really is so you go in the adoption book you watch how brother Brown does it he preaches Saint John 3 16. and God gave His only begotten son so it's a gift does everybody agree you're right then he said he gave some gifts everybody following me then he said he gave some Apostles right I read that this morning there's a gift amen then he said he gave you the Holy Ghost what is it you got that God didn't give you right is there anything you've done to deserve it there's only one thing you can do exactly accept it Daniel 70 weeks a pardon is not a party unless it's accepted you know why we don't have more gifts working in the church people won't accept it right is that right accept it I tell the church I said I taught on all the gifts and gifts is just like this pyramid in my opinion Brethren didn't say as I said it but I can see it see that pyramid there I do this and what the the least of the gifts are speaking in tongues the interpretation right we know that God the restoration of the gifts is that was the Pentecost God restored this speaking in tongues does everybody agree with that put the cabbage down they denominated they died right there that didn't stop God one bit did it you didn't stop God one bit now we're going to go beyond that Beyond organization does anybody agree with that now we're not going to do away with the benign spiritual gifts but when I said you do away with an I am spiritual gifts you're living in a delusion the church is living an illusion right so we believe in the nine spiritual gifts so it comes up right one of them is knowledge does everybody believe in knowledge I think you ought to be an expert in the word don't you exactly it's a gift Glory it's a gift that God gives you these things you understand so you come up the gift of discernment right not like brother Branham had right now there's only one of those gifts per generation is that what he's saying well you know what the gift of German is to be able to judge right you know we'll sit here in a congregation we'll say I can't judge that brother you're the only one that can right that's right who are you kidding right see people around the message I said oh you can't judge him really you mean you got the Holy Ghost In You remember it's a judgment seat we see with blood on it it's a mercy say you mean to tell me I can't judge a matter in the church isn't that what Paul got on to the Corinthians form he said you'll take a brother to law you've got to be kidding me you're supposed to have these nine spiritual gifts working in your midst and you're taking a brother to court no you're supposed to have the gift of discernment it's where you can judge a matter is that right matter of fact take the person in this congregation that's the least esteemed among you not the greatest the least esteemed among you set them down in a chair you tell them your side they tell them their side lay it all out that person ought to be able to discern that that gift of discernment should be working in every local assembly is that right right so God's Building this thing up okay the gifts you the last thing he brings wisdom right wisdom is that right you know what come down in 1963. wisdom thank you all right now I'm gonna ask you what was the first message before brother random preached the seals what was the title of it God in Simplicity I told the church if I was going to use one word to say what Simplicity or what wisdom is it's Simplicity right exactly is that right because remember in the Corinthians Paul had to constantly correct these Corinthians brother Adam preached the message Corinthians book of Correction now book of correction he didn't correct them because he didn't like them right and he just wanted to look up on him all the time he put the book he loved them Paul loved them Paul established this church he wanted to see him move up and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost is really what Paul wanted is that right he did preach it again or beat him down he's trying to get the nonsense out of the church the Washington that's what he wanted to get he wanted he want to do separate him from their own life that old damning nature that old sin is what he wanted to get out of your life is that right amen that's exactly what he wanted to do that's what brother Brandon was talking about the invisible Union right you have to separate yourself from that if you're sin you're still a sinner right exactly John just tell you that don't say you I get more people in my church they'll say I believe and they think that's it good Baptist Doctrine isn't that what it is well they said burn that before you come over into this just because just just trembles the devil believes this entire message did you know that's very most creatures I know right he's way ahead of the curve the devil right he believes every doctrine of this message of the hour and he trembles like I say that's pretty well beats most preachers on that right is that right so just because you say I believe the message is not it you have to have a separation the old fellas got to be dead that old nature that old nature it was a damning nature and it strived after the world of things the world can I tell you that that thing has to be dead d-e-a-d everybody understands and if it's no you are an adulteress right right isn't that what's happened over there in Revelation 7 said she was an adulteress right why because she takes the name of Christ says she's married to Christ and yet she's married to the world and the things of the world she's got her own wine her own Revelation that she hands out is that right now that's what she does now if you've got your own Revelation then you're nothing but an adulteress you understand what I'm saying so like I said you better not hand out any wine or your wine you better have his wine is that right but Revelation to the message of the hour because if you know you're just like that Harlot that's missing in Revelations no different is that right why she hadn't come to the New Birth is why exactly exactly right man and that's where the big failure around the message of the hour is is New Birth right no new birth that's right if you get a new birth you're going to get yourself right with God exactly amen okay and I don't care what you say your mouth can tell me all it wants to I believe the message you go to Ezekiel 36 what I was talking about when he said ye must be born again you look at the last scripture said and you do it right and do it ain't that the last words comma and do it if you don't do it you don't believe it it's that simple so I don't care if you were born in a message church if you do not occurred you're not there yet right amen okay now I'm not gonna give up on you all right Paul didn't give up on the Church of Corinth and I won't give up on people in my church either that's right but I have many of them to say I believe and I'll see about smoking a cigarette you got to be kidding me there has to come a separation do you understand what I'm saying you have to separate from unbelief bitter and sweet does not come from the same Fountain right now I'm telling you we're down here at the very end of the end and we need to quit kidding ourselves if you don't have a new birth in this church it's easy right just accept it exactly it's so simple you can't believe it is that right but it's foolishness to your coconut right to your intellect it's foolishness because it's too simple right yeah if that asked you a hard day you'd go do it right right but if I tell you to go dip in the river seven times and that Almighty Jordan you got to be there's a lot clearer Rivers down here in Syria let's go there no that's not what he said he said dip in Jordan right death right right you gotta be separated does everybody understand that so your whole new life is based on separation right does everybody agree with that now do you understand I'm not going to read the scripture I could but I I won't have time does everybody understand the water of Separation in the Old Testament that's right the Old Testament if you were in the church and you were a brethren you say I believe the message and then you go out and sin in the world before you come back into the congregation of the righteous you had to be cleansed in that water of Separation now do you know what went in that water right there was one when it was hissa that I talked about this morning does everybody understand that kiss up Cedar was the third one help me and Scarlett thank you I remember that so you got hyssa which is faith he's got to go in the water the word right if you don't have if Faith's not in the word you can forget it you don't get the separation is that right and again the same rule that I told you in the Passover was in the water of Separation you didn't take part of the hyssop and put it in there right when you burn it with the ashes of the red heifer is that right so I took the red heifer too so you had to take the whole Revelation the whole Faith right and you put it in and burn it with the red heifer right remember he said Lord I come in a volume of book he's the red heifer is that right Christ is the red heifer so for Waters of Separation they had a red heifer that was perfect right is that right a perfect absolutely perfect specimen of a red effort so they would slay that heifer they take it outside of the can and burn it is that right they had to have cedar cedar the wood Cedar is red and white right but they said the red is for the blood the white is for righteousness is that right so they put that on it then they put in the hyssop that I told you then they put the Scarlet but it was Lamb's wool right so it's Lamb's wool it's Scarlet brother Raven said that was Redemption sure and that went in there doesn't that pretty well tell you everything that's in the water of Separation right right so you gotta have all those things to actually have the water of Separation so when you go out in the world and you get the world of things in the world before you could come back into the congregation of Israel you had to have the water of does everybody understand that because you would absolutely if you brought suit in the camp then what happens is let me just be honest with you you bring adultery in that back door and you call yourself a brother yeah they were an Israelite is that right you call yourself a brother that you believe this message and you bring adultery in the back of that church there's going to be a preacher to take care of that that's right and I'm going to read that scripture for you in just a minute okay but the water of Separation you went out in the world and with that water of Separation what you could do is now you could come into the congregation of the righteous and worship with them exactly is that right until you did the water it even if you were a stranger a stranger you could do the water of separation and come into the congregation is that right but you had to have the water of Separation to do it exactly is that right the word isn't it the washing of the Water by the word amen you had to have it you've got to have the word do you understand you have to what's the Holy Spirit going to anoint his word all right man you ain't got no word in you and you say you got the Holy Ghost you got to be kidding amen right the only thing he can anoint is his word is that right that's the purpose of the holy spirit is to anoint his word and make it come to pass in you right it's you're written Epistles written red of all men is that right you're living like I said you're a dwelling Tabernacle of God right if you ain't got no word in your house God's Gonna Know It God ain't gonna anoint that right he's got to anoint the word is that everybody agrees with that it's every Baptist Church in America today is going to read the word is that right yeah man but it's not life-giving right they don't have the Holy Spirit to anoint it they don't have a message to do like the life for this day they don't have that to anoint it and bring it up do you understand what I'm saying and that's what brother invisible Union was what is it it starts with the new birth you don't have a new birth no Union exactly it's what it is okay that's right now I'm gonna read a scripture to you real quick if I can hold on numbers 25 and 6 if you want to turn here I want you to hear that so this is going to get rough on some of your toes I promise you when I get through you're gonna get scanned so I'm just warning you up front get ready take a deep breath don't get nervous that's the way I preach man when I preach I preach okay I know you do too I've heard brother Wade so I don't have to wonder what you guys preach too and behold one of the children of Israel now this wasn't an unbeliever folks this was one of the children of Israel do you understand could I say a message believer would that give you more understanding right came and brought into his brethren a medianized woman in a sight of Moses here's this guy this Jew this Israelite goes out and gets a strange woman and brings him right into the congregation of the righteous and he didn't go through the water of Separation now if they'd done the law right right is that right they'd have been okay but they didn't do that they didn't go to the war of the word so this brother thought he could go out and get him a strange woman bring it into the congregation of the righteous and everything would be okay not a good idea you understand now listen to what happened a median ice won't decided mode and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel and listen to this who were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation they were in church he brought it here they were in worship crying at the door of the congregation and he brought this strange woman in yeah is that Brazen yeah do you know the devil when he was in Hammond exalted himself up and get up against Michael is that Brazen you know what job when he said he walked up there didn't the devil walk right before the sons of God right before the throne he said hey he said what do you think about my servant job it's when you got a hedge around him man I can't get it to him take the heads down and I'll get him to curse you to your face but the point I want to make is the devil went right up to the throne of God did he not right you talk about Brazen there's people that say they believe the message is our they'll go out in the world and get him a strange woman with this message says don't you marry an unbeliever under no circumstance if you really believe this message of the hour you will not go out there and get you a strange woman does everybody understand this is going to be tough but I'm going to tell you you're not supposed to do that you're not now listen to what happened to this guy and when Phineas does anybody ever look up the name Phineas what that means it means brass mouth can I tell you what it means mouth of brass you got it I heard you chuckle I know you got it so what was it judgment right right you know where judgment comes from all right Phineas he was a son of a high priest he was a priest is what he was and he's seen that thing going on he knew they didn't fulfill the law right he wasn't going to let him get by was he this guy ain't gonna let you get by either you understand what I'm saying you go out there in the world and you pull those things off Phineas is going to come after you if you're a pastor a true Pastor you're not going to let adulter Spirit come in your congregation and drag your people out is that right because he's a shepherd and he's going to take care of his sheep does everybody understand that so what did he do Phineas a priest now I want to tell you something there were other priests there oh yeah why didn't they do anything exactly makes you wonder don't it he wasn't the only priest there why didn't they do something right right I've seen it in message churches they'll let that stuff go on Elite your church up it's like a cancer you can't let those things you can't let the world of things the world come into your congregation and not be a Phineas and kill that thing right it sounds tough don't it oh yeah but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into some real detail with you here in a minute I'm using one example and then I'm going to get real ABC with you and break down the real simple part of this message where I believe the failure is coming from you understand where I believe the failure of this this around this message the message will fail this message I got is perfect you understand but that devil will walk right up in front of this he's he ain't got no he don't care he's Brazen in there he'll walk up before God I guarantee you he'll walk up before me in a congregation right right so phidius the son of Eliezer the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation so he was a priest he lived among the congregation is that what I said this morning that's what a pastor he lives among you he 'll put up with that nonsense and took a job to Japan and he went after the man of Israel into the tent this is the tent do you agree yeah this is the Ten right right see I'm not worried against flesh and blood right does everybody hear it was Flesh and Blood it was a shadow of things to come right is that right I'm not fighting against flesh and blood I'm fighting against the spirit of that thing I'm not going to let that Spirit come into my congregation and have a bunch of that get off on a bunch of people is that right see we can't allow that to happen what did he slay his enemies with a flaming sword where did it come from his mouth right it's a mouth of judgment do you understand so the pastor is not going to let things come into this congregation and not take care of it that's what we're supposed to do if you're a true Pastor you're going to take care of that thing in a hurry because you're not going to let get off on somebody else right is that right and he went after the man of Israel message believer man of Israel right he said he believed the message into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague the plague was stayed from the children of Israel right is that right it's exactly right now then let's go to the book of Corinthians the first chapter this is what got me onto the message that I've been preaching for a while here let's go to Corinthians I said right not know it's everywhere again does anybody know what the word Corinth means it means ornaments glitter they had the glitter but they didn't have the glow does everybody understand brother bran said you got the glow not the glitter of Hollywood right the Church of Corinth if you look at the characteristics of the Church of Christ it's identical to the the spirit of laodicea it is absolutely this is what I did in our church and I'm going to do it now so you'll understand now it's the Church of Corinth or the Church of Ephesus I'm gonna draw a line and too bad you're on the left you know it's the Sheep on the right go to the left you just don't you just have to be on the wrong side but you can move up when I get through maybe all of you'll be sitting over here okay that's really what we want as a pastor isn't it we want all of you to be just like the Ephesian church to where you can take adoption where you take predestination where we can move you up into the statue of a per that's adoption up there is that right that's adoption at the very top there that's what we're taking you to that fivefold Ministry is that right exactly Statue of Liberty right there by giving you the word right that's where how we're going to get you there right let's go to Corinthians 1 and 1. Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sauce to these our brother unto the Church of God so he calls them a church right right he don't refer to these guys as bright yet yet okay now listen I wanted to get you how he really looks at these Corinthians which is that Korean to them that are Sanctified remember what you said last night brother so you guys been preaching the same thing I've been preaching it ain't no different I can't preach a different message Than You Preach right right I preach the same message you preach I preach the same message you preach the fivefold ministry is saying the same thing is that right I'll read it to you in a minute okay I'm back at up here shortly Sanctified I said their behavior was what was in question see what he had done when Paul got there Paul got him to justification Paul got into sanctification you know now brother random said Paul got him to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had to leave him like Billy Graham did 30 000 would come up say make their confession brother random said Billy Paul preached justification did he Billy Graham did I say Billy Paul Billy Graham thank you my wife always corrects me I love it it don't bother me it don't matter who cracks me I love correction amen do you understand I love correction you really do if you're one of his you'll take correction see God don't correct the devil's youngins right he corrects his youngins is what he does okay it says their behavior was what was in question I got after I said Sanctified because sanctification is your behavior did you know that you're right is that right right it's behaving out here is because you ain't got something right in there right and that's what Paul was saying Boys you ain't got the baptism the Holy Ghost because if you had the baptism all the ghost you wouldn't be pulling these things right so what's he do he's going to take them back now he's gonna put him right back and establish them again and bring him up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's the way Paul did it that's why brother I'm sitting here right to separate from Prophet things and dedicate to God to consecrate so if you ain't been separated then you don't have the water of Separation right you don't have the new birth does everybody understand that amen if you're still sinning it's because you're a sinner let's just be bold okay I'm gonna say some things that's going to kind of got to put your hair on in here a little later I'm building up to it but these things need to be preached because there's a lot of people in the message of hour sitting in churches have been told you believe the message of the hour recognizing your day in the faith when you receive your message of the hour that's it you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost no if you've got the baptism you'll do it right so if you're you've got one quote you're not living under it yeah you're in deep trouble right right we're at the end of this thing now you better start checking up brother man said you better be prayed up check it up every hour every minute of the day to make sure you're right where you need to be because we're fixing to take a Rapture of body change does everybody understand so you better be sure that you're under your messenger and the message and the messenger one right so that's what you need to if you have the separation and it separated you from unbelief you'll be under your messenger but we have people all over the place 90 of the people say they're mentioned and they say they believe it and they don't have the separation because they're not I can see it they're not under the man is that right in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place called upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you see Paul was a Grace preacher right the law and the prophets were until John since John come we preach Christ exactly is that right because if you preach Grace Grace will put you under the law you understand what I'm saying you'll fulfill the law can I say it Jesus didn't do away with all he fulfilled it right the Old Testament still works today Thou shalt not commit adultery now there's some preachers don't believe that but it still applies today does everybody understand right Grace be unto you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which has given you by Jesus Christ gift right everything look at the scripture every time it says gave given what is it that you've worked for nothing right it's gift everything's a gift just accept it accept salvation accept your gifts accept it just accept everything that God given you if God says this is you then why can't you accept it right he gave it to you just accept what he gave you right he gave you your healing just accept it like I said this morning ask God tell him what you need and then thank him for it just say thank you Lord and thank any foreign and now what Thanksgiving is exactly Thanksgiving thanks for giving me something right that's what that's what Thanksgiving is all about just thank God for what he already did for you all right that in everything you're enriched by Him in all utterance now I want you to listen to this these Corinthians that in everything ye are enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge right now they knew the message of the hour they knew what Paul preached them that's what's happened around the message there they know the message of the hour and they can even utter it right they knew it they could speak it but they lived none of them right does everybody understand where we're going with Corinthians that's what you said last night brother Wade see they say he said they were Sanctified dangerous like brother Wade said it and I thought boy you got that right big boy he said when you're Sanctified you're on Dangerous Ground right you are you're just like the Corinthians were if you stay in that Sanctified realm you can fall off there you understand and that's where they were they could they knew the message of the hour they knew the quotes I can remember my pastor who used to tell them the color of the book The volume number the page number at the bottom of the left hand when you I told him one day I said you're not learning that for me because you can clothe it and the Holy Ghost In Me will amen right what you're learning that for is to argue with a bunch of preachers is that who you got to prove it to him he's a Moses who gave him problems on marriage and Wars the 70 preachers that came to him the brother man say it was the preachers that got married to divorced all messed up there's where your problem lies today it's the preachers who ain't got a new birth can I say it that way they ain't got a new birth they can't keep it straight but if you ain't got a good new birth you're not going to live it and you're dead you're going to preach me a sermon aren't you that's right that's the problem look at them some of them polygamist you got to be that's the new birth no no it's proof to me there's something a lot of preachers yeah I'm not down enough I'm drawing a line say okay you're over here with the Corinthians now get over here with the officials Paul didn't give up on them you understand he didn't give up on the Church of Corinth he said you where what I'm going to do is I'm correct you give them some love yeah and that wasn't Brotherhood said love is corrective correction is love right so what do you do he's going to correct the Church of Corinth and get him to move over here move them up so they'll come to the Church of Ephesians and they'll be ready to take a Rapture then right so that's what Paul was trying to do with the church of Korean you know what I'm gonna go back to the history for a minute drop back but the Church of Corinth what they said the history of it was the Church of Korean was what it was where the church is supposed to influence the world is that right right that's what you're supposed to do influence the world what happened is the world started influence the Church of Christ and what do they have coming in um exactly I mean go read the stuff they had coming into their Church idolaters does anybody know what brother Brandon said in our daughter was let me tell you what an idolater is it's different what you think you and our daughter is a guy will come sit right in here the message walk right back out and do nothing with it yeah right did you say that's what an eye doctor was so if you want to know that's what the church you could do or they were idolaters and he called them that right they come in they hear a good message does everybody agree they'd walk out and do nothing with it they wouldn't put Flesh on it right right like I said this morning do you understand if this man preaches a word and you get it down in your heart it's going to have Flesh on a thing you're going to Manifest this message of the highway if you don't you're an idolater right right that's pretty tough isn't it just because you come in here doesn't mean you got it right all right because remember Satan walked right up to the throne it didn't bother him one bit right right so just because you come right here to this Tabernacle don't mean you you got to get it on the inside of the inside you got to come to water separation where that old nature that old damning nature gets off of you and then it's Christ that's formed in you it's not me that lives it's Christ in me that liveth is that right that's right and if you've got Christ in you you're going to bring forth fruit all right correct is that right right where would I leave off oh utterance and knowledge and this is the one I told you even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you your testimony is the prophecy confirmed in you does everybody understand that Brethren just didn't preach a message to be to be preaching it brother Adam say this thing to your church he even said Brandon Tabernacle is not my church when he put that in that Cornerstone the Lord told him this is not your church is that what he said brother Brandon was not trying to build a church neither are we trying to build a church any true ministers not trying to build a church we're trying to build a living Tabernacle for a living God is that right that's what we're trying to build here tonight right amen so we have a testimony if you don't have a testimony that prophecy hadn't been made flesh there is that right that's right because the testimony is the result of the prophecy so the preacher remember I said preacher means Prophet would this guy preaches the message if that don't take Flesh on it and you don't bring a testimony forth that absolutely unions with what he said that it shows you don't have a new birth do you understand because it means you got two husbands and you shall be called adulterers right so I just want to make sure you understand just because you said it here doesn't mean you have it that's right so that ye come behind and no gift they had every gift working in the Church of Corinth I want you to know when you go read the book of Corinthians he never corrected their Doctrine one time right do you realize that not one time does Paul corrected her doctorate they had the doctrine right they ought to Paul taught him he established the church you think Paul put him on false Doctrine no Paul put him on the right Doctrine he wasn't correct in their Doctrine he was correct in their lives right they claimed it they spoke it they had argued right why they argue with every preacher in the message right isn't that what we got the problem is a bunch of arguing preachers right you realize that's the problem right that's right brother Rams said when Moses and them were taking their Journey when they stopped and argued with those moabites that's what got him in trouble and God said no fussing right is that right see we're not going to fuss the medicine they want to believe it Go believe it I'm going to tell them the truth and then I'm gonna walk away is what I'm living in you will argue you're gonna find some other preacher to argue with I don't have time to argue I'm on a journey and I'm moving you understand I'm not gonna stop stop and spend my time arguing with some preacher that's right that's the truth so that you come behind a no gift that all the gifts working waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you amen is that right isn't that what this word is sent for to confirm you you is what it is take this thing personal all right amen until the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the worship of the son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I'm going to tell you I'm going to stop here first Corinthians 1 and 10 is the thesis for the entire book of the first to Corinth do you know that anybody and Paul had two phds does everybody know that Paul wrote 13 letters in the Bible Paul was a writer a writer well I was in college they taught us there's three parts anybody in college you're in college oh okay it was I was gonna say well you're alone to be in college we got a guy brother Wayne if you ever meet him he went through the second grade three times so I teased him every once in a while I told him to see God don't deal with your intellect because scripture said a fool need not air therein and why because wisdom is coming it's Simplicity now I don't care if you've got a college education or you can't even say your ABCs that's right because this message was brought in Simplicity for that the common people would receive him gladly so you reading and writing and all that and you're intellect they got one thing to do with it that's what he gave you does everybody understand okay this is the thesis of First Corinthians the book listen to it real close now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing did your Prophet tell you to say what's said on tape all right is that right that's what he said and that there be no divisions among you is that right you're not supposed to have you know this is what the problem was in Creative they'd say summer of Apollos summer of Paul sir Christ and I told the church you know what they're saying if I said well I I go to Brothers to him your nails charged yeah yeah you know what that's going to buy you nothing all right if you say I go to Claude why so you're sure nothing zero you know what's happened to a lot of people around the message of the hour they've caught their pastor's Spirit right and they do it didn't get the Holy Spirit right this man don't want you to get his spirit because if he did you don't be on the same Anchorage climbed up in a tree tomorrow huh so he wants you to get his Spirit he wants to have some hunting land left do you understand so if you get the Spirit of this guy here I guarantee you I'll see you in camo tomorrow all right is that right no we're not supposed to take on the spirit of our pastor but you go into a message church and they hold their Bible like who brother Branham you know what they did they caught the spirit of their Prophet they didn't get the Holy Spirit right I know that sounds tough don't it right but that's what it is a lot of people I believe the message they hold their Bible the same way when they walk right and they want to act like brother Madam well what do they want the spirit of William Branham he didn't tell me to take his Spirit he said you go get the holy spirit so I don't care if you're in Samuel Dale's Church you're in Claude why is there Donnie Reagan whoever you are don't you get your pastor's Spirit you know spirit amen you get you get the okay so that's what he's saying that's what he told the Corinthians didn't he quit that nonsense there ain't no divisions Among Us it's Christ that's all it is there's only one great one Among Us Jesus Christ it ain't saving the only difference in this guy and this guy he's got a ministering gift in his life that's all that's different he's flashing blood just like you do he has the same emotions you do he's got the same gray matter that you do the only difference is he's got a ministering gift in him right it's only there so if you know if you want to thank God for the gift fine but don't exalt the man I tell people our church will come when I come out they say boy brother Claude we really appreciate thank you I know what they're saying but you know what I always tell them thank God don't thank me thank God God's the one who put the gift in there sometimes I'll get my stuff let's see who it's nothing I'll get up I'll go in the other night I ain't got nothing to preach Wednesday isn't that the way we do it right I go oh you know read a book and I'll say bam he'll give me something right is that right then after he gives it to me I'm like you on that line I'll say now I don't want this to be me Lord I want this to be holy spirit I don't want to be called Spirit yeah that's good I like it but Lord is this what you want me to bring to the church so what I start doing is getting myself out of the way I'll even start studying another subject yeah and you know what I'll do I'll study the other subject I'll go book like hitting a brick wall yeah I go okay you don't want me to go there let me try this one all right then that's the way it works for you and then you'll come back and say well and he'll open it up it's like a rush comes in the room right it's just like where brother Brown said when that angel come to him in the room one of the seals he had to stay it up it almost took his breath I can associate with that I've had to get up and walk to the refrigerator sometimes there's such a presence come down in my study you understand because why you hit a vein it's the men where you hit a vein and God said this is what I want you to bring the Tabernacle tonight is that right so the gift is the ministry gift in the man but he had no different use Flesh and Blood just like you are amen so there's no divisions Among Us right but that ye be perfectly joined together remember I said this morning the cements love right that's what's supposed to put us together in the church is love everybody agrees with that right the same mind let this mind that was in Christ being you he wasn't talking about the mind to Paul he was talking about the mind of Christ is that right that let everybody have the same mind the same message the same Christ right and insane judgment amen right yeah see you are supposed to judge something did you know that right you you're going to judge do you realize you're going to judge Angels one day yeah you realize one day you're gonna be sitting there with Jesus Christ judging people that come forward right man and you'll say you know he was good to me when I was on the earth Lord and he said he was he said enter in right whatever you've done to these little these my little ones you've done it unto me you're going to be sitting up there where is The Mercy Seat today by the way when I told you this morning the Tabernacle is a feminist name then let me ask you if that's where the seat of judgment was if that's where the mercy seat was where is it it's in the bride amen is that right exactly sure it's in the bride and you know what there was two things in there over that judgment scene there was Michael and there's Gabriel you know Gabriel is the messenger can I say the message you know what's in my heart the message you know the other thing with her Michael do you know Michael never lost a battle that Michael that Archangel never lost a show it I dare anybody show me the scripture where Michael ever lost a battle amen right Michael cast Lucifer Out of Heaven did he not with Daniel Prayed 21 days right who come and helped him to get him there Michael all right is that right Joshua when you come up to Jericho who was standing there Michael he was walking around taking a look at it and said man it looks tough don't it he knew the battle was won right you got Michael on the scene folks Christ you are a winner I don't care what the devil tells you and that third compartment in your heart is Michael all right is that right man Jesus Christ I hope the glory is in you Michael so I don't care don't let the devil get you down and tell you you're beat down you are not beat down Church you understand that all right you cannot lose how you like that you cannot lose you have Michael in that third compartment and he's never lost a battle amen and he never will right he can't so you look in that third compartment all those things in incense proper prayer right all those things in that is what's in your heart you understand what I'm saying so what's in you is a lot of different things you understand and it's showing you the symbolism of what is actually contained in you and the mercy seats is that right brother random said there not be another one saved when the bride leaves why because The Mercy Seat is going to be gone was that right right amen that's it a lot of people don't understand that but the mercy seat is in the bride and that's what Paul was trying to get to these Corinthians you understand he's got it so you got judgment boys you started using it is that right right now that's exactly what he did now I'm going to tell you something going through I'm just going to be honest with you what we've had in this end time and I see it over and over and over people are coming in Brazen just like Satan is and setting right in the congregation to the the righteous and you're bringing those old nasty Spirits in with you you understand what I'm saying right right now what I've told you this morning brother random said you're the final voice to the final age under your messenger right right now I told you and I want to repeat it look Satan didn't have an exalted himself up against Michael it got him cast out is that right right so if you as a message believer you tell me you believe the message of the hour now I'm going to get tough and itemize a few things so I apologize okay Brother Brad said If he if he wouldn't have a TV he'd blow it out with a shotgun does that mean you're going to have a TV you're going to go above your messenger all right and I'm gonna be just Real playing with you okay you mean you're gonna and I've had people in our church we'll have a get-together and a woman hand me a a a dish and have clear fingernail polish Sean do you find one quote where brother Branham ever said yellow red green he said polish right he said make up on the outside makeup on the inside do you understand what I'm saying I'm gonna get right down with it and the only reason I'm doing it because I said church I want you ready for a Rapture right right that's all of our responsibilities being pastors right and if you don't go take that Javelin and you don't run it right into the spirit of that thing and kill it then you have allowed it to come into your congregation and it will spread does everybody understand that and that's exactly invisible Union it's talking about a separation is that right so if there's people here that separated I don't want to allow the devil to come in amongst the congregation and bring Spirits in here that'll sweep them out do you understand what I'm saying I and you too we're as a pastor and I got a preach a pastor I'm not an evangelist guy so I got to preach what I'm preaching at church when you come to our church do you preach What You Preach here sure you do you told me you do same titles and everything so I can't preach any different than I preach if I do I'll become a hypocrite right did you know that's what Paul said in Corinthians if I come to you and I got to preach what he gave me right and this is what he gave me this is when I go home I want to start right where I pick I live off tonight that's what I'm going to start in our church because I've got down to chapter four of Corinthians but you start taking a look at Corinthians what he's doing he's cleaning up the marriage and divorce situation in the church is that right I mean they had a guy sitting there a a son living with his mama yeah you gotta be kidding me and they they knew it yeah they uttered it but they didn't live it do you understand what I'm saying so the water's a separation when he gets out on the inside of the inside it's going to make everything else on the app it works from the inside out it's going to clean this Rascal up you understand and if you still got the world the things the world hanging on you you're in trouble right I'm gonna be honest we're going to make a Rapture and if if one word threw this thing into what it is does everybody agree right like I said she was behind a holy Veil she walked out and took the lust Veil and look what it brought right now you were born under a lust Veil now you've taken on the word a holy Veil and you know what God has entrusted you with he says it invisible Union a sacred trust what has God given you the word right as long as Eve stayed behind the word she was okay once she walked out from behind that word she took a lust Veil on right and once lust is conceived to bring forth sin what sin is conceived to bring it forth dead now that's the steps of it does everybody understand so water is separation you got to separate from your old life but you got to come under your messenger folks you are not going to live higher than what William Branham is that right so I see people I see it all over where they wear the clear fingernail polish why can you guys help me out and tell me why when brother Ram said nail polish right he didn't say the color so I guess it's like remember the stagecoach driver brother Brandon talked about there was one to get real close to the edge right he said and that King said I don't want to ride in your Stagecoach you think Jesus Christ wants to ride in you yeah and you're as close to the edge as you can get no what you're going to do is the stagecoach is going to get close to the mountain as you can get right is that right so you're running around on the edge you think he's going to be sitting in your Stagecoach I'm going to tell you no he's not going to do that and I sure wouldn't ride in your stage coach either but as a Phineas mouth of brass the five full ministry has to go out there and kill those Spirits you understand that's right you can't think that you can go out there because your messenger already told you these things you come into the congregation and you call yourself a brethren in other words you're saying I believe the message right Brethren that's what he was they were crying and worshiping in the congregation and he brought that strange woman right amongst them do you think you're going to get away with that right no I'm sorry man that preacher is going to preach that message he's going to kill the spirit of that thing if you can stand it okay everybody understand but he's going to preach it right because that's our duty is being a pastor it really is so invisible Union Brethren was talking about a water separation is that right he's talking about the new birth right right we're gonna let these things happen in the church and just keep on and keep on and keep on I've got a book at home that's a red book about this thick that talks about television did you know that Ramen in one place he said television yeah right do you not believe that right and you know I where I work in the office they got a TV and a break room I can sit there there's not a fit commercial anymore you know I the people tell me they say brother Claude well I got one just for the weather I said really I said why don't you get away Oklahoma weather Rock and they say what's that I said you put it out under a tree and you go outside and you feel of it if it's wet it's raining if you feel of it and it's cold it's cold if you feel of it and it's hot the Sun's shining I know that sounds funny don't it that's right but it's a core excuse to have a TV you better clean your house up you understand what I'm saying brother rib said you're supposed to apply the token the token is the life does everybody understand that if brother Brandon preached against it then what do you think you could bring it in your house and get by with it right now I'm just going to be honest with you I know I don't get preached a lot of places but I'm going to preach it that's right my preach it at our church too and you know why I hate TV because if you put one in front of me I will watch it right that's right what's you don't tip me with that thing I think it's like a magnet man you'll be a turtle a man don't have I mean commercials anymore Phil fell on it right is that right me and my wife one day there's a Mexican restaurant just to be blunt about it we were sitting there and had the TV on the corner we're slapping each other eating pretty soon this man and woman got up there's a BBD commercial show them in her underwear I like to have a heart attack I couldn't believe it I said you got to be kidding me is that right that's what's on TV a commercial so if you're watching the news you're going to get some of those commercials you understand what I'm saying right I mean Bittersweet don't come from the same Fountain you better get away from that thing I don't like I say I know it don't go down good I know it there's a lot of people still smoking right not good enough you better separate from those things don't bring yourself into a congregation say I'll believe the message and you're pulling those things off we're out here at the end time now you better get yourself separated you better get the new birth is what you better get because this thing is soon to end does everybody understand that okay it's the truth I know it's hard but go look at what he's saying invisible union he said it's a sacred trust that he gave you God gave you this message of the hour a sacred trust and he expects you to keep that Veil right does everybody understand brother Ram said that woman is entrusted with that Veil right right you sisters have something very very special I'm going to tell you that God entrusted that to you amen amen and your responsibility is to keep it and we're the woman's a type of the church and he has given us a holy Bell in this end time amen and his expectation is you're going to keep it right so you're either living one of the other all right you're either living behind a holy Veil or a lust fail right there's no difference you understand what I'm saying right right you're either in the Church of Corinth and you know brother Branham half of his messages he had to correct people the other half he could preach the Revelation and bring him up is that right brother random he said I teach preach what Paul preached brother Abraham wasn't any different you show me a message where brother didn't preach on the clothesline can I say it that way he does but did he preach a revelation too right why he had a mixed multitude there he had the Corinthian Church he had the Ephesian church now he didn't preach the Corinthian Church just to beat him down he was trying to bring him up to get him over on the efficient side is that right so that's the goal of the pastor we're not here to beat you down but we need to tell you get away from those things right is that right amen and move up to a vision amen because we want to go to adoption as as pastors that's what we want to take you all too right is to adoption sure and you know I told brother brother uh Samuel you know brother Brandon had a quote he said you know he said God will not require you to do something that he's not willing to do did you know he said that right amen so when Jesus was born he was born Jesus capital J capital e capital S capital u capital s he didn't become God at the River Jordan right he was born a son will be given to you and his name shall call be called Emmanuel God With Us all right does everybody understand that he didn't become that at Jordan I'll tell you what happened to Jordan because he's going to do example what we have to do is that right he came to the spirit of adoption right right now Spirit adoption is this it's when he said this is my son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in exactly there's your spirit of adoption you understand so you're born right then you receive the spirit of adoption then after that you're going to come to full adoption can I put it that way you know where brother Brandon received his cool adoption sunset Mountain when God pulled him up into that cloud right is that right because remember in adoption you put your son on a high place and you said this is my son his check name's as good on the checkbook as mine is is that what happened to Jesus Christ when he pulled him up on a mount Transfiguration didn't he say this is my son here ye him exactly so he took adoption is that right so what did Brother Brandon well not sunset Mountain he took adoption let me tell you you're gonna have to have your sunset Mountain too is that right like I've told people you want to see and this is me now you can change this or whatever and not what in Revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel come down yeah that was logos does everybody agree you know what and I tell him and I'm going to tell you this to show you the separation Your Soul and Spirit are like that okay is that okay all right says in get it for me yeah uh Hebrews 4 12 and read it for me I can almost explode it but I want him to be sure we get it right he for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than the in two-edged Sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit right Adam to join Samara Jackson's the only thing can take that old nature off you is the word amen that's what divides it asunder does everybody understand that all right so if you don't have then our message for our day is revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel did come down logos because everybody agree with that if that this message there is going to take that old nature off of you is that right like you said your your soul is the theophany you're right it is exactly what it is and a lot of people in this message don't understand that right so what is it it's when that word gets on the inside of the inside and kills that over damning nature out is that right and then you're born again and now you have the divine nature of God Amen is that right and in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God he was logos is that what word brother I said logos so what gave you New Birth it burnt that old you out of there exactly the OU is d-e-a-d Right amen is that right there's no more to be found of the old you right is that right you're born again is right you're born Anew into the kingdom of God is what you are what is the kingdom of God word word word is what it is right right no wonder brother random could start saying she is him right and everywhere I see now when I pick up a book I see the new birth I just can't isn't that what you do I mean you guys are Jessica you're seeing it sure it's because and the reason it is because God has had so much grace on you people here because he wants you to receive the new birth so that you can make a Rapture right all right now remember it's not an option it's a must right all right you must be born again there's the invisible Union there's your Thanksgiving so in order for you to have joy because without it you're a man most miserable I'll tell you that you really are is that right and with it no matter what the devil tries to throw at you you're happy happy man because why I know I'm born again yeah man I can't lose brother Wade exactly amen no matter what the devil tries to throw at me I win right so in that wonderful now aren't you going to be a message and that you've experienced the new birth I mean it's a wonderful thing people it really is but do me a favor go through the book of Corinthians see what they wrote and I told them I said the the prince church was misbehaving yeah yeah that's what I tell our church and go through there and itemize and see how they were misbehaving look Paul told him in the Theses of the book you've got to have the same message the same mind and the same judgment does everybody understand that exactly right you're all going to be doing living the same thing you're going to have under your messenger if we all live under the message we're all going to be living the same life is that right right it's the truth it can't I can't come to you and preach you a different Christ right right brother Ram didn't preach you a different Christ than what Paul preached we all preach Christ amen and him crucified amen and resurrected is that right a personal experience I like the way you put that last night it's a personal this this Bible has become such a new book today it is it is personal to me it's a love letter right it's personal right and I thank God that I could have that he'd let me have a new birth right away so that I could experience oh Grace you know what I miss Grace right that's right is that right that's what I am it's wonderful isn't it all right I'm gonna close with that hey Lord bless each and every one of you I want you to know it's one of my I don't they don't call me to preach a lot of places and if they did I wouldn't because I'm a pastor does everybody understand that but I do appreciate you it's always wonderful to come here and preach and like I told Brother Samuel when you're when a person when a church is taught and you're a pastor and you come to preach at a church because see pastors supposed to be able to teach too I mean you guys do good you know I don't have to just teach the ABCs and stuff like that all right zoom zoom zoom and preach some nice things right all right so when you go to the church and you feel that freedom and that Spirit right you know that the people have been taught correctly right amen that you could you could preach some good messages you understand what I'm saying so I appreciate your pastor can I tell you that sometimes I call Brother Wayne or a brother uh uh Samuel yeah I told Brother Wade I didn't want to talk to the secretary I wanted to talk to the main man he takes teasing very good but I'll call him up and I'll say so and so and I'll say I want to talk to the main man I don't want to talk to the secretary anyway so I pull brother Samuel out and discuss something with him and it's very it's been very it's a valuable thing for me to be able to have that fellowship with brother Sammy right so like I say you people thank God for the gift that God's put in this church not just him brother Wade do that these men can actually teach the word of God and break it down for you before you go out and live it is that right and really that's what it has to be and I said it this morning that word has got to become flesh it has to be that the prophecy has to become testimony right right to where you're written Epistles writ and red of all me right right you know you look at Corinthians it says that there are angels the world and men that you're a spectacle you know what says that exactly and you know what the word if you look up the word spectacle it's the later you know we're actors we're either acting out the message of the hour or we're acting out the darkness part of it you understand what I'm saying right and it says in Corinthians read it and you'll see what I'm saying it says you are spectacle to the world to men and to Angels right so you absolutely your life will bring people's strength does everybody understand that brother random when he talks about Mr Lily he said Mr Lilly when he comes up he comes up about them up comes up and when he Sprouts out the Bumblebee can come by and draw nectar out of him right he draws strings and brother random said virtue there did you know that virtue there it says where people could draw strength from you right yeah and you live the most confused life in the message of the hour do you think God can draw virtue or straight from you another brother no we're workers together does everybody understand right and we need to draw strength one from another that's why strength and virtue is so important in the message in the Believers all right so you need to start living the message of the hour if a quote says don't do it why can't you do it why are you going to exalt yourself over that right it's me you know what they did in crit they said I I mean read it as I mean it'll make you blush the life they lived right right see that's what's happening around the message of the hour we have message Believers say they believe it argue it speak it know it right and no life to back it up right right like you said brother Wade they're on dangerous Grammy they're on Dangerous Ground because they haven't went on and received the new birth and be separated right from the old man can I say that they're not living in a new land right that's all right amen God bless each and every one amen I'm going back to Oklahoma tomorrow I'll be glad to be leaving Georgia by the way Georgia's okay as low as you're here but I need to get home so Lord bless you I appreciate each and every one of you like I say I talked to brother Samuel and you know I just I'm out there by myself I don't even have a minister another minister in the church so one thing I really ask you people is be praying for us I'm asking God to grow the church give me a song leader give me a deacon give me somebody else who can so I'm asking for a lot right if you're a lot is that right so if you would if you'll be praying with me I'd really appreciate it amen and pray for the church we've had a lot of natural death in the church and I've had people in the accountant tell me I said we're not going to your church everybody's dying and I said no you don't understand they're sleeping right right nobody's died they're on the other side half of my church made it what about your church is that right so it's not my point right there foreign but it sure is rough on the flesh you know what I mean so if you would I really covet your prayers you pray for us uh brother Samuel brother Wade's going to be out there next week preaching so after this two-week journey I get two weeks off to hear them preach when they come out there so I'm kind of glad I hadn't been in my own bed and I'm wore out I'm getting old now brother Wade's been teasing me because he says I'm an evangelist or trying to do the Evangelist I said buddy I'll tell you right now I'm not an evangelist I'm a pastor so I ain't got no business out here trying to evangelize all right because that's not my Ministry you know what I mean I see a lot of pastors or should I say this I see a lot of evangelists that are drying the pastor exactly they won't even stay at their Church they're out here they're out there they're out here they're out there more than they're at their Church their Ministry speaks of what it really is the gift we need to start smarting it up writing the message of the hour right right Lorraine said don't mix your Ministries right we know that right so God bless you I want you to know I love each and every one of you I really do I just when I get into church even our church I'll stand there for a minute and look at everybody because you are the most pretty people right on the face of the Earth right exactly you are the Bride of Jesus Christ do you realize that you're the most beautiful people on the face of the earth I told our young girls I said you know you look at those women out in the world or our brothers said they're all hardened up you remember that sister that looked at sister meeting and said oh sister media You're So Soft she got hardened up she smoked you ever see somebody smokes a lot of women they're ugly yeah their face will all wrinkle up I told somebody why would you why would a woman smell they're the most vain creature on the face of the Earth

waiting on that Shore oh there is always are you looking forward to that amen there is although I've never seen it it before I've got loved ones now waiting on that Shore oh there he is always amen amen Amy's made their reservations to go to that place brother Adam told us some things that ought to be you've got to have reservations to get there it's not too late to make your reservation I like that they'll slow down we'll speed up you know brother random said in Christ revealed his own word he said heaven's just another dimension a little faster than this one so you know we talk about being caught up you know we think well let's you know we're going to shoot up Pastor milky white way and all that but you know it may just be catching up this way that just slow down we'll speed up because a faster Dimension say you're not going to be able to catch with these senses here Electronics the Ethereal waves things like that but uh it's going to slow down and it's going to catch us up into it and boy it will be off and running then trust you often run I'll tell you off and running now run this race with patience amen we have a great cloud of witnesses that can pass about us today amen we're so blessed today to be able to have brother uh Sam Dale pastor of the Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia I've been here once before matter of fact it's about this time last year I think it was brother Dale it's when brother Dale's here you know the deer is running down in Sudan and so uh he wrote a waiter here and there and uh they've been hunting and uh so uh he's taking time out of his uh busy hunting scheduled to come by Ministry force today and I certainly appreciate that with all of my heart I do appreciate the uh the ministry the gifts that God has placed in his church and we recognize brother Dale's gift it's been a blessing to us and uh we want to just turn the service over to him and uh give him freedom and liberty to minister the word of the Lord to the people of God amen you know I don't know that song well enough to sing it again and it's every Vestige of it is gone so I'll just turn it over now to brother Dale brother Dale God bless you you're all hooked up I think now we got it amen God bless you we send you greetings from Oliver Church in Georgia and I would ask you to remember my wife she wound up she has migraine headaches and she had one last night and she had to stay at home this morning wasn't able to go to church so remember her she'll you know she's fought the Battle with him for years and they're getting better but that's you know that's one of those things but good to be here always good to be here we had a wonderful time when brother Jim came out and preached for us and all and just we really enjoyed it I enjoy the the word of the Lord don't you so let's just go into the scriptures if you'd like to turn in the scripture to follow along with us turn to Joshua 10. Joshua 10 and we'll begin reading about verse 12 and then we'll get over to Hebrews 1. so Joshua 10 Hebrews 1. I'm just the kind of a guy that I like to speak to people and and I like to get you to thinking I don't like to see you standing there with a blank face and you know I mean I'd rather see you frowning than to see you with this blank I'd rather see you saying what in the world is this guy talking about than to just I don't care what he says yeah but I'd like to get you to think because that means that God can speak to you've read a random said a minister and only one thing a gift and he said that gift was to get to block that spell that Satan has over your eyes he said where God can speak to you so that's all a gift is for and that's what we're doing okay let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for this day and this opportunity Lord we love you and we pray that you would just come this day now and speak to us touch our wife Lord and let everything be well to me with the church there we know they're already in service and just bless and take care of everything be Wade over at Bartlesville Arbor brother cloud and images blessing just let your love be made manifest with each one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen and I came off and had to bar glasses because mine's left in the cabin so if I don't read right it'll be Jim's fault you know reading through other people's glasses you know all right verse 12. very familiar with everybody then it's fake Joshua hey man I can read it here I didn't need no glasses brother Jim okay all right then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel Sons stand thou steal over upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon and the son stood still into Moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not just written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day there was no day like now get this point and there was no day like that day before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel now let's go over to Hebrews very familiar everybody knows it all right God who at sundered times in diverse manners spake in times past in the fathers by the prophets so you know what's the prophet of God said he's fake in the prophets that word by should have been translated in but it's fine because it's okay all right and half in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the worlds amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you know mankind says they can't trust the Bible because it was written by man well you know that's right in a degree of pinning it speaking it you know bringing it to us those things are true but we read in the Bible that God LED those men see all right so now don't misunderstand me when we get on over into the message in a minute of anything you'd think I'm trying to say I say what I mean and I mean what to say it's whether it's good or bad that's the way I am I just say what I mean so don't try to figure out what I'm talking about just listen and see we know that the Bible then was brought to us by Prophets man brought the Bible to us God used that man all right now it was at one time there even with Moses you should remember that uh God wanted to speak to all of Israel but they chose for a man to speak to him all right so then God said okay that's the way I'll do it I'll do it through man I'll bring it to you you know and see then we are the ones that chose it you say I wasn't back there to do that but we were because we're human all right and when they chose that that put us in a category to where we must believe what man says now if the man's wrong and it proves to be wrong then we don't believe him right I mean sensible if it's something out of the Bible it's not right there's doctrines trinities Etc that we're taught by man that we don't believe but that was days gone by we're supposed to be today the word that we can believe the word of the Lord but if you notice there in verse 14 as I emphasize he said God hearkened to The Voice of a man now you know I believe it this way and uh this is where I've always taught it to my people when brother Jim came out and spoke to us I invited him to come I believe the Lord LED it and all like that and you know I believe that's God's way of speaking right if I hadn't would have called him okay yeah I believe that's the way of God speaking so then there was a ten other guys supposed to come in and preach you know I mean it wouldn't have mattered to me and you know if if brother Jim was scheduled to preach and and and uh Obama wanted to come I I said sorry I got a speaker schedule you know I don't care about what you believe or whatever but I got somebody schedule because I believe that's God's way of speaking it's through man to us right now that's my whole points right now remember and we're going to get some scriptures in a minute to bring out something I have a odd way of approaching something so follow the approach and at a while I say okay now you're ready here's what I got to say okay all right now even in the writing of the Bible I'm believing because some of these notes I I had to write myself getting here and changed a few things but I believe it's in the second seal that brother random said that God gave to Moses a thought he said first it was God's thought he said he gave it to Moses as a thought he said it was not the word he said but then when Moses spoke it it was the word so you understand now the word was written before the world and coming down that's the point that the prophet received the thought what how did um how did Abraham say why did he say I'll give you a tenth of this form I mean what was that number off the top of his head well then we pay a 10 percent tithe don't we I mean see that would fit together that God before the world transmitted down through the the to Abraham and he just didn't pick up a number and say well I'll give you 10 percent right you were to give him 90. right now right but see but when it was finished it's in God's word then it all fits all the way through and then you'll see that it's been God the whole time leading the writing of the Bible that's my whole point all right so then it was not the word until Moses spoke it out right then it became words unto us all right now what about that man no that walked out there one day and he said I know he done it through through Aaron but he went out there and he said let there be flies and they came Let There Be fleas frogs Etc it came right by the words of a man the Bible said that he plagued Egypt with his word actually through Moses he plagued Egypt with the words from a man right now that's that's the point I want you to look at and let's turn over now to another scripture and pick it up look at Exodus 32. all right Exodus 32. we'll begin reading about 30. now I got a Sly way of sliding things in I say that to where you'll remember what I get when I get back to it after a while and I'll put my point in and then I want you to catch it and if you don't catch it I'll come back and tell you what it is me but then you can look on people's faces and they go see they're getting the point okay I'm carnal enough but that's just me forgive me but look look what he says in verse now 30 of Exodus 32. and he came to pass on tomorrow that Moses said unto the people now you know what this was with the golden calf situation and all of that you know look what he said he said unto people you have sinned the great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord free adventure I shall make an atonement for your sin I remember that Moses making atonement Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sinned to Great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will not forgive them their sin if not block me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written we know what happened God told Moses said okay I won't kill him he said I'll deal with them and he did he said they won't go into the land but they'll go up to it they'll get around it they won't be able to go in but he said now I'm going to spar him now now I know so many thousand died that day but the biggest portion of Israel out of some 2 million they went right on their Journey going on towards the Promised Land all right now we know what brother Branham has said about this of reading the scripture you know block my name out and uh I don't feel on some of these I have to give you all of it because I'm standing before congregation is well taught and you'll know even the quote and we were laughing a while ago about my cut and paste really it's cut and tape all right they laugh at me at home but we get it done now we know that brother Branham said that he even had trouble with the fact that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something you know he said if you blocked him out blocked me out all right so we know that that was not Moses brother Brown said on the message souls in prison paragraph 77 or 1 cent 117. he said that always posed on me how that God could tell Moses Moses could tell God a better way than God had until I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses well now we're back in Hebrews one right that God in the prophets they spoke to man so we're not putting the honor upon the man the honor is going upon the God that was feet which you can't leave the man out of the situation it can't be done it's got to be left that way so he says you know if you're going to do that block my name out all right but now listen to this one this is taking looking away to Jesus which is paragraph 83. the brothers are putting them up and they're real good at that and that's they do it at home I hand them these you know but I didn't hand these so they're they're getting ahead of me okay but look what he said and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses paragraph 85 could tell God a better way than God knowed how to do anything when Moses said the people will say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found out that Moses that that was Christ in Moses standing for the people now we'll get to it in a minute that's actually quoting numbers 14. all right the one we read was Exodus now we'll get to number 14 in a minute and you'll see but see just don't don't lose the point I tell you that because see that's actually in numbers 14. all right which is another situation that Moses has to do the same thing but this is what I like he said in modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 57 that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in David it was Jesus Christ and Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's Jesus Christ among his people today doing the same thing that he promised he'd do in that age all right so now we know the story then that the real man is the man God you know himself speaking through a man but he doesn't do anything apart from man okay so now watch the point as we begin to just lay it down just a little bit then even God allows a man brother Branham on The Sixth Seal he said he was out there and God was revealing those things to him and listened to a prophet I don't have this quote but he said God I can't tell them that a man could house sit your connection to the mind of God that he could say is just as Moses would say you blocked him out blocked me out he wasn't playing games his life was on the line right but he knew how to deal because over numbers when we read that in a minute she'll see it a little better he knew how to deal with God and during numbers he says now it will be said Mr quote again that you could bring him out but you couldn't take them in he knew how to deal with it now this may be carnal to you but even Balaam with a prophetic gift he could not curse Israel right because God said you can't do it right but with that gift in the presence of the Eternal God he could back out of there and tell balik I can't curse them but I'll tell you how to get them defeated just get them more about women over with them get them men around them more about women because they were pretty and the Israeli women wasn't too pretty because they're out there living in the deserts and like and you know the story so he goes and they get them there but now I don't lay it all against all things but I just put it all together you know a lot of those Israelite women wanted to look like him more about women that's why you got them bite in their faces and all today you know they still want to be the more about women but just making that point but just think Moses said God they will say you were able to bring them out but not able to take them in you know what Moses what God told Moses turn over to numbers 14. see what he told him and we won't have to read all of it to get down because you got the story then of It Go Just Right Back above in verse 13 14 15. we get down to verse 20. he said pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy that's just after he's finished telling them they will say you could bring them out but you couldn't take you couldn't get them in so it's going to be against your name and we're going to read a quote in a minute where he brought around and said he promised him so Moses was reminding god of the promise so look what he says and his thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt up until now you know that works you've been forgiving them you're going down below here in the next verse or two you'll find that they sin 10 times from the time they left the Red Sea or you know left Egypt to Katie's Barney I think 10 times and you know God was ready to take him in you know the sin that kept Israel from going to the promised land the big one Katie sparnia when he didn't believe God's word when he said I give you the land and God says that's it I can look over you here and look over you there and look over you ten times but you ain't going because see they become unbelievers right but look what he says in verse 30 verse 9 20. and the Lord say it I have pardoned according to Thy Word and what about the words of a man that he could so go before God get an audience with God he'd know the mind of God and know what he was fixing to do but yet he could turn around and use that gift that was in his life to be able to what would be a word for it I don't have any education but be able to bargain with God or deal with God or whatever words you would use you know he would be able to talk to him in plain language he said now look you blocked their name blocked mine out don't let it be said that you could bring them out because he knew they was out we said you can't take them in because you promised them you'd take them in all right let's see what brother Raymond had to say that's why I like to read what he has to say you know man this is from the message presuming e24 you can come on down and watch what he says said he would have killed the whole world he said that was Christ in Moses he would have killed the world and everything but look Christ wrote himself into breach for the whole human race we know that Moses thrown himself into bricks for Israel and he said you made a promise God you made a promise that you'd take them to the land that's right what did Moses do to God listen we're reading what he said what did Moses do to God when looked like God was going to do something contrary he throwed the word in his way now reading right around him he's up behind you here he throwed the word in his way see amen I love that right around it says I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God can't walk over his own word all right said you promised to do it you said you would take them to the good land that was flowing with milk and honey I've told them what you said listen and here we are we're on your hands see he knew how to deal with God all right look on down to the next one the message on the second seal paragraph 54. right down at the bottom you get all of it coming down to it but and their Moses took the place of Christ then to throw himself in the breach and say don't do it Lord see and of course and of course he after he'd ordained Moses to do this he didn't come over Moses they said right around I'm saying that once you because he was acting like Christ in that time that was Christ in Moses he ordained Moses for the job and he wouldn't come over him then we know he was kind of discontinued with him back there when he smoked a rock right and we know that caused Moses to not get to be able to go to the promised land as a walk-in he was 800 years later coming in the scripture but yet he wasn't able to go but you see he could he could go before God being a prophet that's why I mentioned Balaam Balaam could go before God he could see the Holiness and righteousness of God but he couldn't curse Israel but he could go before him and look at it and he'd say if I can just get them to do something wrong you remember even Balaam was shown the hinder part in other words the worst thing that could be happening in Israel he said I don't see it he couldn't go over it but yet he come out of it with an understanding that's what brother random says you got the lion the ox the man the eagle he said the man is shrewd he uses his mind you see it in the message you see preachers that they don't care what the word says they're using words to get the mind to the people and they can get them on that side and they'll say well the brother is a wonderful brother so yeah but he's off the message but but but he said he believed the prophet some people told my wife years ago this right eye would come in the message about a man named Lowry over in India and she said I darson say anything about him he said because he's God he's preaching he's God my wife she said does he believe right around his message she said well no he said he he he says brother Ryan was wrong you know and change it well I said well I don't give a hoot I can say what I want to do about it you know maybe she didn't use the word hoot that solid language okay but the point she wasn't worried if he was off the message but you see the shrewness of man's mind man's words you can take a man's words and you can twist you I know your pastor he knows the truth about any Doctrine you call a brother round's message and I'll give you a quote from Brother Branham from memory it will sound like it's contrary is that true he said one day he said now you know he was always one true and living God he said one day let's stand and address the third person of the trinity right now did he believe in a trinity no that was your Trinity he was telling me Lester just one you want to talk to you he didn't believe in it himself but see man's words can be twisted and make things that's what they do in the message they take so much of the message and then they twist it to where it's just Twisted enough and until now they're saying that even Jesus done wrong um great following Joe you know well I'm just honest now if if I follow a Doctrine I don't mind telling you I'll follow it no problem you asked me what I believe I'll tell you and I won't sugarcoat it either I'll tell you up front what I believe and then I'll tell you why I don't believe something else you know see because that's just the words of a man all right but now look God has got to keep his promise look at the last quote we'll give you sir as we would see Jesus paragraph uh E36 he said if God don't keep his promise then it's not God's word God couldn't be God make a promise and then not keep it all right now at the words of a man God was fire Israel at the words of a man he would actually say I pardoned those people now without going back and reading it I want to just get the whole story now oh that's background we read the scripture where that in Exodus 32. and after they had made the golden calf and the great sin Joshua said I'll go up before the Lord and said pre-adventure I can make an atonement well we deal with basically don't blot out and just blot out that's basically you're preaching from that point but I want you to think about what is an atonement it's a covering you know a lot of times Moses would tell Aaron say take your sense or run among the people you know and make an atonement right there were more atonements than just a lamb or a goat or things and like I said he'd tell Aaron said take your sensor run in off the fire into the altar get that go among the people and make an atonement for him make a covering Farm but I want to ask you a simple question this is the whole message one nutshell what was the offering Moses made when he said I shall make an atonement what was the offering it was not far off the altar even though Aaron done that and that was it was not a ram a gold or a lamb or whatever what was the atonement it was his word excuse me it was his word he reminded god of what he had said brother random says you find it in the Bible call God on the scene he'll do it because he said it and he can't deny his word Moses never offered any animal he never even offered fire from the altar it was his word you blocked him out blocked me out same thing would be on over in numbers when he'd come to that place that he began to deal with God and say God it'll be said that you could bring him out but you can't take them in so don't let that be said so keep your promise he reminded God of his word think about that the words of a man now we established that that man speaking through Moses was Christ right speaking to Joshua was Christ but there was a connection to the human man that you cannot separate and I read you the quote or showed it to you there we did that he said he chose Moses for the job and he would not go over him oh I know I'm carnal the way I speak but I'd like to make you think if Peter said in Acts 2 repent every one of you and go off for a ten dollar bill that would have been what it was and if you got the Holy Ghost you'd have done that but he wasn't going to do it that way why because the mind of Christ was in Peter to tell him what to do see the mind of Christ come through Moses and told God a better way of doing something the atonement Moses made was his own words that he took before the man so you know what we are building the words of a man does it said about brother random when he was talking on the Sixth Seal he said Lord I can't tell them that what about I know this is going to be short and sweet so I like it what about a man that could stand in this day he said let her be squirrels God didn't tell him how to speak that he just told him what whatever you have indeed I was speaking go through the life of brother Branham then of the things of the third pool and the things are speaking to the uh storms out of existence the uh you know the the growth that was on his wife the the things that he spoke of sister had it right took the words of a man that said I give you your children sure I heard years later and they I don't know about it they said they'd both Beck's lead but I don't bother me how many times you ever backslid huh see brother random said it now that's not for everybody because brother Brown said it to the person huh but get the point what atonement do we need today what do we offer we don't go get a lamb and crucified right we've got God's word I thought we believed in like Romans 18 everybody's in there that you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you'll be saved you know what you're doing you're reminding God of his word right he said if you do that in Acts 2 you'd be saved repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Promises of you and your children and pharah you're just reminding God right it don't bother God for you to remind him what he's saying come on how many daddies in here especially granddaddies now that's the worst part but how many daddies in here your kid comes up and say daddy you told me you know that you do that well where's humans sometimes we can't do it maybe but we should tell them say well we can't do it so but you told me to do it that's the way my kids always done me they just come to me and they said daddy you told me was going to do this or we're going to do it or not yeah not a problem you know well especially grandkids now they're they're in a greater higher category and well they can really get to you they don't even have to remind you of what you're saying they just look at you and you just go do it come on go to your granddaddies and everything else but you know my whole point is one thing a man with the word of God did Brother Reynold make this statement he said a believer with the word of God in his heart speaks that by faith he said it's deity speaking it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Joshua it was Christ in brother Branham now I don't want to raise our hands because I don't do that but how many of us needed the grace of marriage and divorce have you ever noticed wrote a random Satan I say unto you said from what God showed me up on that mountain you go back and you see Moses had a Grace you go back and you find out that Paul had a Grace at the words of a man We Stand today and the words of a man that came that God Vindicated to to be the prophet of the hour that's why we don't look for another one all right because it may be great anointings out there but they don't have a message they don't have a message pointing you back to God they have a message pointing to their billfold in their own things right but at the words of a man we stand on that every day I wasn't dire when brother Brown and spoke squirrels was you I believe it happened why because of the message he preached would tell me that can be done I wasn't there when Moses crossed the Red Sea now I know we got the quotes right around and say I was back there with you know what I'm talking about but you know what I'm saying you and I wasn't back there physically walk across right I believe it happened the reason I believe it happened is because it's like brother Brandon when he was preaching one day and he was bringing that out about Joshua you know and his son stood still and he said I'd love to have all afternoon he said or something to speak on and God Stood Still you know son stood still and he'd say look at um the little woman with problems and she touched His Garment and said to Sons Stood Still what about all those places in there where that God would step on the scene and to prove that he was God what about the The Prostitute that was brought before him and they said now the Bible says in other words to us the law says she's to be stoned what is your judgment he couldn't say I forgive her that would have been contrary to his own word so he couldn't do it but he knew how to take care of it right so what'd he do he knew under the law if you had two or three Witnesses you'd Stone the person to death right I just got rid of the witnesses right that's what he done he's got rid of the witnesses he just condemned them of what they were doing they all walked away he said who condemned you she said I don't have no connection he said neither do I go and sin no more why because I believe Jesus was a man yes the flesh but in that flesh was almighty God not the doctrines that's going today and that's all right that's their doctrines I gotta as the other day I was down in the woods and I was reading on anointed once the end time I don't see a lot of deer but I could do a lot of reading now but are listening to tapes because I got an iPod and I just stick it in I went through three tapes sitting there on this deer stand you know just listened running around my house slept through half of them and you know but I was like reading on anointing once the end time you know and it really struck me he said those people can't help it don't throw off on somebody that doesn't believe like you believe because you know what they can't help it they've heard the words of a man in the wrong direction they've listened to man Express things and they've went after the wrong thing but you know that can't help it that's not going to save them I'm not going to do it but I pray that God will be lenient you know those are wonderful people but they're caught by man's ideas but my point was what what atonement did Moses give it was his word he reminded God of his word marriage and divorce brother Reynolds spoke to us and he said I say well you know what you may not need the natural Grace of marriage and divorce but there's not a person in the world that didn't need the spiritual Grace May differ with me on that that's all right but even brother Brown I'm carried a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist faith that's what he said we all need the grace of marriage and divorce have you ever thanked God have you ever repented for being in the denomination sometime you ever done that no the Holy Ghost let me out okay okay have you ever thanked him for leading you out have you ever just said Lord I was sincere there and I was I was 23 years old I was an ordained deacon when I left the church I was teaching the adult Sunday school times the deacons and Elders that's what I was doing when I left they thought the world of me what you see when this message came I couldn't do nothing but move I could have been told them in the church I got them told everybody I said I'm sorry I can't stay here I've got to move on yeah my brother came out and he said any minute he said what are you going to do I said I don't know he said are you a preacher I said Heaven Help I certainly don't know about that and he said well just stay and we'll build you a church and he meant it he said we'll build your church in my family would fill this church up my family would fill it up all right because I'm the baby of 13. four died real early but nine lived on got a big family all right but my point of what I'm saying I couldn't help it couldn't help it a friend of mine was speaking there not too long ago in the church where we used to go and I went to hear him not a problem I don't figure I've actually it because I went back there I went to hear the man and encouraged him you know young kid coming to but you see the point of what I'm trying to get whether you like it or not you can say oh it's a holy ghost it's this you're you're built on the words of a man whether it be that or whether it be the quotes of the prophet and I sure like the atonement that the prophet made I may not have needed the natural but I surely needed the spiritual I made this statement I said Lord you've got me out of the Baptist now get the Baptist out of me you ever done that just say thank you Lord thank you for saving me there's not a day passes that I don't pray Lord thank you for saving me thank you for delivering me thank you for bringing me into the word at the words of a man stood one day in a church told him I said Wade is actually it but he will come back I said leave what you want to the Lord told me don't know why something one day I said that'll take place or I'll quit preaching she said well you just preached tonight's sermon she was honest she said you just preached your last sermon I said well okay what you want to happen but I'm just getting a point not coming to my wife I have to wait come back to the Lord before he came back I come to wife I said now this a little more been added to the story do you know okay I said he's not only going to be coming back to the Lord but he's going to be preaching with me she said well okay you know well he's preaching with me my point is this we think that the word comes to the prophet now we know that I've established that established who it is it's Christ and what's taking place right all right so you shouldn't have any open part or any problem with these statements but brother random one we read one of those he said and he's still the same yesterday today and forever you know he's still using men to speak to us he's using a five-fold Ministry the Bible does not say that the prophet was made for the perfecting of the Saints it says the fivefold ministry but now if that Pro if that fivefold Ministry Don't Preach what that Prophet said they're not a faithful Ministry forget it you know it read around and said to five full Ministries predestinated eternally he said but the nine spiritual gifts in the church is not give some callers without repentance but he said five four minutes because really see that's God we're building the words of a man you know that sometimes brother Jim has to say something that probably if a lot of you heard it you wouldn't agree with him you'd probably condemn him but sometimes we ministers have to say things sometimes we have to speak things well I don't believe that brother Brandon was the only one that could speak the word I believe he come to bring a bride to the position they could speak the word well why can't you speak it for your family you've got a child you got loved ones you've got a husband or a wife or whatever to speak the word for them and say it and keep saying it till it comes to pies because if you say it for a while and then say well I really don't know so you never did have it right to start with it wasn't God but if you keep speaking it and it'll finally come to pie should be God that's the way I believe God I still believe that he's speaking through a faithful Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints see the words of a man and you know sisters now we don't believe in women preachers right okay my brother Ryan said you got your own Pulpit at home with your children and see it's not just the words of a m-a-n masculine you know that's why I read that in Hebrews he says what in this day he has spoken unto us through his son so what's the sun in you that's the way women preachers you know they'll say it a lot of times they say well I've got god in me I've got a man in me why can't I preach well we know that's not correct but you do have God in you preach to your Pulpit at home you claim your children this is not just made for a man to have to speak it well I wait a brother Jim speaks it which Revival was it was started and they checked back to find out that it was the lady that cleaned the church and she would just doing the pews you know and she just cleaning it and she'd say there's brother sets here Lord blessed and sister sets here and calls a Revival to come into church the words of a man and you know what now I'm going to end it by saying this to make you understand it was Christ in Moses you agree Christ in David Joshua et cetera Etc but now if I cross a Doctrine I'm sorry I'm just I say just this way none of those in the Old Testament had eternal life by the new birth right there was no new birth because the Bible said Jesus had not been glorified he's in the Holy Ghost couldn't come until Jesus came and released that life to come back to give us a new birth that's why you got an Old Testament in the New Testament okay simple now fell under the blood of boys and ghosts listen to Bread around them if they could speak flies fleas and frogs he said why would you stumble at squirrels under the blood of Jesus Christ so I believe he spoke to them squirrels into existence I believe he come to bring me the word this is my Bible it was give to me but this is my Bible don't belong to you this is my Bible this is my message you know holding up brother randoms quotes I can't say it belongs to you because it's mine there's just one God and he's mine well see you've got to say that man there's just one God and he's mine because see you don't know whether I have God or not at the words of a man we put our whole life I mean what if he came along now they've tried to do it you know they tried to prove that brother Branham was an illegally hunting out there in Arizona did that stumble you know what if they come up now and they put out a doctor and then put pictures up and showed brother Brandonwood and he was standing there and he had 14 women lined up down through there and said all of them was his wives what would you do see when dinosaurs said and all that came well sure that we know that's right which they couldn't be but even if it was he brought me to an understanding of God's word I would Glory no matter what anybody would say about him our glory in the word that he's brought me the words of a man that we stand up what do you think about it you got to depend on somebody brother here's probably the oldest what are you about 65. you know what he got depend on somebody right that was the old riddle of the springs how many of you in the school level talked at and I tell that to people they say where'd you go to school the old red leather stinks what starts off and you know four legs lend it with two legs and one to the end on three and you had to solve the riddle this man he starts off crawling four legs he stands walking up end of it he's got a walking stick he's got three legs that solved a riddle it was called a riddle of the stinks you see Church we're dependent upon what somebody says pray for your pastor because now if you're going to stay here and he's going to be your pastor he's your link to God no bless God I depend on all right see you're not in the you're not in the field I'm talking about if you're going to say bless God I've got my own Holy Ghost and it'll lead me and I ain't dependent on nobody we'll go home you're a hindrance that's what I tell them at church don't come if you're going to have a Doctrine like that you're hinders to me and I'm a hinders to you but we move on with God yes and we depend upon the fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints because they're predestinated to that gift brother Jim has one gift I have another because Tommy has another we're not all the same I wish I could have a gift that these brothers had or remembered names I finally got to remember Tommy I heard it ten times last night I said one of these days I'll remember that see that's why I love the Lord because he's that man that's leading all of us and all of our honor and Glory goes to him come on with you the man Christ Jesus it was back there who could speak now he's here and can speak through you wonderful day isn't it amen praise the Lord the only thing wrong with that it was too short but I got enough to finish it up I'm just kidding now the Lord has spoken this morning and uh it's not the amount of words that's spoken it's the value of that which is spoken and what we receive like the naturopathic doctors will tell you it's not actually how many vitamins you take it's what you can metabolize it's not how many books you read or how many tapes you hear I mean those things are good but there's not necessarily more grace that's ministered because of that but it's how much you retain it's how much you that actually you metabolize spiritually that causes a causes growth amen and that's what the word is to do we're not going to measure it physically you know day in day out day in Day Out but we know now that there's a restored Eden that's begun and we've been invited back into the Garden of Eden to eat from the Tree of Life we know there's a change taking place what Adam failed to get now the bride in this hour absolutely sidesteps the grave cheats death and continues to eat word upon word upon word upon word and it'll change us into his glorious image I believe it was David that asked the question in Psalms chapter 8 and verse 4. he said uh he said when I consider the stars and the heavens I can just picture David just gazing out under uh under a Starlet night and he said Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him what is man what is man what's his value what's his worth well our brother helped us to understand David's Dilemma not necessarily a dilemma but he's asking the question man brother the Bible says God's age and he said he could have chose the trees to preach that would have been a sight wouldn't it we could be if God had chose a tree we could have been sitting out on an L train today or either brought to yam Tree in here whatever but we would be adjusted to it if that's what God's I mean that's God calls us to believe some of the strangest things sometimes but that's what separates us from from everybody else but David said and I like his answer here when the Lord apparently responded back he says thou has made him a little lower than the Angels his crowned him with Glory and Honor hence made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and has put all things under his feet now what he told us in Genesis gave us dominion over everything all the sheep and The Oxen and all the beasts of the field the foul of the air the fish of the sea whatsoever passes through the past of the sea O Lord Our God how excellent is thy name in all the Earth David found so many different ways and reasons to worship and praise our God didn't he there's always something to to praise him thank God thank God thank God I heard a brother was finishing up and I normally don't do this well we got a few few minutes I normally would just would finish but if I know if we get out too early you know there's kind of a fine line this kind of a gray area we get out too early well well you know what we gonna do now the Baptist already beat us to the buffet so but just so just some thoughts I just it just just uh just take a minute I was listening to Terry Fox this morning I knew I wasn't having to preach and I was looking at the newspaper and listening on Terry Fox I remember Terry Fox I know brother Chad's a big fan of Terry Fox well if you heard what Terry Fox Said Today he was talking about election procrastination choosing and everything he says I submit to you congregations that's a Doctrine from the pits of hell well Terry just he fell to the bottom of my list of preachers because he was given an invitation whosoever will whosoever will and he said all the people say well God elected somebody and God chose somebody said that's the doctrine from the pit sale but you know you just you feel sorry for people like that because you have to once you deny election Jesus said John 15 16 he said you hadn't chosen me I've chosen you what are you going to do with that I said I'm the one to put your name on the last book life for the foundation of the world I'm thinking if Kane was in his in his service I wonder Esau I wonder if he could have convinced them that they could have been saved it had been hard it had been hard either boy both boys not having done good or evil God said I've chosen one I've rejected the other I've given Grace to one giving grace to the other I say this kid it helps me to appreciate it helps me to appreciate the love of God the word of God and the fact that God has chosen a sin as the brother was getting getting to in a so many directions you go now brother Banner made the statement he said he's talking about questions and answers 1964. he said uh he said you know the king and the queen how the queen will serve the king he said no wife will serve the husband by ministering him food and he said now that's the relationship we enter into now in this hour where the Queen of Heaven the bride ministers that food to her husband we got to take that word that we hear from man we take it right back to the word we find it's right it's wrong like you said examine it and so forth examine these things that we hear it if it's right we adopt it as a part of our own uh spiritual growth and we believe it and we testify it and we confess it and so forth and Minister it back to God Jesus is the one that said in Matthew chapter 18 and verse 18 He said uh how did he said he said uh whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven he said whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven he's pointing back to the man now because David said what is man it's a man who's actually crowned with honoring Glory from God so God deposits that word in his heart to what to speak it out David said I have seen therefore I have spoken see I've heard but now I see and what's the last part of that now I speak that back out and that's why we're called to be Witnesses and we testify of what God has done and that's how the word gets from generation to generation to generation to generation God established that all through the law teach it to your children and your children's children your children's children and and right on down and write on down and that's why we have it in such volume today and such Clarity today because it's continued to be to be preached bride ministering the word the husband said oh I said something in it just come fresh you said something he said but you didn't get it but there's going to people they'll be people rise up and they'll absolutely get it thinking of another statement he made on page 50 of souls in prison he said with the word comes to the prophet we know that God's ordained it he says but now now that last prophet is off the scene he said now the word comes to the individual to the bride the elect and he said they become now the word to the people yeah God's entrusting his word in human vessels in Earthen vessels where the will of God is he prayed not my will but thine be done he told us he taught us to pray in Luke 11 he said he said our father would start in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in Earth and vessels this is where God this is the final resting place of God's word is to develop us into the very image of God himself we become living Epistles written Epistles known in red of all men amen that's a good word today I enjoyed that I enjoyed that I'll be munching on that for a while we're sheep we're of the ruminant family I mean knows what a rumored it is you see a chief always room they always ruminating or they got four stomachs see they just they eat it down it comes back up he down comes back up it's a type of meditation meditate on these things David said day and night when you get up communion with your heart meditate on these things and there's where it becomes strength because you get into that fourth stomach which is called the album you get into that fourth stomach and that's where it becomes meat actually to them not here just hearing it in the first realm and so forth and just kind of processing in our mind but when we meditate on those things meditate on those things meditate on those things that's because that's where it becomes reality that's where it becomes life to us amen whosoever sends you retain remember as Jesus blessed them and so forth at Bethany and what he tell him he said whosoever sins you retain he said they'll be retained and whoever sins you remit you remit talking to people said and also he said whatsoever if any two of you will agree or touch two or three will agree is touch anything on Earth that they shall ask he said it shall be done they that you ask shall be done of my heavenly father amen God entrusts man to deliver his word to receive his word and to preach his word to believe his word and that's what's going to change his friend that's God's order that's God's contract that's God's covenant with us today I'm so happy about that aren't you praise the Lord praise the Lord Brother Adam said the Catholic church and rising in the sun said the Catholic Church picked that up he said give it to the priest you go into that little box and you tell them all your sins and they they they they give you the old sign of the cross and and whatnot sprinkle some water onion and tell you your your sins are remitted brother said now that's carnal because they're doing it by an edict by a Doctrine by a Dogma by an order he said but the bride he said that power goes to the bride not to the Catholic sir they picked it up and stole it he said but that's the part of the Bride he said by Revelation he says the spiritual reveal revelation of the word he said that did it amen amen you know the Catholic stole the cross from us too remember brother Madam even talked about that he said you got to get he said you must be Catholic you got to cross thinking of you guys everyone said when are they on the cross they don't own it it's just a symbol anyway amen It All Belongs to us remember he was talking about Katie spartania they went over into the promised land and while they say listen you're eating he said you're eating the the milk and the grapes it belongs to us it belongs to our children but the word was go get it you got to go get it you've got to you've got to advance you've got to take it it's yours brother is it every promise and the word is yours but you got to go get it you got to rise up in faith and declare that's mine and go take it by the grace of God Amen it's free he said but you got to fight for it he said every Instagram every step of the way is a fight I know that it's a fight I've been fighting out 34 years and it's still a fight every day set yourself for a battle because it's going to be a fight as long as you stand for this word brother Madam said every devil in hell is against the revelation of this truth that God's put into your heart he don't want you to believe it he don't want you to talk about it he don't want you to minister it he don't want you to he don't want you to come to the house that God where is being preached he don't want you he's against you I hates you he knows where he's going he's trying to take as many of you there as

maybe somebody's found them around here for the life and it must be janitor take them back therefore you can't see what they are they can't see what they are oh you need glasses to find out if you're

gone out tonight you you bold i can't never get his name correct amen you just think people don't pay attention to what you're saying got a little email i talked to her sister on the phone the other day she was talking to wade to make sure she got it she's she's been listening in from india and uh telling how that she's enjoyed the message and it's really helping her and she's been through a good many of the series what she sounds and this is what she says said you may be an old hateful arrogant intelligent dude she said i love you in the lord and you're a very precious gift we had a long conversation on the phone the other night she talked with you'd be surprised how many people are actually viewing the services around the world and that's the purpose of what we're trying to do so we thank the lord for it if you'd like to learn new scriptures turn where we've been reading revelations 1 and we'll be reading from revelation 6. i don't think there's any other announcements parents have done taking care of all of it father we thank you lord for your loving your grace unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for peace and joy thank you for all thanks and you said you give them to us freely so we don't even have to do anything to get it it's just a gift that you pass down unto us lord we love you and we thank you and we pray that you bless each one be with those that are not with us today and just touch each one remember the sick among us you said it lord you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from our destruction so we just commit everything into your hands and we try to speak about you you come on the scene and speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen revelations one we've been on this for quite a while of revelation one that we just used in secondary scripture it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what time to understand amen and we go to revelation six we'll pick up verse five and six and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and be held and and i be held in love a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to study these things and you know to try to see our day and our time that we're dwelling upon the earth that's right and the main thing and i'll repeat this in a minute because i want you to get it we're not talking about these things to just look back and see what was i i'm wanting you and i to see what's taking place now an hour day in our time because to preach about what it was back there is a it's just a story you know right just a thought or an idea and you know it can be true and i'm sure it is but we want to get it down to the day that we're living the prophet preached a message one time recognizing your day in its message well it's not only just recognizing the day and the hour that that the prophet was to come upon the earth and bring a message but to recognize your day that's what i'm trying to get you to see the book of revelations is written to you because the things that are happening in from revelation 6 1 on through right you know it's not concerned with the bride it's it's to israel but we look at that and we see what will happen there and then we see what's happening now because what happens there has its beginning here that's right are you listening that's the main thing i want you to see whatever would happen it'll have its beginning somewhere that's like in genesis everything begins in genesis all right and then it comes down to this day any doctrine any idea any thought you can go back to genesis with it all right then you can take the seals and and one of them will tie the entire bible together the prophet said all right then we can go back through the bible and see the day that we're living right it's fine to look back and see what somebody else done like what he was saying one time you know he's preaching about abraham he said well wait a minute i'm not i'm not just talking about abraham i mean it's our journey it's our doing decision right here now there's no need of just just stories to tell about somebody else but when you experience it yourself you live through it then you can see you know your day and it's time and who you are it's not going to put us in the rapture to know the bible now listen to what i'm saying even to know the letter of the bible that we could read it that we could memorize it to be able to quote every verse in the bible that's not going to put us in the rapture right it's when the word is revealed luther preached no telling how many sermons on maybe a topic called the just shall live by faith because he preached the bible and surely he preached a lot of things but see one day it was quickened that's right and when it was quickened he was not afraid see maybe what he was seeing it caused a lot of uprisings had come back in that time and people were trying to protest the catholic church and things and their control and you know they'd be afraid not like the apostles were when they were gathered in the upper room they had the letter of the word right amen they'd walk with the lord jesus but they were scared to death right but when the holy ghost came he took away their fear it made something personal see when martin luther when it was revealed to him then he came off the pages into his heart and his soul of being was a just shall live by faith then he was not afraid of the world he said let them know that i'm against them you have no problems with being scared about being excommunicated because you know what that means to a catholic you know saying the other day you know we think about see bring that down to where we're at right now that we think about you know that uh when we've got to stay in the catholic church because mama is still in purgatory and we ain't got her out yet so we got to play her out you know and then then honey maybe we'll think about leaving once we get mama and grandma and grandpa all out of purgatory we'll see we would laugh about that right but have you ever talked to people that said well if the badness was good enough for mama it's good enough for me i'll stay here because mama was a good baptist well that's good mama was a good bad this probably might have been a good christian but what has that got to do with me and you yeah you know what right what has it got to do with you and i about anybody else right christianity is not based upon you and somebody else is based upon jesus christ in him alone what everybody else is is great i love my mother she raised all of us you know could have adopted us all out and got rid of us nine of us and she could have thrown us all away but she chose to raise us after daddy died well i love her and appreciate it but you know i'm not going to stay i i couldn't stay where mama had went right when the word was revealed i had to move on i've told you my brother came out he said where you going i said i don't know but i can't stay here he said well you want a church we'll build you one i said that's not what it is he said i've got to find my own way i've got to walk in whatever's leading me that's i don't have anything against anybody i said about my own people or see right but yet they're so tied up in their church until they think the church is going to take them right well that's the deception i'm trying to get you to see that's the things that we're trying to go through to get us to see here why we are like we are why is it that we're odd and different well you're just a bunch of people got another cult we're called a cult and i don't mind saying it probably about 75 percent of the people of this message are a cult that's right and i'm against them so then that's just it right i'll just talk plain okay because i don't build it up to say oh we're the only one where we're with this no the truth is the only one right so we got to do something about the truth man the bible says you shall know the truth not know about truth you shall know d notice that b means singular it was john d baptist meant it was just one if it was saying john of baptist then you could have a whole lot of them right but when it said john b it right it was that's right lord the christ there's only one right so then looking at the word and seeing it and trying to follow it down to where we're at let's find our day right let's search our hearts you know you don't know you've got error until truth is made that's known i was in the baptist church for a long time deacon for about five years or more i don't really remember you know i believe they were right i knew they had a lot of problems yeah but i still believe the word i thought but one day i found out that that wasn't exactly it they had truth but i wanted to be true right then i wanted to read the word for myself i want somebody else to read it for myself and see what it says all right now in the opening of these seals that we're talking about the the preaching of what we're doing to kind of back up and review up to where we are see we saw the first seal when it broke a white horse rider it was a rider and a white horse he had a bow and no arrows a crown was given to him later all right in that antichrist system because that's who that was that was the antichrist that little john spoke up when he calls it the antichrist an antichrist system is just a little savings the doctrines little cults and i told you we went back to genesis with it that abel was okay he tried to tell cain the truth right how many years don't know because they were offering sacrifices so that means it had to be on up to adulthood never what you want to call it he came he was trying to tell abel what the truth was he thought and that's what caused him to come up with a doctrine and he went from a doctrine to a basis did he become incarnate with his doctrine and he wouldn't believe what abel was saying so he killed cain i mean killed abraham so then the white horse he was the antichrist riding out to the deception all right second seal we saw that it was a red horse same rider but a red horse and it was given unto him to make war and to do things and to kill with a sword we can see that that been all the way through the bible because that's what it was talking about that's where cane didn't kill april now watch it when we get into this this one that it winds up being a black horse if i don't get back to it just watch kane see a curse was put on cane not to make him black it wouldn't the curse that would have been done away at the flood but it was a curse it was put on him the mark of the beast right right was put on him but darkness was put upon the heart of cain that's right god even told kenny in person said if you would have done what your brother done you would have been accepted is that what the bible said but instead of darkness came upon him blackness that he was never converted right you would never have anything to do with it and become a battle ever since you know see he said but brother dale you're talking about good people kane was a good man sure you know he wasn't a murderer mabel was a murderer right yeah come on abel killed an animal to take his place kane was a good guy out working himself to death but that wasn't what god said that's right he said it was blood right we see the world is full of good people good religious people just like it was there when jesus came on the earth was there anything that jesus could say about those pharisees about what how they were keeping the law no but he was just trying to tell them that they couldn't see pastor into their nose you remember the only trouble that god had with job you remember the thing that job's problem right job said i've offered what god said for me to offer but he thought the offering of the animal made him right when it was not the offering of the animal that was just the commandment to give right it was a believing believing in god the problem with job was he he didn't put everything into god he put it in i've done it that's right and he had you remember and the three guys kept talking to him but finally hell are you you know got that's right answered which was god to him he said you wanted to talk to me and i'm down here now to talk to you he said all all that i see wrong with you said you're just a little self-righteous he's self-righteous and he thought that what he'd done was right he was now the pharisees were self-righteous right right but jesus said unless you exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you won't they were righteous they were perfect you couldn't put a finger on them because you couldn't they would have killed them but yet they rejected god when he stood there could we do the same today see by accepting you just trying to live the word to the letter man we can be a pharisee an actor that's right you see i want to be a christian don't you yeah that's the whole of the bible what are the seals the plagues the viles or things we talk about it's a revelation of jesus christ but where's he at now he's in you and i am right all right we're not talking about a historical god of 2000 years ago that walked the shores of galilee we're talking about the god that we claim to have within us in the new earth and to walk therein see so it went from what an antichrist this is a little saiyan it went down from that to a false prophet paul dealt with them while he was here paul didn't call it antichrist because he'd never been to pat with some back john i had but paul would call it grievous woods false prophets right because by the time of paul that's what it's become men teaching perverse things like philosophers and armenians they're how you pronounce them teaching that the resurrection was passed well see paul was teaching the resurrection with spice but his was a spiritual resurrection and a new birth into the heart of man they were teaching the physical resurrection it already transpired right well paul could have simply said well show them to me yeah but instead of arguing with him he just committed him to the devil let him take care of it you see the simplicity of the opening of the word amen see this antichrist this was this first seal he had a bow with no errors very innocent very uh almost seemingly powerless and you know that a doctrine or an idea is powerless until other people join together with you sure that's right but by the time they came into the second seal see a crown was given him in the first what a triple ruling crown they made a poke when they made a pope out of the mansion they elected the head bishop you know they had all of them and they wanted to head kind of like israel right israel had a prophet but why did they want a king you see it's always through the bible why do they want a king we want to be like everybody else so they said we wanted a leader over all of us so they elected a pope because i told you he didn't start out a bad guy right it took many years before a lot of their doctrines came into view and they started killing right it came all the way on over in time before the killing started another second season all right now we read here in the third that is coming down to a a dark time now what i want you to think about today you don't get nothing out of the message get one thing we were to illustrate it oh i went with josh and him you know i may be a dodeo granddaddy but a dude but i went with josh one time on a tour of mcminnville where all the caves are at well you know if you turned out all these lots in here you'd say it's dark but it's really not have you ever been somewhere where it was just you seemed like it was the old saying you couldn't even see your finger before your nose so they were down there and they got us all together in one place and he said all right everybody turn off the flashlights and they turned off and that guy had a big old lantern thing and he turned that thing off and you talking about black yeah now if you said go north i'd ask you which way it was south or up or down or whatever it was black right right no hopes where we were at there was no hopes of finding our way out they claim that's what a lot of the cage dwellers done you know the guys that go back in on things back in the old days they had pine knots and stuff and they'd drop them or lose it and they just go haywire and kill yourself or fall off a hole because it's dark now that's what we want to think about today what would be the blackest of blackness you could think of i'm asking you for your definition wrote around and preached a little message one time you remember it was his first one he thought he done a good job i think he did but anyhow you remember he preached it started preaching about hell when he preached it there was no no mama there was no daddy there there was no god there he thought he'd done a good job i say i think he did because he got a point to me what is the what is darkness okay most of you are whispering it out so whatever it is what it's an absence of light now no matter how dark it was down in that hole if we had even just one little of those um lights that you pointers you know one of these little bitty bikes here yeah right it would have been like a greater luminous light to your eyes underground but what about when you can't even find that right right you probably said the reason it was sad for hell he said because god wasn't there you talk about something is when cain himself turned the bible said and walked away amen from the presence of the lord how dark is darkness how great is darkness what about someone who becomes so um one with a doctrinal issue right until you won't hear truth amen that's right it's all but if it's presented right don't you think jesus presented it right to the pharisees and sadducees don't you think so yeah i mean if you're not you're going to argue with god about the way to do that i think he's done a marvelous job presenting sweets off to him sure at times he had to say things but what could he have said at the other things darkness and blackness of cain to go away from the presence of god sure still have 20 20 vision let's seal yourself away because that's what i want you to watch today a darkness because that's what this third seal is it's a dark horse i remember what we were covering how we've been through it it's the same rider on each horse right because that rider starts out as an antichrist spirit which we'll find out this afternoon was already dead anyway but it wasn't called that right that antichrist spirit he was satan and the children of disobedience that paul would say deceiving the world deceived it so much until when he got off of that black horse he got on the red one and the same people that had accepted that antichrist thought wound up killing people if you don't agree with that get fox's book of martyrs and just see what all of the the historians said about it right that's what gets me and see the people who come along now and they can say well well we'll oh well we i guess we're wrong maybe the way we've done things or let's all be good brothers but you know there's an old story he said if the snake bites you once it's a snake's fault that's right it bites you twice it's yours but you see you got off of that white horse got on the red one and started killing wherever they ever apologized see if they apologized for the 68 million on their own record and say they was wrong they would be saying that that 68 million were not going to heaven think about it they can't deny their own records they made their own records if they'd killed 68 million because remember the saint augustine wrote the decree but it was better to serve god by force than to not serve him at all so they killed 68 million so they're never going to apologize for killing all those people he said look but brother dale that was back yonder that was back to you under we were all different now we are i thought the same old people right right i didn't know the world had a conversion and made everybody a christian did you i thought it was still that same thing right amen but you see church what i've tried to get you to see just like i did there wednesday a lot of you have left churches and come here and you know what they said when you left you've left the word you're out from under the blood that happened with brother richard and them years ago in that situation that happened back there and they come down here i immediately call them up to the front and if you desire it i'd be glad to do it the end of the service i brought brother richard and his family up to the front and i said i know what they've done they said you left the word and you're out under the blood so we'll just put you under the blood of this church i mean i mean it now sure all right if any of you think that some of those churches back there you've been in you know like that you're in bad shape because you left them well we'll just have a comment after the service here today and you just come up and we'll just put you under the blood here i think you already are if you're saying this is your church home but i mean if you need it that's what we'll do because see i know what those little deceiving demons are they talk to you right like i've always said you you come to church you come to a sunday morning and the devil tells you you're feeling too bad you just don't need to go this morning just wait and go this evening it only happens to me every sunday morning all right so what do you do okay i do i feel bad i'm not going today so you're sitting there pity pattern in your little headed ways and saying well you know i didn't need to go because i feel bad i like the old two man sitting out on the creek bank fishing they heard the bell ringing into the church and one of them said well you know what i went to church today the other one said i couldn't go because my wife was sick but just about the time that you look at you watching ten o'clock that old demon don't say no more that you were sick he'll say see that you ain't a christian he was christian you'd win come on they don't talk to you that way did you could win you wasn't that sick so you ain't gonna win best way to deal with the devil just get up and leave i don't care what's wife or husband if you call him the devil either get up and leave him that's right go on right now move on with god oh i want to be a good little wife or a good husband when you die and go gonna help me that way too i know i'm my oh hateful dude but is it the truth see church what is a darkness brother brandon tried to talk to that girl one time about her salvation right the next time he seen her she offered him a drink or a smoke or something she said i could see my mother's soul frying in hell and life at her so that's how bad it's got brother brown now i'm not talking about back dark there was a dark age we'll get to it a little bit the middle age prophet calls it a torah a dark age you look at your church ages that was drawn out by the holy spirit and you'll see in that dark age the light was just almost gone just a little bit of light right why because of what the church had done right the thing that was supposed to be the savior the church became the crucifiers right it was it from them down to the ages there they killed a man because he believed in one god i've never understood that i'm as honest as i can be i've never understood mankind how that you could nail up you could take a man and put him in time to a post and build a fire around him and then turn around with a cross in your hand and say deny that god and the man looks at you and said i believe in jesus who do you believe in right i believe in jesus too i'm going to kill you because you believe in jesus because you won't accept murray as the mother of god right and that's something to kill right well what about a darkness i look around at this message people and i see people that they're gone into darkness because they will not in no way accept truth right come on they have a change truth is supposed to change us okay bringing it down to our day see that antichrist he had a bow with no arrows just a teaching it's a doctrine he was given a crown and become a pope and he went forth killing the people to make them serve god isn't that something in other words he wrote a decree well let's kill everybody today in a cabinet that one went over right yeah but look how how's how it looked don't you think it's better to make people serve god than to let them die and go to hell what do you mean who are you you think you you don't want people to go to heaven we've given you a way to do it you kill them you say yeah but we wouldn't back there we don't know there's plenty of books go ahead and read if you can stomach and read fox's book of martyrs all the way through right and one day you surely got i mean one doing you surely got a good stomach i ain't never been able to make it through cut babies out of mama's dunk and throw them to them pigs to eat all in the name of religion strap them down with an ox pulling one way and one pulling the other way and just rip them to pieces if you're going to kill at least do it sensibly and nice you know cut the guy's stroke that's the easiest way to kill somebody they say on this side over here there's a big vein you just whack that one and you're dead at least be humane i was reading one time about taking a a metal chair and building a fire under it taking people's clothes off women take their clothes off and strip them down and pour stuff all over this foxy book of martyr and take them and make them set down on that red-hot chair but those brothers my brother tell them they're good people well okay right what about it so let's start reading just a little bit now we've read these a lot of these i'll give them over to you over to you over to you we'll keep on giving them over to you too i don't want you to get the point what i want you to see if nothing else to see the same rider riding on the same horse and remember the horse doesn't stop right the writer gets off the white horse gets on the red one the prophet said that white horse goes all the way and strikes eternity that antichrist spirit is still here now the same one that started in genesis but still you're deceiving the horse don't stop yeah it just keeps on going the red horse he rides in it gets off the red gets on the bus the red one just rides right on the black the pale it's the same writer satan he said you're against him people and good people i'm not against nobody i'm against the devil and his control that he had upon mankind through religion amen all right we didn't come here for freedom of religion america wasn't established on freedom of religion is that was established on freedom from religion we came here to get away from religion we get the things that bound there come right all over and binding here right but now it's done through as i said we laughed at the catholics saying we're going to pray for grandma out of purgatory but then we come up to say well i go to church in the baptist methodist whatever because mama win is good enough for a mom that's good enough for me you think we still don't have that same ideas that they had catholics will tell you give me a child that's five years old and i'll always remain a catholic right that's how stunts they believe i say the new birth will change it but see they're putting it on the bases that the message is bad this presbyterian pentecostal can't change it i'm just come on but you see church the antichrist is still deceiving amen and you know where he's at in the pulpit who do you think he's got all this started and brother the preacher well how do we know whether you're right or not well what does the word say amen that's all i got to say about it ain't going to argue with you about whether i know i'm a dodeo aggravating dude but there's one thing about it you know i don't try to pull nothing over on you either i tell you like it is then you're gonna have to face god for the way it is if not you come and show me in the bible where i'm off all right amen i'll be glad to tap a sign right up here and i'm a false prophet show it to the world on the biggest internet system can be found if you can show me in the words where i'm wrong let's start out let's get something because what we've tried to keep this point before you see god is father son and holy ghost but satan you gotta have antichrist false prophet incarnate false prophets that's what's saying it pope and then the beast all right now keeping those things before us to where we'll understand it you remember joel said the cankerworm polyworm locust and the caterpillar all right that's the same thing as your your go to what is it can't get worm palm worm looks like it's four stages of one bug right right the bug goes through the cocoon he comes out of this he winds up being a butterfly he wind up being this and you know and then he just goes right back and makes it circle again because it's that's his stages it's the same old bug well that's the way it is with with satan you couldn't start out in that first church and say i'm going to take place of god no that wouldn't work but you've got to get the people to believe it that's right that's right now the catholics don't believe now listen that the pope is god you know the god of heaven right they believe that he's instead of god or in god's stead or in the place of god i'm not throwing off on them i'm just telling their doctrine right they believe that he is taking the place of god and if god has to transmit down something to earth he can use the pope to do it and he's elected you know like i said wednesday you let god all those bishops and things and ain't just one guy running right they have a whole bunch of them and then they elect who's going to be the one that god can come down and incarnate but it's the same stage but see can't warn palmer locust caterpillar restoration of rivalry but what does god do justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and then the word that's right right man so he's fighting there's four horse riders in the book of revelation one through the first through the fourth seal these are forest rider on each one amen but there's also a combat beast yes sir right on each one that says come and see right now so look at it put it back up ready now go back to number one let me get to it he said i want you to notice the forward the mathematical one first antichrist white second false prophet red third parker of heaven and earth and purgatory black that's what we're gonna get onto today and the fourth is the beast hello horse satan being kicked out now that beast can't be until satan is kicked out of heaven that's right now if you think daniel's 70 weeks ain't important brother brown says you can't understand the seals unless you understand daniel 70 weeks okay now if you'll go to that book you'll find that he explains revelations 12 in the daniel 70 week's book that's one of the things you can't understand so you see now where you'd be this nice one is going to be this evening we get to it he's going to be kicked out of heaven right amen but you know the bible says right now he can go before god come on the book of job read it said where you been he said i've been going through and throwing the earth he's talking to god the devil is right you know a lot of times i can't get an audience with god but the devil can sit up and talk to him know that would make us all upset but instead of being upset i know what he's doing he's using that old boy that's right he's using him to bring me amen he used that old boy to bring job down and get job down to where he would get out of his own self-righteousness and look up to god no satan you just keep on talking to him tell him all about how this hateful arrogant old dude just tell them all about how bad i am but you see one day he's to be cast out right well you know what's going to cause him to be cast out well that's this afternoon when the bride goes up he's cast out see when we go up he can't stay i love that he ain't going to be able to step forward when we knew that won't work would you see one comment first antichrist why exactly false prophet read third bikers of heaven earth in purgatory black fourth is the beast all right now jump to the next one try to get these fights all right do we ride on damn this is taken from the first seal of progress 322. here he is it's the antichrist he started riding in the first church age they ride them down on damn through every age watching he's riding he doesn't stop he keeps riding he's riding that horse all right see coming down it's the same rider all the time number three white horse we've seen what he's done perfectly here comes the red horse we see exactly what he's done here comes the black horse you see the same writer all the time what's he doing right on down through the ages when they get what i was saying want to go he comes up riding that by horse he gets off that horse gets on a red one that white horse just keeps right on going through the deception he gets onto the red you look around the world today over the name of religion and see how many people's being killed over the name of religion and i know i'm an american i believe in it but we go to a country like afghanistan or some of those countries iraq we go there to free the people from bondage of their religion right exactly right right all right we free those women to where they don't have to wear the veils anymore we turn them loose and let them become prostitutes on the street yeah are we really good people or what are we doing all right come on we go to africa and free the people when brother run said he was over there and said not one case of a narrow disease he said before they marry they've got to take emergency tests oh we freed them to become prostitutes i don't think you got to put a black veil over your face and drag your tracks out with a dress no but i think you ought to look right and dress diesel i've always said true blind where's language a barber she said there she is sister we used to talk about these religious people i told her one day i said sister barbara same women they just got their face covered you know you can't tell me that the face covered with the veil and the law saying if you do this or that other thing kill you that don't change thinking that's right it's just a different veil still doing it maybe you're not doing it out and open but still doing the same thing listen the different stages of satan's ministry the writer is the same it does not say white writer red writer black writer pale writer doesn't say that the man's the same he's the devil but when the horse comes in it's the symbol of what he's doing quite righteous very deceiving red killing united what probably said church and state he couldn't go out killing the first pope didn't go out kill him had to wait until constantine united church and and state they could take the pilot because like i said you go down here now kill a bunch of people while they arrest you but if you get the people behind you they want to arrest you you get the government behind you come on see the point i want you to see is some of you are catching on to what i'm trying to say because what you're doing is we've talked i have with some of you in discussion but you're not looking back there you're beginning to look here where we are now now that's a good idea it don't matter to me what has been that don't control me it's what it is that's why i say that i'm against the biggest portion of the minister to this message because they're not preaching the prophet's mission that's right they're not preaching salvation they're preaching a book of rules that's right believing a prophet you don't believe the prophets you're going to die go to hell if you don't believe jesus christ you're going to die if you believe jesus christ you're going to automatically be his problem right because you can't deny his prophet right and say that jesus christ is true if it's god's prophet right now that sensible all right see i don't have any words about it but she looked and seeing what we're doing now can you still see that writer and there's still a deception right preachers will come in i've seen them and you have to they'll be just preaching alone going real good everything goes real good and all at once right out of nowhere for no uncall for a reason richard says about aaron he gets off his one rabbit trail onto another one that's what he said about you know brother i didn't say that because i believed it because it's pretty good about us preachers we'll be going sometime and we'll just take off and go like hell that's not too bad that's off on rabbit train you can come back right but what i'm talking about is these preachers when it ain't got nothing to do with their sermon whatsoever and right in the middle of it have you seen that great revelation about jude and taymor oh my how that judah had a relationship with tamar and it brought that seed right down it didn't have anything to do with his message right now but you see he planted his seed right that's it you ever sat on a jury yes exactly right when the lawyer gets up here and he says so what's those said so and so on the judge said that's your say you can't bring that up in court strike that from the record you can't strike it out of the brain it was the people that hurt it he got his point across he planted the seed right out of what he does again or just bam erase that from the records i think that is point across right now that's what the preachers are doing they preach real good and i don't want you to see him go and then he jumps back especially they do here sometimes craw brother one time was preaching away here and he said something and i was gone i wouldn't hear but i certainly heard about it because he was preaching away on something all that once the whole church went right and he said what's wrong he's i say something wrong i'll just tell you what the prophet said well he wasn't telling what the prophecy that's why everybody shut up on him you know they set out on me i'm glad you did right he let him know a whole lot more what if i'd have told him he's wrong but you see people get their point across just a little saying right then here comes the young preachers alone right and they're just preaching judah and tamar and just all these doctrines like crazy and you say something to them about it well i just preached it called brother so much i was preaching right exactly right now you've got a doctrine right doctrine and he said well danny right well who are you you think you know everything no but i know somebody does yeah but do you think you know everything see they're killing you then right why because you kill a man's influence right come on are we still in the seals the a man's influences to kill the man you go out and kill my influence with people now i've said it straight and i mean it straight if i'm wrong and you tell people i'm wrong you're okay but if i'm right and you tell people i'm wrong you got a problem with god that's insane see but you kill my influence you kill me come on trying to bring them down the seals and things down the sense of simplicity of us thinking amen and you go out and won't hear nothing else you'll be like cain was kane said paraphrasing what he said he said god i've done all i'm going to do it's what your prophet said he said take it or leave it can't he never repented all right so he was saying before almighty god i'm not going to change he went into a blackness it would never be removed from him amen that curse follows him and his descendants all the way through all right what effect i'm asking you and me a simple question what effect does doctrines and ideas have upon us right sure what about it what effect does doctrines and ideas have upon us have you ever let an idea get in your mind and then you wouldn't even go to church maybe lay out a while or do something because some idea he said brother dylan you're talking about me bro mold had a good point the military they had a thing you military guys noted and he was crawling around on the ground out there and they had this barbed wire and stuff and you crawled around on it they had a gun that was firing live ammunition and it was right up over your head you know it's no problem as long as you didn't stand up right because it wasn't see if i say something to you and it offends you why what's the problem i'm gonna ask you is it the truth well you didn't present it right when jesus said you are of your father the devil he wasn't presenting that too much right to them either was it the truth is true what kind of effect does doctrines and ideas have to do on the things you and i what you hear like i've always told you i say nothing to you about you ask me can i listen to brother so-and-so's tell you yes you're welcome to listen to anybody you want to when you bring that thing back in this church that's right and i hear somebody start talking about it right i'm going to approach it from the pulpit right right and i'm going to tell you that that doctrine has no place here and if you don't like it you leave with it right because i'm going to be playing i'll try to be honest with you to say listen to people but let the holy spirit what's wrong that's right all right this is online i don't get it off i guess what's the matter why can't the holy spirit keep us straight right you got the holy ghost and it can't keep you straight you mean the holy spirit can't keep this thing no straighter than what it all is you mean there's 969 different denominations in the world that's a long time ago yeah there's about 2 000 in this message and the holy spirit can't keep it straight right there's something wrong somewhere my language go hateful dude somebody ain't got the holy ghost right all right you got the holy ghost you can't turn the word down now when it's first presented you might not like it when it's first said you might not agree wholeheartedly but if that holy ghost is inside of you you will somewhere line back up with that word neither you or anybody because you can't argue with the holy ghost is inside of you you ever heard somebody preaching and you didn't know what it was you stopped making something wrong amen you did something wrong yeah okay we trust him right hey man why look at me the other day i just broke up she said what's better with you yeah dude something struck me i knew there's something wrong why can't we trust him amen i pray every day god lead me in the word that i might not turn away yes lord because i know if i turn away myself and let satan do it i'm lost and i'm going to hell for doing it there won't be no rewards i know that and i know also that i'm not only going by myself but i'm taking you with me you think they're in a burden you see that's why i am so arrogant and hateful but forgive me for that just look fast and say well really tried that old school teacher you read an old school teacher man they used to they just wear you out and you do something wrong but they didn't mind reaching getting you they didn't have to call home that's mom and dad if it's all right that's right that's the truth he knows when they send home words you got it you're gonna get it again wow why can't we see that in the gospel amen all right look why can't but listen church you remember what we were saying and i'll just do this go back through this one over this evening the same writer when it was once revealed to the prophet that that was the devil that antichrist he didn't say this the antichrist would say oh he just said antichrist no he said that was the devil in a deceptive form he knew that writer was not white and then right and then black and then pale he knew that it was the same old devil but it was different stages of his ministry the horse would signify the other things the boy and new arrows would signify the symbols right so he knew that that red horse rider was going to be telling him he knew that black horse rider is going to be the devil but as i told you they're on the second seal and it's on the third one he said i didn't know this until today you know what you know it was a devil oh he was a developer he didn't know the symbols what those symbols meant until that day he didn't see all of the seals unveiled with the first one but that's where i've always tried to get people to see it i asked you a question many many years ago i said which seal means the most to you some had the fourth don't have to feel somebody's sick someone just said what i see when that first seal broke to me then i had something i knew where i stood that's the most important seal of all is that first seal that's right once you see it's the antichrist then from then on it's just finding out what the symbols mean right amen right and what took place because it's already open to you he said well i like the four field six seven you don't know what they are if you don't go to the first come on i don't mind saying that that's right i've heard people preach the seals that way they just preach here and preach there but if that first seal don't break do you that's right you ain't gonna know what to sacrifice i'm sorry when it broke about the antichrist that prophet knew where he was standing in the end what he wanted was for god to speak each day and tell him the symbols right now when you get over to the fifth we're not going to get this probably for another couple of weeks but i've asked you to read you see a book you're supposed to be reading the third seal now and follow home by reading the fourth all right but when you get to the fifth seal there's no combat bit that's right but there's a key amen because there's a little phrase in that fourth seal that you better study on the combat beast on the four seals had come and see but that was not to calm that beast that screamed out touch not the oil and the wine that was god himself through the lamb i'm quoting brother brown maybe you'll get enough to go read it there's your key to why it's not a field six and seven why because god's come on the scene that's right if these seals don't bring god on the scene then what do we need the seals for everybody said well what do we need them for we don't need no i believe we need them but if it don't bring god on the scene we don't have them i'll just continue on this afternoon we'll make it part two of the third seal and move on from there but i hope you follow me for what i'm saying bring everything down here to where we're at the little deceiving ideas and thoughts that we have brother don't you think that brother has right believe what he wants to constitution says you can right the bible says no that's right show it to me in the bible you got to write believe what you want to do all right come on i'll put that thing around my next song false prophet bring it on show me this bible says it i can believe what i want to believe that's right eve said i think that's all she said wouldn't it come on and it caused all this death for her one little thought you think that we're going to go back with any of those talks what about it 539 response 39 to smartphone you might have any of the alters fear everybody me please is within me oh seeing ourselves we are me me me just think about it now i've got a word i want to say to you and i want you to take it correctly it's not just one sunday school class that we've had some problems with but the children not obeying and doing correctly and following the instructions back to them so now i'm saying to your parents don't think your goody little child is not guilty but you need to have a talk with your kids because sometimes kids get too smart for their own good we respect our elders we respect the teachers and the things that are here if not we will take you to your mother and father we see kids we do the best we can so you do the best you can you obey these people that are teaching you and don't argue back with them and fuss with them about something or ask them why is this and why is that just remember you're a child a teacher is a teacher so now i speak that in love to you children if things anymore we're going to just go to mom and daddy and have a little talk no you don't disrespect nobody school teachers even at school or whatever don't you do don't do it kids don't just don't don't fuss and argue with the school teacher yeah but that's wrong well that's part of your growing part of your growing period right they're doing the best they can they try but most of you won't do what i doing one day we got word something about terence there he was in the eighth grade principal sent home a report on the report i've read it and what did i understand it said check student's folder when i thought it meant he was in somebody else's folder looking around that was just what i thought it meant i called the principal and said i want to know he said no he said sam said i found out later said terence and this boy in his class it wasn't too bad what they were doing said probably shouldn't even come to the office but said these other boys was in bad shape and said they were really needed to be rebuked and said i put them all in together and rebuked them i said you're welcome thank you take care of them they need whipping you take care of it he said i wish all parents was like that but i can't do it i said yeah but the only thing i thought if he was doing something and he shouldn't have done looking in somebody else's material then i'd take care of it but you've taken care of it so if you have any more trouble let me know you see what most of your parents would do if principal called you up and told you you're kidding my kid don't dis don't like that you are to see that's as plain as i can say it absolutely yeah i know one thing kids are kids and no matter what they're going to be kids and some of you ought to remember where you come from because you was a kid at one time and you've done a lot of things don't think your kids are so goody goody okay there's the old dude that's all right you know it's all done in love and understanding father we thank you for this day and we pray that you would bless us and give us understanding of you and we ask that what we've said is worthy of have been said today if not erase it lord from our minds and our thoughts and let us dwell on one thing we're trying to see jesus christ revealed unto each and every one of us in our hearts and lives that we can walk in the day that we're living upon the earth and be what you want us to be because we are the ones that must be under that anointing in the end time that combats all of these things we can't let them get up on us we've got to stand out against it and be what you want us to be we love you we thank you be with everybody give us lord time do we rest and then come back this afternoon in jesus name you're this man me is uh oh me victory oh is\n"}, {"id":

each one remember the sick among us just let your light shine in our hearts as we read your word you come and you speak to us now in jesus name amen amen revelations 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand time to understand now let's go over to revelations six and we'll read verse seven and eight starting on the fourth seal and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that set on him was death and the hell followed with him power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to give the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've getting on over kind of in our studies and and uh you know talking on these things of the seals and things and just remember now what we've tried to bring and we won't get as much to it tonight but we'll the lord within sunday we will get on to trying to tie together some things but i'm trying to hold a point up for you to remember that uh the the seals they are to israel because they take place between revelation are in revelation 6 and then going on into revelations 8 1 for the seventh seal the literal things that take place there are to israel right now we don't want to be there when the sixth seal opens right we don't want to be there when the fifth field open we we don't want to be there for these we'll see sunday we certainly don't want to be there in the opening of the fourth seal when it would terminate in armageddon right so then the literal happening of the seals are to israel but the revealed word is to the bride of jesus christ all right now the revealing of the seals the bringing of the seals that's why you'd say well why did it come in our day because it would bring the mystery of redemption that's right amen and see god sent us a prophet as we'll get back to the end of the message this evening lord willing he sent us a prophet that we would be able to see what these mysteries are to be able to read them and the seals as we'll read one in a minute the probably said it shows what has been what is and what will be to come you know all right then we've studied so far and found out these seals even started back in genesis and worked their way all the way through the bible but the reality of those things the things that that you know the bringing forth of the things that we read under this is coming on over after we get out of here and it will be to israel but what a wonderful thing to be able to stand here and see it before it takes place that's right what about a people that we can stand here in the because of the message of the hour we can go all the way back to genesis and we can see what happened there all right amen we can come all the way through and see what's taking place and we can even go on past our time and see what will happen to israel right and go on to seeing the millennium and how it'll take place and seeing the future home and all of those things while we're still here on earth amen there's a lot of these things that we're speaking of see will be after we get out of here but we can see them while we're here i mean that's that's the part i've been trying to get across to you it's just it's been with me for 40 about 40 years and i've been trying to make that statement and it seems so hard for people because they'll say but but but brother dale i thought we got the seals we do by revelation we get the revelation of the word of god we don't get to tribulation right right right we don't go to the tribulation right but we know that what will take place right because it's been made known to us by the end time profit and that's what we want to we'll get down to the end in a little bit uh of understanding to see the point but we look at it and see the opening of the word right the word being open to you and i am and and you know that that to me is a wonderful thing when we i was talking with somebody there the other day and you know i told them i said you know it's so amazing how the bible is written amen you know it's written for every age that would ever be in the world martin luther could read the bible and he would understand things for his day and time right but he wouldn't understand what we understand but we better not come up with understanding something he didn't understand you know what i mean by the hat you know in other words he'd understand something and then we'd understand something entirely different then we're not talking about the things of his natural life and and the doings that he done we're talking about the message he brought the message of the just shall live by faith that is actually those who learn in revelations the the uh three angels coming across he's bringing it forth as the message upon the earth and what about a wonderful thing that we can stand here and agree with what martin luther said about the just shall live by faith right that's right and we don't have to deny that and we don't have to say as a lot of people in the message say well luther and western them didn't have nothing but if they didn't have nothing then we sure were what are we standing on you know right i mean but the bible is so beautiful and perfect but here we stand in the middle of it being the bride of jesus christ and can understand the whole the whole word of god all the way from the beginning to the ending that's right while we're still here and you know what that's going to do that in itself is going to change you and i to take us out of here see that's why it couldn't happen until the end time that's right we'll read in a minute we read ears about you know his name that said on him was death we'll see the prophet said even to the the line the ox the man even in those days they didn't understand it was dead right but he said it was death from the beginning right right it was death from the beginning but you see it's in the deception and that's what i want us not to do is to be deceived you know and get caught up in the deception of things and just kind of you know well brother dale that he he keeps on about the seals is the israel i've heard all my life they was to the bride well they are the revelation of it is to you and i we we even understand why throwing judgment you certainly don't want to go there do you no but we understand it well because it's been told to us through the opening of the word we see just get the point now of what we've been trying to say and we've been studying up through here and taking that it was the same rider on each one of the horses he changed but the writer the horse changed colors you know representing what would be in that time but it's the same writer the same devil being exposed by the word now i know people don't like me the way i talk but just get what i'm saying and you'll understand it the bible's not revealing the devil that's all right it's revealing jesus christ we just we've read that 37 times because this is the 37th message that i've read revelations 1 1-3 that's the revelation of jesus christ the bible is revealing jesus christ but by revealing christ to you and i it's exposing satan in his tactics and his ways so it's not revealing him he's not something that can be revealed god can be revealed but satan will one day become extinct and totally annihilated yes sir you agree with that the bible says he will well if that's true then how could it be a revelation the revelation of jesus christ is never ending it's exposing satan for what he is and the way he's deceived the people and you remember what we're bringing out sunday that white horse right it didn't just blow up and go out of existence get right on going right yes he got off and got on another horse ready he rode that horse through the bloodline got off to get on the black that red horse is just going right on through the black horse goes right on through and you'll see the reason that that i keep saying that because if that was not sold how would you wind up with the pale horse right because the pale horse would be the white the red the black all mixed together which is governmental powers religious powers and demon powers all mixed together and come out as a pale horse right i was thinking about that the other day and this i'll get back into the message with but we can see the red the black in the things you know the red being the blood and all of the killings and the 68 million being killed you know and more of that but didn't see the black horse to be the dark ages as it come down through you know in time the thousand years of where the the catholics ruled the world all right but then the thing about a pale horse why would it be in symbolic of a pale horse that gives us something to think about a pale horse yeah you say well you mix the white the red the black and you get pale okay all right you mix all of his powers together and you come out but i think it's got a whole lot of deeper meaning to it i believe it's pale because god is going to let us know how it's destroyed this beast will be destroyed this pale horse will be destroyed this system will eventually be destroyed that's right it was not destroyed down through time but it will be destroyed so it's not just stopping on a symbol of a killings or a dark age it's the payloads sickly pale horse it's death right because we'll get to it in a minute but you know death one day will be annihilated yes sir for everybody that's why it's pale i pray another day about i thought lord and i know the symbols and the things the prophet said but that's praying lord why did it wind up a pale i can understand the mixture of the the white the red pack you know and get your colors and whatever you want but why would it wind up paying the lord because you see he's going to destroy this seal is going to show us death right destroyed amen okay so now that's what i'm trying to get to so that maybe make you interested in listening for a while and read what the prophet has to say upon these things now i keep giving this quote back to you go ahead with number one brother anderson i keep bringing this one back because of the purpose that i want to be brought god's mathematics is three but satan's mathematics is four all right so what is he first antichrist white second false prophet red of heaven and earth in purgatory which is black and fourth the beast the pale horse and notice what he says this is the end of the message and i know this will probably be sunday morning but look what he says when he gets to the pale horse if you think we're going to be over there when the seals break you better start reading a lot right if you remember the daniel 70 weeks brother brown said you will miss the seals you'll miss the red dragon you'll miss the casting out and all of the things you'll miss revelations 12. so look what he says satan being kicked out of heaven amen now he goes into the fourth seal satan b-e-i-n-g right being kicked out of heaven right now we get over after a while in the message and read it we go up he comes down right amen we don't want to be there when that beast takes place but we are we've done this the rapture we're in the tribulation period and that's what i've tried to prove to you to show you then if we get time we'll get this scripture revelation 13. but notice when read around with bringing down the the course of the horses when it comes to the fourth the beast the pale horse satan being kicked out of heaven now what causes him to be kicked out of heaven okay so i said you might be interested to keep reading these things and when i keep bringing a quote over and over and over again you better believe that it's got a purpose behind it all right so i keep reading those things and i would go if i were you and i would read if if i don't get to it tonight i would read revelations the 12th chapter and he gives the 13th verse satan being kicked out of heaven then in 13 1-8 he is incarnate in the person of the beast all right when he's kicked out of heaven you remember what i've always told you you can't be the beast until we get out of here that's right right that's right you can't be the beast until you and i leave so maybe it'll start dawning on you that the singles and the literal happening when he's kicked out of heaven we better be the reason he's kicked out right right now because he's kicked out as we go up he is right what a wonderful thing to think about i didn't mean to go this way but that's all right god will allow him to come up there and talk with him right come on that's right he was talking to him in the book of job where have you been they should walk into and from the earth you got an audience with god would you show me where he's ever back in heaven when the bride gets tired so i begin to believe if i was you that maybe she might be and have a part of kicking him out sure i'd consider that point and let that ponder in your mind cause that's the way i do if you wonder how i get things or what comes you know i'll wake up in the night and i'll just be praying and laying there you know i'm just like everybody else and say well lord why is it a pale lord i can understand the white the black i'm the one the red the black but why don't you turn out to be a green or a purple or a yellow or something you're gonna find out we got something to do with this we got something to do with this just don't put us there when the thing starts taking place we're going to be in heaven when armageddon strikes here on earth if we're not in heaven when that happens you better believe you better find you a place to hide and hurry and it won't do you any good that's right that's right back on these things go ahead with number two we've used this a few times i want you to get the point paragraph 194. so i keep giving these backgrounds if you notice a lot of the sc folks the people are out there on the internet they they made some of them don't even have the books you know and brother reed told me years ago he said brother dale remember those people out there don't know what you all know try to back up and cover as much as you can he said i know it's hard to do but because they're watching and then when we get reports like i did the other day from that sister that she just took the message and just tied it together from some of the sermons i'd preached and brought it right down to what i'm talking about maybe she don't sleep you know whatever but listen watch rides a pale horse hurt 194 to four seal on his ride this last ride now there's not another right beast in the field sixth and seventh and there's not another combat beast in the fifth sixth and seventh amen now i'm not saying he won't satan won't be there because he's gonna be in a tribulation to be wiped out and all that i'm just saying there's not another form death is the highest you can go there is no other place to go death is it right there's no court of appeal after death i'm talking about the death of the soul to this right he's on his life right now this is not an hour day that will be on down right it's the seal foretold i'll get to that loading about sunday sometime coach see the church has done gone up when this happens amen and when he becomes the beast the church is done gone well okay now brother dale i agree with you on four five six seven five six film but we're here when the first the seal started in genesis come on and work this way all the way down through and it didn't start in the first church age it started in genesis right where i've been through it with cain and abel and the things prophets told us that the seven seals even spoke up from genesis as it's coming down right and you'll see all of these things as they're taking place is the seal foretold amen but but but i just don't understand because you always and we will read some more work the prophet said we go up revelation 4 1 not single 19 21 what about revelation 10 well what about it we don't have to be over there well revelation 10 you know in the days of the voice of the seventh day yeah and that's the seventh angel is the church age messenger to revelation 3 14. come on right seventh church aids messenger it's just like i've tried to tell you john's up here seeing all this he's writing it he's told to send it to the church read chapter one he's told to send it to the church right that's right he gets over to where he's at into revelations 10 and he's wondering how to work and i get this back to the church that's the key that's why i said it i've checked all of the translations as much as i've got a 26 to see if there was any you know discrepancy partner said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you look right back over and said seventh church agent saw that that would be a prophet that would come and get the word so he rejoices now everything's okay he can write all he wants to see that's what people they don't even think that's right right now we don't have no rights they're going to be christians we forfeited all of them right that's right we have no rights we gave up all of our rights to become christians well i'll tell you what i'm i'm just gonna believe what i want to believe well that's good for you go right here that's word that the people that don't get it you've done been told over and over you can goof off and play around and not believe it and you're going by the grave i'm not de-christianizing you say you're lost i'm just saying you're going by the grave i'll get to do your funeral or somebody will and i may be one of them but somebody will do mine because it's going to take somebody to stand there that's right and see death destroyed remote back by 19 and 60 what nah moving on about 70 anyway he made a statement he said brother dale we need to find out what death is because the only way you can destroy it to find out what it is that's right you know i mean you come up with a disease if they can't figure that disease out and find out what it is they can't hope and have any hopes of getting an antibiotic you know or antidote or whatever to right be able to conquer that right see church it's the day in the hour that we're living that we're wanting to go so fast and that's what everybody in the message want they want something new something every new thing that comes along they want to grab it and run with it well after a while it just runs down right right but somewhere there's a little bride just just taking it day by day and saying don't worry about it right you mean you're not worried brother they're worried yes because of us as human beings yeah we're worried about whether god will keep his word or not oh come on right amen i mean what we've seen in our day and then worry about whether god's going to keep his word right i'm only something wrong with your mentality revelation that's right he will keep his word even said he would send the headstone not upon our merits yeah right that's right but because he promised it right right oh but we're just gonna get goody-goody and get good goodies we go to goody goody until one day we're going goody writing rapture well keep good and all you want to do there's gonna be somebody that stands on the word we'll see death destroyed and you're going to have to be able to laugh at it while it's taking you and carrying you down you know getting old you know what i mean great higher right old age you know right i can well remember when i had a lot darker hair and a lot more of it and a lot of you had some real blackheart see that's death right that's right we're gonna find out what death is one day and it will be annihilated well i know what death is your heart quits beating your heart quits beating that just starts you over on the other side right death is the death of the soul all right that's what i'm trying to get us to see these seals is revealing death but why is it doing it by revealing life life is being revealed you know life you know the internet out there i got my southern way l-i-f-e you know i can't help it and i ain't gonna change it why because i can't go to school and learn how to talk properly so get you a dictionary and an old southern one and if not rightly and i'll tell you what i mean l-i-f-e life is what destroys death right right yes sir the only thing that can the revealed word is you don't think destroy death all right watch as we get on into it but what did we read there he said this rider rides on down he's on his lights right now the beast you know the pale horse and he says now that is not in our day that's right that will be on down it's the seal foretold because see the church has done gone up when this happens watch it now paragraph 202 number three on your notes the second seal look what it says but now in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate revelations 12 13 through there the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what i mean he's incarnate in his people then he's got his people bound by his power the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and be down by it now what does he call believing a lie being damned by denying the word with a form of godliness right right you know that's that that's what's all in churches out there they got i wouldn't go that far stick around a little closer if i just you said they're denying the word no they ain't even never heard it right but look what he says the devil just in a time after christ no satan incarnates himself a type after christ not a type of christ happen after christ following christ if you look back above it you'll see what the key of the whole thing god works his place in the trinity justification incarnate himself in the people with the baptism of the holy ghost when that is fully completed we become the word make flesh and walk off of this earth because of that satan can become the beast because he doesn't know how to do it now right he watches god and followers live stream he doesn't run before he follows live stream who wants so what does it do now look at the next one people would wonder you know i keep reading a lot of these things and you wonder a lot but as it dawned on you yet the reason we go up is we're not going to go through the tribulation that's right that's simple but my language didn't it i have 164 questions and answers i'm 62 now watch it 0 5 27 62. now someone wrote me here not long ago and asked and he said if you do not believe that the church goes through the tribulation period how about revelations 13 how they overcome by the blood of the lamb and their testimony i'm like hey brother around the scripture it looks like it looks like the church is gonna have to go through to be able to be overcome by the blood of the lamb but remember israel must overcome by the blood of the lamb even though she's in the tribulation right but the person asked that question i wonder do you realize that the first three chapters of revelation deals with the church in the church age that's the tribulation period now he's going back up here to answer this right that's the tribulation period not the church age the church raptures and goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation never comes back again until the 19th chapter when it comes with jesus that's right that's in the tribulation period not nothing to do with the church at all after we leave out of here this thing goes into the tribulation period right right okay i'm going to the next this is the feast of the trophies paragraph 36 the three chapter first three chapters in the book of revelation revealed all the happenings unto the church then from the third chapter unto the 19th chapter of revelation there is no more scene in the church the church goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation and returns back at the 19th chapter of revelation the bride and the groom together coming to the earth then from that 19th chapter to the conclusion of the 22nd chapter it's all on the millennium and what will be in the year that is to follow during the 4th of the 19th god is dealing with israel is that enough that's right 4 to the 19th god's dealing with israel yep well what about the fifth foot remember the fifth chapter is in heaven after the rapture while israel is getting the tribulation i just got through preaching on it right sure look at the next one i grab 87 on the fifth seal but the reason it reveals it and i understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the antichrist being revealed notice where does that feel sealed right and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right they're away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and does not return until it comes back with the king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be from genesis to revelation we're going to get to it the minute where the prophet was coming back to preach on what the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end you saw it the bible called it a beast didn't it right his he called that back in the garden the beast seeing that was to be for the church he was revealed by these seals and now watch what takes it see the church age was revealed by the scene but we're not dire the seals are going to israel right now i got the one in here with bro around there asking a question this is the first sealed first thessalonians said yes many times right on over to the last day but church are you listening see then that puts it to work we don't have to go through the triple s right right we're the bride of christ we get the revelation of everything we don't have to go through the tribulation so watch what takes place now go ahead number four you notice there was three a b and c so let's take on it now what's he talking this is back in the second seal now the first he become an antichrist and it couldn't be antichrist only in spirit you become an antichrist in that spiritual command that taught the same thing that the antichrist spirit was doing and then you become a false prophet to the antichrist spirit now what about a man in an organization that's what you said i don't know what you think about it but all right can i inject one right there and that word organization can be in the people around this message right okay said if your pastor won't stay with a word get away from your pastor that's his words you need it right of course busting up churches brother dale nope right doing it like it is amen god's the one that's doing the busting look now finally he becomes a beast now wait we'll get into that after a while see all right and if satan's trinity lace like that satan all the time that's the point when you get satan all the time satan antichrist spirit satan and dry spirit incarnate false prophet who is at satan into a prophets of people preaching their lives and then he becomes the beast they when not a demon that was in that antichrist that's it and what's it but when satan himself he said well now what's he saying that was a demon that was in them false prophets right the bible tells you this read what he's saying he's saying the beast is not a demon come on satan handed out spirit antichrist spirit incarnate false prophet then becomes a basic when not a demon that was in that antichrist that's not what the beast is but when satan himself is kicked out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was where was that in the prophets you remember the other day i talked about it they just elected a a guy over all of them made my pope where the devil was the devil then the devil is incarnate of a man just repeating itself all right sticking next now you remember whatever said it that demon that was in that false prophet is not that beast right that beast is satan that demon was satan yes is one of satan's demons but when it comes to the beast it's the head man the beast is the devil himself because he's kicked out of heaven what we just read after we get out of here watch what he says paragraph 105 for seal and when the laminate open the fourth seal let's stop there now the four seal now who opened it the lamb was anybody else worthy no one else could do it no the lamb opened the fourth seal now get the point and you'll separate the eagle from the lamb the lamb opened the fourth seal you remember in the third seal it was not the combat beast of the third combat beast that said a measure wheat for a penny and a minute of barley touch not the oil and wine that was the lamb himself you remember sunday all right see what's your prophecy the lamb opened the fourth seal and the the fourth beast the living creature like an eagle an hershey key said to john come and see what the fourth mystery right are you reading that all right amen are you reading where i got my finger can you see it from over there i'll they can see it he's not talking about the devil the plan of redemption is not redeeming the devil right man he's not being revealed he's being exposed what available the fourth mystery come on i'm just asking a simple question because what he's saying what is the fourth mystery amen of the plan of redemption come on church was you listening want to go right if we could ever find out how to destroy death it's going to take the fourth mystery to do it and it can only come by the eagle that's right yes sir none of the other ages could call him death right we'll get to that in a minute i'm going to do it sunday one the living creature like an eagle said to john come see what the fourth mystery of the planet redemption has been hid in this book because the lamb was opening it in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here that's what the the combat beast is telling us the lamb is opening it bringing it down there's a forward mystery here i've showed you in symbol well you just see a symbol of the pale art remember in them symbols there's a lot of difference in what you think right go into the opposition of those symbols which we haven't done which we will do probably the next week or so we'll just preach a message of all the way through up to where we are and take both sides but we've been just dealing up until this message dealing with basically speaking about the antichrist false prophet pope etc exposing him but take the symbols of the horse amen in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here i showed you in symbol and john i don't know whether you've understood it or not but he wrote down what he saw but it was a mystery so he wrote what he saw the lamb was breaking the seals and god still wasn't going to reveal it it was left for the last days that's right he was not going to reveal these seals until this day that's right the lies come back because that's basically what you're doing your mind i know it because mine done that until the lord began to break it away and help me to see it you're just looking at seals like a white horse and just finding out what that is right and you get all your symbols you get that down and you say well we got it and then you get a red horse and you say well we that's what we see the red horse and all the symbols we got it then you get a black one and you just see the symbols and we got it now we've come to a secret mystery under the fourth one amen to see that it's revealing jesus christ there's a statement brother man made one day and i've been looking i know i found one but it's close but he said we've talked enough about him what the devil right there we've talked enough about the devil you know the people of this message and i know i'm getting off of them mexican getting down to meddling but the people of this message are glorifying the devil that's what i'm trying to expose that's right amen glorifying the devil come on folks wake up there's some sitting here that know i know what i'm fixing to say and won't say much but you go join up with a certain group and they'll tell they first started out that it had to be a one supreme being now it's only dealing with a supreme being after you go so far it turns from looking at things to magic and you wind up worshiping the devil as your worshipful master okay but you see how easy and deceiving it is we had one brother that when i and i'm not against all of that i don't talk about those things we had one brother and he'd come to him and he said they lied to me i said i didn't beat on him in the hammer about it there's some sitting here i've never said a word to you but he couldn't he said they lied to me it's okay you found it out you found it out true sets you free okay but remember the lamb opened the fourth seal and the fourth living creature like an eagle now you've got an opportunity to be able to see the plan of redemption amen not that it wasn't dire on the others but they were not dealing with that they were dealing with the spirit of the age which was to sacrifice and to hang on and do the best they could and to live for jesus christ even though they died just for saying they were christians read foxy book of martyrs but you see waiting a time that we could understand the prophet unless brother richard wilson was last night waiting for a time that it could be comprehended that's it you know there's no need of god opening this in the first church age there was no need to open it in the second third fourth fifth and sixth there was no need of it because we couldn't comprehend them we're having trouble now right now because of the carnality of our mind and we want to keep rolling back but we're brotherly operating the seals for the bride i got quote quote yeah but are you going to deny the quotes where it says here to israel all right amen that's right and you are going to be in bad shape to think that we're going to be there when the fourth seal opens in armageddon terrible shape to think we're going to be there in the tribulation period no no no we don't believe that but we just don't want we just don't believe what you're talking about i thought i was reading it did i did i lose something somewhere i mean that's why i have page after page i thought i was reading it i thought i was reading what the prophet said that's right yeah but you're just putting it together that's what a brother told me one time he said you ain't nothing but a good baptist he said all you can do is just put the word together in the letter i just screamed that didn't bother me at all i said why did you change your mind he said brother i didn't think you had anything other than a new birth and it was nothing but this was his words he said when god spoke to you about that manifestation of spirits i knew the animal was right okay because that's what people think when they get over the romans you know in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god they think manifest goes out and call for rain and call for this and call for that all that that's wonderful but what about where it says making known right right manifest is to make known right your prophet came to make these things known that's why he was an eagle all right a wonderful position i hope we get down far enough to be able to cover it look at the next one parker at 158. now remember when we just read said it was a mystery the fourth seal is a mystery but then there's a mystery rejection because there was a mystery about the fourth seal it was you know it's just exposing the devil okay then when we find out his mystery here in his church and state the fourth stage of his ministry he's called the beast first he's called the antichrist and it's called false prophet and he's called the beast now we find him here being called as the beast and i want you to notice that after the fourth horse and then this fourth that's to want you to notice that's after the fourth quarter and in this fourth horse if you'll notice all the first one was white and then the next one was red the next one black and the fourth one all of these other three were represented in it is what makes it tail to because pale is red and white and so mixed together see he it's he's all mixed in this one horse and there he becomes four are actually the three and one he was all mixed up in that one thing mixing amen now we're gonna read in a second what he mixes history powers heaven earth purgatory heaven earth and purgatory when he gets a mix together it's going to bring death but we'll find out it was death all alone you know but now what's his other three political power religious power and demon power right when you mix them together what have you got yeah amen that's right right pale horse okay go ahead to the next 136. this is off the power transformation raced in 1965 10 31 the morning when i go home this time i'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and trail him right through the bible and show how he's how he heads up see you all get that on the telephone so if the lord permits it he's going to come and do it the coming of this fellow well now beast at the beginning beast at the end where they're just like judas and jesus they're both brothers in their tribe just like he saw in jacob you know and the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin in this great warfare that we're in the next one trying to do god of service without his will that being god's will america 37 i'm preaching i wouldn't preach it in brother jack's church he'd tell me go ahead and do it but i'm going to the tabernacle it'll be about four hours long and my subject is the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of a serpent see it takes about four hours i got my scriptures all laid out the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden he's the beast at the end and show how he's a religious person and a denomination that made the denomination and come right through the trail of it and prove it to you by the scripture that it is i didn't know that till the holy spirit gave it to me the other day up there that's one of the things of people who believe in the return ministry i believe brother brown has got to come back and preach the trail of the serpent that's one of their thinkings that's fine that's alright i have no problem not told you where i stand but listen you mix up all them colors look to the next now we're back on the fourth seal i got 195. when christ appears here on earth as its fellow appears and becomes completely completely the devil from the head cross all the way down the false prophet into the beast the devil himself and he's riding on a pale horse covered all up and mixed with all kinds of colors to make him pale and deadly right all right pale and deadly going to the next one alright 197 the fourth seal notice the antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color horse is a beast that represents the power his power is all mixed up why it's political it's national powers it's religious powers it's demon powers okay it's all kind of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse was he just got all kind of power do you remember what i was showing you that he couldn't be when it was an antichrist of the spirit he didn't have a crown he had to wait and become a pope well that'd be a pope that connected the government together so constantine brought the government in and that's why they could get bible killing 68 million because the government okay but when jesus comes it's on a one-colored solid colored horse this one mixes the colors of red white black three colors in one represented in one and three powers represented in one white horse a black horse red horse and three crowns in one triple ruling crown over heaven earth and purgatory right come on look at the next thing this is paragraph 310 more sealed and here they're joining themselves together coming to that show down to armageddon i'm not gonna touch armageddon tonight period so don't get your thought running into armageddon we're coming up to that place we will do with that sunday sometime or some sunday let's go down to armageddon and riding on the mixed-colored horse with one horse of white one horse of red one horse of black the three different political of political power spiritual power control but demon powers which is the antichrist mixing that all together you've got a pale sickly looking thing he's right now now here is where our fear comes in and makes us think the wrong thing the bible speaks of the devil there's a man laying in a ditch with no power he's like a drunk that's laying in a ditch the bible describes a map we'll go back to scripture if you need it let's see we're afraid of him we're afraid that he may be powerful more than we think right why would you be afraid of him yeah but look what he's done to people i agree right but you know yourself most others because people volunteering that's right when you take the governments and the things like we've got them today and the government can control everything you're right back to the same situation where they can kill you and they just erase your name right now from all records by just the blood of your name and goes off the computer and you no longer exist and you'll not be able to buy ourselves right that's never been until now never being that the mark of the beast could be made manifest until now those are not jabbers those are facts you can take your name off a record right now and you no longer exist you can go in hard scream all you want to you don't exist look at it sickly looking thing he's riding on sure don't look like a powerful horse does it no that's right so you're looking at it as thinking as some kind of great powerful horse this demon power political power spiritual powers demon powers that's where our trouble is we're looking at them like they have a power the way you're talking they're going to get you brother dale they won't get me until god's through with that that goes out there for them to listen to as well as anything until god gets through with me and if he ain't through with me i got a lot of scripture to stand on when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up the standard man no i think it's wise to be sensible right yeah okay sickly looking thing he's riding on why why did it get up here where you got the white as a great powerful deceptive you've got the red that they could kill by the millions you got the black that represents your dark ages that brought around said no telling how many billion was killed spiritually right right why would it now show him as a pale sickly oh that's just the way it looks i'm glad you said that that's what i'm talking about right the symbol of that seal is a sickly situation that you and i should not have any fear of yeah but look what they can do they can't do nothing till god gets through with it that's right right he didn't worry about that at all why would it call him a horse because now he's come down he looked like he's got everything in the world under his control right political powers even to the their heaven or in purgatory that he's ruler over you can pray them out of hell or bring them out of purgatory do all kind of things got the government behind him and all the political maneuvers amen god says by the eagle you hear me god said by the eagle come and see he's going to show you what this stuff is and how it's going to wind up and be destroyed instead of satan gaining power you think he's got everything in control he's got the governments he's got the religious he's got everything in his control what does that matter right what are you afraid of that's right what are you afraid of jerk i'm serious right a sickly pale looking horse by the eagle that says he has no power by the eagle that tells you what he is the equal contact skip the next one go to number 12. try to cut out a little let's go to 12 click it over questions next you're going to see 63 324 morning service program 199. brother brown does the fur does the first horse rider now listen to him real careful fulfilled second thessalonians the revelation of the man of sin yes that's right that does that easy that does that's the man of sin this same man just keeps in in stages riding on until he gets on a pale horse that's called death christ comes down through justification to the white horse and that's to get life are you listening now he went from seal one to four return a statement from one seal first seal to the fourth seal all together in that one statement that's why they took sealed or not you and i when that man of sin sits in the temple of god to be as god that is the beast which is satan incarnate that's when satan has been cast out because we go up right and he will be here as the devil incarnate and he's called death we'll jump these and go on hang on the smith and i'll give you his number but on program 155 he said he was antichrist he said he was deaf to begin with he's deaf to begin with go to prayer go to number 14. all right 182 the fourth seal now we find out here that this is satan after being kicked out of heaven you'll see why he's sickly he thinks he's got everything under his control amen but he's fixing to be defeated that's right you know why because if we done god up he's already defeated we're going to defeat him here right that's right not in the physical battle right right that's where people ever since i've been in this message minister sat right here and was having a minister to me one day but i always thought we'd come back with him and fight on that revelation 19. i said five you mean we are supernatural eternal beings to fight natural people you just you know he didn't say no more listen church if we don't defeat the devil israel don't have an opportunity this revealed word is going to make it all right here we go all right please now he now he is a beast and a antichrist fox prophet now beast and given the name of death and hell follows him fully satan on this throne now that's after the rapture then we go up because he's kicked out remember he's kicked out because we were on the earth he's satan rep satan he's saving representatives on the earth now he that he now is head of the kingdom of the world the first thing kingdoms we offer to the lord jesus in matthew 4 satan now becomes a full king now this happens later on he's false prophet now he will come become beast after a while when he breaks his covenant there with the jews you know how we've been through that now there's how you understand you down on 70 weeks he breaks his covenant with the israel going to the next one paragraph 192 nobody's satan fully only strong yes sir offered it to god you talk about the world offered it to our lord he is sitting here with his beastly heart in him snake incarnate the devil in a man to become incarnate he's got a beastly heart don't get into that what's his heart over here what did it hurt was it down here you've got a beastly heart not a gizzard now here is the person the beast the incarnate devil he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false prince of the true word oh he associates himself with the word yep that's right are you ready amen when he's cast out he don't come down say i'm the devil no no that's three and a half years of tribulation and then he breaks his covenant with israel at the end of three and a half years until that time he's the good old boy then according to the book of daniel that makes craft to prosper makes all of the things then he comes in like flattery he's a wonderful superman guy under the false pretense one of the true word right in other words they tell me you just got the word he's the one who said john he associated himself with the word and he can call fire down out of heaven that's right amen is that right is that the book of revelation he can do things why because he's satan incarnate we see the little bride's done gone lord my wife was saying the other day on the daniel stephanie see the only people battling him is not the natural jew they're the covenant with him right the only ones that's battling him is 144 000 when they're telling them that ain't right and this boy over here saying get even get rid of them get off take care of that you know what they do they take care of that they kill them then they find out you're done wrong it's going to be chaos to the natural israel right okay his death let's go a little further let me just get this quit off right here i'm gonna go any further we're going too far america two team watch christ first coming he comes immortal to bleed and die is that right that's his first coming the second coming is the rapture we made it undiscovered immortal his third coming he's the incarnate god amen god emmanuel to reign on earth that's right only three okay so satan is following after him becoming incarnate and you and i for a rapture to come then he followers with the beast being incarnate and saying he's god right but you see we've done gone four stages of the writer the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternally separated that's what god calls him and i'll just fold that over and we'll start it right there sunday we know the combat beats the eagle is the one that called him death but what is this if we take into account the last two things we were reading of how that god becomes incarnate in the people in the word and satan becomes incarnate in his people after we get out of here then we should consider one thing i'll review this sunday but why does it say in revelation 6 verse 7-8 verse 8. it doesn't say his name is dead it said it was dead brother brown said his name is death now i want to end in just a minute or something you see what brother dale death is not a name yeah when the bible says it is the prophet says it is i don't care what your english vocabulary thinks about it but i'll remind you in your english vocabulary little now i'm real good in english but i do know how to read a noun is a name of a person place or what or thing so death is a thing it's not a person it's not a place it's a thing you see we look at it we want names laid upon things according to revelation 19 that writer has a name on him which is the word of god you're waking up right loretta says that is jesus i got all that time we know that we know he's his word but just remember he's just as much god when it says jesus he's just as much god when it says in the beginning was the word word god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us brother said translate that now this is his wording he said in the beginning what was elohim he said elohim was with god and elohim was god and elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us well elohim then it's a name right the word forgive me the word is a thing now you really stepped over because the word is a person that's right and it was placed before the foundation of the world and become a thing i want you ashamed to call the word a thing i remember brother years ago we were talking about something and then the bible calls the holy ghost and it you know that you want me to get scripture right the bible calls the holy ghost in it and he didn't like that translation whatsoever he was dogmatic against that part of saying the holy ghost was an idiot i never had no problem with it i didn't have enough education to figure it out i just read it citizen here and i knew what that idea was don't you all right right i've been under the bed this morning thank you now brother said a theologian will turn to this theology every time you have people in this message that are turning and i know one did because he said he did did he relied upon a theologian to help him understand i do too he's one called the holy spirit and he had a man to bring it down called william brown to bring it unto me so if you can see that death is a thing that's a name if you can see that then you can see the word is a person it's jesus christ you don't have to rewrite the bible just understand the mechanical side of it we get to it sunday it took the eagle to name it death the others looked at it as a deceptive form of different things and couldn't follow it true as even john on batman's admired that church until he found that all that was in her was death death is not dying you know hearts quit beating oh they did oh that soul lives on no matter whether you're sinner or saint that soul lives on until a time because only god can kill a soul that's right satan can't kill one amen he can blow you to pieces brother ray but he can't kill you he just puts you in the other side death is a name it's a personification of satan because the word is a person which is a personification of almighty god back on these things sickly pale horse oh it reads er that he had power to do this and that because he had all the governments and everything in the world but he's got no power over the bride of jesus christ right i remember drawing out for some brothers one time at a meeting we were having we were talking about how that gets over to the end and what happens with israel and i asked the question of who was fighting and by this quote to the prophet and the scripture i took out a position everybody even the two witnesses are killed before armageddon well who's fighting well that's where everybody will bless god we'll come back riding on him horses and we're just going to sword we're just going to kill we're just going to cut people you can see what kind of a demon spirit they've got right a supernatural person sitting on a supernatural horse to battle natural people with an army tank all you gotta do that's gone but when i draw it down i drove it out and you know what's left the last was two witnesses left standing on the earth i said but the bible says they're killed right that's right now who's going to fight it then brother the bible says out of the mouth of those two prophets will come the word of god that will annihilate the enemy it will be the word that will destroy satan ain't gonna be no physical battle that's not what everybody read the bible says michael in revelation 12 michael and all fought in heaven and they throw him out like michael and jesus was just slugging it out boy they just fighting gabriel whatever like a physical force satan just brought his powers up and jesus standing there as michael because that's where satan could never understand it he says can i you have no more right here that's right all right there wasn't no physical fighting that's right there's no fighting now christ is in charge as long as he's in charge what are we afraid of amen but enemy could destroy us why can't we at least be like israel now right now we're standing the whole world and we americans are patting around trying to sit somewhere in the world to keep them and keep giving away their land and typing them into it to try to have peace and they say give us but we'll blow the whole thing up they can take it all down they're sitting on the center of the earth why would they say we have the sampson effect you afraid of their bombs what would be the samson effect what if they know exactly where they're sitting and they know to put off a bomb under the earth right there will bring the whole thing to total annihilation remember the pyramid of egypt chiops is sitting in the center of the earth come on church what are we afraid of all right that's all i'm trying to get you to look at we're looking at a pail we look at the red we look at them we see the power they have but now look at this you said it's got all the powers but what good is those powers you know we preach back are the satan has no power only what god permits him to use that's right are you afraid of any country or any thing brother i'm afraid of dying well then you need to be saved that's right that's the best way to get rid of the free of dying right now let's stand together let him be on our side michael on our side we don't have to worry about nothing do it he'll take care of it anybody have a need your altar is open let's sing and worship and think about it but what he's doing for us even the symbol of the seal is not a powerful looking something it's a weak sickly probably didn't lose it believe it just as mixings the bible tells you sickly looking he's defeated right sure we got a battle of armageddon but it's a spiritual battle what's going on now we'll get down to that we'll see death destroyed amen somebody is right and why can't we be where are we 97 lord jesus consensus anybody have a need what do you is thank is jesus yes is foreign is satisfaction oh thank you is most of you know that the donny didn't have been taking care of andy's kids and things and you know we've been praying hoping they would work out things and maybe that ricky could get straightened out and do things it don't look like it's working out now they're set to the place that they can go to court now and the children can be theirs and maybe they'll get them totally free i mean they will could not they wouldn't fool with it they can get everything free but still it's something to think about when you gotta take three children and raise them everything is your own so they just want us to pray that god will work out everything for perfect will for what he wants that's right they're willing to do their part it may mean a lot of things but i just want what would we all do when you're faced with a thing of knowing that the children don't have a hoax whatsoever nowhere else what are you going to do let's all pray let's all believe just like we would like we would dedicate a baby that we have let's say this whole church is dedicated now to raise that baby you know give a life before it and things well let's just put this into the hands of the lord amen and believe that god will work it all out for his honor and glory and that whatever comes out of it it'll be his honor it'll be his his doings because we're going to believe it that way that's right everything so they're willing to give up the children give them full control so that's as long as they'll do that that i wouldn't go no other way hardly but you still couldn't close your home to a child and not take care of it those little kids are wonderful little kids that's right let's just pray on it lord jesus as a church of the living god we come before you this night with heavy hearts in many ways because we know and realize these children have no hopes without donnie and susan but no one also lowered that taking on the family and raising us a lot of burdens and heartaches but we know that it can all be wonderful if we just leave it in your hands and let you take care of it lord you just touched the children and that's donnie and susan and everything lord you work out everything but there'll be a lot of financial things in it raising kids lord just help bless and take care of everything but just have brother donahue sister susan to have the right attitude in their hearts that whatever comes with this will come for your honor and glory all be made manifest for you lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen we're going to believe everything will be alright it'll all be worked out all right anybody else will just have a need before we go here there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon jesus didn't have one more oh we shall see the king we shall see is night of jesus christ we shall see the king we shall see coming soon one more time before we go we shall see the king we shall see the king we shall see the kingdom oh jesus said he she can handle this thing now the kingdom around this world we shall see the kingdoms pieces you\n"}, {"id": 23924, "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2013-01-04 - 11-0821pm -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShU-blUBEE\n========================================\n\nthat's right I know we all know why we're here and this is special time for me and this should be my first one so that's this stuff it's just the right time right play that's it right time roughly if you wanna y'all know you don't have your Bible because you turn chapter six of six of Romans Paul is explaining what Jesus was telling the people when he said be baptized this is what I believe because what he says here watch this he says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound in other words why are we continuing on in this saying that we're that we're doing he said God forbid in other words let's do something about it and that's what we're doing brother Chris is finally he's doing something about it amen we all come to a point like I said today we come to a point to where the word was lit in her heart and we started enjoying the things of God instead of the things of the world God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein in other words how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein first thing I want to do get in the water get baptized I wanted a new name they'll talk about a new name we're fixing to give brother Chris a new name right he's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ that's right can we believe that right that's what he's going to be we baptized our brother Chris in the name keep taking on your name right we're gonna have a burial here today we're gonna put somebody to death know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death he's still asking the question therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like his Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life or if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death go down planted we're going to plant him all right and once you're going to come back up as not the same dead person right but what but we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin if your old husband's dead you marry again but your husband's got to be dead you can't just divorce him you put a lot of we put like we said we put a lot of like take a lot of dry centers and just make them wet Center what'd they do they just hung they just hung their ideas up in a closet somewhere but if there's a real killing if there's a real death then we marry again that's who we're married we're married to Christ is that correct now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ's being raised from the dead dies no more death has no more dominion over him what was I saying today she is him so we need to read the scripture for us all right death had no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once we don't have to every time we stand we don't have to go be baptized we're not Roman Catholics we don't have to pay tenants if there's a real death today we won't have to bury brother Chris again right right he buried once Jesus Christ died once wrong all right so now likewise reckon we also we also that we also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord amen that's the scripture death burial Resurrection the newness of life not be dead again we didn't come back we're not we're not going this far to die again you die one time you're dead let's don't resurrect the old people again the old you the one we're talking about today let's let's when we put when we put him in the ground he's not going to die physically but you know what it's better to die spiritually and come up in the newness of life right than to really be dead naturally because if you're dead spiritual you'd be walking around alive remember the Bible says why is a woman dead while she living she's had other husbands she's done things wrong she's she's well she's alive she's dead so let's don't be that way and a woman's a time for giving out of the church right but if she's divorced she can't married but now she's if her husband's dead she can marry again and we're him and guess what we're going to take our brother we're going to baptize him in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to bring him up a new man man you may not see it right off when he comes up he's just gonna look a little wet but Betty when I come up out of that water it was like I had everything when I come up it just emptied all out and I became a new creature a new creation God's gonna do a creation here that's why I said if you're baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right let's don't just take that script and say well now we went to board of baptism now let's go now they're combined they're together I think they're together right that's scriptures together right you get a promise that if you'll do this this is available for you for both Chris little dick leaves himself oh who will come and go with me I am Bound for the promise this is going to start the journey right here so this is where the Journey's moving in really to fulfill the commission told him to go into all the world preach the gospel and baptize in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost to fulfill that Great Commission we baptize our brother Chris and In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah we're here to help anybody else foreign Lift us up Lord Jesus for your word is we've come today to bigger fitting with your words and baptize our brother in your name yes walk with him Lord as your word said that I love that National fatherhood that you wrote there in Acts it was just for me because that's the only light I had to hold on that's right bro amen father God it was enough and then patient was sending it to me and bringing me to this place and today bringing brother Chris yeah scored it now that he can walk into this alive she almost received a gift just continue walking brother Chris and and receive that gift because the gift is yours that's right amen eternal life walk on into it I asked you Lord let's continue sending your word to us and most of all father send your understanding yes give us your faith give us your mind Lord that we know these things because we can't do this without you do it for us brother and we just present ourselves before you father and ask you just to have your way with us we ask these things in your precious name and bless the bride around the world right here at home real partial too thank you Father God it seem to ask your name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen in this man\n"}, {"id": 23925, "text":

emma said i feel so little to go and stand behind a place where to have a pastor like y'all got you know have to try to follow him and preach i said man i feel so little but i said maybe if i brag on the same one to keep frags on maybe we can be all right you know praise the lord so that's what we're here for tonight to brag on him a little bit amen and just let you know that i love him praise the lord i know you love him praise god but we're just going to get right into the words here a little bit tonight and and just read just a little bit off you got your bibles like to turn over here i believe revelations the third chapter and uh about the 18th verse we want to talk a little bit here about a little strange thing called maybe the title of it about the advice of my side other night this is kind of a strange thing but it come to me and i was just frilled in my spirit uh wake up i never thought about this never really got into it but it's a revelation the third chapter in about the 18th verse you know i want to read just a little bit praise the lord and i'll let you be seated he said i canceled thee to buy of me gold tried in the farm and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes with eyesight that i may see and just think about this as many as i loved i'll rebuke and chase them these zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and sup with him and he with me does that sound good that's just our head father we thank you again tonight lord jesus for letting us come and gather here tonight with our precious family lord that you have chosen before the foundation of the earth lord our hearts are just filled with joy tonight to look out and see these precious hungry souls oh god and your little body that's gathered together lord to come into the unity of your faith father lord we just feel so little tonight to be here god to stand here behind this sacred death lord to where your servant stands lord and father that's been called into this gospel lord into this teaching and preaching of it lord to help the souls of your people lord to be matured father the lord we ask tonight that you'll help me lord to just help me get out of the way lord and father that your word could have preamps in our lives tonight god is lord that we may be able to say something lord to just say a word that will encourage this little body to be stronger lord father we'll give you all the glory and praise and we thank you for it tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated we'd like to talk on this just a little bit and i was kind of going through this the other night i woke up about two o'clock in the morning i was telling my brother never had really thought much about this little uh scripture here but you know it's just the spirit of god just kind of run it through me and it got better and better and i thought man there's a lot to do with it's a lifestyle you know because it does something for you and i just got to say lord just let me just rub it all over me anyway you know it's good for a gator if you can just get the meaning of it and i'm sure the prophet of god uh got a little taste of this you know and he really really put it in his eyes and you know i believe that god really let him be anointed with he did praise the lord and i believe tonight if god's little bride can get just make sure that we've got this rubs in our eyes real good you know and inner years and all over us you know it's good for you it just goes plumb down in your heart this is something you know they got different uh uh medicine and stuff you know it's they'll give it to you and it'll just go all through your body you know stop all the pains and you know it kind of does a great thing you take a aspen of something that's you know you're hurting any you take a aspen maybe a head or something about your body and you take that little aspen it just goes to work don't it it goes down circulates through your bloodstream and gets down in earth to where your pain's at where your suffering's in and i was thinking about this uh the other night as i was thinking about this i saved i said lord i know i got something quite a few years ago and you know it's still working today praise the lord amen and it just gets better and better you know it's just it goes all the way through you know it just it gets the moving on every part and you know it's it's good for you praise the lord i know we used to have a lot on side back when i was young you know mama and make some and it gets some i guess from different places and and you know it was good for different things you know different things about your body and sores and different things but here i believe god is referring to something else you know just like kind of like the little woman that was at the well that time when uh you know when jesus happened to be there at the time that she walked up you know and she needed something she praised the lord amen and kind like that water was you know god had to uh kind of get her attention he started off kind of the natural things but he had a spiritual meaning for her you know you know she had to find out what the water is talking about this she had to get a little taste of it you know she had a desire and had to get to a place that she that she uh when god kind of searched the heart out a little bit you know and found out a little bit about her i believe he's still doing that tonight amen i believe that the holy spirit is still the same yesterday then forever and i believe god is still the same you know i a lot of times i preach it or a little church down in lincoln i don't have to worry because well if i had a congregation like this i'd kind of be obscured to say some of the things i said but sometimes i get kind of rough you know i think well boy we just ain't got too many to pick on and i just get a big old thing in my soul sometime and i just try to put it all on them i guess felt like it man was one time he had plenty of said i got plenty of hay on the fort but you can't feed it all to one person okay you know you got to kind of take it easy on them so i just like uh me i i kind of have to look around and i ain't got a little handful so i can't hurt them too bad and they got news to me but here you know when you go out somewhere i incredible minister i've been asked that a lot of people ask me to come different places but i just you know i feel so little i just say oh my i might want to feel like that but i just don't feel like i'm qualified to speak to some of the people i just listened to some of these brothers talk here before service say amen one of them especially and just listen to him i said man i need to hear him pray praise the lord he knows about these things you know and you know you just find yourself sometime but you about you're learning you know thank god for that eyesight amen hallelujah it's a goodness to a place you know that we can or get our understanding open right i mean to say that he's talking about but it gets when you put it on your eyes it kind of opens up your eyes if you understand right and it goes all the way through down to your heart and everywhere you know it'll it'll make everything just line up praise god amen hallelujah don't take much of it you know you don't have to put it on the other day it should get a little of it i told a brother here i said backyard back in 70s i believe it was or maybe right there somewhere but god give me some of it i got some of it and i'll tell you when i did it started opening up my understanding i could see better you know like we sang your old song amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me before i found out that that scythe will open up all this amazing grace to you thank god it'll begin to open up thanks to you from one place to look it begins to show you things amen that's god has got in your head sometimes you know i found out that when i thought i used to know everything about god and all about him but after i got to looking in the scriptures and things and listened to him and especially when i heard the prophet of god i found out that i i just really had the anointing but i didn't have any understanding you know we used to have a backyard we come up these mountains up here we owned up in little hills up here and we only thing we don't we thought were boy when you got saved all you need to do is just really just get to northern you know just get really make sure you got to north and you know i knew it was good right i mean we still need that tonight though i tell you i believe sometimes we a lot of people thanks you know we just kind of don't need the anointing but we do we need that holy spirit we need god's holy ghost inside of us don't we it needs to be our leader it needs to be our teacher and uh for a while but when i got acquainted with the message i want to tell this tonight just give a little bit of my testimony and uh and then we'll forget i used to be up here i guess back forth a lot of y'all ever uh was here at the church back many years ago brother moats and brother dale i guess thank brother dale just kind of got hanging on me and i believe you just you got a little taste of this but you know what uh i've come up and i used to be with him a lot in a little building here and boy it was a blessing i couldn't hear we'd be coming up the road been some of the brothers and what was amazing about it we'd be on the same message that our brother would preach right we'd we'd be fellowshipping on the same thing coming up the road brother colleen knows about it we'd uh when we come here brother moses everyone who was here we pray and i'll tell you what that'd be open up to the bible right to where where is it talking about right before it was because we had to grow in god we had to know something about the lord jesus christ you know and and when it opened up that scripture that morning teaching or at night whenever we was here i s which listen you know cause god was speaking to us right sometimes we don't take it for granted like we should that god sometimes through the teaching of god's word and and as god's uh minister begins to you know bring it to us and begin to feed it because we ain't careful it's so easy and so simp and simplistic you know we've missed some of it that's right but oh i remember back then when we'd have our own heart and uh oh brother won't see it get up here and uh and kind of it seemed like god just tell him what to say you know because that's what her heart was crying for was hungry for something like the little lady come to the whale she really didn't understand what she was there for but before she left there she knows what she come for she found what she come for brother god sees us before we ever really get to him you know before we get our understanding open he's got a way of getting us to something ain't he praise the lord amen but we're not aware of what you see just like the scriptures that's why i believe he said search the scriptures for in them we think we have eternal life and he said these are they didn't testify with me not right you know what probably easy it was easy for me back then because i had tried to keep the anointing on my life i'd do everything i could brother to go without food you can't tell that now but back back then you know you could you know i i'd go and pray and i got it on a little film showing it to some friends of theirs the other night back up here in the mountains where i used to spend a lot of days and prayer and you know and stay back in them woods and talk to god and god would come down and just make itself real tell me in the spirit you know but i didn't have no education much i didn't have known very much but i learned about him you know right hey man i'd rather really that's the greatest education you really get right because if he can ever get you in him he can let take care of the rest of his i didn't know hardly how to read couldn't explain my words too good still can't but yes god was helping me you know he's kind of getting a place to where he could teach me amen amen and i i know uh brother gable i believe was give me some little notes here and thanks that brother dale had been teaching on up here at the church here fall back and boy i've been i was getting in there and catching some little nuggets you know and just to eating on them boy it's good for you praise the lord i'm telling you when god's got somebody that can get in here and bring out little nuggets for you and place them in here where you can see them and hear them and you know and just get the taste of them i tell you it'll do you good praise lord it does something good for you just like this i say you know he said if you buy this or or just get to ignore your eyes you know and one of these days you'll see that it's understanding to you that's right i mean it begins don't move stuff until you it goes down in here you know it's got something to do with that amazing grace hey praise god hallelujah i once was blind but now i see amen you know that's the way god is beginning he showed me these things but he began to open my eyes you know to more truth and more life because it's a time i couldn't walk in it you know i couldn't put my life in it i couldn't place myself in and i know you you probably walked in the same pathway praise the lord but there's a time that you just didn't have what you got now amen i mean you knew god probably maybe was blessed by it right but today you were able to stand you know just like a little child when he's a growing up he he wants to do what his daddy his father wants his daddy does he wants to do the things he does he wants to walk in him and work in them and do what he wants to do but yet he has to learn these things you know it's a time that god has got to let us grow into a place that we'll learn to be solid and be walking in him praise the lord because we don't walk in him like we should you know at the beginning we have we think maybe we do it's just slightly i didn't want nobody much to tell me about god because i thought the boy had all i need you know i didn't need much yet but brother i found out that there's a lot about him i just didn't know him amen and old peter one time you know i was i was thinking about him where he was telling the lord when he found out that that jesus was gonna be delivered over to hands of man to be crucified and you know that was a sad thing you know peter said tell him he said kind of rebuking the lord what lord i don't never say nothing like it don't ever meet you nothing like that how you know jesus turned around he said satan get behind me cause you don't really know what i'm trying to say to you you know what was that's kind of rebuke wasn't it it's kind of a rebuke to i mean that was kind of hard because it would be hard today you know somebody just get up and say well let's try to do the best we can and somebody come along god sent them servant of god along or something he just say well listen you you just need to sit down and listen hurt your feelings a little bit you know because we thought we knowed everything you know but i i just i just like that you know he done me i believe like he did on peter i think he maybe he didn't just speak the words to me but in one sense it was just like that he said satan just get behind me you need to listen you know right and i thought about that i said oh my i thought i knew about everything you know i knew how to pray i knew how to let the holy spirit speak through me oh i just thought the boy is i got everything i'm ready to go to heaven now and you know i i i was really i guess if god would have took me on right now and i'd believe out of me right but you know i had to do some growing and listening and just getting more settled you know right i was just a little child i thought well man if daddy had put me out there on this car i'd erect and kill myself you know i wanted to drive a car and i wanted to do what he wanted me to but i just want matured enough i just didn't understand these things because i know the first time i got in a car and tried to grind i like to tour the transmission up you know they don't scratch stick things and let my clutch out too faster and then try to stop it without pushing the clutch in you know that thing was a hard thing to learn how to do something so i thought about just like that you know to get back to the word of god that's about the way i was in the words you know i just didn't know how to do things i didn't know how to handle myself and i didn't know how to get other people to see the truth about god's word come on if i just always stayed in this shout you know it's still a bit of shot and still wanting to know that right that's right you know because we're still being going on and just having a great time because we've all like felt like a boy if you could just speak in tongues and prophesy and dancing the spirit you know and just oh it was good you know right but you never get into the knowledge of the truth like that amen i mean you can shout because they people still shout in the day they still prophesying still having great emotions and still don't know god dude i feel his spirit but they don't really know come on brother i imagine these uh pharisees and sadducees back there you know when jesus come on the scene you know and come amongst them and walking with him and you know trying to explain thanks to him i guess he thought this was a bad church full of people how can these people be so ignorant you know how could they believe what moses said why couldn't they believe what these old prophets uh prophesied back through the scriptures you know about the coming of the lord and now i'm here and they don't even know me that's right said he come to his own his own didn't even know it didn't receive him did he you know it's sad for it to be like that you know and it would have happened here in our generation if god had done something to us come on if god hadn't got this i said to us tonight and somehow another opening you know if he had to let this uh revelation of god get to us brother and sister we'd have still been carried away with all kind of ideals and opinions but and things in the spirit we want to know which way to go you know it's hard today to deal with people i've been meeting a lot of people here lately and uh some of them uh inspectors or some big churches and been having kind of little discussions with them about things and god's letting me find favor with some of them but i tell you what they look at me and say well how do you know these things you know i said well it's only takes god you have to see how god's leading you to know things you know i mean if you can't see yourself in the word and see yourself before as god has predestinated you don't place you in the word you'll never be able to go nowhere with god you've got to see your predestination don't you you got to see your calling you got to recognize what god's called you for amen what he's purposed yet and how he's placed you in here praise the lord i mean we just think somebody's just hatched out you know god had us in his mind wig that came before the foundation of the earth he's and he's been up bringing us through all this eating through the jeans and bringing us on up here you know to hear in the last days he's kind of manifested what we are that's right if he can ever get us to see a picture who we are you know and recognize who we are in him praise god then i'll tell you what we're going to have a revival brother praise god hallelujah here little grab this brother say here not long ago he said this won't have a revival he said you know i got to thinking about that he said you know how we're going to have a revival he said man we need to find out that we are the revival amen praise god that's a difference hey it ain't just getting a big crowd of people together you know and having a good singing and having a good uh thing but it's when we really see who we are and what we're doing and how we're fulfilling the purpose of god listen i'll tell you what it gets rich in a sense you begin to see where you came from and where you're going to hallelujah you know i want to see where i came from don't you i know it's good to be under i guess old he and a little wall and you know scratch around in some of the earthly things we all fulfill that purpose i guess but oh i believe god's trying to get us to lift up our wings now don't you i believe he's trying to get us to hear his voice hallelujah i believe that mother eagle that great eagle has come and screamed out to us amen i was preaching here a while back on elijah i said how elisha was a father elijah and i said you know when you go to reading this and finding all the things that elijah was in and how had gotten used to him found through the scriptures to uh to give to minister to people and give life to the people i said you know we ain't got but one source today i said we ain't got but one way to get through into life today and that's through this message amen voice of god that's the only way we're going to get there hallelujah i know we started off i believe god poured out his spirit upon all flesh and i believe everybody has had the privilege or had the opportunity of being filled with the spirit amen or getting the baptism of it i mean that you under you could just used to have revivals brother brown and all the old servants of god back counter they had great revivals that i mean far i know a lot of them i could call their names you probably know them but they had revivals they had outpourings of the spirit you know but really they hadn't become the revival no money come on you know it's different than having a outpouring of the spirit when god pours his spirit up on all flesh you know and you know what i that what really got a hold of my heart i was telling my brother here before service how did god let me get a hold of a message one time about the anointed ones at the end time because i was a kind of men my wife and we used to be at a lot of pentecostal meetings and over the different ministers and different brothers and always having great meetings and revivals and what we thought was revivals but it didn't last long you know i mean you can get healed every day and still be lost like a brother tell me he said you know a sinners you know i'll tell you what god heals sinners and everybody though you don't have to be a real holy ghost-filled person to get healed right man you can build me to start in the country and be still be healed listen that's what had me kind of blinded because i i saw this going on across the country you know and and i it got me a place i really didn't know what kind of revival to look for man i just i didn't know what to do you know but i was trying to stay with everything that i thought was moving on in god and i just got into i thought prosperity and and all this stuff you know i thought boy if you just give god a hundred dollars you'll be a millionaire you know he'll give you a new cadillac and a nice new home and all this stuff but i found that that didn't work too good you know if you give it to god it might work but i was giving most of mine to the preachers you know as well as it get rich it wasn't what the lord didn't need that you know i found that out a little later on down in my life you know because i'd give a lot of money away to kind of you know i just thought god's gonna just bless me like that i might able to get blessed you know and god saw my little weak ignorant ways but i i've done all i could i was doing all i could you know to get in the program and get in what i needed to thought that i i wanted to get to heaven i wanted to get as many people as i could in and but i going act the wrong way you know god is he's got to get us around these things sometimes and get us to show us where he's leading us to though that's kind of like peter was he thought boy i got a i know god how could you say that this thing's gonna happen to you hey could you do these things he said don't even say that because he saw so many miracles and so many banks happening all these great explosions and god the dead rays and the blind the sea and the crippled walk and he just couldn't accept this you know he said man how can a man like this going to be tucked in the hands of people to be crucified or or he took away how could this thing happen he didn't realize that was what he was doing it party he just hadn't come to the understanding to see it this was a plan of god you know amen if he hadn't done that there wouldn't have been no hope for peter would would have been no hope for you and me you know but god had to let this happen but out without understanding what he was saying he said he looked around at old peter he said satan just get behind that mean peter was a devil but he just had his mind on the wrong motive did he you know it's kind of hard for us to see that sometime because a lot of times that we we got to get our mind focused in the right pattern that when the right moment you praise the lord because that's what god had to do to me because i didn't understand these things about the water baptism and all these things god had the mysteries of god and different things about how god was to reveal himself to me i just didn't have this inside of him my thinking wasn't like that you know but god had to get around to this he had to have a way to bring me around to it he just didn't cram it all in at one time but i was in little services uh for wherever i'd go god would let me get into some of them so i got in one toughing for a while and that was my brother ned allison i don't know anybody knows him at all boy he was a real hard teacher he just about tell me he'd say satan get behind him you know because i disargued with him and i he tell me boy you just said you know you well after 63 years you couldn't really see what god was really doing you know and i just couldn't accept that i thought man i needed i had gone away back younger you know i said i told him i said you might not know brother but i know you know but he has kind of showed me something you know that i didn't understand because i had never come to the water baptism 1972 and this is when god open again don't mess up to me a big snow was on the ground about this time too you know well if you don't get in there when god wants you to he'll he'll get you in his way but there's a big snow about 17 inches deeper there's never been a snow like that in augusta georgie but i'll tell y'all sitting at the table when god began to that good old last night went to work amen thank god my understanding began to open up to the scripture praise the lord i began to read i said oh god i've never really been buried in you lord i've never really had that experience you know i've been baptized in water and i thought it was a great thing back then it was you know and i believe if i went on back then like i believe like broadband told that brother that time he's worried about his daddy got a pole and hadn't been baptized you know but brother brown said listen don't you worry about it he'll be there bless him because he knew that down the road that that man would have if he'd lived i'm no of those saints if they have been here tonight if they have been living right here and hearing this good teaching of the word of god that you and i've got god give us that i believe that i said amen to the word praise the lord amen i believe better tuck it because they some of them wanted to really serve god some of them their whole heart was to to be in the will of god you know and live the life of the lord jesus christ them never will forget i sit in there at the table and that big old snow i didn't know brother ned ivis and brother glenn doyle and i'm at that time we're sitting there and reading and praying and somebody gave me the tape of brother brown i mean that really quickened to me and i said lord i need to call somebody i need to find out if there's anybody can baptize us to name the lord jesus christ boy i called up somebody told me about this little fellow said he come out of the church of god and they turned him out and said that he's got a little church back here somewhere in this house and said i know he believes like that you know and i will forget that and him and brother that i was having a service during this house so i called him in that snow i said surely ain't nobody crazy enough to they think we are crazy now you don't call them in this time of get cold and the snow about ain't ain't you still on the ground and i called him up he said brother you ready to go you know i guess i was kind of hoping he'd say wait in the sunshine but he said yes brother said right now he said that prophet said when you see these things you know you better get there as fast as you can so boy i know that i saw it hey man i couldn't sit still i wasn't i'd lost my alpha type for everything else and i had to get in this praise god i told my wife i said honey you ready to go of course she didn't know what to think about this because she hadn't really been quicker to her yet but yet she said well listen said if it says that and we see this we better go man they got us somewhere old brotherhood iverson brother doyle took us a way back there somewhere in the south line of the pond we i tell you we got everybody's attention everybody was coming down the road stopped and got out of their cars they thought was sure crazy now getting down in that water in that pond in the snow but brother i'll tell you what after god i believe that with some of that eyesight amen come on amen hallelujah when i never will forget when we got down in that water that day and they had burned us in the precious name the lord jesus christ you know i went back and started reading my bible and everything's a little bit different amen praise god these things begin to open up the door begin to open praise the lord and god let me walk in you know just walk right in that door and he began to come in tell me praise god and sup women take his up in my life amen brother then it wasn't hard to walk and it wasn't hard to listen come from it on you know i've been hearing him ever since then thank god hallelujah uh just like a on down and a little further along you get the reading things and little mysteries begin to come forth in the word of god and you learn more about him don't you you know even jesus itself learn don't be his dick praise god and i'll tell you what if he had to we got to learn today god's got to learn the spanx we got to let these things get down inside of us and begin to live you know let it begin to take a hold in us hallelujah amen didn't you begin to see yourself acting like he acted amy that's what was so strange to me when i got to seeing the scriptures opened up hear the voice of god begin to talk to me begin to show me things i begin to turn my old bible back through the pages and i see them things god just seemed like he's walking right out of it right in my soul amen amen brother the bible said the word killer but the spirit gives you life hallelujah and i uh boy what really got me one time when i found out that he said the helmet and earth will pass away but my word will always be here right i said man we need to quit trying to get to heaven no he said david's gonna pass away i said what are we gonna do now you know i was kind of confused about that brother hallelujah i said now if heavens and earth's gonna pass away where else could we go to i found out that he wants us to get in his word don't amen man let this word get settled in her spirit in her heart because that's him that's right i tell you what i i have a little my little family sometimes i have to i get rough with them i know i about believe in the word of god you know sometimes we get sick you know and we forget to i don't want the word a bit not a fact to me and you know sometimes if we ain't careful this whole thing will get to a place we've heard it so much and handle it so much you know and and heard somebody explain it and tell us about it that sometimes it just gets to be a form foreign amen more than a life you know right you know i see people today i i it hurts me sometimes when we go a lot of the used to go to a lot of the meetings where they had the big crowds of people in the message you know but i'd listen to the ministers and a lot of times they got to where they got off on little issues or something would argue about the word of god and you know kind of pull something maybe on somebody or get somebody to agree with what they're saying i said that just don't sound too good you know and i got to place to where i kind of losing my appetite to go to some of the conventions the last things i see in but you know i said how could if a devil can candy's gonna separate every little body of christ he's gonna he's gonna cause little things to happen and kill the fellowship out and kill out the love that we need for god you know but i'll tell you what if we ever get in love with him you'll love everybody amen praise god you just can't hit i've been loving this brother here now ever since i met my way back out of when i god opened up my eyes and got me to going the right way and brother dale and them i just got in my soul i can't help from loving them brother hey man we might not all be the getter but they somedays there's a bounding in there there's a love in there amen just bonding us together you know thank god it's real hallelujah it's something that's keeping us and it's making us look over sometimes we might not all wear the same kind of clothes or maybe drive the same kind of car and some might not live in the same kind of house but we gotta love our praise god that all of it belongs to one another amen i used to i think but boy you know i found out where the bible said not to covet you know you see some of the brothers seem like they're just blessed better than he was and you know you just thought it's awfully easy to cover that amen i found out boy i just need to get probably a little closer to him amen and i i found out that you know if you get the covenants and fangs and god certainly want us to do that because like a brother told me down here tonight he said you know i've never seen one of god's children beg for breakfast something wrong with them if they do anything because god's gonna look after his own ain't right i know we all get down sometime we didn't got our things maybe that we need and i guess god's got a purpose for that maybe we didn't go through some hard times we won't know how to help other people to go through it but always sometimes i know maybe we don't get have good jobs like when could need or somebody blessed us we got it blessed but we want to be thankful for every little thing with god praise god because there ain't going to be no little use and big eyes in god listen you might not think that you got as much of this but you just as real as they are amen praise god hallelujah if god's called us and placed us in the kingdom of god and we're part of him brother and sister you're going to be just as great as anybody praise god i've learned that i wanted to be more of a servant than you know than anything right you know what a lot of times we we don't realize that being a servant is about the best thing we could be right you know every a lot of people wants to be the one that's you know that maybe it's the head but listen i just love to be a servant if i could you know praise god just to help somebody you know if i could just help the least of god's children help them to see the word of god help them to understand more about the lord jesus christ and more about the faith of god it does me more good than anything that's better than having riches or anything to give me praise god and whatever god wants you to have i'll guarantee you'll have it praise the lord brother ain't going to give you something you don't need on it he's going to give you just exactly what you need he knows some of us is not able maybe to to handle things like others somebody a lot of people they know how to handle things you know gordon others do i guess if i had just everything i just give it out and you don't want to have nothing left praise god because i've always felt like brother branham you know he didn't much much in this world i mean he they tried to build him big houses want to put him in a place where his having a guard at the gates and things he said how could i want something like that that's right i don't that desire or nothing like that he said i don't have to have a place to where the children of god when they need prayer for sickness and need something from god they have to go through some kind of a guard or some kind of a thing to get to me he said i don't want that but he could have done that couldn't i mean that people would give him anything they offered to give him a million dollars and give him a new car maybe every year some kind of a big cadillac or something right in or he said how could i want something like that he said how would i feel when i go down the road and see the little old precious mother that's been over an old wash tub on a washboard or scrubbing he said how would i feel have a urchin some kind of a fella to drive me around this big cadillac and you know i was in some meetings one time on the saviors and i heard this preacher they got the preaching prosperity and they take up offense and wash tubs i mean i saw him fill up a wash tub full of philharmonic blessing and you don't got to preach it if you'd give to god and pull people and give everything they had you know just put all the hat in thinking that this was god you know then that preacher get up and you say i won't let my mother even let my dogs live in y'all's house i thought oh god how could people make a statement like that brother who would want something like that anybody that could even see it all or know that that wouldn't be god but people was deceived with things like that you know they was hindered and a lot of poor people they're not even serving god today because of things that was brought out to them like that a lot of them turned back you know a lot of them turned away from the leadership that they did have and never did get back right with god i know a lot of them that done it because they just felt like oh god if you don't care more about me than that then lord i don't need the certainty but see that ain't god god cures for you praise the lord and i tell you what i know you'll prosper god said if you would serve me and you don't believe in when you do that he said thou would above all things you prosper and be in hell praise the lord i believe god will do that part of you anyway i believe he'll give you help and i believe he'll prosper you and i mean he's gonna give you all the world's richest in here because he knows that you don't need him doesn't it i mean you just don't need but just watch him get violent man get unpacked from this world you know if he loved the world and the things of the world he said the love of god is not even in you i'm not packing up to get up there i'm gonna get unpacked that i can't go there praise the lord because these things is weights to us amen all this little stuff i tell you you have to pay taxes only if you have a thousand acres you're gonna have to pay taxes on you got a big home maybe a mansion or something you're gonna have to pay taxes on so there ain't no way around there darty you're gonna have to this thing's gonna hold on you i mean the devil he can cause you to prosper too if you didn't like he tried to get jesus to fall for that didn't he right he tried his best to get him to use a little bit his power you know to just perform a few miracles and he done that on preachers and boy they failed for it that's true i mean over the country if you just go back and get them in your mind you see where many of them fell for that it didn't take much showing them boy they just went right into it didn't it i mean they learned that you could have these riches and get it you know rob god's people and take from them you know and and well maybe not all together god's people because god's people don't get wise enough to not fall for that stuff after all amen it might take a little bit more this i say but we'll listen he'll finally he'll get her understanding open on it praise god god when you give to god and stand behind the word of god and and use it like god tells you to you'll be blessed amen brother god's gonna bless you everywhere you go hallelujah i was a preacher the other night on the where jesus well under sunday morning i believe it was week before last about jesus when that blind man was sorry you know when jesus spit up on the ground and took some of that old uh clay and mixed it up with that spit a little bit put it on his eyes you know what he told him said you just go down that pool way then i see it you know and just wash your eyes and you'll be all right it don't take much to get a miracle if you want one does it right just believe him praise god just take what he says and you know i've been i thought i was bringing it out tomorrow and i said listen when you need something from god if you'll be willing to take what it gives you i mean it might not be the best thing that you think that you'd like to have but when god gives you something take it praise the lord believe it amen i'll tell you sometimes it might be a rebuking or something but if you'll take that god will do something for you hallelujah it's hard to take rebuking sometimes hey i mean it's hard to get corrected sometimes it's always been hard for me back when i was little it was hard to get corrected you know but i thought that was a horrible thing to have to get corrected but sometimes you know we because we may be not seeing things or not growing like we should or getting in a position we need to be in sometimes god corrects us don't us and he'll he'll give us a little whip and you know he'll let us see that where are we at you know praise the lord if it wasn't for that we wouldn't know where we that but god sometimes has to do that praise the lord because i was thinking about the the little eagles how did they cut some used to their nest you know that good furry nest and softness in it how nice it was to jump the good soft nest and boy wasn't my mother's eagle and father eagle they know what to do dude that's right man they got tournaments just jumping in there and when they get out and do his work you know so what they do they just pulled the fur out and let him jump on the thorns a few times oh i'll tell you what that got his attention that's the way god has to do sometimes his little body you know he has to pull that fur out you know praise the lord i tell you what my it's like my girls some of my will get to preaching so hard against sin and you know the whirly boys and things that sat here in the world and now that's uh just stop living right you know we just get to preaching so hard against it sometimes and they wonder if they're going to ever get married you know some of them got up to about 30 years old and still haven't gotten married yet but you know what i believe we want to wait till the right one comes along amen i believe we need to wait praise god i'll tell you god's got that little part of the other part for you if you don't get him here you'll have him over there if you don't get her here she'll be over there for you god's got one for every person you know he's got plenty enough to go around some of them today satisfied with one they just get four or five you know but listen brother and sister i believe we were to build oneness don't you thank god i always believed in oneness amen and i believe it's yeah i believe that god's just gonna let us have one hallelujah i i know sometimes if we ain't careful we'll get the devil and get us different ideals and get things happening and this stuff we're leaving in a time when all this stuff is coming right up to the in here because we'll manifest manifesting time it's time for everything and all this stuff that we're going through now we're going through pressures in the world and all of us are piling up right here at the end time talking to a little brother down there yesterday i believe it was no preacher he said brother i've been trying to preach here for the last six months or something like that he said i've been seeing what's happening right here at the end time amongst the bride you know how these things are getting uh to us you know and we don't even see what's happening we don't understand that god is trying to get us redeemed you know instead of that we're getting bound down with things i didn't understand what he was talking about right and then but i know that they different doctrines and things are going on empty i mean all kinds of things are happening it ain't god it's you know the devil gets the offer of confusion amongst the people sometimes and he'll cause us to get uh ideal or about something that the prophet may be mentioned or or something other that he didn't you know he didn't say it's the same the lord and thanks and you know different subjects and we try to build something around it you know if we ain't careful we'll build a big old fence or a barn and we'll pull a lot of people into it but if it takes away the love and fellowship from our brothers and fans we better leave it along i don't believe that god wants nobody to build a barn and get our big fence and put a city you know and that's what happened to the nomination i looked under that i i listened sometimes i just had the radio list this little station over here in south carolina has some good singing and i mean every preacher comes on and got a different name a different denominational name i thought oh my he tell us something i never thought i'd seen that amongst the baptist people yeah i mean the pentecost as you expect anything but dad i never could because there's always more solids you seem like about what they're seeing what they belong to but you know what they had i bet you on that one station and during the day you'd hear probably a different hundred ministers that comes on there and everyone's got a different name for their churches i thought oh my you know what think about all these things that's happening and it's about like that about monk sobriety i mean amongst the message people because it's got different little ideas and different opinions you know different things of saying well this is the way it is and that kind of got me heard about some of the meetings we used to have the big meetings and i for a while i backed off and i just plumb quit going to any of the beats convention meetings i just and some of the fellowship not the fellowship but the minister's meetings because of little subjects coming up and i didn't see i mean i know we need to know what we're doing god don't want no ignorant people if you're eating it he'll get us give us some wisdom on it amen and i i feel needed that myself but you know just different things that comes up and and like like oh brother homer said is that the church here a few weeks ago he said brother he said i don't want nobody sheep but mine so if you think i'll come here to steal your sheep he said you got the wrong idea he said i can't pastor nobody's but mine amen i thought now boy that's good and praise god hallelujah but you know it ain't like that this we had one or two leave our church here lately one space sleeping with us a good fall but he i guess he might have told the truth he said i have a little brother he said brother collins just ain't preaching deep in that fart i thought i was preaching everything i know you know and uh he said these think hearted deep enough and i said well oh my made me kind of feel ashamed of myself i said lord please get me where i need to be god let me rise up to that place that i need to be but one person i can get in let me get that in you know if it's my wife you know i sure want to be able to get her in and i said lord if i can't feed nobody with her and just god if you've called me to be a minister and call me to to be a pastor lord please let me get to the place that i need to be right you know what nasa but i pray all the time i say oh god i said i might not be able to explain things like other people might not be able to get my message together like them but i i got to i got to where i get these little books out you know and i'd use them yeah man i'll tell you i don't believe you want something to clack dust do you that's right i get them out of hammer service i get them and i'll when i preach it i've got to find something you know as i read the little taxi cup then i i get my bible here and i kind of bring it out the word of god then a lot of times if i i'll read what he says about it because that's what we need to hear i'll tell you when elijah god raised him up here to get us in to bring a message to us we better listen to what he says right brother i'll tell you it better be a i know brother brown make my absolute you know far as a man but i tell you what he's showing me to absolutely amen amen he had him inside it that's right and that's he always pointed us back you know one time he's making a statement he said where could i send you to today he said could i point you to the brown tablet he said no he said that thing just as that is arrested he said where could i point you to he said i can't torture that he said but there's one place i can he said this to the lord jesus christ back to this word hallelujah you know if we can get somebody back in the word of god and get them to see what they are and let them see that god still alive is still real amen brother that's all that's going to matter and he'll help you if you read them little messages and and listen to them i'll tell you what i when you catch a hold of it and see that god was speaking you know it's not just a man it wasn't just brother brown but it was god speaking fruit hallelujah and that got me more that really struck me hard kind of like he did old peter and he said satan get behind me because there's a time i wouldn't have followed it like i need to there's a time i wouldn't have applied it to me like i went to the message you know and things like little things in here i'd say well maybe it just ain't as serious as he says it you know but it is i'll tell you right now you don't find many flaws in that prophet's message you don't find too many things in there that ain't really got god in it you know i mean there might be a few things was god was bringing him up and showing him about the seals and about the horse riders and things you know that god had to show him you know had to really bring the light to him and show him the truths of it when he was trying to get it from other men you know he's trying to get to revelation from other great men but god let him know that it was going to take him to bring it forth hallelujah it's going to take god to do it and that's the way it's going to take today if without god you know we'll we might just get into anything you can take one day's little message and build your church thank god you take a little message here and just build you up a big church out of it and call yourself this or then but without the holy spirit without god of being there you know we'll get in the mess won't we right that's right god is trying to get our minds back to his word back to him praise the lord you know there's a time i followed him in like a shatter like peter did i'd get off and i really wasn't identified with a message like i ought to be but i was walking in the shadow of it brother i mean i was standing out there to shatter but when i seen it it's going to take a crucifixion to me and when i seen what was going to really happen boy i had to really get birthed again hey man oh peter walked around and shattered him a long time didn't right but when he seen how he was delivered up to be crucified then peter began to kind of say well man i you know he's a good man but i just can't be crucified with i just can't let this man if they're gonna crucify him they'll do it to me too you know what he'll sure get you crucified want it when you get really in the message you'll be crucified right brother you're gonna have to lose your life here to bring to have it in him praise god as long as their own life's a living god that can't get in here and live come on it's going to take us a dime for him to live praise the lord i tell you what when i saw that and began to get in here and search it there and that's what was god was showing me the other night through that eyesight i said oh my i said god that's done got down in my soul praise god it opened up my eyes of understanding it's opened up my whole life that i can see you now and i know where you are praise god but i'm going to find him i'll get in his words here i used to get out in the woods and pray and fast and it was good but i was trying to find him somewhere else i thought he was a way under somewhere another and i was kind of calling down you know and i guess he was but he was down here in me and he's just riding along with me now and i just i just didn't know it right i was trying to run this little ship by myself come on brother brother i'll tell you what i come disciples after they saw the miracles they saw the great revival they saw all this and when they started over on the other side and they got down there and they began to uh storm begin to rage you know and things begin to happen they done done all they could themselves to get those ship this kind of stay stable a little bit finally one of them said we better wake us wake him up pay me better go down here and wake him up man he's we're gonna have to do something you know that's what i had to do brother praise god he's in here riding with me but i had to wake him up man you know that's what he's doing today if we'll ever wake him up he'll he'll calm the waves man he'll take care of every problem he'll take care of every need praise god but we gotta wake him up you know i'm afraid today a lot of times he's going to sleep on us you know he's letting us do everything you know have you ever tried to do your own thing sometimes and i mean you try to have your service you got to have a church you got to have your own religion you try to do everything you can god let's let us do it but if we don't get in his perfect will everything's going to be out of place i believe he's got a perfect wheel for the little bride to get into i believe he's got a perfect will for us to fall into and be led by the spirit of god amen man i know sometimes it might be a battle to us and you know the greatest battle the prophet of god said ever fought was your mind i guess you sold it i mean it's so mind he likes to remember things you know he likes to keep things and way back and fangs he hard to turn loose from you know but the soul wants to obey god hallelujah there's something down in here there's a little place down inside your heart and that in there there's a god that lives in there there's something there that's controlling us brother sister i tell you what you it's amazing how they got these little computers these little things you can just touch in a number now and find somebody and go to where that you know there's a man come to their house today uh insurance salesman he punched my address in that little thing and it took him on the wrong end of the road i chose ain't at first all the time you know he's way back in the woods way back there i said listen you know what i'm fine saying think many things accurate but god's word aren't it you know it's going to take this word to get us through that praise the lord amen i mean we can punch in something we get it all down through the ages people are punched in this and punched in that you know sometimes they get off on the road don't they but god always brings us right back to the road amen right back to the main road amen if we never let the holy spirit just don't awaken inside of us you know make sure that he's living there make sure that we know that god is taking us and leading us and lives inside of us hallelujah and i get onto my children other day my grandson got real sick you know and and i know i hurt my daughter i guess and my son-in-law's feelings a little bit i said lord i say you know we should have had him in prayer we should have brought him up for prayer i said when he got sick and had a fever and stayed like that for a day or two and real sick i said i'll come and sit in the church you know and i'll preach my little my heart out sometimes just trying to get people see that god's real you know i said all you had to do is just bring him up and let us pray for him we'll use this little oil here and just put a little on him and just lay her hands on him i said god can do something for him right it's kind of it's too simple for people sometimes either i mean the first thing we find when we get kind of sick is man we got insurance let's run down yonder to the doctor's office you know what's that first comes through her mind and i know we'll get healed if we get healed we're gonna get healed by god anyway but you know it's just easy sometime to believe his word eh brother brown said if i pray for everybody jeffersonville and all of you die said it ain't going to change god from being a healer you know she gonna still be that healer but you know what god is still obligated to his word right he won't never let his word fail he'll stay with his word and i told him i said and finally they did bring him up for i believe that morning the next day or so they got to thinking about that and they brought him up there for prayer we prayed for the little fellow you know i believe god completely healed him he took that sickness out of his body you know god will do what he says he'll do more he said by his crops we're already healed but he has to get us to a place you know where we can believe it praise god i mean god so proved itself to me in so many ways amen to show me that he loved me and showed me that he cured for me and he's there with me you know he's on the inside he's living there but a lot of times i i'll let him go to sleep on me you know i just i forget to uh get his benefits like he said all these all everything in here is farming praise god all of his great benefits and all of his power and his glory is in here it belongs to me praise god because i'm a part of him brother right but we're going to have to learn how to use it you know taking use to don't let it become of no fact to us because if it does the devil can beat us out of just one little thing sometimes he'll just take one little he'll cause us to uh let one little thing happen i know he's done that to me you know what next thing it's easier it gets a little easier for me to give into it you say oh some things it's too hard for god you know i just can't trust him with some of my old problems you know listen god understands everything doesn't right he knows everything i tell you you're while back i had the interest in to bust in my stomach right down next to my spine right here right in there i mean artery right in there you know and i thought i was gone you know my wife and i started praying i didn't jump up and call everyone to call them families and things i said oh no god will take care of thanks they started praying for me i thought i was gone i tell you when the blood leads you that's where the life you'll be thank you you don't last long will you but i'll tell you we got to pray and i everything was dark i just know that i was going it's been about four years ago and and i'd come to myself funny and there's a praying for me sitting on the bed and but you know god restored me back kept me they did got me to go out to the doctor but i put god first they got me to go out there at that doctor and old doctor will check me said listen you would be dead i said how in the world you're living i said well god just ain't ready to leave here right now he said well let me call the ambulance said need to i'll call the emergency room i said no i said i'll we'll go down if we need to go you know i i didn't have to go but i did go down there my wife said you're to go and just let them see what happened you know got down to that old doctor when i got in the emergency room they started sticking all these things in and needles and putting blood in me all i need is just a good mess of liver or something might have been all right man i went and had to take out my shots and things and all that stuff putting auction back my veins and if i just got a good fried piece of liver or something you know to build my blood up a little bit out of bed all right but you know i i went there away and hit connie i suffered during that old intensive cure for two three days you know people are praying for me but i just felt good you know i mean i god had already done something for me he let me know he's with me down there praise the lord he went with me to the emergency room he was there with me but i had to this whole body here you know it's gotta i guess go through some of those things but god was showing me that he loved me praise the lord and i hope i just get this over to you tonight because god is he loves you so much amen he'll take care of everything morning my whole heart gets to act it up sometimes and no devil he'll he'll use things don't he does that to hinder us you know because he's going to be a hindrance he's taken out of the way and you sometimes just say boy i better go it's hard to hear this you get to thinking maybe your cancer is on the inside of you you know the best thing that you ever had is just faith amen praise god faith will take you through it all amen through all sickness and diseases or whatever it is there's a god there that'll take you right from every bit of it he'll leave you won't leave nothing out of it amen he'll here's joey that he loves you praise the lord so don't let him defeat you in any way i know if uh if he could get us out and make us think well god's forgot us and left us in sickness and diseases i've heard a lot of people say well i've tried to trust god and everything you know and when i get sick seem like it's no he's not there but he is there god is will you ever where are you at and whatever you're in he's there we praise god i believe as my brother told me before service said about helping somebody uh giving somebody some money or something said whatever you do with you know god's gonna if you take that money and use it misuse it it'll be you're doing it but you know because i give it to him it's god you know and to think about that you know if you if you misuse god you have to you do something wrong or get out of the will of god you know you god's there you're doing him you're taking him weed if you're a child of god right you know we shouldn't be good we shouldn't take advantage of his fang and say god i don't want to do nothing lord that you wouldn't do god don't let me do nothing of my own you know don't let me get in my own will because if we do we'll find ourselves in a kind of a bad shape sometimes we'll give you a get rebuked sometimes and you say sometimes old pastor who get up and he'll you think well boy he's he's just picking on me you know he knows too much about me but you know god lets him know it sometimes amen in the spirit that little pastor if he's ordained of god he's obligated to just uncover every little thing amen he's on he's obligated to bring our attention back to god ain't he back to the fangs of god i mean if he just let us go and just say oh you just do what you want to do and you know just get out just have a good time and i tell you brother and sister we'll forget about god sometimes you know what we'll catch ourselves on that ship and i was thinking about this other night i said oh peter when the lord jesus when he come back storm that time and it's after that ship and old peter they got to look and disciples got to looking around they saw something walking on the water i said man this is a you know a lot of people don't believe in ghosts i don't guess but they said this is a ghost in here and old peter got to a place he finally got enough boneless in him he said well master if this is you just let me just let me come out there and you know god will let you walk on the water right but you better have faith when you step out of that shield i believe that's what god's been trying to get us to do is that we've rode this old ship you know and it's about time for us to step out on the water i mean we've gotten used to riding the ship too much you know we're living in a time when a storm is a raging brothers sister we live in a time when we're living in a darkest page we've ever lived in really right now in this united states of america right when the little brides are getting ready to get in that millennium i was reading another day where brother brown i said wait back in 61 i believe what he said we should have already been in the living i said oh my have we missed it i said think about that he said you already would have been in it i said sure to god we ain't behind that far you know he was looking for it back then i'm preaching it you know trying to get people a seat it's not long off it's just getting real close but you know we're getting we're getting right close to this thing and we're coming up with a most than an hour you better believe that the devil knows about these things he knows that we're fixing to just walk in that other dimension with him praise god and or we something we're trying to get us you know work on us and our vines and our spirit and get us to a place that will you know just can't really step out on him like we need to but god is gonna we're gonna have to do it you know it's like he told peter he said peter just come on out and meet me just step out but as you know when he stepped out hey what did he do he started going down didn't he you know what that's what we got to see here because if we're not really careful we're living in a time that gods are telling us to step out into the deep you know to get in him get our minds anchored in him get herself in but if we ain't really got our minds anchored in there then there'll be all kinds of little things that devlin used to how to get us off on something else you know you get us to get the different ideals and different opinions and i didn't know there was so many got in the message to here a few about a year or two ago and got the list of different things i never seen lots of things come up my life i said oh my what's going on here you know what i thought we just need to get in this basically to simply believe what he said you know and staying with what the prophet of god said i mean keep that love and keep that in unity you know but i know there's little things in here i guess people's mist i guess a lot of the great preachers we got today in the message is probably maybe has i know maybe some of them knows it all but still there may be a few little things in here that they don't know you know i haven't got been revealed to them right yet but we're searching you know we're digging we're waiting for god to give us the final a test thing we praise the lord probably we're coming to the final test brother and sister that's why the prophet of god said i ain't gonna be many make it he said why because we we're coming through the trials of these things and tested i mean it's just like the natural types of spiritual and like my daughter back here i she's been going to nurses you know to be a nurse and all the spends hours and days and nights are kind of understanding the books and things she has to go through you know but when she comes to that final test of it and she don't it don't she ain't got to what it takes to pass it she's gonna she just can't go in you know that's the way god's doing us he's putting us through the final test of this message i believe i believe we've come a long ways but i still believe we've got a little ways to go yet ain't we praise god hallelujah so we might be able to walk on the water but if we ain't really careful we'll start sinking you know brother it's a serious thing this this is desperation that god you know prophet of god said we weren't going to make it till desperation said it you say well how can we get desperate listen i believe it's time to get desperate don't you i believe it's time to search a scripture search a word search a message thank god get back and see if there's any little hens left off anywhere see if there's any things that's hindered us anything that stops us from really believing what he said because they gonna take much to to get us to thinking off on different lines and different ideals and things and i i tell you what i love my precious brothers i got a lot of them that i know and you know i know that they kind of leaning off the different little ideals and things and i just wonder i say lord is this really the way we need to go is this what we need to believe you know i if you get to listen to some of them that's why i guess we need to stay with their pastor though thanks god you know brother brown said your pastor will take you through it man if you put confidence in him i believe y'all got to greet when it's pure praise i believe you got one that wants to make it amen brother dale i've listened to him and i told him the other day i said brother when i if i go up there you got to promise me you're going to come down there and be with us an attitude praise the lord he said i'll sure do it brother he said i'll promise y'all come down and i told him i was gonna really call him when he gets back and get him set up because i need we need that teaching praise god my little body needs more understanding that we all need i know i need it and i know our little church needs it thank god and i believe god can give us a little hearing a little there he'll help us to mature and we'll be more get more like god we begin to look like him amen live like him and be like him praise the lord and he's working on us amen my little boy joshua used to sing that song he's still working on me you know what the whole song is all about don't know what he knows but he's singing about every service and you know what i thought boy that sounds good amen god was working on me hallelujah and he didn't quit working on me he still mowed me up we gotta get that old father's house i tell you when we get to it brother and get uh god's got to beat on us and you know and bring us through a real testing time to get us molded in him don't right hallelujah you got to be just like him and i was telling it or not i said when it was michelangelo he made that statue of moses praise god and he spent a lot of time working on that thing did i mean he had to get such a revelation such a mind did him to build that thing he got so perfect you know he finally got in such a condition he's finally struck and said speak did he thought that hang on to talk you know what's words got to get some means so much to us it's got to get to a place that we can hear god talking amen amen the word killeth but this spirit will give life you know there's a god that hears us when we get to uh getting our hearts down to this word getting our lives applied to it getting your whole being applied to it you can hear him talking to you you think god still can't talk to us he can do it okay right sometimes he has to use old pastors and he's a sunday school teacher i'd have to use a deacon or something but i'll tell you what he's still talking to us amen thank god he'll come right to us and you say lord that's what i needed you know it's hard sometimes to get scalded to scold it a little bit but i tell you what when you do and you can overcome and take it he'll do you good praise god that's right i mean it helps you something to get some time just get rebuked amen and if you old pastor sometimes he gets something he'll you know just begin to preach fangs and it he'll say well hey i don't need that i don't think but if you get the search in your mind real good your soul you might need it i mean it might be something that you need and he's trying to god it's trying to use that old pastor he wonder why he's not preaching something like that he wonders why he's a set in his face but some how another day somebody maybe needs it all of us might not need it but there might be one that does need just like you sometimes you preach a little message you see people that needs healing and needs they need something from god maybe need the holy ghost or need of lessons from god or they need to have more understanding and you try to preach the things that god would put on your heart to that need you see and god sees that need he needs he might be the least one in the church it might be somebody that's not mature to or somebody that's not really been birthed yet or something but god will let's the preacher he led to ministry they'll begin to preach these things till god gets us right to it morning then you'll know it's him talking to you praise the lord that's the way it does to me and i it's like i what i said with i'm precious brothers that was in a message it was with brother branham and listen to him brother uh parmer i guess a lot of you know him that's what brother brown brother jack farmer he come and spent a whole weekend one time we fished and count and boy they sat around the little count for us and he knowed i didn't know much about nothing you know i was i was playing things in the message and he'd tell me all these things that god had showed him and brought him through and it opened up his understanding to you know it's just a blessing to him i mean i enjoyed it so much i've been with him a whole week and hearing him expound on some things and that god talked to him and brought him through you know and it really was a help to me did i run into that brother ned iverson boy he he was a real bible scholar and i thought man this fellow here he just got too much knowledge i said with this little jewish brother come through one time and and i i know brother brother eddie's done gone to be the lord so i can't i can't hurt him more now you know you can't do him much damage now uh but i'll tell you what just a little brother coming up this little jewish brother he said brother dad iverson he said what you need to do is just cut your head off and throw it in that garbage can oh i thought boy that's something you know i said i didn't understand what he was talking about he said brother collins he got me off this little jewish place that brother that man's just got too much knowledge he said he just got too much knowledge i guess that little brother need to do some growing too you know amen i thought about it i said oh my i'd love to know what that brother ned knows because he really knows about the message you know he could take you from one book to nothing and quote hearing protern just line you right up you know he just about know how you live i said how can you do that but you know that's the way god does he's a getting us in a statue or something maybe god's placeness is that little lively stones you know one up on one and just getting his little temple made and i thought boy if i'm one of them stones i need to get my place you know thank god i i need to be placed and that's what god was doing he's a placeless in that part of the body you know wherever we're at just like you can't say to your little toe you don't need it do you i mean your whole body's got to be working together and i it's just like if you see somebody that's struggling somebody maybe don't know as much as something maybe he's not obligated to carry all that load you know somebody's got to get a little higher to help a safety right i mean if somebody don't learn how to use something and work with it then we'll all i certainly don't want to be eating it to you concerning the leadership of god i want to find it and see what the prophet of god has said to me to walk in that way and living that way talking that way you know i got ashamed to talk about people i used to be pretty bad to criticize people but i hear the old brothers say one time talking about the uh how it sounds and took that jawbone that i asked and killed all them philistines and people and i thought man then he come out and said he said you know what he said we killed more than he does he said us it's just individuals kills more than sampson i said oh my what's he saying yeah he said these jaw bones here kills more people than sex i said oh my god i'm gonna quit talking about people lord i sure ain't gonna be guilty back tomorrow i try to quit that you know because it's that thing if you catch yourself sometimes and we'll you know you kill people by just talking about something right man you don't have to shoot them or knock them ahead or beat them to death but just simply talking about them you can kill your brothers and sisters so that learned me a little bit on that brother i got a little wisdom on that i said oh god i ain't gonna be guilty of that no more if i can happen somebody starts talking about somebody now i try to walk away or just close myself up no because i want to stop i ain't going to kill anymore probably killed a lot of them but i've stopped but here this little scripture meant so much to me i said oh god i said the other night when i was a prayer and reading this and i said lord there's something in here that i need about that eyesight i said god if i can just anoint my eyes with it lord the only way you can do it really to what your eyes will just to hear what that prophet is saying i mean if you want to get some this eyesight on listen to what he says believe it and i'll tell you what he'll drop down through your whole body he'll make you dress right it'll make you wear your hair right it'll make you tall proud it'll make you live right it'll make you do what you're supposed to and that's what god's trying to get us in a position to do it to be obedient to him man amen if god can ever get us in line with him uh but i was going back through this and my spirit tonight god was taking me back to paul and to moses and a lot of these fellows and how that they had to be brought down to a place you know that they could they had to see god you know they had to know israel hallelujah i don't want to be out there if i don't know it's real just like a lot of the soldiers and army you know they get out there they don't go through that train and teaching and listening and being obedient to how to conduct ourselves and listen you know what they don't know what to do when they get involved and that's the way god's letting us we're fighting the greatest battle that's ever fall right now i mean we go we're living in this time when these flames are repeating again you know the prophet of god said all these things are repeat again we're living in the sodom condition like it was back in the days of sodom we live it when god is letting the promised son come forth amen he's he's letting it be manifested in our hearts but we're living in this very hour when these things are taking place i mean it's god's let it roll around you know to the time that we're living in and it will if we ever been a time listed or governor news you know it's you can't find much fitting to listen to they can but bad news on their every bit of use you listen to is about it bad except the good news and these things are getting around our nations is gone the leadership of our nation's gone what's the happening people's killing and murder and stealing in augusta georgie you just turn on the radio down there and it's just become horrible it's just to become a place of death in a night that passes what somebody's been killed they pass the road and shoot people standing on the streets not even without any cause it's to shoot people we're living in a time that people is going totally insane they're young people i oh i think we better get a young people for god's sake we better get our minds in the lord this get ourselves anchored in because uh it's time we're living in when this bangs are manifest and it's coming right on the scene and they only the young people it's the older people i mean they got to a place we just don't know what is the real leadership at and what we think well where is it at but god's in here he's inside there so you got the holy ghost in if you've got that presence of god in you brother and sister all you have to do is talk to i found out one way to get close to god that's to pray and read your bible i don't know what a way to tell you i mean you could pass yourself to death and still be lost without god amen unless you're getting yourself out of the way i found out that's what i need to do i used to fast to try to get god to come down on the scene to be in the service but i found out i was doing the wrong thing lord i need to fast to get myself out of the way god if i just get my old self killed and get this old gene collins get him plumb lost you know lord to let your mind and your spirit take control in this old vessel here god then i'll make it that's the only way i'll make it that's all the way i can help anybody because i was used to praying like a brother said you're sinners you know anybody can be healed i've seen people that wasn't even living right get healed by miracles i mean because it they they just believed you know they'd come out with what faith they had and god would heal them and a lot of them they just wouldn't make it fill them with a holy spirit and i've seen them receive that baptism the holy spirit on the human spirit you know and they'd prophesy and speak in tongues give out messages but they just couldn't live right they just couldn't get in the place they need to be with god especially my wife we come down into custody georgie going to church with some of her people and and it kind of astonished you know spain's deceiving sometimes if god don't open up your mind and show you things before we got into the message and i never will forget how to we'd go there and some of her people would shout just shallow the church you know fall out in the spirit people ever would all and i'd see them day by day and see how they just wasn't living right i mean if i came to see the things in the scriptures that they need to obey and do what god wanted them to do and line up with the word of god but they had the anointing on them you know and they had that spirit of working in their life but they couldn't they just couldn't walk in the light of christ couldn't live like they need to i said lord there's something you're lacking somewhere and they certainly was you know you couldn't but my wife thank god gotta got a hold of her and let her see that you know she had to live his words not go but feelings you go by what obedience to god you know your feelings might try to take you some other way i mean if you got your mind in here might be trying to take you a lot of ways but in your feelings but yet the word god let it be the truth you know he said let every man be alive with my word be the truth so if that one so if that would be the soul then we got our builder life up on his word they praise god it might not satisfy our feelings all the time might not satisfy once all time but i'd better be in his word praise god and have my own wants and have my own feelings because i'll tell you we've satisfied our feelings we might do everything we can to just get all we can get you know and be blessed out here in the natural manner and yet god's wanting to take us the way that we need to go some other way through the word you know and it might get a little hard you know why sometimes we have some hard times and good times but god brings us through all of it praise the lord but i want to get back to this year now i'm going to stop here god is trying to get her mind back to his word back to his presence amen and i found the best way to do it is to get this old-fashioned bible word and just say lord here i am god lord if you'll take me in moment use me and let me just be in your leadership god i'll i just like the prophet of god he started off as that young fellow i used to get that life story out and i read it listen to it i say oh man it's just a blessing to hear what he was going through but a lot of times he had to he god rebuked it and god chased him and you know a lot of his wants he didn't get him did i mean he had to take him and take him around the hard way sometime and he lived as poor he's the poorest person i guess it was in kentucky at one time he didn't have nothing you don't but after he got in the mind of god he didn't need want for nothing i mean everything that he needed you know it was our farm praise god and it was hard because he sure didn't want to burden the people for nothing he didn't want nobody to feel like that they need to be burdened for him even out of his as many right when he's out in on the fields and going and and he he didn't want to impress some people he said god if you call me you'll meet the need you know you'll see that this needs me it did and you know what he said i'll get a job if god i'll go back to work if you don't meet the needs i they want him to come overseas in different places and him a prayer and kind of get in the mind of god get in the leadership of god and you know he didn't have finances to go he just didn't have help to go so he'd start praying he said lord i'll just get me a job and go to work and if you want me to go when i get enough money then i might be able to go but see that wasn't god's plan was it god knows how he could get him in his will he didn't meet them needs did he'd make sure if he sent him he'd be there to meet the need for him praise the lord and he saw that and that prophet of god as he growed up and began to see these things how god was leading him and material and getting him ready for this journey praise the lord it become a blessing to him and he just got richer and richer on the inside of it praise god he said if i need a million dollars next week god will give it to me boy i'll tell you when you get that close to god and get to a place you know there's no doubt in you there's nothing can keep you from walking in faith and living in faith and staying in the faith of god then you've got to bless them in your life and i believe that's what he's trying to do teach individual praise the lord i believe he's picking us up a little bit at a time and we'll begin to see where he said you know and it's hard sometime to go through these trials and go through the testis and go through the pressures of them but sometimes god let you do that to see if you're gonna still love him don't you i mean if he just stayed on the ship all time and got everything you needed i mean it's everything learned every little things maybe we'd forget about god but forget about praying and forget about how others is having to go through struggles and things sometimes but we have to be touched with these things you know god he'd come as low as anybody could he humbled himself and come down here left his riches and glory left everything he had to come down here to walk in their footprints did he had to take this little journey parson he is tested by all these things and whatever trial and error persecution ever sin every disease god had to go through the test of his faith he overcome that that we could overcome so today if we realize that everything that we go through and every little test we go through god's already paid for it he's already given us sprint to overcome any praise the lord he's made us strong enough to overcome these things brother and sister will become real to us after fall amen and i i just thank god for his grace tonight do you love him amen i'm going to stop prayer but listen let me read that one little license verse and then i'll stop amen revelations 3 and 18 he said here in 21 he said to him that overcome will i grant to set with me and my throne even as i also overcame and i sat down with my father in his promise he to have a year let him hear what the spirit set up under the churches right you know god spoke to all them church ages didn't he and all down through them and he's speaking to us today hearing this lastingness this is closing out let us hear what the spirit is saying hey babe brother god is kind of getting his little body ready she's fixing to go on a journey and i'll tell you what like her brother was telling me that everybody said brother when we get where we need to be i believe that prophet now i'm anxious to get to come on the scene amen he asked me that i believe in the return ministry i said yes i believe in it i mean returning that's right prophet of god i believe it i believe he's going to return amen but you know what i don't think he needs to come and finish up a message i believe he left us give it to little bride i believe he's going to make a bride out of baby i believe she's going to be married to the lord jesus christ and that's their whole name she'll be mrs jesus amen god's a chronic he's doing that for us right now let us hear what the spirit is saying to the churches brother and sister god's been talking to us and bringing it to us and every time we hear the little pastor get up here his heart just burning in him and a little message that set him on this far in his house or out there while he's going down the road it'll tell him what this little pastor y'all's a little pastor how when it comes back you know sometimes god had to get the prophet off on little crips and things to get to give him something sometimes it's hard if you around a good bunch of people like y'all or brothers and sisters maybe to get what you really need you know you have to get out in the woods sometimes or off in a desert or way at you under a mountain somewhere for god to come and just open up a little nugget to you amen because somebody needs it don't they and i mean everybody might not need it but i know i'm still growing myself amen no i'm thank god for for my precious brothers i'd love to sit around and talk to you and listen to you because there's something there you've got this heavenly i mean this is like a brother here a song leader or if i had him around i'd sit around with him all the time tell me about these things he's just got wisdom and god god's done something for him and i it pays us to listen sometimes to brothers that god is showing things uncover just let them get it out of the message a little things done through their life that's bringing these little nuggets on the scene brother it's gonna help us to be over conversation do you love him with all your heart tonight is anybody here tonight and you don't really know him but all your life i tell you need to know amen put him in all your life his brother comes tonight to sing a song or however we're going to turn this service over to a brother here brother dale's son whatever he's saying here thank you uh just whatever brother you say whatever you'd like to sing anybody tonight needs prayer for anything okay we'll be glad to pray with you praise god i think 120 in

stay with brother dick long he he'd bring him back believe it we need all right pray for sister gail but she take him back amen we enjoyed it we love to say tonight thank god to really say but i just feel so little you know being a place where you got a great pastor like brother dale and heard you to stay with him praise god and lift him up in your prayers i'll tell you come expect with expectations get what god gives you because god will surely give it to that pastor to help you and lead you and teach you praise the lord are you ready just to encourage them but they know he's the best pastors in the world they make i tell you to make a pastor feel good when you've got people like y'all that are coming and just feed of that food that god's given him you just don't know how it makes a pastor feel but he can come in and see somebody hungry and thirsting for god and he feels something come out of his heart to help them feel like eating that food praise the lord it just does good so we just love you if you ever come down around to linkedin i hope sometimes we have a little meeting and come down and be with us in our little place we don't have nothing real fancy but we

that'll solve a lot of problems amen all right let's pray father we thank you we love you Lord and we ask you that you would just father be with it each and every one of us and that you'd give us understanding ears that we may hear what the spirit has to say unto us for this day we pray that you'd bless each one remember the sick among us and just touch each one you promised it and we believe it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so remember each one of these Lord remember ones that are not here brother Don brother Tom brother George and these different ones that and sister Thomas Lord and the ones that are not able to come out and be with us but we pray that you would bless them exceedingly and Lord have your way with each and every one we love you and we thank you as we read your word Lord you come and speak to our hearts and just have your way now in Jesus name amen and amen we've been in Ephesians now for quite a while but we just keep on because we're still on the adoption and the things we kind of uh closed out a little bit on the predestination and now we're on the uh adoption in three stages and also we're try to make it you know stick with what we've been reading in Ephesians so if you'd like to follow along Ephesians 1 one blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his Gra Grace wherein he hath made it us accepted in the Beloved amen now we we'll go to Romans 8 reading verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abby father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ours of God and Joint ours with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God you may be seated Lord add his Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we're trying to speak about adoption and we gave you the quote there the other day and and brother randam says it on the message of position in Christ paragraph uh 163 and I give you the the dates on these adoption because uh the there is a difference between the wording they use in the the what we were using of say one message formality and then the the new version that they came out from from spoken word and uh you know the voice of God recording uh so I give you the date all right that way you can check the date see like brother Joe and I were looking a minute ago on where it says like Ephesians parallels Joshua we see in the new version they don't use that title they use just adoption one adoption 2 adoption three adoption four all right if you got the red composite book that's the way it's put out but I give you the date that way you can check the date of the tape or the the book so the one position in Christ is preached in 19 uh 6522 in the evening service that brother Brown says that ask said Do You Believe In dispensations And I know people say well we don't believe in dispensations well see a dispens is like it it it's a time set or a time for something to take place or the taking place of that during the time in other words it's like setting an order of events and brother R says on that he says now there was a dispensation of Moses there was a dispensation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation uh of the the church ages in other words and he said there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said and now is the dispensation of adoption see in the day and the age that we're in so in other words this is a time for it this is the time to come to fulfill a dispensation or or a time period that will make itself you know be made manifest during that part all right and that's what I've been trying to tell you and to talk about it is we we took the life of Jesus Christ and seeing that he came through the the stages of adoption and uh you know and doing that then we must also uh come through that or go through that stages also now it's different in the way that he went but it means the same that's the point I'm trying to get you to see because Paul was not telling the Romans the what we're we would want to read and see uh he was not uh telling them you know that uh hey uh you're already Israelites he wasn't telling them that because adoption pertained to Israel it was an Israeli custom it's good to see our visitors back there with us we always say welcome to you one time two times you're part of us but see it's in other words they Paul wasn't telling them he was telling them that you receive the spirit of adoption he wasn't telling them that you uh know all about adoption so now your adoption that took place in your your life as an Israeli you know as a a Jew uh that's not what we're talking about because see that was their custom and their ways uh see he wouldn't be saying that you you you don't need the new birth because you were already an adopted Jew see that wasn't it that's what I tried to get you to see the the difference between the Old Testament form and the New Testament see no one in the Old Testament could receive eternal life now they have to die go by the grave wait or whatever or be be you know beyond the curtain of time or whatever you want to call it in a position but they never received eternal life until Jesus Christ came and died to release that life all right then they could be taken up to a position to wait you know there and all and they could receive the eternal life there that's fine to give it to them in the in the resurrection but don't give it to them as Old Testament people cuz see that was a dispensation a time that Jesus Christ had not died but then see he comes over and when he dies then it's now we're capable of receiving eternal life and I wanted you to see that about Paul he calls it the spirit of adoption all right see trying to explain to the Romans now these Romans were are not just totally Gentile because all of this was basically to the Jews but he was trying to get them as I said to see that this because that they believed in adoption because they had come to their and I always mispronounced it but Mar barit how you say it of the the thing when they reached a certain age you know that that is uh in the natural of the the people of Israel they still do that today right but that if you went over right now you wouldn't go up to one of them and say you've already been adopted into your family so all you need is a change of the body right you wouldn't say that to them would you tell them they need to be born again Nicodemus had went through those stages right and Jesus didn't say because of you who you are and you've already been adopted no that's only an example right brother brandom as he's using it he's using the Old Testament custom of the people of Israel you know the Jews to to explain adoption to us cuz that's the same thing Paul's doing he's not telling them you're already adopted so that no he he told them that they buy the new birth cuz if you go back and read before then and you know you said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ be in you verse 11 uh you see if it raise up Christ it'll raise you up so he's talking to people with the new birth and he's telling them what the things that are to take place and by receiving that new birth they have the spirit of adoption whereby they cry out by father in other words they're in the kingdom of God cuz there was no way to get in the Kingdom of God in the Old Testament right you got to be born again to be in the kingdom of God and it could only start on the day of Pentecost cuz it was in Jesus Christ the kingdom was in him but it had to be brought into manifestation all right so I want to make sure you don't misunderstand then as we go along so then there there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost there was a dispensation of to where that it was down to different stages of the church ages or a time but now we're in the dispensation of coming to understand the full measure of understanding adoption all right then it's taught in three stages all right see Jesus Christ had a a water baptism a recognition an identification a receiving of the Holy Spirit not as a new birth I put that on there because everybody wants to get so confused with it so they won't link me with somebody else's Doctrine I believe he received the new the the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah we can say that cuz that's the way the prophet used it but as an anointing not as a new birth but as an anointing for his ministry to go forth you know and preach the gospel because that's what he goes right over immediately in the Book of Luke you find him saying that that Spirit came upon him that was Isaiah to fulfill the scripture this day that scriptures fulfilled you know all right see then in that he had a time of identification all right then he had a time of Authority or positionally placing on the amount of transfiguration and to hear ye him came into being see and truly then we'll get to it later you know how that I've already preached it many many years to us to where it says there in Romans it doesn't say that adoption to Redemption of the body it says the adoption to wh the Redemption of the body to understand right and truly Jesus understood the the uh the the Redemption of the body because he said what he said destroy this body and other words destroy this temple in 3 days I'll bring it up he understood he knew what the Redemption was about cuz he knew that that what was said over there at the the time is called the River Jordan position at his baptism to where it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and brother randam interpreted that in other words or translated that into modern-day language to say this is the part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it so Jesus had understanding to it to understand he knew about the Redemption of the body all right so I'm not concerned about the body being chained right you know just like years ago I told you I said I quit trying to go to heaven people didn't understand that you know well what do you mean you don't want to go I didn't say I didn't want to go I said I quit trying to go because that was our point we always want to go to heaven go to heaven now I want heaven to come here because if God don't come here I don't go there and that's that's what I've tried to express to you for many years so is it with the I'm not concerned about the Redemption of the body I'm concerned about to Wi to understand right how this body is redeemed that's right all right and I believe that we'll come to that eventually in the the understanding because we must have our baptism not only natural but spiritual we had our water baptism and like I told you if you ref refuse to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then don't worry about the rest of adoption you're not even in the stages yet you're not even in the journey so just forget it cuz you won't follow the word all right but see then we come to this water baptism and the natural then the spiritual and the baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing us into the body of Christ and then we can talk about the hear ye himym the adoption the authority and then go on to understand the Redemption of the body because to me it's that's what it's doing so we're in that dispens ation or time to understand uh let's the Ecclesiastes says it like this says it's a time to all times it doesn't say there's a time for all things there's a time to all things right see this is the time to understand and that's what I'm trying to get us to to to bring to that point but now this past Wednesday I know I would just got down talking to you cuz see I want you to understand so much until it gets on me to the way to try to express it and I'm sorry if I say something hard uh whatever just lay it to my old ways and ignorance and never what else you know and just say well he's just getting old but if I believe I believe if I was you and about to R and probably verify a lot of it that he's redoing the tape system for us and he told me the other day he said you're saying the same thing now you're saying then so I I I wouldn't go along with that too much but I'm just saying that I want you to understand and it doesn't matter to me to take service after service on one point to try to get it to us because the prophet said hold that up until the people gets it well bear with me maybe it's me so you bear with me till I get it all right because I want it too but see I believe you must be born again to be in the body of Christ then that way we come to what Paul is saying to the Romans that if we have the spirit verse 11 that raised up Jesus Christ in US it'll also raise us up he's he's linking the whole thing to the New Birth because the prophet said that's the most important thing in your life is the new birth because we're not even a child of God other than a natural Child by natural creation that everybody in the world is a natural Child by natur creation cuz God's the only one that can give life but see then we must be born again to be in the body of Christ all right then being born again we're just using then the natural story of a child the of the Jews Like The Prophet is using it you know a natural uh Israeli person who would come to the uh natural adoption things and as I said they're still doing that we were we happen to be there and we Act happened to view brother de s Piggy and my wife we actually viewed about a 13-year-old boy that was going through his part and you know we we were interested we we we we didn't run off we wanted to stay and and I'd like to stay there probably instead of going on with the guide but we got in trouble a few times about that anyway but it's all right uh we got we got through but uh see Paul is not telling let me repeat that I want you to understand he's not telling these people here that oh you always was eternal oh you always was this you always was that you already went through all of these stages of your adoptions and things and probably a lot of the people that he was talking to was standing there with the full signant ring of their father's adoption right you know the full Authority was invested in to them but he wasn't telling them that he wasn't saying you're all right he go back and read Romans 8 there down to that see he was telling them by the new birth see brother randam explains he said now the Corinthians had to have it explained to them over and over but he said most of the books they didn't have to explain he said especially like Ephesians or something he said because they understood well see the Romans could understand certain things so he was capable of speaking a greater depth to them of this adoption situation and expressing it to them you know but he was remember the one thing that I like what brother Brown brings out in the book of Hebrews that brother Brown says Paul was trying to get it out of those people's minds see we've been taught all of our life that Paul you know I mean it was back when we was in denomination that that Paul was telling them the Lord's coming just the Lord's coming Lord just now he was trying to get it out of their mind mind that the Lord was coming he said there must be a falling away there must be these things see get it out of your mind he wasn't telling the Romans here that you're okay he was telling them the stages they must go through to come to the position that he was trying to speak of but remember that could not take place back there before all of this could transpire we had the falling away right and then you had to have the restoration coming back in the last days in a zeusa street coming forth with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and bringing the people back into the body of Christ in the the correct way not that nobody wasn't in there before but bringing it back to the three stages all right so then we we're we're tying it together so just get that point in mind so what would the child do now in the natural story The Prophet explains and you've read all of it and heard the message and all that he explains that that child is a child when it was born into the family but said it was not didn't have any inheritance in other words it didn't have any Authority it didn't have any recognition of those points but it was in the family all right and it was given a tutor to raise it all right and he said now you choose the best tutor you could get all right see then he goes in explaining that what see when we receive the new birth you remember how Wednesday was talking about it when we receive the new birth we receive that Spirit of adoption which is the holy spirit that's why it's called the spirit of adoption by Paul we receive the New Birth the spirit of adoption cuz it adopts us into the family see we were Gentiles totally gone and no no lineage no connection see and even the natural Jew couldn't get into the kingdom of God because he was born a natural Jew he had to be born again right to get into the kingdom of God you'd be surprised how many people of the message don't understand that cuz you listen to him preach it like one big man said one time and I heard him I wouldn't said he said I don't believe in dispensations well you brother R said you're sure out of the Bible if you don't that's now I mean so you know but of course everybody wants to say what they want to that's their business but now listen see we must have the new birth to bring us into the family of God all right that would be then like that natural baby back there as the example as the natural Israelite would be brought into the family by his natural birth think we're brought into the family by the spiritual Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet said God gave us the best tutor he could get he said he gave us the holy spirit all right now I've tried to say this and most of you know it you know what I'm fixing to say but I've been at this for over 30 years on that 40 years going on it see the way I look at what most people teach of adoption it's the father just going off the scene and he's never seen anymore just disappearing you know and really here comes the son boy he's strutting on you know he I I just don't understand that because I thought that the Holy Spirit and the father was a selfs sign Spirit as I said Wednesday or the prophet said Jesus had two daddies because he said the Holy Ghost was his daddy and he said his father was his daddy till he have two daddies or something's wrong so it have to be the same holy spirit so look what I'm talking about the father picked the best tutor he could get what he came himself to dwell in us now come on that's how much do we need where brother R said he didn't even send a son to die in his place that's right said he came himself all right see then the holy spirit is not another Spirit different from God right right it's God's Own Spirit dwelling in us he's wanting his nature in us so he's coming in us to start the thing maybe forgive me for language like that but God because I don't know have no other way of saying it but it's pretty good point that's the way to get it started bring us into the family by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that is the spirit of the father that's within us right we're talking about adoption is talking about getting the nature of the father right well look behind me at the Statue of a perfect man I thought that was to bring us into the nature of the father I thought faith virt and all temp Pati god brother kind and all the nature of the father being brought into us I thought that's what adoption was that's why it took brother ROM 30 something years now this is a quote from statue of perfect man he said 30 something years before he could preach the stature of a perfect man amen not that he wasn't preaching it going back in there and get like 1956 and all like that and listen to an inter Veil where he talking about the nature of the father he'd always preached that but this nail that dams he in other words he saw how to bring it into view right all right but you see then he gives us the tutor but the tutor is not another person separate from God that's right right the tutor is the holy spirit amen which is the spirit of almighty God Amen he comes in you and I to bring forth his nature that's right no more as I said than he sent a son to die in his place no he came himself the new birth is not another Spirit separate from God to come and live in you it's God's Own Spirit his own soul his own being the prophet would say in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see to make us a child of God so it's not the father going off the scene adoption is the father coming on the scene in his son whe it would be where he was walking on the shores of Galilee himself in flesh or whether it be in his bride around the world we are his offspring we are God made manifest in another form called a bride or a wife you know see but we're him not another person he wasn't I like Brother Richard Wilson he's always said it his way said he wasn't a second person he wasn't a third person said he's quoting brother r that he's not even the first person see if he is the first person that could mean you had another person brother said he is the person well that's just old one this well I'll just stay with it so you go what you want to because I sure do really love it like it is all right but now listen the holy spirit is the spirit of God coming into you and I to bring a new birth and it is not another spirit that God is sending right because Jesus how long do we need to stay on Jesus said I and my father come to take up our abat in you right right that's right it's expedient that I go away cuz if I don't go away the comforter won't come all right see then we're sticking with the point of understanding understanding the the true revelation of one God but now watch as I said comparing the life of Jesus Christ with with the bride of Christ M and comparing that with the natural adoption that's what I'm trying to do cuz in the natural adoption they never went on to understand the Redemption of the body right they could just go from the the baby and the coming in the family and then the authority going with it it it doesn't go on you understand so when you're talking about comparing something like brother Brown said comparing the church ages with the seals M see you can't parallel the church ages and the seals CU if you do you only got four seals and Rapture is gone you you'd have to do you can't do it so you compare that's right compare means to put them side by side and look at this and look at that and see how they bringing forth you know something in similarity because I said Jesus didn't need the new birth but we must have it that's right see so that would be a different sentence but we're comparing it to understand and bring it down to that place that's right all right so then the baptism of the Holy Ghost being the spirit of God that is what brings us into the family the spirit of God brings us into the family placing into us the tutor the Holy Spirit which is the spirit of almighty God so brother says you have in you by the new birth father Son and Holy Ghost in the New Birth you said well I don't understand that well I don't either but I just say what the prophet said I do believe that much of it to where I can can say all right see then the spirit of adoption see as I said he saying to the Romans that you have the spirit of adoption whereby you're crying by father see not telling them I keep repeating that where you'll remember it not telling them because they were Natural Born Jews that they were already in the family of God because the New Testament is the family of God the Old Testament read your Bible they're always called servants you better go back and read your Bible a little bit they're always called servants they were the servants they were not the children of God you said they were the family of God well that's just as a church as an example as a type but they wouldn't in the family of God like we are are see then the spirit of adoption is this tutor coming to raise or teach us the nature of the father amen then the Holy Spirit couldn't be another person so you can't have the father and the Holy Ghost two different persons it's got to be the same person amen that's what that man told me down at work one day he said well I I I like the way you talk and everything what he was was a Mormon and excuse me Jehovah Witness and he uh he said uh I see now that really that you understand that there's just two of them I said well that's not exactly the way I see it but uh you did get rid of one of them yeah I said why don't you just get rid of one more and me you be talking you know cuz we we have't understand it but that was just my point all right now I I want to get this into you and forgive me for just being blunt and talking like I did Wednesday but when it bues on you you got to get rid of it so forgive me of just being plain I tried to explain something this past Wednesday and explaining that I told you to please listen to that tape over and over and to not make a decision in other words until you get to the end of the tape because the end of the tape I was explaining it that when we're born again we're babies I don't care how big you are how old you are how grown you are how much knowledge you got amen I've explained it to you I had a very very uh I guess decent amount of understanding of the Bible before I came into the message because that was what I done I read and studied it you know and all and and then 2 years into the message before I received the new birth and all I was doing was reading and studying the message of the hour but I didn't call that the new birth just because I left the Baptist Church and come into the message and and you know and believing brother random was a prophet I didn't call that the new birth because to me it was not I had I knew that that was not right all right but then I watched people all the way down through in my life and the way I see it most people are trying to bring and I'll get down in a minute to the quote they're trying to make some form of rule or doctrine or or what would you call it something of this message and and and each little group has its way of saying it you know and you just listen to them and and you'd be surprised you'll see that that there's people in this message that still believe that tongues is the evidence and then they'll turn around say well I I know brother Bram didn't say that now I know he didn't but I believe that I believe it you see and they still believe that all right because it's not been revealed to them what's going on but there's people that believe in the message see that if you just dress right live right and do right that you're ready to go out of this world well now there's people in this world that a whole lot better off than we are and live better and act better that's right and you can't argue that point all right there's good Catholics that live better lives than you and I right I don't mind talking that way because it's the truth well no no no brother well see that's where you you don't understand me but you see what I think most people think that that here we are and and what we need to do we need to preach on hir and dress and clothes and you know men this away and the women that away and get rid of this and get rid of that and oh we're ready well now I admit that that make good people I admit that I believe that yeah but brother BR said you sisters don't think cuz you got long hair and dresses that makes you right come on see if you're born again and then that comes forth that's right been wonderful wonderful see now you're right that's right but babies start off as babies looking around to see what other people are doing babies don't look at their own selves to see what they're doing they don't learn looking at theirself they don't stand in the mirror and flex their muscles as I said you know to try to do like uh Arnold swash ner orever you pronounce his name you know see they look at other people and they'll copy other people they watch other people but when you're born again you're baby in Christ and you watch what everybody's doing now you don't grow in Grace and knowledge and get where you can look over what people's doing I didn't teach that I Ain never taught it I've taught if you and I grow in Grace and knowledge we can get to the place to look over not to look over it cuz it's not right to go out and do wrong that's where you get misunderstood see somebody cut it off don't listen to what you're saying babies look at what people do and judge by what they do and you know in a way that's a good point and you know babies have a right to do that cuz I've always said it if I saw you slap your child for smoking a cigarette and you stand there smoking one I might just get a little bit my rightous indonation might get up a little bit and I might kick in the shin I'm just honest you say you get mad no I wouldn't get mad I just get even with you because there's no we need of acting like that you're supposed to live before your children the way you want your children to live and not whip them for doing something you're doing and say you ain't going to do what I done we'll quit doing what you done I never done my children that way never have and I never will to whip them for something that I'm doing myself but I wanted them to live right well you start living right yourself cuz they're watching you okay but now listen see in doing it I I know it gets to the point but the way I see most people preach about adoption I've listened to them what a little bit I could hear because most people don't deal with it but most of them think that if we could preach long enough on dresses and hiring clothes that people would get adopted but I don't believe that it's just like I've always told you I believe if there 7 billion people in the world today and if every person in the world had to baptism of the Holy Ghost and was where the faith of the fathers was at they would still not be a change of the body whether you believe that or not it would be a good world to live in but it still wouldn't be the change of the body because it took the message or else why did the prophet bring it all right well the same way of what I'm talking about we can preach and we can preach about dos and don'ts and things and that's good there's people that's that's their point of preaching that's their doings you know but where will that ever bring us to the position to understand adoption it won't do it it's never done it yet all right and I wrote it down the best that I know how to write and I'm sorry see what I saw people do they try to beat the people into a place of try to beat the nature of the father into you now I don't believe in that I don't believe in it natural I don't believe in beating a nature of a father into a child I believe in whipping the child yes sir and I believe you're wrong if you don't see that's just the way I am not kill them get you good little hick and spank them and they they'll understand and that tries to help them make their nature right but that ain't going to beat your nature into it you better remember one thing your nature is displayed as I kept saying over and over daily before them if you want your children to act like you act like you're supposed to act is that plain enough everybody understand what I mean you live before them the way you want them to live then you can say well a child is acting just like the father or the mother see and that's wonderful all right but you can't beat it into and you can't beat the nature of God into anyone you know if you know I'm not talking about a stick beating I'm talking about taking doctrines and ideas and Concepts about clothes and hiring and dresses and stuff like that and just preach that preach that just preach that just preach that just preach well when they get lined up that we'll preach the Deep things but we got stay away from them deep things but see you can't beat the nature of the father into the children all right but why not do what the prophet as said had to do took him 30 something years to preach the statue of perfect man now did he just ever service from then on and I'm making a point so listen did he ever service from then on just preach we need this we need that we got to have this we got to have that we got to have this we got to have that was that his message no he went on to preach the doctrines of the Bible right the truth of the Bible not man's doctrines we've done confused it enough like it was I ain't talking about that I'm talking about he started preaching the word cuz he knew that only through the revealed word would we be able to ever attain unto anything right right that's all I'm trying to get you to see see why not preach the word bless God we preach it yeah that's about like that old man was that said you know said they said something to him saidwell why don't you preach on something besides acts 238 you know repent every want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in wrong he said well give me a scripture so man told him okay here it is John the Baptist standing down there and he had axe in his hand he said well that's wonderful a brother wants me to preach on that said I can do it said because John was standing down there with an axe in his hand now why did he have that ax in his hand only reason I know he had that a in his hands where he could cut away out into the into the river where he could baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see he couldn't get away that's all he could preach with acts 238 there was a time for that there was a dispensation for those things there's a dispensation of where you're learning of the message there's a dispensation of all kind of things and a time for that but now listen but see most ministers try to make you live up to a certain set of codes or doctrines yes instead of preaching the word of God all right now let's see what the prophet said let's see if that's what he said okay the message called us riseing of the sun 1965 4:18 the morning service page 11 look what he said I'm FR okay let's read now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting now he didn't leave his out so you do what you want to with it oh he was just trying to be humble okay he's humble I'm afraid today that too many of us us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life all right so we're not getting the people to Christ we're getting them to a Doctrine an idea or a thought or a concept it goes on down to number two power of decisions 3 55 10:07 and then that one where he's uh explaining about to people being just hungry licking your lips a different that's what's the matter with the church today it's anemia I guess I pronounce that correctly which means you're you know you need something to eat because they're not getting enough spiritual food if they got the Bible brother it would put the blood of Christ into the veins of the believer new life life comes from the blood amen the anemia condition of the church pitiful pale fa pale cheek my mind we need a transfusion to start us off amen all right now what do we need to work okay going beyond the camp 1964 30719 the evening service more and more I am made to believe that people are not getting to Christ now I'm here to try to help in every way that I can and make my statement as clear as I know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as I look and preach Across the Nation and watch the people I I I'm fully persuaded that the people are not getting to Christ I believe that it's the enemy that stroe this hindrance because the reason I believe this he is not the object that they had been pointed to now that means Christ that's Jesus not Satan all right they have either been pointed to a Dogma or doctrine or a party or experience or sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ to work that's why I think that people are resting their Eternal destination upon some Dogma or some sensation like some say I danced in the spirit or I spoke with tongues I I I felt fire run over me and do you know that all those things can be impersonated by the devil there just one thing that he cannot impersonate that's the word now what is he saying we're not getting the people to Christ Christ is the revealed word okay Christ is the revealed word amen see the letter of the word is not Christ Christ is the revealed word all right so now keep keep that in mind of what he's saying and he's saying we're not getting them to Christ we're getting them to some sensation some thoughts or ideas all right now if your dependence this day is upon the fact that you shouted spoke in tongues cried whatever You' done the prophet read these points you read them over if you're dependent upon that to say you have the new birth Satan can impersonate all of it okay well you're destroying my own I'm not destroying anything cuz I've never told you not to believe that I believe a lot of people receive the Holy Ghost and they spoke in Tong I believe a lot of people receive the Holy Ghost and shouted I believe a lot of them cried I believe a lot of them this that and the other I believe in that but I don't believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost just speaking in tongues shouting and whatever you're doing that's like the baby get the baby here first and then the baby cries the birth of the baby is one stage the next stage is the cist of effect but if your dependence is totally upon some sensation Satan can impersonate all right see and I wish to God I've always told you this you say but brother Dale you'll empty the church preaching that people needs to be born again well if I do then they know what it means they're not born again that's problem solved stage one but listen see I believe the new birth is is the birth of the word but then the sensations and the feelings and the signs the Wonders and the things you're doing to what you're saying that's what follows after the birth of the word right but you see a person that's living like the devil and then they claim these experiences and then they go on living like the devil there's something wrong get the baby changed you know word and then start on those things but brother I believe the message well amen but don't you think that the devil believes the message yes does that mean he's born again no see no that's that that that doesn't make it see we've got to have more than just some sensation or point or thought that's right we got to have the birth of the word right to be a child of God all right he said but I'm fully persuaded we're not getting them to Christ now but what are we getting them to I gave you there one on door and door is that the world will be judged by Christ and he's the word now the world won't be judged by a strong I mean a a Thompson Chain uh uh Scofield that's not exactly the way I look at it it's going to be judged by the word and Christ is the word I thought we believe that we would sit there with him and would judge the people that come forth yes I thought the bride would be sitting with him in judgment and see then a person can't deny you know anything because you're sitting there right and Flash in their mind has to would come back to the point to where you tried to help them and explain it to them all right and then they can't argue the point because there is the Living Word all right now brother brandom I believe is saying what we're not getting them to the alive person of the word which is Christ but the letter of the word as I've always told you has to be correct that was why the prophet had to come to bring us to that place all right see but now see people must be fed the word not the ideas of mankind because ideas of mankind only produce more ideas of mankind that's right all I don't like that today you know they'll say I know what's meant by it I know it but you know they'll say what's your input on this well I don't have no input input means I'm putting something in and I didn't think we're supposed to put anything in I thought we were supposed to draw out the word from God I didn't think he needed us to interpret or do anything he just needed us to stay with what he said that's right and believe it all right but you see it's going to be judged by Christ who is the word the alive word is what's going to judge people so then that's what we are here as the children of God we are the live word see but now see we we try to make some idea or some thought and and forgive me but I listen to people and I hear them you know and I I hear them never mention the the revelation of the word but oh yes they read the word yes they read the quotes yes they read the things of the Prophet but where are they talking about the word Made Alive in you where they're talking about God coming down and changing your nature I thought we supposed to have a nature change and I thought then even that after the New Birth that that was what we would to receive a total nature change that there was still something from things wrong with us that we needed to the statue of a perfect man we need the adoption but to do that we must have the revealed word all right but you see you take and forgive me but you see why in the message that you see people constantly changing churches and I'm not against you changing churches and coming here and I'm not not against you changing churches if you leave and go somewhere else I've explained that to you the only thing I ask you to do if you find more word somewhere else please come back and give us some contact with us you know at least make contact where we can can go with you or do something you know cuz I I I I want the word but you see that's why people are constantly changing it's just like you take a you notice a cow and you see a cow out and a pasture you know if they Knee Deep Grace you know never see around at the side of the fence with their head stuck out on the side of the road trying to eat the G right no am I right but if you see the pyer to where there's nothing in it old rack weeds and stuff growing up and bitter weeds and things you see the cows sticking their head through the fence right all right am I right now but if a beautiful P out there it's fertilized field and everything you on that's all growing they're not around the fence now you understand what I mean if people are fed the word they're not out hunting for the word they're not sticking their head through the fence but if you don't have enough for people to eat then they're going to stick their head to the fence and that's what I I kind of believe preacher are that they're afraid to let somebody else come in and preach cuz they might preach two bailes a Hy when they ain't never preach one to them themselves now you know what those carnal illustrations mean don't you they just preach little sugar tit things and little small thing line up and get your clothes right and somebody comes in and just takes and man that you know just takes and just dumps a whole load on you and man you just find out that there all kind of grains and wheed and corn and all that you can just eat e and just you know well no wonder the cattle want to leave and go somewhere El where they get something to eat all right why because you you get a little taste of it that's what the preachers are afraid of they're afraid to let somebody come in cuz they're afraid they'll lose a bunch of people you know that's true so there's no need of arguing with it it's not a point to argue see but now listen as a majority I just wrote it this way so I read it as a majority around the message most of the ministers are not trying to hand out spiritual food they're trying to build churches they're trying to build programs they're trying to do things and that's their business we don't have nothing to do with it all right and in doing that see they're not feeding their people and you see a lot of them running about the country and become evangelist on the field you know and going off and preaching and and they lose a lot of people because of that well see but then some of the one of the people two or three of them will come back and they really just Rejoice because you know they they think well they finally learned their lesson you know and I'm right anyway but that's nothing to me ain't going to help me one bit I'm just making a point do you believe you know the point's right words you know the point right I'm just making the point see all right but when you see somebody that has really tried to preach or to keep a you know keep the pyer up in real good shape to where the cattle can have plenty of food plenty of water you know you don't have much trouble of people running around we've had very little problems of people leaving for other things and you know some have left and and all like that but neither one of them will come back and say it was because of the word because everybody says little ain't nothing but word word word word word well that's thank God for that that's all I've ever believed that it's word word word but I want it revealed but we got to get it planted in the field that's right all right now but see that's why I've tried my best to preach to you the message and not just preach every service you know in clothes and dress and hiring cuz I seen years ago that that wouldn't do it I told you I asked brother Mo when he preached the statue of perfect man I asked him I said okay now how do we get these things and see the Lord spoke to me later and said by the opening of the word and I gave it back to you at the end of the message the prophet said with the restoration of the word will come restoration of power all right but I believe with that word being revealed is what we're to feed on and that's what we've been doing for 4 something years all right now think about it see we say but we preached one God we preach uh serpent seed we preach predestination we preached adoption but you know if if you're just just think with me just a simple illustration right I wouldn't ask for a raise of hands but how many maybe in adoption the series just learn something you didn't know before you know something was revealed to to you of the one God the water baptism he realized it couldn't happen before now come on I thought we believe predestination I thought you was listening when Brother D was preaching when I said the word is what comes predestinated eternally and there's a word for this age right brother Gary so if there's a word for this age and that word ain't been reveal to Brother Gary then we can't leave that's right amen but get the point of what I'm saying you do at least say God has revealed something to you recently right all right see then if he's revealed something to you recently not maybe me preaching or anybody whatever just God revealed you know that the time couldn't take place cuz there was a dispensation that was waiting for that to take place and if there's more to be revealed there's more word to be made alive right then the change won't come until the word is completely finished that's to be made alive there's their their thing it's the preaching of the word that's supposed to bring us up the stature of a perfect man it's the preaching of the word that's supposed to bring the nature of the father because I thought I gave you a quote in there were that that that Jesus I mean that God was his word now if he's his word then that's what I want reveal amen yeah and if there's something to be revealed to us then it won't take place until that's finished being revealed is that that sensible you you shouldn't need anything to help you understand that but you know yourself that I brought in a people brought in people to try to help you understand instead of trying to keep them away cuz I want you to understand and I know and realize sometimes that I I'm one that knows for certain that brother Dale's not all of the fivefold ministry I know that for certainty I believe in a fful Ministry and I tried to bring men to help you and to help me because you know I learn and I go listen to the five4 ministry cuz remember that's that's what we're to do all right but not just pound people about something but preach the gospel the scripture says the gospel is what the power of God unto salvation is that scripture the gospel is the power of God under salvation well then why have we not tried to preach the gospel of course everybody says they have right all that those that just still preaching 40 years ago they preaching high and dress and clothes they still preaching high and dress and clothes they say they're preaching the gospel well why didn't brother Ram was I said why didn't he just stop on the Statue of perfect man and just stay there preaching the statute of perfect man over and over for the next three and a half years or 3 years somewhere the life no he went on into the preaching of the word because he saw and real realiz the only way that we would be able to come to it would be what as he said this messenger Malachi Force to do two things what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers number one right he said and bring us the Revelation the seven the Thunders which is revelation containing the Seven Seals and these would be the things that would literally turn our hearts back so he knew had to go on preaching it and bring the message to us right see and that's all I've tried to do see not pound on you but try to preach unto you cuz preaching unto you the nature of the Father by the revealed word will bring the nature of the father in you when it's revealed to you because it's not going to do it for for pounding it's not going to take place that way all right you said well brother D give me scripture for that give me scripture for the fact that you believe that that through the opening of the word will bring these things to P well okay then if you look over in Romans 10 you'll find the scripture says what 1017 Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and we know the scripture said that is revealed from what faith to Faith see all right then listen then if you believe that we become a child of God by the revealing of the word which is what brother Bron said on number five on your notes there a paragraph 71 patus Vision 1960 1204 the evening says you're saved by Revelation and says the only way you can be saved is by Revelation he said other than that you got an intellectual see so if you can't be saved only by revelation of the word of God then you see why I believe and I believe that is true see then you see why did I believe that a child can only grow into the nature or a character of the Father by the revealing of the nature of the Father by the revealed word I believe that's what's taking place I believe the seals the things like that is revealing the nature of the father amen unto us by the revealed word we see people are say but brother Dale we preach these things well all right but is it fully revealed Has It produced the nature of the father right that's just as plain as it can be could it be we've tried to preach our own ideas about these things and call it revelation you said but I don't believe I don't believe Brother D preaching them deep things you get all confused and you confused to people no the people are already confused you're not going to get confused reading the word of Goden you're not going to get confused studying this message you're not going to get confused hearing somebody preacher the deeper things of the message you are already confused it's exposed our confusion all right I gave you some quotes where brother Brown said you must be born again he said it's not Sensations and things like that but you must be borned by the word born by the word conflict 1962 3 531 number8 on you know you mourn by the word read these real good and listen to what your Prophet has to say do you see what I'm trying to get you to see now I'm asking you do you see what I'm trying to get you to see I'm not asking you to believe me I never have asked you to do that see if we teach the word of God to the people then the Holy Spirit can make it alive that's right right now up to the 5old ministry now did your Prophet make these statements he said I break these down as big nuggets he said it's up to the 5old ministry to break it down to where it can be explained to the people now I didn't make them statements your Prophet made it right but see the Bible says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints until we all come to the unity of the faith right now so then we must have a five-fold Ministry well brother Dale what about these people see everybody wants to make an excuse what about these people that where they can't get to a preacher well you got a problem now cuz you can get an internet few years ago may have been a problem the God just takes them out of the way with what's cost you know science and and new things and he just brings things to where you can just turn on a computer and you can just listen to people right so there's no excuse now well we just can't get together where you know it's too far yeah and you got $100,000 laying in the bank account that that the world's going to fix to take away from you but you ain't going to spend it going to church that's all right no my business I ain't never asked for nobody no money people are surprised when they do on the internet and come back to us and we say no charge yeah but we want to do no charge why cuz we're not trying to get rich we're trying to spread the gospel and you know the reason why I told you here a while back we're trying to spread it because these preachers ain't going to preach it so I just opened up said okay loosen it up Let It Go on the internet then who wants to hear can hear call me in you want to but there's a lot of people listening today around the world and I hope that it's helping them and I've never asked one of them for a dime and never have told none of them to call me their Pastor I always direct them back to their pastor but you know what brother Brown said he said if your pastor won't preach the truth what' he say do now what' he say do come on somebody tell me what brother R said do said get away from him thank you so you know he said it well you're just trying to bust up churches I'm trying to get the word out all I've ever tried to do see because we have the inside teacher but brother Ram says that the holy spirit is sitting in you waiting on you to bring him the word well I thought he know the word see that's where you don't understand you ain't been taught for 40 years of truth of understanding you're still thinking well I thought he the Holy Ghost knows everything we don't need no teachers called got teacher inside of us the prophet said why did he put teachers in the body that's right now I wrote it like this brother brandom said on the message Ephesians parallels Joshua you've heard that over and over and over that's 196 5:15 the evening service where you'll know what it is number 10 on your notes he said preaching catches The Sinner now listen but he said teaching positionally places you in the body okay of course the teacher he wants to strut right there don't he but I'm going to just clip the strut out and under you cuz I don't believe it you call me a teacher I don't believe that I'm the only one that can teach I believe the fivefold ministry fivefold Ministry that is called of God all right everybody know what I'm saying the true fful ministry that's called of God each one of them is capable of teaching in the capacity of their office so brother random didn't label just the teacher here he didn't say just that read what he saying he said teaching positionally placed it he didn't say the teacher positionally placed you he said teaching positionally places you right he didn't label it down to hear in one person it's a five-fold Ministry and each one is supposed to be able to teach in the capacity that they're in so teaching positionally places you whether you're sitting under a pastor today and that Pastor is teaching you the word then you're exactly right in what the prophet said amen but then there is a teachers that are in the body of Christ that you know that the prophet said nobody can touch the teacher now he did label that did he say those things nobody can touch the teacher now he put it there he didn't say nobody can touch the teaching but here he's saying nobody can that the the teaching of the word is what positionally places you and I so the five-fold ministry is called for the perfecting of the Saints according to the scripture until we come to the UN of the faith that's why I believe in the five4 ministry that's why I bring in people to try to help you the five4 ministry because I know as I said I know and realize that I can't do it all by myself and it can't be done so you bring in somebody to try to get somebody to hell because that'll bring you to the place and we'll go with one that he did say the last one I gave you you looked at the last one to gave you I didn't say this he said you'll never live no higher than your pastor he said you'll never live no higher than your pastor well brother D this means we got to depend on yeah that's exactly right that means we got to depend on somebody but you know this is one Pastor that knows he's got to depend upon the other fivefold Ministry I've got to hear Faith don't come by reading Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God in other words a prophet would say hearing then by the revealed word that some preacher stands forth and preaches unto you all right so I believe that was placed correctly I don't know what you think about it but it's teaching that positionally places you yes not the teacher but then to reject the teacher is what's wrong with a lot of people that they can't teach themselves simple that ain't going to get me no opportunities to go anywhere and preach and I'm not going to do it I don't worry me that's why I opened up the internet because I've told you before see I thought Wade would be able to go I thought these other ministers would be able to carry the message cuz I realized what they were thinking about me intellectual all this that and the other but that's their business I don't I don't get offended at anybody because of that I thought W could go and carry the message but See's not much popular More than I am but because I've never taught you anything like that I've tried my best and you come and show me where I've missed it you come show me where I've ever taught anything to Prophet didn't teach that's an open challenge to the world that's why we haven't got into all these doctrines of Two Souls seventh thund virtues perusia the river Jordans the no Holy Ghost doctrines of son of mans and all of these other things because we just simply just tried to cluck alone here and the five-fold ministry here has been a wonderful help to me you know the ministers here to help me to understand and help preach to me you know and I thank God for them you know cuz they've been a help to me and that's what I depend on but see I don't believe that that preaching this this little things is going to bring the bride to Perfection let's stand come on brother mus this it's not going to do it it's going to take the preaching of the word that's what I've always believed that's what I've always tried to teach you because I didn't put it it own need in Mage where brother around said with the restoration of word comes restoration of power what you want want Power like I told you I've sat and talked with ministers I've listened to people over the years there's a group goes that way and they say we got everything when we believe good Baptist Doctrine they said they believe the message they got the Holy Ghost they got everything the other group goes this way and says we ain't got nothing well I I want to be somewhere in between there you know to hold on to the word of God and believe what we've got and don't deny what God has done Among Us amen we have seen the sick heel the dead rais we've seen rain come we've seen rain leave we've seen storms spoken out of existence we've seen all kind of things stand here all afternoon talk about them this documented to where that like we stood and walked right out here when they said the war started in Kuwait you remember that I walked right out here in the back room and I said according to what God just revealed to me we're not ready yet cuz see Kuwait was right there so close to Israel cuz that could cause War just like that with Israel had Israel jumped their bombs on Kuwait we would have been in a world war but they would frame they got kept them from doing it but I said we can pray because God showed me we're not where we're supposed to be so we can pray and ask God to bind all the forces of the enemy and that they will not be able to use their forces against us they were buried in the ground waiting on us to pass over them and then they were going to just run right up behind us and trap us and all kind of things but the Russians forgot to tell them that to bury those tanks in the ground meant the moisture would build up and they'd rust it wouldn't work the we lost more people by our own friendly fire in Kuwait than we did by the enemy why because I believe that the Lord told me to come out here and let's do that now I didn't just say it I said it I said now let's pray and that happened see those are documented just don't have to worry about it we're not talking about something that ain't documented but you see all I want to do is preach the word and God he'll have to reveal it cuz we can't reveal it anyway go ahead brother 597 that's father 597 anybody have a need than on

part after you're married what's going to go on if if if certain things certain things transpire but keep in the back of your mind really honestly truly being a Christian there's no such thing as a divorce right amen no such thing as divorce I mean we're we were always we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world we know all these other things happened down here that he divorced Israel and Mar what that that happened a long time ago right we were always his bride amen that's right we weren't not his bride and then we become his bride yeah down here in the Gentile age we did but now as far as in his mind he always had a s he that's one he was looking for the whole time all right so just keep that in your mind and as as Brother D brings the U the series on marriage and divorce let's turn to Ephesians 5 and read the scripture here and we'll make a few announcements while you're turning to the scripture or looking on the board remember to uh coming up next month that's already announced but may the 19th there be a fellowship meeting of brother pageant we plan on going for Lord willing May the 6 June and I will be that weekend we'll be at Brother Richard

to witch time we need to plan on going and not wait 5 minutes before we leave the plan we need to start making plans now same thing with downstairs Richard has made us a um a sign up sheet for the Financial Peace University class that we're going to start in July if you're going to attend you need to put that down because we need to start ordering the kits for it even though now we can get a better discount now than when we wait till till we get closer to it so uh the Lord bless each and every one of you in that and then remember June 14th 15th and 16th we'll have the um annual third annual fishing trip for all the the young men and and all the adult men in the church so just keep that in your prayers we'll start planning it and getting it ready I think we kind of know that one kind of comes together pretty good so we we've got that one down path so let's go to the Lord in prayer and ask him to bless Heavenly Father we pray that you'd be with us Lord just one more time Lord you've put us on this Earth Lord to be an example for you father and I know that we fail you every day but Lord there has to be a time that we come together under this present day truth that we have that you told us what to do you've you've instructed us on the things that we need to do you've instructed us us on things to help our life you've instructed us on things to help our finances you you've given like you did the children of Israel Lord you've given us a lot of things but sometimes we turn them away sometimes we commit iniquity because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity spouse from our mother's womb a liar but Heavenly Father you saw Grace and sent a sent your son Lord to take care of that to put us under that bleach blood that made us Lord Justified us Sanctified and filled us with the Holy Ghost and made us children of God lord we have to look to that Lord the author and finisher of our faith the one that did it all for us Lord so now as we live under your blood father you still give us things that we're supposed to do Lord you gave us Commandments and you gave us promises and things to to go by and walk thereby you gave us rulers and governors Lord to to teach us and and give us Lord admonition and father we pray today Lord that you would just come and just give us Lord the words the say to the people and may it be said in in the honest of our heart let it be taken in the honest of Heart Lord take it and study it and and live it Lord and and Lord we know we have to be in this body Lord until we're changed or till death will set us free so we have to learn to live in this body we know that it was that it commits sin every day you said through the prophet we'll read it in just a little while Lord that we sin every day but father you gave us an advocate you covered our sins Lord and not just covered them this time you've totally eradicated them Lord but it's got to come through the word of God not just being Lord lip service it's got to come from a knowledge a holy ghost knowledge that you truly have forgive us of our sins Lord today we pray that you'd be with the young people that you'd bless them Lord the ones that are looking for a spouse the ones that's looking for a companion in life Lord may they may they find one that's pleasing to you first and then pleasing to them father we pray that you'd be with us now take care of us heal the sick the ones that are not with us Lord bless them take care of them Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign field give them fruit for their labor father we pray today Lord if anybody's sick among us you said you sent your word and healed them and deliver them from their destruction so father we pray that as the word Goes Forth that we'll be healed and that we'll be Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord just give us a refilling this morning we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen all right let's go to Ephesians 5 and that's what we've been reading on so we're still on choosing a spouse we went through two of the three things we went through the planning stage and the looking stage now today we're going to go into the praying stage and then I'm going to give you some things to do not do as you're choosing your spouse all right and if you're not if you've already chosen your spouse maybe it'll help you teach somebody that hadn't chose their spouse you know to be able to uh as parents be able to sit down and be able to talk to the kids and and may it be a Bible talk may it be something that you can go back into the word of God and tell the people tell your sons and daughters that hey this is the way if you'll do this this is the way God said we're going to have troubles and trials and tribulations but if you'll do this it'll surely make your life a lot easier all right so verse 28 of Ephesians 5 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen for no man ever hated his own flesh but isth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word we pray truly today now I'm going to give you a little bit of a warning for this afternoon when we get into the this is the choosing or the courtship part but when we get into the dating part this afternoon uh there's going to be some things said that you may you know you may need to have to explain it to the 10 and 11 year olds but I'm going to have to say things to help you not to go down a certain Road there certain things that we need to talk about so I I hope we're all adults and like brother R said I hope we're all godm minded all right and we know that we still live in this body and there's lust of the flesh things that we have to keep under control all right Paul you know Paul said I keep under my body under control all right for the glory of the Lord but he was a born again Christian right that's the problem we get people that maybe are not born again they can't control this man cuz there's no man to take to take over to keep control that's why you shouldn't marry an unbeliever all right so now let's look at the kind of a background of what we were talking about we were talking about the three stages of choosing a spouse now this is pretty much the courtship part you say the courtship part dating is when you find somebody I you've honed it down to one person right all right this praying and looking and planning stage is the stage where you're looking and you're you're plan you're making the plan and you're looking for that person and you're praying about it that's the courtship part we think the courtship part is the dating no the courtship part is trying to find one yeah what's a court out here courtship you're looking around trying to find you a spouse you're looking remember we talked about planning I hope you didn't uh felt a little resistance from some people that sometimes were too carnal but I triy to bring you some scriptures where Paul and would saying look I I I got a Mark that I'm looking toward I've got a place I'm going right he had a plan yeah he didn't just say God don't want us to look God wants us to be led by the the Holy Ghost but he don't want us to sit down in our seat at home today and say God I know I got the Holy Ghost you said you'd be my teacher now I'm going to close my eyes and you just teach me and I'm just going to sit right here and you're going to bring me my food and you're going to bring me my cash and you're going to bring me this that's not it exactly we are living breathing human beings amen we have a brain we were made in the image of God even in a fallen condition we were made to be little creators look at all this this come from trees this once was a tree right 90% of this building was once a tree right and then this here was chemicals that come out of the ground right right car and all the things like that what you have on today come from a plant no if it's cotton there polyester then man put two or three things together and made polyester but cotton come from what the Earth all right now God give man cotton but then he give man the ability to take that cotton and make it into clothes right amen so what am I what am I saying uh you can say what you want to about planning if you don't plan like I said last Sunday if you fail to plan your plan will always fail in anything you do in life right anything you do in life I I see that that Paul had a plan he had a goal oh he had a mark he said and I press toward that Mark well he found the Mark didn't he amen well God didn't just pick him up and St him in the mark he said I run that I may run to the end right not run to fail all right plan remember we talking about this background for last week set a goal know what you want write it down young man write down on a piece of paper what you want your spouse to be right now look it doesn't start with whether they're skinny or fat amen Little Tim said I want a skinny one well I me you I said desire that's okay but look for character amen look for character right amen we might have all started out skinny at one time but things happen amen gravity takes over and pushes whatever here down there so at once you know like sister Gail said she had this lifeguard that she married right well it looks more like a beach ball now my but he's your that's right but listen we must look me too I mean he's not much bigger than I am but look what's the first thing we do we start going with looks and is she this and is he that that's not what we're talking about right character is what we're talking about right somebody that has Christian values and character amen how many of us now you know you can hold your hand if you want to but how many of us married somebody that wasn't in the message I did right Terence did we got a lot of people did right well you know that's okay but like I was telling you that was a long time ago 30 years ago for me 32 coming up folks we're closer to the end now than ever yes at least we're 32 years closer than when I was so you better if you're coming up of age you young men you got to not make as many mistakes as we do and I think God has give us people to teach you that right that you don't make those mistake those mistakes that we made all right right exactly so that's why this afternoon we're going to talk about the dating stage but right now we're still in the choosing a spouse we're choosing we're looking we're we're planning we're writing down what we want we want our spouse to stay at home or is it okay for her to work are we going to have children in the first year are we going to have children in the fourth year we going to have this write those things down write it down and look at it right study it take the Bible take the prophet's message we give you all the quotes you'll have all these all these um messages have got all this attached to so if you ever want to go back to it make your little book of it I don't care what you do with it brother Joe's going to make a um an MP3 just of that so that if you want to listen back to it you can and refer back to it right uh be good for the young people to do it again but look we were talking about setting a goal but now the goals you set has it reveals your choice reveals your goal so what you choose right should reveal what your plan or your goal was right right okay and we're going to talk about some of those things not to to look for today now let's go to Philippians 3:13-14 that's what we talking about Paul was planning Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark right he had a goal he had a plan he had something to do Paul did I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God God in Christ amen so his goal was to what put Christians in the in heaven or whatever you want to say put put Christianity to where that you can have what he has all right same thing with choosing of a spouse you don't want to choose a spouse that's wrong right when you're looking the word look means to turn one eyes toward something when you say look what do you do you're looking you turn your head but remember when you turn your head now you need to turn it toward a real believer not somebody that's sat in the message to you for 15 20 years 5 years 2 years character loyalty love and where they come from that's what we talked about before amen was very important all right know what you're looking for know what you're looking at right look is to turn one eyes toward something now let's start with the praying part praying means to make an Earnest petition and it's not God I want this woman can you give her to me no don't start your prayer that way right God I'm looking for a Godly woman don't put a name on it I'm looking for this kind of person Amen in my goals and my plan I'm looking for this kind of person and after you planned and look for that one person and found her now you have to pray so you're heading toward the dating processor all right you're heading toward it there's some things I want to show you when we get into the dating that brother brand says do not do when you take the dating sequence is the very very serious part all right this courtship part is not so very serious because you're looking you know you we always call it testing the water yeah but remember there's sharks in that water yeah so be careful of the Sharks and the water so we'll talk about that in just a few seconds we we'll do that and actually the next one coming up but after you've planned and looked for that one person and found him or her now you have to pray not just a short prayer thank you Lord you gave her to me yeah thank you Lord no you pray pray through on the matter the prophet said trust the Lord but be willing to accept and no or not now because remember what I always say God's knows are the best yeses you can have amen God tells you know that's the best yes you'll ever get cuz if he tells you know he knows what's going to happen in your in your future you don't if he says no he knows if he says yes he's not like us as as Earthly parents we might say yes and then wish we' have said no about two weeks later or a month later or two months later but God is a perfect parent if he says no he knows if he says yes brother Eddie somewhere down the line you're going to mess up but if he says no he's keeping you from that all right everybody understand that God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever have all right let's go to First quote and listen what brother Brown said about this marriage is Honorable but it should be entered prayerfully and reverently and genuine love for that woman will bind you together forever what you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven amen when you walk down the street Yonder she may get old and gray and wrinkled but that same love you had for her when she was a young beautiful girl you'll still have it amen you may get stoop shouldered baldheaded wrinkle fa and everything else but she'll love you just like like you did when you stand with wide shoulders and curly hair if it's really God right for you're looking at the time when you've cross the river Yonder when you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever amen I think we forget that part right I I I told I tell many people when I go out and Minister I say you older people you're closer to being young than we are right right you're closer to being young I know you get up and you ache and you pain and you hurt and all these things are going on but remember that's the part of you that's groaning to get back to that young person that's inside of you right same way with you and I we should be we should not set our LIF time gold that well we're just going to grow old together and that's it no we grow old together so that we can be in heaven together amen so that we can be in eternity together all right and is if you pick the right one let's go God's Eternal promise what what's his eternal promise that you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever that's God's Eternal promise he said he would do it he not only that would get to an Ament he swore he would do it amen so God swore that if you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven remember he said that when we are joined together that it's done it's finished right remember the Lord said whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven let's go to number two H certain sound a man nowadays getting married you young fellas you better pray a long time ask God to give you a companion you young women the same way cuz it's so uncertain number three why it's alarming no wonder the home life is gone see any home life that's not stable what I said told you about marriage about divorces and all this stuff you just don't it's not stable I don't care how good you think it is oh yeah right I don't care how good you think it is well me and my ex-wife we get along just fine no you don't if you did you'd still be married to her yeah and vice Vera I mean her problem I mean ain't just her problem to you you got a problem to her too there always two sides of this thing any woman that's going to marry a man any woman is going to marry a man and she's not certain of that man she better leave him alone right and any man that's going to marry a woman that's why we go through these stages we go through the courtship and the dating process you better leave her alone you better pray through on it until God gives you the answer right and then what God joins together let no man put us under but we first we must pray through on that yes I think we'll have one more choosing of a bride you need to read that book I think today what's got so many divorce cases now that we leave the world in America in divorce cases yeah we lead the rest of the world I mean we got drive-thru divorces now yeah 299 you go up to the window and tell them you want a divorce and you get a divorce but we made it so easy why because it's just so easy hey me and my spouse don't get along with let get a divorce yeah there's more divorces here than anywhere else this nation and supposed to be and thought of a Christian Nation what a reproach our horp I think the reason of it is because that men got away from God and women got away from God and we find that if a man prayed now look how many times he said pray you ought to look this up how many times brother R talks about a man praying and a woman praying for a spouse if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter not just look at a pretty set of eyes or how big strong shoulders or such as that or some other worldly affection but would look first to God and say God is this your plan amen oh so God's got a plan right I read you that last Sunday Christ mystery God reveal brother said God had a plan and a purpose so God's got a plan right amen and if we would study we study about everything else but sometimes it's hard for us to study about getting married yeah and if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married when we choose our wife our husband if we'd study over it a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life Remember The Vow is until death do we part that's what I said if a Christian man marries a Christian woman it's till death do you part there's no separation there's I mean you can separate for a time but we brother Dale get into that you know about well you can actually cause cause your wife to commit adulterine right and you're held accountable for it all right right right Remember The Vow is until death do we part and he could ruin his Life by making the wrong choice but now look when we get to the end of this this afternoon there's a thing called Grace yeah and we'll cover that also all right cuz a lot of us needed it cuz we're not sitting here in with a perfect marriage condition right right well you can admit it or not you say Amen but I know your life so but if he knows what he making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyway then it's his fault right yeah you can't blame nobody else right it's your fault but if a woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong right so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through amen all right everybody understand thatly that's pretty that's pretty pretty blunt from a prophet praying all right let's go to the next one the object of praying is to find the will of the Lord not to find your your will right find the will of the Lord right then say yes Lord that's right see this will help get the fleshly motives and objectives out of the way cuz God's not dealing In the Flesh right when you pray he's not dealing In the Flesh amen you're you're praying spiritually to a spiritual God but he knows your fleshly condition so therefore he is he's a perfect father if we'll listen to him all right listen to number five Prophet Elisha now that's that's what we do sometimes look at this sometimes we go off on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God not pray over it ask the Lord whether we should do it or not and we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off you ever read that quote our supply of blessing is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why I can't have no more blessings you don't watch you let down in your prayer life you say well I'm a Christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever amen read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering God about it remember what daddy always says you come up and you say brother Dale I'm going to buy this brand new car what do you think Lord bless you you already made your de you're not asking me my opinion you're telling me what you're going to do you're just asking for a stamp of approval right of what you're fixing to do buy something like that or anything you need to just you need to say hey if a situation comes up it's like brother Brown said one time he said people believe me while I'm in the pull pit yeah he said but out here in in Family Matters he said they don't listen to me right like that brother that I told you about that brother AR that that uh Lord Brother Brown the Lord through brother Brown told him said you should never handle your finances well why go see somebody if you're not going to do what he says right exactly he wasting time but I'm sure you know what brother Brown probably knew that I mean he discerned that that man was so stubborn and that's a lot of our problem we're so stubborn we don't we don't consider that if brother Dale is our pastor and he's the one that's supposed to be our leader and we go off and do something off the wall because we feel good about it or or we we get all upset about it and then you say well yeah he's my pastor but yeah we we'll handle this one no I don't know about that that's right ask him shall I do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you right he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you could be another human being wow he might not give you a vision but he will speaking some way to you to let you know and look where I underline that if you'll be sincere asking right there's the part be sincere and ask him I need an answer to this question and be sincere all right number six questions an answer see brother talking about waiting on a vision God doesn't deal with in Visions with many people right so therefore I wouldn't advise you to do that see don't sit and wait for a vision if you can never had one okay you may still be sitting there for a while God may give you a vision that's okay but look at what he says God deals with us different read that so I would if I was in your place and didn't have visions from before the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make right and then way you feel led to do it then wait B see that Lord now you tell me and then way you feel to do it then wait just a little bit right then wait a little longer that's right and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter now that's where we should start that right amen it doesn't matter Lord but I want to know what you want me to do about it and then he says that's the way he does in meetings he'll wait and he'll get the feeling of the Lord and then he'll follow that way that's a way to do it cuz it's in prayer then you do the the best you can even the best we can we make mistakes we know that but if we'll follow this plan of prayer wait wait a little longer so we're praying waiting wait a little longer all right now let's go to here before we enter the dating phase let's look at some clear dos and don'ts now these are going to be wrote down on the paper here so you can see them you don't have to write them down cuz little they're a little lengthy but I brought in some scripture and I also brought in some quotes to back it up of some dos and don'ts and not heeding to These Warnings could lead to disaster in your life so this is very important these should be discussed before a serious relationship begins amen all right let's go number one do not date an unbeliever now brother bandam said he never told you to date an unbeliever he said do not date an unbeliever right all right second Corinthians says be you not unequally y together with unbelievers right for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with Darkness amen oh but she comes to church her actions will prove what she is right or he is all right let's look at number seven quote here be certain of God and then in this wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and Mar a siner he's talking about Ahab and Jezebel I tell him Brother Anderson I met a girl yesterday came to the car lot her name was Jezebel yeah I told she was from Puerto Rico I said you know what they did to Jezebel in the Bible don't you she said yeah I know everybody told me but my mother named me this I said well okay all right I think I change it but he married Jezebel and she was not a Believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever now look under no circumstance cuz we're going to see in just a few minutes or later on this evening that that here's the famous quote well I'll date them or I'll start seeing them so I'll get them to come to church or get them to become a Christian you watch what brother rown says about that he says the Hound of Hell's out for you if you do that no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstance should always marry Believers but Ahab had done this evil thing and no doubt but what Jezebel was a beautiful woman and he'd fall for what she looked like instead of what she was so many people make that same mistake to this day she brought idolatry in the nation on the people she actually look at that the people the priest their ministers everything fell victim to Jezebel cuz he married an unbeliever all right number eight just like today when a Christian boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a Christian boy that starts something right then see don't you get married unless you're equally yolked together with Believers you know to keep trouble down now look read this next one when God made man men and women in the beginning he made their Spirits then there's someone for you just wait see all right now let's go to the next one number nine AIA was the son of Ahab and that's what he's talking about his father had made married out of Fellowship married a woman that was not a Believer and that's all that always makes a bad home for any kid to be raised in that when unbelief and Faith tries to mix together now I don't know if some of you have unbeliev and husbands and unbelieving wives but they somewhere you going to have to deal with this with your children because if you're iniquity cuz if your iniquity of knowing to do better not doing it or not praying about it passed down to your kids yeah uh brother Brown said that I think I got a quote this afternoon it shows that brother Brown says visited iniquity is from the parents to the children talks about being a a a flapper and then a course girl course girl flapper prostitute right on down so it keeps falling all right because of the because of the generations I'm sorry that's just what it is but remember we're no good no not one we're not throwing stones in anybody but there's somewhere you going to have to deal with this cuz any bad home or any kids raised in this home brother say is a bad home yeah when unbelief and Faith tries to mix together now if the father had been a real strong man in his faith the child might have had a better opportunity but he didn't he didn't have he knew that there was God he knew there was Jehovah then his mother's God and so forth he was all confused and after the death of his father this boy in this condition kind of mixed up one way or the other and if that ain't a picture of the lands today one in the family is this way and one another and one going this way and one going that way now you could be married and that happen oh yeah you better be careful don't be looking at people sitting here with s that are single no you better be looking at your own life right one going this way and one that way no wonder we are producing we are producing so much juvenile delinquency right and all other kinds of stuff under the name of Christianity right it's because there's no Unity there's no real call out and stand for God Amen that's your prophet argue with him all right so never never never start a dating relationship with somebody you know you can't have right amen so if you start dating an unbeliever you not supposed to have that person so don't don't get yourself mixed up in it don't let emotions begin to take hold God cannot and will not bless this situation because of that quote that I showed you look in first Corinthians this says be not deceived evil communication corrupts good maners now look in the in the U NIV version then I pull this out the NIV version this is what it says about that scripture bad company corrupts good morals yeah right you hang around Bad Company long enough it's going to destroy your morals been there been there thank you be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners that's why you don't hang around you not you don't hang around people that tell dirty jokes you don't hang around people that do all the talks about all these things of the world and and these movie stars and all that stuff why it's evil communication and it shouldn't be a part of anything you listen to you should walk away from that junk sh your very parents of evil we'll we'll get into that a little bit later on all right let's look at a quote on that and see so it is I watched many times the wolf after the deer now here it is right here yeah if he can catch a little deer out of it that's the one they work on there's a lesson if he can catch a deer that's why the that's why animals her together yeah there's power in numbers right amen but now what happens is there's one will get out over here and think he's doing a little better than the rest of them and he can outrun the cheetah or the leopard well watch this there's a lesson if he can catch a deer away from the herd what let an unbeliever go out with an I mean let a Believer go out with an unbeliever right same scenario that's what the devil wants to do so you young ladies he wants you to go out with a boy that's not a Christian you too young man he wants you to go out with some little pain in Jezebel that's not a Christian right that's where he wants to break you up that's where he wants to he wants to Sock his teeth into you and this little deer will get out to itself away from the herd that's the one the wolf works on and to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from believers yeah hello somebody people say I can stay at home hello that's right that ought to hit a bunch of y'all sitting here today CU they're not going to see you tonight this afternoon I can stay at home be just as good Christian as I can what the prophet say right here I want you to read this yeah say it again so you're fooling yourself if you think you can the Bible said not forsake our assemble together and that much more we see the time coming if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are amen and fellowship with other Christians right so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life that's right you read that can't do it you can smirk and smile all you want to you can't do it you cannot do it I I'm I'm Brother Richard Marlo is he here he see it BL his hard he's been sick this weekend but his son I got a burden on my heart for that boy amen he he just needs to get around some Believers yes so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to the table I just I'll never eat I just I ain't going to do it see you got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one a mother another we do need a mother we need one another more now than we ever did amen when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them that's making yourself just a little different when you single yourself out from the rest of them making yourself a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're going on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church that's the success of my meetings is because real godly people pray for me right I wanted to put that in there but pretty clear Bad Company corrupts good morals all right let's go to the next one number 11 but now when he comes down and make fellowship with Ahab and he get in trouble now Ahab and when you take the world is trying to find fellowship with you just remember there's a rabbit in the W wood pile somewhere right when you take that little cigarette smoking boy that wants to take you out at night time young lady you chis Pentecostal girls that little Drinker and his hair comb down slick enough to hold his mouth open you reckon he saw that somewhere I think he did let me tell you something now there's something in the making right he says I'll marry you dear and then I'll join your church right he's a lying to you right if you if you love if you loves you and loves the Lord should be a PE I guess he will do it then he don't have to take you that's right and you men you young boys with some of these little p up Jezebels the same way you shouldn't do that shame on the pastor that fails to say that in the church so we said it we are called out separated different people Sanctified to the Lord in Israel all right sure the Bible said the devil would do it that in the last days and that's exactly what he's doing what he's separating he's taking unbelievers and Believers and putting them together all right let's go to the last one number 12 any time evangelism God wants his people be separated from unbelief and unbelievers so many of you people make a mistake in this sometimes letting your children play out here a little Oswald or you can put whatever name you want to in I guess oswal was popular back them see I don't mean to be different now and start you and so forth and be some kind of fanatic I don't mean that but you let a you be sure your daughter goes out be sure who your daughter goes out with at night time right see maybe you raised her a goded little old girl around the church and the first thing you know she gets out with Oswald or some of them and he's an atheist unbeliever and her life will come up ruined and you don't know what he is right you see then he'll marry her and look for your kids or your grandkids then you see be careful God wants his people to be separated all right number two you cannot marry a divorced person with a living husband now that ought to be self-explanatory Brother D was going to cover this but I thought I'd br bring it out in here in the dos and don'ts so don't even don't even yoke yourself up with somebody that's been divorced so cuz you can't marry them amen and he saith unto them in Mark 10 whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another right committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be buried to another she committeth adultery all right let's go to Matthew this is Jesus speaking it has said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I said un you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication we're going to talk about that this afternoon not this morning but this afternoon causing her to commit adultery causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commit adultery amen all right so that's pretty cut and dry we know we got we have Grace but listen to this we wouldn't need Grace if we' quit marrying unbelievers right well I mean we know we always going to need Grace but I'm talking about for married and divorce cuz remember two Christians don't divorce right now brother Brown is there any Scripture permitting marriage after divorce this is very important it says important well that's the reason it wasn't pertaining to this cuz that's the question aners on the seal as far as I can see my brother or sister whoever it may be there isn't unless your companions dead because the Bible said we're bound to them as long as they live so as far as scripture he don't have scripture that's it you've done took an oath over that you see so I don't think there is but as far as myself I don't find any in other words there's no scripture to say that so there's no reason for you to be dating or even looking at somebody that's been divorced sorry you can't do that right okay it's just one of them definite definite knows right now if he takes you in deception or she takes you in deception there was a a pointing case brother forny was telling me and this this brother was dating this sister and she was like from New York and she had moved down to whatever South Carolina North Carolina I can't remember it wasn't in Brother Jules church but it was something he was dealing with and the brother was dating her she said there's nothing in my life everything's okay so they made the vow to get married got married and on the wedding night if you understand what I'm saying he found out she wasn't a Virg she confessed that night that she had been with several men and that she even had a child that night the man immediately got up left wherever they were drove back home and had somebody come and pick that girl up now see what you see what you get into right now he's got a legal right mhm right and a Godly right and a scriptural right to put that woman away and marry somebody else and God never never worry about him being he's not double married though he went through all that cuz it was under a vow and she had committed fornication but he did it immediately he didn't wait till 3 days later after the honeymoon you understand what I'm saying right at that moment immediately he gets up and goes home tells that woman go get your daddy come pick you up and the of course it was all done separated and the the woman left but see you really don't hold things back you need to talk exactly talk about these things she said well I was afraid you wouldn't date me he said well you've already messed yourself up anyway you were messed up before I found you right and now you put me in a bad situation even though he's clean to do what he wants to do he still got that stuck in his brain right okay so and you can't even man someone that's been engaged right remember the sacredness of The Vow let's go to number 14 brother Brandon what is the meaning of an nor daddy read this one but let's read it again are people free to marry or is it just another word for divorce I'd like some information on this sure they're married long as they take that vow they're married just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith so you should be going through the planning looking praying dating before any of this is discussed as far as hey let's get married yeah okay and the asking part should be right at the very end right amen she's just as good as married her the only thing the law does it gives you a bill and rights to live together to keep from being common law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I'll marry you honey I'll take you for my wife will you take he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow amen there's not no preacher can marry you Mistry nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you're married and a little lady if you promise to marry that boy you're obligated to do it if you marry another after that obligation you will from now on anyhow you'll be living in adultery right and notice now see she's she's pure as a lily as far as her virginity far as her natural virginity right she's just committed to say I'll marry you and then breaks it off brother BR said that's is just the same name has commit an adultery right amen from now on you'll be living in adultery she goes and marri somebody else she'll be living in adultery right it's very serious young kids it's very serious I I wish we'd all had somebody sit down and explain this to us before we started doing what we did and notice the same thing to a boy promising to marry a woman don't you make your vow to anyone unless you mean to stick with it remember there's the Bible for it Joseph promised to marry Mary you have to keep your vows when you promise a woman that she's a sacred little vessel and that's to bring child life into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her amen so you can't marry somebody that's been engaged right everybody got that amen okay number four here's the one I can change him or her after we're married this is Satan's life dating or marriage is not a witnessing opportunity right amen it's not a witness tool do not play with this idea IDE right you will get burned right pray for people witness to them invite them to church but do not use yourself as bait amen right oh if I could just get him to go to church with him yeah I'm just telling you what the prophet said let let's go through number 15 vasion of the United States let's read the the quote part just save time you take a man that's a good moral man and let him marry a little woman that ain't worth a dime it isn't long till he ain't worth a dime either right that's what happened to Ahab take the same vice versa let a nice little woman marry an old man that ain't worth a dime first thing you know she's doing the same thing he is how could I go this morning and point my hands on little broken up homes and things like that where lovely little mothers come into a drinking dad and things like that and thought they could do something with them right and now the whole mother and all of them is drinking and going on it's environment right all right next one now but when he come down and made fellowship with Ahab then he got in trouble now Ahab and when you take the world is trying to find fellowship with you just remember there's a rabbit in the wood pile I read this one before but I'm going to read it again cuz there's another emphasis to this when you take a little cigarette smoking boy you want to take you out at night time young lady you Pentecostal girl that little Drinker his hair combed down slicking up the hold his mouth open let me tell you something now there's something in a making see there's something in a making I'll make you dear then I'll join your church he's lying to you folks if you loves you and loves the Lord he'll do it then yeah he don't have that's why I said don't use yourself as bait you're not bait brothers are sister invite them to church invite them witness to them but don't yoke yourself up with them everybody got that amen you sure okay now please don't do that number five you don't really like this one watch out for spoiled or selfish people I'm going to read you what the prophet said about it okay if you don't mind then we're going to get to the last one and this one is very serious I see too much of this flirting going on all right this one though is is watch out for spoiled or selfish people sometimes I wonder if we intellectual Americans has enough discernment to discern right from wrong yeah especially Juvenile Courts prove that we haven't got it to discern right and wrong for our children they seem to have a good psych psychologist answer for instance like this if jior comes up to popping Stomps his little feet and screams out and shakes his head and says Dad I don't care what you say I want a hot ride that's typical America and the father says all right Junior I'll buy it for you you could say to that Dad why did you do it oh I love him yeah you remember dad junior is going to grow up to be a man someday and he'll marry and have a family listen to what the Propet said God help that wife that lives with a boy that's been brought up like that to have his way about everything he wants right can't discern right from wrong y'all didn't know the prophet talked about all this did you can't discern right from wrong that's not love that's pure ignorance right amen it's Prophet saying this not me okay the Bible's right spare the rod and you spoil your son all right is that all of that one yeah I think that's all of that one no yeah you spoil your son same way with the girls flip-flopping same way with the girls all right same way with the girls we don't want no we don't want no people that are spoiled yeah if you'll pray you'll get all these things away from you but I listen to the last one this is the last one on the on the page here flirting brother Brown talks a lot about flirting the Bible talks about flirting yeah people flirting is wrong flirting is wrong amen you know what you're doing flirting means you're coming as close and you as you can to something without crossing the line right that's dangerous right cuz the closer you get to that's what I telling y'all if we know something's wrong and we try to live right on the edge of that yeah you know the man walked up to the devil one time and he was sitting on the fence God was on the other side he walks up the man walks up and start talking to the devil and and he tells the devil said or God was over here with with a man well the man walks over close to the devil and says hey why you sitting on the fence he'd been wishy-washy in a lot of things you know you talking about sitting on the fence cuz you don't know which way to go or the other Satan just looks at him and say well I own the fence I own the fence so stay away from the fence right stay away from the line you see where the line is don't get right up close to it that's right if you are flirting with the world you don't intend on crossing the line but you're trying to get as close as you can yeah and wanting to experience as much of it as you can without getting caught by it right flirting hurts both parties involved by giving fault hope think of a young man that you got a flirty little girl and and she flirts with this boy and she don't care no more about him and nothing but she wants to get something out of it that's what you do you get something it's your own emotion when you flirt you're getting something out of it yourself right right it's selfish go back to that selfish person you get false hope all right listen what brother R says where's our strength gone say Samson now here's here's Samson watch what he do Samson did real well he got a good start and he did all right until he began to flirt right and when he began to flirt he got in trouble that was his first step of backsliding y h I believe tonight the first step of backsliding to the church when it begins to flirt with what unbelievers yeah right all right listen we're not supposed to be stuffed shirts we're not supposed to be think we're different but we are different right we are different live in this world different we are different we're supposed to present something that that no one else can live right but you don't have to go out there and think you're up here and there down here right cuz at one time remember you were down here all right first step was backsliding you see that that fisting woman there was one problem with her she was an unbeliever Delila was flirting also yeah we'll read in just a minute she was flirting also and what happened was she really didn't want Samson as a husband she didn't want him right she wanted to know where his strength was she didn't care about the man Samson she wanted to know how is he killing so many of my people cuz she was Philistine remember and he go kill all the Philistines she wanted to know how she was what she was trying to find a way to help her Philistines and herself and not help Sam all right yeah so you remember that Isaiah 3 and 6 moreover the Lord said because the daughters of thine are hoty what is the daughters of Vine right am man Bri the bright right are Hy and walk with stretch forth necks you know why you walk with stretch forth neck cuz you got on about 3 in heel right some of you do it too so you need to stop yeah right cuz out you're doing you're doing this and it's pushing this out and this back right right they're not comfortable please it's not walking on nail no don't tell me it's comfortable it can't be and wanting eyes we'll get into that this afternoon what that word w mean walking and mincing as they go you can't walk in a pair of high shoes without mincing right twisting right making a tinkling with their feet amen wow all right let's go to Proverbs 6 for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and the reproofs of instruction or the way of life that's what we're trying to do today to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman right lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with their eyelids what do you do when you flirt yeah yeah ain't that true yeah quote number 19 please and it was getting night and remember her husband would return now this is talking about remember in the Bible where where where Jesus tells the parable about the woman with the tablets yeah the the headdress with the tablets hanging on it all right very very pretty um analogy all right and he found her one of those coins out it showed she had been marked to harlot and if she had to if she had defied or defiled herself in any way and it was seen by the people they brought her before the priest and brought witness that she had found she had been found such and the priest saying that she was a married woman took the coin there was coins hanging on the head right here right coins H and one was for a different item right amen they would take that coin look right here because look there's one there's there's a couple there there's not just one there's several coins hanging on a on a string off of her headdress the priest saying she was a married woman took the coin out of her tablet that she had been doing wrong by and if she had marred her virtue they took that out in other words she would committed adultery they pull that one out so everybody could see and her husband could see when he come home but now look here if she had been flirting showing that she wasn't to to her husband they took that one out so there was one for flirting yeah they took that one out huh and whatever it was they took it out and when her husband returned he found that she had been marked and he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he didn't want he did not want such a woman yeah Lord get La toward dark in other words she found you know her situation was different from this he just making an example the church better be examining themselves by the word of God our Purity our loyalty our devotion we become tlers tail bearers cigarette smokers backbiters painted up Jazz Bells everything in the calendar that the rest of the world does the Christian church is associating in those things today CU you can't hardly tell the one from the other it's time we took inventory it's getting late amen all right so flirting flirting is a lack of commitment or to trifle have you ever looked up the word Tri trifle means to make Trivial or insignificant in other words it doesn't matter trivial or insignificant flirting is selfish and not genuine a put on and a fake yeah so there's nothing good you see anything good about flirting nothing good about flirting all right quote number 20 but Delilah did you notice she know that Samson had a power and she didn't know where that power laid she couldn't tell what that power was but there was some great power that Samson possessed and she wanted to find it she didn't want to get close to Samson cuz she loved and as theila she kept wooing Samson after her beauty wooing means to flirt yeah oh she dressed herself real sexy and she walked before him and she teed like some of the little teenagers of the day and so forth and when you act like something another strip te trying to wo woo Samson to her number 21 Samson a to have made his first stop when deila flirted her eyes at him he ought to have turned his head and walked on right Samson stopped and got in trouble Eve stopped and got in trouble right there Eve stopped just for a moment she got in trouble Sams stopped for a moment got in trouble amen and when the world presents something to the church or an individual don't stop keep moving amen right that's what the church needs tonight don't stop for his intellectual classical Pride keep moving on in the Holy Spirit right all right next 23 or 22 now if a man goes out here and is married to a man she goes out and makes love with another man and has has an affairs with him and comes back to her husband he should kick her out is that right she must be true to him cuz she is vowed to him and the bride of Christ is vowed to Christ and he is the word not even wink at the other side amen a woman should not even wink at another man right amen she shouldn't make no signs no emotion at all toward him right for she is absolutely a bride to one brid Grom amen we don't want none of your mixed trees your denomination be true to Christ the word he'll vindicate it true no sir not even any emotion of anything toward making love to him not join his ranks or anything else right or let him get you in his arms or in his care right or talk or talk to you over this way that way you listen only to One Voice amen my sheep know my voice a stranger they not what is his voice any man's voice is his word and this is it the Bible not one word added to it or taken from it you stay with that voice all right next one number 23 that's the reason many times today that a sinner is still want wondering about a beautiful young girl will cut off the locks of her hair to be popular paint up her face to make her look pretty put on clothes to show the form of her being right watch that now watch that here in this church yeah you put on Godly clothes looking but if it cleansed everything you got right what's brother Brown trying to say what am I trying to say if if it's if it's too close to the line it's wrong right you're safe it's too close to the line it's wrong that's all you got to say but don't close your form of being cuz it's the only thing that she can find finding somewhere to try to find something to come back to her when she can cause men to whistle at her wave at her flirt with her young men will do the same thing to a woman try to make your attractive to her neighbors will build a house and fix a certain way cuz it look a little better than the neighbor's placees all the time we are seeking for something and something keeps going just a little above it all right number 24 now it's not wrong listen it's not wrong to dress up and be nice right you need to dress up if you go on a date you need to dress up like brother Bown said you don't need to stop your car in the driveway and blow the horn he said you go get that girl if you're going to date her you go get her all right right amen you you cannot have an eternal Foundation upon popularity right that's the great sin of America is trying to be popular women trying to dress popular men trying to act popular all these little things going on the way it's taking place I don't have to start on that the first night but I didn't say the third night of the second we'll Coast on that tonight but being popular

want to be covered so forgive our sins and keep us and cleanse us and guide each and every one of us in Jes Jesus name amen Revelations 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he s and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand uh now we go to First Peter 1:9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesy of the grace that should come unto you churching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ Christ which was in them and signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing we had a a u word sent into us that we need to pray uh that brother uh Royal Serano uh the flooding is in the Philippines real bad and there's some pictures back there that it says it actually the first floor of his home and I'm 99% sure I've been there when I saw the picture and the bottom floor of his home is totally flooded and uh so it's raining real bad there you know and all and and they're here and cannot contact their two daughters so just pray that the Lord will move the rain out and make everything you know be okay they' say they've already had over 50 casualties in the last 2 or 3 days from the strong rain so remember that the Lord would would be with with them and take care of them amen right now we've tried to bring things down Sunday afternoon to kind of a uh show you an overall view of what we're talking about and all and you know kind of line up some things to where we can move on a little bit and you know I want to make sure tonight we're not going to use any I may quote a good bit but we're not going to use any quotes we want to just go with the service and try to to speak without having to uh pull up a bunch of quotes and things but to get you to see what we're talking about amen all right now we went through in our studies of Revelations 4 and brought it over to the place you know then to go into now into chapter five and going into chapter five we have found some things to be there to help us to understand that's right and and I pray that the Lord would would would open their eyes to one thing now it's it's you know I've gotten some comments back so I know that most people haven't never maybe thought of the situation that I brought out there Sunday morning in the afternoon service right of the book being written and then sealed up right because most everybody wants to try to break it open it see it you know understand it but if you wasn't here I ask you to please listen to the morning and the evening service this past Sunday all right but see the book is sealed amen right the prophet said you're sealed with the book right right amen now you say well how do it sealed now now there's some things about this book this Bible that we're holding up that's that man was able to be able to read and understand like the Fai of the fathers the writing of the word Etc but then the Book of Revelations comes into view and it just kind of seals up the book right to where that you you've got to have an understanding then of a sealed book right a lot now if you'll notice in your reading we'll get to it in a few minutes uh in three places in chapter 5 alone it speaks of a sealed book you know and chapter 5 we know is to be already the bride in glory after the WAP rure amen right Y and the book is still sealed right see because you've got to get that understanding to be able to walk into the rest of the scriptures all right but see the book is sealed you say yes but but uh you know and I said there are some parts of the book that was not what you call sealed up right y but just remember that the Bible is sealed to unbeliever right amen right that's right that's right y all right do you you follow that amen it takes a baptism of the Holy Ghost to be able to understand the Bible right now you can read you can study it that's fine and we do that but the Holy Spirit has to reveal amen and we're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ and see then we know that the Bible said just paraphrase it that no man can call Jesus the Christ you know the Christ accept it be by what right by the baptism of the holy spirit all right see because you can't understand you can't see the book you see can't see the kingdom of God without the new birth right amen all right so it's sealed up now so remember now the book is sealed up the that mankind can't read this Bible that's right and understand it right amen because it's sealed until you get the Holy Spirit now also remember this and keep it in your mind I'll repeat it in a minute but see until this time there in Corinthians the Bible says that there's a blindness over Israel's eyes right amen that they cannot see it's over their heart really right because they can't see it right and see that's what we're talking about see then we begin to talk about in The Book of Revelations you don't see the book in chapter 4 you see one on the throne You See Redemption you see all the things and the bride goes up in Revelations 41 not seen until 1921 right you know coming back all right the rest is to Israel see then that's the point we're trying to get across to you to be able to see but you see you the book is sealed am and we gave it to you paragraph like 75 of the seal book the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book amen right see you're the book right see we're not talking about the one that's in the hand of the one on the throne is not a scull field thps and chain or whatever Bible right amen the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne we' read it to you the prophet there's nothing in it but a book of names amen right see it's a book of names because it was the names that was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen right so it's just names written in that book amen all right but see then when we came to Earth then this Bible here is The Book of Life right amen because this Bible here then tells what going on on Earth while that name is being made manifest that was in the Lamb's Book of Life Amen brother said arm and Neville is not written in the Bible but he said what's going on on Earth while arm and Nevil is here right he said that puts him right in the word amen right all right see then we don't look in the word to try to find our names right we look into the word to see what's going on man yes all right now the emphasis I've been trying to make for quite a while is one thing that book that you are is not completed yet no that's right amen well because we're not completely yet right right right right am see we're in the journey amen we're in the process all right now being in the process being in the Journey the book is being written ye are written Epistles Paul said known and read of all man but see when you come to the Book of Revelation chap 5 the bride's already gone up to glory in chapter 4 right right so she's already become the book she's already become a Britain epistle that's right she's already become a live word that's what we're doing right now right is receiving the word of God and becoming that word just as we eat and become the food that we eat and see then looking at it then see we are sealed the world can look at you and they can say to the about the sisters and they say well you know you're different right you look like the word all right right but still they can't see him right right you remember brother R saying said you can't see me right he said you see the body I inhabit right but you can't see me right now so is it that I said a moment ago then that we are that book amen you're a walking book right you're a living book amen the book is now being written about you and I amen there's things in this Bible that's not fulfilled yet you agree right amen all right now if it's written in this book by somebody by prophecy like Paul said we be changed the moment the twinkle an eye now that hadn't taken place yet right right if it has you and I missed it all right but see it's not taking place yet all right so then the book is not complete all right man see now the book I'm talking about Adam didn't have a Bible in his hand we were doing Pary and my wife and I were talking about these things and she helps me to try to get me to back to the CH the chain of thinking and what we ought to bring out and you know and I appreciate that you see Adam never had a Bible in his hand he didn't have a book in his hand no right but he didn't have a book he didn't have the the lounge Book of Life holding it in his hands no no but what he had was was the ability to bring forth all of those names amen right yes sir right right and had he not sin not entered the picture that's right we would have come spoken word children amen and only the names It Was Written in the lamb Book of Life would have been all that would have come right right but but because that we didn't go that way and send into picture then there's a lot more names going to be involved and then a book had to be starting to be written y right according to the Book of Daniel according to the Book of Revelation it calls them books right Prophet says there's even a book about your life right but this Bible tells us enough about our life right right that's right see this Bible has covered every age and time that will ever be upon the Earth is written right here in this Bible amen all right but that's the Book of Life man to show you what you're doing or a record of what you're doing and it recorded on the day of Pentecost that the baptism of the Holy Ghost came and how many received that what were they their names had to be on that L's Book of Life right right but it's not that Adam was sitting with the book and lost it he lost the ability for it to come forth amen and God had to take it back right all right and brother around said then we see him sitting here with that book in his hand amen so the book that I'm talking about is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne in Revelations 51 right it's not a Bible you can call it a Bible because it's the book of life but it's a record of those names right that would receive Jesus Christ as their savior amen amen but it's not a record of the Jews it's not a record of the of the foolish virgins M and the thing it's only a record of those names is only the bride right see then when Jesus Christ paid the price then he went to the throne right all right you remember we went through chapter 4 he raised up and went to the throne amen all right brother said climbed up on the throne and set down in other words became the one on the throne amen that's what happened at Calvary but he didn't claim The Possession that's right on the entire being at Calvary right he only claimed the possession of the soul of the individual amen all right now he's not going to have to get back up on the throne and die again to claim the rest of us he paid the price amen it just wasn't made manifest at that time right see then what started was it started on Earth y just like I said a moment ago no man can see the kingdom the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost into our hearts and lives right amen all right be in that Kingdom when you and I came into that Kingdom by the new birth that brought that name that was before the foundation of the world it made it manifest on earth right might not be G Atkins or crany want right because it's their name that was written before the foundation of the world right but there's a manifestation on Earth of that individual see both of them the in are made manifest here on Earth and accepting the new birth then God's predestination would catch up with you right and see then you would be here in as a born again believer right that's the writing of the book amen see until all of those names in that L's Book of Life have been made manifest upon Earth in individuals who have received the new birth then the book is not complete amen I gave you quotes over and over where the Prophet would say when the book is completed you know what happens to the book it's sealed up that's right amen so if you can see that people can't even see you that's right they see the body you inhabit they see your life your actions your doings and that's why it's so important yep how we live amen all right but they can't see that Christ in you because that Pharisee was just as religious sure as to look upon him the Pharisee would have been more religious of what we think of religion than what Jesus was even sure right but we know that what was it he was an actor right amen word Pharisee actor see all right but you see once that last name comes in here on Earth and is made manifest by the new birth you understand what I'm saying not just because it comes on earth right but it's got to receive the new birth amen all right and when it does the book is completed right and it's sealed up because what I want you to think about the statements brother R made that we sometimes don't you know honor them as much as I think as we need to but brother R said here in Revelations 5 he said the book is closed amen that's right he said we didn't know it was a seal book that's what he said I said the seal I gave it to you he said we didn't know it was a sealed book he said but we found it's a sealed book the book is sealed up it's not open until chapter n chapter 10 you find him with a book in his hand open you don't find him in chapter 5 with that book open why right because this book in Revelations 5 is you and you're sealed up just like you're sealed up here but they can't see it right m they can see the life that you manifest yeah but they can't see Christ right unless the Holy Ghost comes through that person to make Christ manifest right right so then the books got to be sealed why because it's got to go to Israel as a sealed book right right come on yep that's right sure Israel at this time the book is seed amen right yep they can't see Jesus Jesus Christ right right they know all about him sure they could probably tell you more about him in a lot of things than even the lot of the religious world that claim to be Christians but in doing that see it's sealed up right you are the book right that I've been talking about in the hand of the one sitting on the throne cuz you don't see the book in chapter 4 I went through that over it and over it amen you see the throne and one on the throne the elders and the the rainbow and the things showing the Rapture has taken place right but you don't see the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne in chapter 4 right it's in chapter 5 right why because he's fixing to take that book amen and he's going to preach you to Israel amen amen I don't see why people can't see that that's right amen we're not going to Israel as I've said some even believe that we're going to go to Israel ourselves some in the message say a gentile prophet and a gentile bride you know of course I knew the brother meant he was the Gentile Prophet but it didn't make no difference I didn't believe we're not going to get up the plane fly to Israel and then go out to Rapture and we ain't going to fly up and go over and go down you know and no no but this man message which is the Bible amen right you agree brother R's message is the Bible this message will go to Israel this book will go to Israel not a not a book like this right but they will tell Israel right right you rejected the right of sunship right you would not receive Jesus Christ as your savior right we said the Gentiles did and they have this whole New Testament now is written that you can read what they done right yes and they can tell us that and they went in the Rapture and you rejected the right of sunship I was looking at something today cuz my wife will remember this I told her I said there something something somebody said about him singing a new song and I couldn't get that straight now I know where it's at see in Revelations five the bride sings a new song right but in Revelation 14 Israel sings a new song after they're redeemed sure absolutely amen about 143 I think it is I knew it was somewh word and I couldn't place it and I kept searching then all at once it appears yeah all right see we sing a new song Amen you say yeah but we've always sung the song of redemption that's right but our song of redemption if you ever noticed your songs notice your song books Charles Wesley and them all wrote the songs right during that period of time a lot of people that time you know there was written about the blood is that right why because that was what being was being preached it was being preached so strong until they believed you were saved by the blood right yeah there's no way to be saved by the blood cuz the chemistry can't be applied you're saved by the life that's in the blood right amen but you see there are songs actually sing those song We sang them right here I know it was the blood I know it was the blood and it were written in the time of the blood right they was being preached of sanctification ausa Street struck right what is the songs one of them now that may come on down later in our day but just get my idea of what what I'm saying they wrote songs about about the Oneness of the godhead right after isus the street that's right y cuz that was the message that was being preached what are the songs now written by the people of the bride of Christ beautiful songs of the token of the different things what because it's the hour amen even the song shows the time that we're at right amen are you are you following me amen see but we're going to sing a new song Amen you said we just want to sing the songs of redemption now we're going to sing a new song yeah we'll get through that in a minute we're going to sing a new song not something different right but a song related to where we at then when we leave out of here Israel will sing a new song but be real careful the way you place it CU we sang the new song that thou H has made us Kings and Priests right under our God Amen Israel sings only thou Hast redeemed us right I get time I'll get to that scripture in a minute it's on over the message to show you the difference I don't get to it you read uh Revelations 59 and 10 and then you read Revelation 141 through about three they sing a new song Amen y because you see they can't sing the song of Salvation like that that's right they can sing only the song of redemption you say what the same no it's not Redemption can be a a a why why thrown judgment foolish virgin is redeemed one day but she can't sing the song of redemption that we can sing right cuz they don't know anything about our God and our savior are you listening see the book that went back back there was the book of names yep right but the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne if you want to to call it that it's the Bible cuz it's Bible is the Book of Life right brother R will call it the Bible cuz it's the book of life right amen but in this book of life there also a lot of bad things you know what it does it tells you all about how dirty you are right Paul said in such were some of you some of us amen that's right but I like what he sung a new song cuz he said but now we're clean washed amen Washed by the blood amen see this Bible then shows you the natural life that we're living amen but it shows also the eternal life that is dwelling on Earth cuz here's Peter James John that's those names that were written in that book of life before the foundation of the world you know but then their lives at here even to Peter D doubting and problems but you know it was before his new birth right you don't find any doubting in Peter after his new birth made manifest you find him ready to give his life for the gospel but do you see what I'm talking about you see what I've been trying to say I know it's confusing when I come out and say hey everybody's been talking about opening the book book this book that they don't even know how the book got sealed okay how did the book in Revelations 5 get sealed whatever kind of book you want to make it right whatever you want to call it or what it is how did it get sealed cuz it is sealed yeah but we know the seals brother there we know all about seals yeah listen church I know I've made Mass confusion When people's minds are saying one thing the sealed of the literal happening of those seals is to Israel amen the revelation of those seals is to the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't want to be around here when the six seal breaks to you cuz you'd be in the tribulation right right amen well that's what they thought brother around and was saying right when you get over to the Feast of the trumpets like the brother said said he made so many slips of the tongue that it can't be understood brother R gets over there and he says see here he said there's a seven a in a seventh angel Mal for he says to come between the sixth and seventh seal well now if it comes between the sixth and seventh seal that'll put him in the tribulation if that's all you know right he said well brother Dale the seal is broke to the bride amen amen but are we there where they are to make be made manifest you better not be there when that first one is cuz that was the only question they asking does second Thessalonians the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God is that the first heal he said yes so you better not be there for that you better be there where that God takes the seal off and reveals to you but the things is taking place I don't want to be where they're at I want to be where the revealing is at this is the revealing of the book amen while the book is being written about you and I it's being revealed right we are the revealed book yeah that's right we are the word of God that's being made manifest we are that book amen that's in the hand of the one sitting on the throne Lord and then he can take what's there and he's got a book to go to Israel y right right exactly you remember we brought it out Sunday trying to to show where the prophet of God even was confused on that Fifth Fifth chapter because when he answered that question right is that the Saints he says no that is not the Saints he said they're not redeemed he said that's the elders and the the beasts and things but he's done forgot that he's in heaven right he's thinking that's some Redemption for Earth chapter 4 and five is in heaven amen yep the bride already in glory right she's the book that's what I'm tried to explain to you that's right and then I ask you a simple question I know that is fensive to people could he take your Revelation and convert to Jews right M right well I don't really know where there's one God or three you know kind of look like it's three sometimes sometimes maybe there's four or five I don't really know is it important for me to know yes that's what everybody says right once you start talking to anybody that's the first thing you think we need to know this all we need to know is Jesus Christ died for our sins that's it well go right over there and join that church cuz that's what he preaches every Sunday I'm not sarcastic I'm telling the God's honest truth you don't go to a Baptist Church and hear them preach that salvation comes by believing in some hudo they preach it comes by believing in Jesus Christ right but then the scripture says no man can call him the Christ unless it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right could he take your Revelation and show Israel one God that's right now you see why did I spent 40 something years preaching one God y could he take your revelation of one God and converted you that's right brother R was listening to him the other day he said them Jews can show you where that Trinity come from y he said they can tell you all of these things because they studied it so that's why you can't cut God in three pieces and give him to a Jew now how could you take the doctrines in this message and go to Israel that's right two Lords Two Souls River Jordans you know God not god Till The River Jordan all these things you see why it's not going to work they've tried to do it right I'm not TR to explain there have churches in Israel right today that are following this message sure but is that going to convert the Jews well how come it won't convert back come come on right all you got to do is get the word brother just give him the books now You' seen the ladies is coming on all these things after the guy you know jumped up that brother R was out there at the wrong time hunting and all this that and other now this big things on the Blasted on the internet around the world showing the fallaces of brother rand's message you don't have them as copy in my office see everybody's getting on the bandwagon now church we don't see the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God and in a literal extent Israel sees that of the breaking of the Covenant but we see him sitting now amen now in the people of this message because the greatest and the closest to the truth is where the Antichrist can be the greatest that's right yes sir so you think that I'm hateful for talking about those things no I'm trying to warn you just don't get caught with them I just simply ask you the question cuz your Revelation converted you amen and I don't mean this wrong but how many of your mannerisms and conversation and life and things has converted people to this message right amen right sorry I shouldn't be that a it's true but one not it's the truth amen the prophet said your life is so loud I can't hear your words right oh that's for them other people no a live life is a greater book than any book any talk you can do with your lips amen right all right let me get off there and get back do you see what I'm talking about right let's just read go ahead brother Joe pull up Revelations 5 we got him in the office all bicep t i cuz I told him going have nothing but a few scriptures let these other brothers rest but I want you to notice how many times he talks of a sealed book right well now what kind of a book is it what what what's wrong here we've done gone up in the Rapture what kind of a book is it yep and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals that's all the people ever deal with is it on the inside or is it on the outside we can't figure that out we can't figure that out whether it's inside or outside we got quotes from R around that sealed on the the inside and sealed on the outside yeah but you better carry that all the way through until you find him saying you can't add one word to the book right no right I tried to explain that years ago but how many of you remember it there's not Seven Seals on the outside of the book there's not seven Thunders on the outside of the book Daniel heard the Thunders right they're in the book John heard the Thunders they're in the book yeah but he had a quote from Brother brandom the Thunders is the only thing that's left and they're on the back side of the book now what's he talking about he's done explained to you it's not a book like this right he's done explained it's not this that it Scrolls and things right why can't you remember that get away from a book but once you get down to a point of thinking that book is a book of names and it's sealed up until those names are revealed until it's revealed amen it's not written inside and on the backside writing why don't you just get simple weird thinking everybody wait that this a simple statement I've made for 40 years then the book that is written is sealed by The Book of Revelations it's not outside the book right be outside the book you you get your CL sometimes right well it was on the outside till the prophet broke it well did he go outside the book and get his Revelation no come on did he go outside the book and get his Revelation no he didn't do that his Prophet am it had to be what was in the book he said but where light had not shined on what in the Bible had light not shined on right right Peter didn't preach one God water baptism no Eternal Hells and thing right you said no you can't well it's in there in his writings y right but the Book of Revelations has the Bible sealed that's what it seal with on the back it's the last book in the Bible right right there's not another book after The Book of Revelations so that's the backside of the book right y The Book of Revelations it seals the entire book Y and until those seals are broke that's right I'm going to throw you a curve to where you follow one of these days and I get to it when you get to Revelation 61 there's only one seal broke in 61 right so then there's six more so the book ain't opened in Revelation 6:1 it's only part the open right you got to have all of those Seven Seals to be open for the book to be opened right he church so what does he say and I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book y though the book's closed Y and to loose the seals thereof seal with the seals no man in heaven no man under the Earth was able to open the book why it's a seal book needed to look there on you couldn't even look at it right what do you mean I can't look at it I I I pick it up and yeah what your Prophet said said you stop at drunk driving down the highway and he saw drunk and you ask him is Jesus Christ God and you say yes he said but he only knows what somebody else said right y it's not a revelation to him no no man in heaven or on Earth neither under Earth was able to open the book neither to look her own and I we much because no man was found worthy to open open open open to a seal and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders says we not behold the line of the tribe of Judah has Prov Veil to open the book and loose the Seven Seals brother Rand couldn't do that cuz no man in heaven no man on Earth brother Rand said Moses was there Elijah was there he said all of them that had died in Christ was there there's no man worth it so don't holler say brother R was worthy he's the one that's just told us he's not worthy that's right but get what I'm talking about he's prevailed he's overcome so he can open the book he can lose the seals right the land so in Revelation 61 it says and the lamb opened the first seal second one it says and the lamb opened third fourth now it don't get down on over there about 5 and 6 and say the lamb opened the fifth seal but you got enough sense to know what's going on so don't be a you know what reason I get that I I know what goes in people's mind well ain't no Lamb on the for and F or something like that boy look at the Revelation on water yeah and behold low in the midst of the throne the Elder still is a lamb he had seven horns and seven eyes which is seven spirits of God it's like we said now what kind of lamb is it y That's not talking about Calvary he never had seven horns and seven eyes at Calvary no that's right right this is the end time right when the book is sealed up only after the book is sealed up does a lamb appear with seven horns and seven and I and all right we put message after message to do prove what where did the lamb come from right did we not read that it came from the church ages cuz those horns and eyes are The Messengers and the ages go back in chapter one and read it'll tell you that right where did this lamb come from what's he doing in the end time he's fixing to go to Israel yep right he's going to take those seals off that book and go to Israel amen cu the next Redemption is Israel and chapter 5 we're in heaven man right simple everybody says I'm so deep but what is it simple look and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him to set upon the throne he took the book now brother around I gave them to you it's on souls and prison and uh who do you say this is is two different quote that brother around said he took the book climbed up on the throne and said I am yeah all right so that's what he's referring to he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne right see we look at like two people when they got no he took the book he come to the position the book in him was one he walks upon on the throne and sits down who the lamb the lamb that has seven horns and seven eyes right CLS up on the throne and sits down the prophet said it like this he said he become the one on the throne right as your Revelation put him back on the throne right or do you still have wonders about Trinity or what this is or what that well brother so so explain it's so beautiful yeah like that brother that had that big thing and had the screens of it and everything you know and everybody just went haywire he had it all draw out where this great Pillar of Fire went up here and went over here and come down down over here and he just raced this out that's where he first messed up y because brother ROM never said all God like all that we think was poured into Christ because there was a part of Christ that was not made manifest until the Book of Revelation right look and when he had taken the book The Four beasts Anders fell down for the lamp having every one of them hearts and golden vs full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints y now and they who not the lamb not the elders not the the four Beast you see well that was part of it yeah it's part of it but now you're getting into the story mhm the Saints are singing a new song what are they singing see that's where brother Brandon when he answered from here up in his talk but then when he dropped down and read that nin verse he said that is the Bride of Jesus Christ I was fixing I answered that wrong and they sang a new song now watch what is that new song would not that new song be what the prophet of God was saying when he said when the seals broke it become a brand new book is that what he said not a different book right not something different from the song you were singing about the blood you finally see as a prophet would say you're not saved by by the blood see Luther w i mean Wesley and all them thought you were saved by the blood little said you're not saved by the blood he said you're saved by the life that was in the blood he said you're kept saved by the blood CU it's on the throne see then you're moving up right amen it's opening up singing a new song and watch the worthy to take the book amen and to open the seals now it didn't say he did right there no you find in chapter 5 one worthy to take the book and what the book is chapter six is when the lamb opens the first SE get it in correct order read it in correct order look why they sing a new song dark worthy to take the book and open the seal there for thou was slain who was slain the lamb Christ right and has redeemed us amen that's it to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation like way said the other day see then that can't be Israel n because they're not redeemed out of every Kindred Nation they're redeemed out of Israel they may be living in every nation and Kingdom but they're not in that that are not that's not them they're Jews amen that's right listen has redeemed us to God out of every k and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests and shall reign on the earth amen that's it remember what it says there so keep looking at that chapter 4 14 and I looked and L lamb stood on the mount s and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their forehead look what's already happened to them and I heard Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and the voice of a great Thunder and heard the voice of Hearts harping harping with their hearts and they sang as it were a new song Before the Throne yeah watch their song now remember their song you made us priests and Kings right you redeemed us watch what their song is and they sang as it were right and you song see because they they couldn't sang it before before son Before the Throne and before the four Beast and the elders and no man could learn that song right listen right but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the Earth all it says that they're redeemed nobody can't sing that song but the 144,000 no man can't sing this song that we're looking at in Revelations 5 right where he's made us priest and King nobody can sing that the Jews can't sing that right amen cuz they don't come after sunship right you don't understand what that prophet he answered that question there in the questions and answers on the seal he said that is not the Saints right now what if God had not stopped him that's right there's only two redemptions in the Bible That's Right 144,000 and a bride that you're dealing with yep so he would have been saying that was Israel y well that's okay we're over in fourth chapter see that's how silly people are right if he made that Israel we can't say that we're priests and Kings Israel would be the priests and the Kings cuz they would be singing that song we wouldn't even have a song to sing right right that's right we wouldn't have anything to shout about when you get on down in the further in the fifth chapter we wouldn't have anything we would all be going to Israel yep and how many years have I tried my best to preach to you one thing in the Old Testament there was no eternal life as a possession except Adam that's right amen Adam was the only one in the Old Testament that talks about having eternal life amen that's right nobody else had eternal life well where are they going brother D they going to be given eternal life right that's why they a singing you s cuz remember there's more than just 144,000 right there is a fifth seal Jew that can cover a lot of people yes sir Y and they can sing that song of Israel but they can't sing what the 144,000 can sing right you know the 144,000 can't be nothing but Unix to the bride right y that's what your Prophet said right the Plan of Redemption but do you see what I'm talking about Revelations 5 we are that book that's going to be taken to Israel amen that's sure is our revelation of almighty God God brought To Us by the prophet of God and don't you misunderstand me on what I'm saying those things without him bringing it to you and I wouldn't have it no amen but you can't make him God right he's a member of the body of Christ amen that's right amen don't you think them true prophets is not going to tell them that the Jews that the Gentiles received a gentile prophet and they're going to explain the five times of Elijah abolutely they got three and a half years to preach yeah that's right right when you read it it looks like we go up when the next day all Israel Sav no there three and a half years of preaching right that's right amen amen they will tell them all about what's happened to you and I right they'll tell them about Elijah number one Elijah Elisha number two John the Baptist number three of the coming of Elijah and brother random number four of the coming of Elijah amen and they'll be standing there and look at number five y right right right amen you know what's the worst thing of it how are they going to see they say to those two prophets come on you want the Bible sure they say where did you get the nail prints in you hand right you two prophets won't be standing there with nail prints in their hands come on they'll be preaching about Calvary that's right right they'll be preaching about Calvary if Calvary he could show the nail prints in his hand right but look folks when they see his wife that's what I Tred to get across Sunday Joseph you think he was more interested in his daddy than he was his wife Joseph loved his daddy loved his brothers right he done set that b before him and they did you think he was interesting you think he went home with Daddy well Daddy I'm going home with you don't you have a wife and some kids yeah that's over with I'm with my daddy now I love my daddy I love my daddy too but he's not my wife right right I love my children I love my grandchildren and my great grandchildren but they are not my wife right that's right my wife is a part of me right you remember this this dream I had and woke up that in the dream I was going down the road saying and fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly do and I woke up and I Heard a Voice was singing feel my way every day with love I kept listening thinking am I still asleep or am I way and I thought well I know I'm awake and I heard it my wife was in the other room singing feel my way how did she know to sing the song at the time I was dreaming about it cuz you see we're one Joseph was more concerned about his wife sure than he was his daddy and his brothers all right God loves his children of Israel sure right mhm he died for him but who you think he loves now right amen they rejected the right of being his wife right Y come on y but the Gentiles accepted it right amen by us accepting Jesus Christ then we can fulfill the complete Plan of Redemption CU we can sing a new song y amen when you're in chapter 5 you can sing I'm redeemed my love divine Glory Glory Christ is mine everything I got I went to him amen sir right right see Paul now if you understand I going just say this in quick Paul Could Sing of the Redemption right Peter James John they could sing Redemption right now see if you catch on to the stories I was trying to tell you how the songs were written about the blood in the days of Wesley this was what I was talking about those disciples could sing the song of redemption but they can't sing what we can saying right right right they can only sing I'm redeem waiting Redemption come on they without us cannot be made perfect so they can only saying I'm redeemed in Soul but my body is still here right I got problems with it but that bride in Revelations 5 stands there totally Eternal totally Eternal Body Spirit and soul thank you that's a new song Amen thank you Lord what about it anybody got any questions am I confusing you I don't want to confuse you I want it to be clear you see the book I'm talking about is sealed up is you and I amen that's right that's right this Bible has been sealed a whole time y this Bible sealed to an unbeliever this Bible is sealed to a Jew he can only read the Old Testament part brother R said the old only speaker than you that's right see but they can't understand Redemption they're worried about the nail prints when he makes itself known to them they go to themselves for because they see they rejected Messiah m y sure do now listen to what I'm saying when them 144,000 sees the nail prints in his hands they know he died at Calvary right right they know that's talking about Jesus because he's not seeing them in physical he seen him through the two prophets right all right but when they see they turn down that Messiah ship and we accepted it they go to themselves and weep because they know they turned it down and ain't a bunch of Gentiles say well bless God I'm saved I tell you what you can't tell me I ain't saved when Jesus Christ is revealed to those Jews that sends them to their knees that's right amen that's right has your Revelation put you on your knees knees anywh or has it lifted your head up that's right and made it so big do you have to distra you I'm Bri you better remember the stories the prophet told about the armor meat packing guy and come looking for a wife amen and he found a little old slave girl it didn't have no clothes worth nothing it was out there washing and taking care of everything where her K folks could go to parties and dress up and she didn't smell too good she smelled like the animals she didn't have no pretty hard do but she had one thing that that man was interested in it was a carot car amen right that's right a carot right she was a servant y right that's it you get a revelation and it blows your head up you I'll tell you I've got them and they tried to blow mine and I've had to put them out m y you said brother Dale you'll tell us that well why not why not be honest that's where the trouble with people is they're not honest you ask most people preachers this message you ever got something that busted your head no buty I've always been humble yeah only thing is I just ain't lied to you right Satan will try his best to penetrate your mind and give you thoughts and ideas right amen that are not right right that's right you must know the word to be able to change oh brother I just feel so good it just makes me feel good when brother so and so is preaching that's what I get here you know I go home my listen to take cuz I a hear and I hear a lot of you holiday men and tonight I don't hear nothing yeah you think I'm mean don't you if I was mean I done quit a long time ago I got close to it a few times every other day you know but you see I'm not trying to get your aen right I'm trying to touch your soul am if that Soul gets right with God we'll have plenty of time in glory because you can read there where they're shouting so much you know what I love after all of the shouting the screaming and the hollering that could be done out of the bride of Christ John says they all' heard me y he must have had a voice come write questions write down say Brother D explain this but I do the best I can and I put it in the S so much I know and I try to help you but I try to give you something to Anchor it with the word and it's not been just something brother Dale has to say can you get up here and tell me that what I said on Revelations CH 4 and 5 is not what brother randam has sa anybody want to talk come men women children or what and tell me I ain't tried to say what brother Brenham said CU that's what I'm trying to do pil bitterly I know but I want you to see Jesus Christ I want my wife to have her own experience because she can't go because that me and her are married she's got to have her own Holy Ghost that's right that's right my kids got to have their own Holy Ghost that's right I believe for them God speak to me about them yeah but I can't say that's right right but I can keep holding on Amen right let's stand where we got 194 in the red anybody have a need nations are breaking his roomes awaken Time Eternity soon will on the day of redemption is there men's hearts are failing for how many of you ever had a broken on you know it hurts you know it hurts a lot let's just pray God this a place that won't hurt that's all we're asking

sitting over here one sitting over here one sitting over there oh great tree oh Ain it something that ain't even in the Bible right sir would a Prophet come to turn us back to the word right and to see who we are he said when the bride realized that who she is that's right and what she's doing here Satan won't be able to stand against you that's right amen you say yeah but look at all of the horrible things would you like to swap places with the Lord Jesus and the things he went through that's right what about those early saints that had to give their life for the gospel right yes sir that they would even take pregnant women in the fox of book of martyr and tells you take pregnant women and actually cut the babies out of them and throw them to the Hogs take the women that had the

the lord willing on the 2nd of october brother keith reed will be here preaching for us for the weekend now to the children especially we've got you some new basketball goals and got some new basketballs down there so we're asking you to do for us you know and help us now i know uh kids that the bigger ones they want to play and bounce on the asphalt you know and it does work better i know that but i'm sorry but we designated and and and richard and terence and zach and all just a whole bunch got down there and fixed the goal where the the little kids could play so that's that one on the asphalt now at the end there is made for the little bitty kids you know the little little bitty girls and little boys that you know that can get out there and play so now please kids go on down to yours and play and you know uh do the best you can down there and have some shooting goals and things you know but don't be up trying to be with the little kids we're trying to make it as safe as possible but we want the little kids to have a good time too because you know they've been kind of pushed out we had the big goals and couldn't do it now we've got it fixed where we can do that and we're in the process of trying to buy some new swing sets and things of that order and we just ask you to help us you know to do and if we come out and we put a little poster sign up on there and says no child under a certain age swings on this we'll please abide by kids because we're we're going to spend a lot of money it's going to cost up and weigh into the thousands of dollars to buy two different swing sets one for the little kids and one for the bigger kids to swing on so you know we don't want to tire up the little kids things and i know some of you get out there and and want to play on the monkey bars and walk the top well um parents if i was you i'd instruct my kids not to try to walk on top of them beans up there you know because they're small and they can get hurt so uh you know just uh adults instruct and then when we do get that set up we will probably try to like in you know appoint a person to stay out there and direct and make sure that everything goes good you know with the kids because we want you to play we just don't want you get hurt so don't get up on the top of those bars and walk out across there that you know i know your kids and i like to play tarzan when i was a kid too we swung out the trees and you know and all like that but brother ray tried it yesterday stepping out of the van with the bus and wound up laying on the ground but i didn't hear him yelling like tarzan we thank god that he was with him because he did slip and fall and just flat on his back right there and we got some scratches out of it but he he's still all right we thank god for that we didn't want nobody to get hurt amen but just remember that kids okay genesis 1 26 and 27 we'll try to pick up the point and move on then we'll go to genesis 2 7. heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace and to us we thank you that you are god and you change not and that way we can depend upon what you say and we thank you and we ask you to just help us help us to realize realization lord to be able to be your children to be your offspring and what you'd have for us to be here upon earth we love you and we thank you bless the little ride around the world lord remember sister faith our brother richards we forgot this morning but we you know you remember and sister faye was real sick and in the hospital so we ask you to reach down and touch her and just bless each one we love you and we thank you have your way now in jesus name amen so we go to genesis 1 26 and 27 and then we'll go to 2-7 because we're trying to tie together the the point of what we've been what we're talking about this morning right and god said let us make man in our image after a likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the iron over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created in him male and female created he them now we go over genesis 2 7 and the lord god form man out man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils breath of life and man became a living soul you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope that we you know had a have an understanding to to you know understand the point of what we're trying to get to this morning of the creation of the spiritual man now the spiritual man 126-27 the prophet we gave this morning was created before the foundation of the world but the natural man of genesis 2 7 he was created on the sixth day all right and doing that then the spiritual man was created before the world the natural man was created and in the creation of lining up one two three four five six seven day okay we know in genesis 2 then that it goes on to about verse 20 to 25 and it speaks about the fact that god put adam to sleep and took a rib and made him a help meet all right that would have been in the sixth day of the creation of man see nothing was created in the seventh day god rested i know that's contrary to the jewish teaching they say that they're seven days creation but i can't find it but then some of the others believe too that more was created but that's all right that's their business now what i want you to see today is one thing all right now he was made a spiritual man before the foundation of the world and so i was trying to explain about the word creation and to get you to see that when we look at something and we talk about creation our human mind locks on to the point of of like something that was not in existence and then it comes into existence and we we try to make some kind of a certain beginning of things instead of making it to where that we can can uh stay with it in the correct order the word creation doesn't always signify something that's coming into being that as i said that didn't exist it's just a way of stating what you know what it is it's a creation right it means that it was maybe not in that form before but then it became into a form to be able to be seen and we covered where the prophet of god said that god's first creation was himself and then out of that came the logos the another creation but that's not another creation like a different creation it's the same creation in another form another way of doing to where he can reveal himself like i said about the the the fish you know jesus didn't they didn't walk up to him and hand him the fish and the loaves and he said well go set that down over there i'll just do it from here no he took that and he kept from that of the original creation because that way then you can tie all together all right now so as we see them we come to the point of the natural creation of man and that natural creation was brought into being is looking even like the animals but i hope you was listening this morning that god is a person he's real right he has a body he has a place he lives he has a house to live in the prophet of god said all right then in all of that as i tried to explain in the previous messages we look at things here and we tap it on the pulpit of those maybe on tape or something that we think this wood this is oak wood and it's really you know extremely hard and and all because one of the hardest of our woods here in this part of the country uh maybe the hickory a little harder but it's firm and solid and all but you know that's not really the hard that's not real the world above us is what's real the dimensions above us is more real than we are and if we would look at that and stay with that point then we could see that you know god is real as we keep going up and we would we would find a play somewhere that you know we could find what reality really is or what something is real all right now to look at the man then see brother branham said he took that 126 and 27 man and he said that's the catch that where people don't understand he said they don't see that there was a spiritual creation in genesis 1 and then a physical creation in genesis 2. all right so then he took the man of genesis 1 put him into the physical body of genesis 2 but when he put him in there he put him in a special way because he he put him there as one body there was only one body standing there any place within him the theophany the eternal life of god came into adam well brother branham you can go back to those questions and answers in genesis i ask you to do and you'll see in dark you know i'm trying to cut down instead of bringing so much to you and you know but brother brown said he was in adam and that's theophany well now he said her natural being now listen her natural being has elements would be called a by-product right right but he said in her spiritual condition she was not in my brother right right now so follow that line with me now and he said a true husband and wife becomes one in god he said their hearts beat as one they become one in their thinking and they're doing and he said as they do that then truly they're coming back to look like and it was there that adam and eve in the garden standing there in a beautiful condition before sin entered would be a type of christ in the church and so is a husband and wife truly you know a husband and wife they become one together and then their hearts speed is one then why wouldn't you believe that he could say that he was in adam in theophany and then separated why wouldn't we accept that as being a truth because what i've tried to get you to see is that genesis 1 26 is just one person yeah right right that's not a lot of people but ron said that's where he made man not amen you know like he made man all right so then when you come forth in genesis 2 and you put that into a body you see him standing there and what we're looking at a lot of times our mind will lock on a point that we'll only see adam as uh you know that say well it took out the feminist part you know and put it into a body called eve which their name wasn't eve at that time i like what brother stephen wilson said the other day he said when you get down do you call her eve she'd become a byproduct that's when she really messed up because her name wasn't even her name was adam when she developed the name king richie scripture when the name came of eve that meant the mother of all living right theirs were something messed up by that time it was getting all confused but see and i'm not i know the quotes of brother branham and i i love to read and see what he has to say and he said we have taken the woman and made her our god but said remember eve was made for adam right now that's right not adam now i know the women don't like those terminologies but this church should realize by now what brother dale has tried to preach over 40 years to you amen that i am not what is the word i don't i don't i can't finish what's what's that word showing his stick or whatever it is i don't know i'm not the kind that pushes women down all right never what y'all put the words to it i don't have enough education i don't put the women down but i don't push the woman up okay okay so then you ought to realize that we're in a position to where we hold it correct that brother adams would say that on one side she is a symbolic symbol of all things dirty unholy garbage cans and we call her sex deposits you know disposal excuse me and uh but he said on the other hand she's the top of everything beautiful he said she's the top of the bride of christ after a while we're going to get down to where brother branham said something that is going to shock you just a little about most people in their ways of talking about a byproduct i said in most people's ways of talking about a bright brother to me i hear preachers preach about women and by product you know i don't like the jokes where he said yeah they buy products they'll buy every product they can get i don't like that that is silly most men are outspenders and more than women and i just you know would you spend theirs on hunting and fishing and stuff like that i've killed about 30 deer in my lifetime and if i calculated how much it cost me per pound i would have about a hundred thousand dollars per pound in every deer that i've killed so i don't think we need to talk about spending and garbage who's spending too much or what you know i think we ought to just settle down be human forget it and that's what i try to be i don't try to build up i don't try to turn down i try to just state and try to state all that brother branham had to say right but how would you write a statement like this boy you cut it off out there on me on the internet you good because you make me say something bad but how would you like it if brother brown called the bride the bride a byproduct so stay with me paul harvey we get to get to page two but we're not gonna get there right now all right just to make that the word you know you better search out what you're talking about instead of trying to do because what i think most preachers are talking about when they called a woman to byproduct they're talking about them as porterhouse steaks and maybe they might give the woman the right to be uh hamburger and and my wife is very choicey about it and she she doesn't like to buy this regular hamburger meat all right she gets to what is the ground ground brown round as we call it she likes to get that for the hamburger meat all right now i remember when we were so poor that we ate the hamburger meat and what was it used to put in it uh no what are you used to stirring the hamburger meat years ago um well no not the heifers that's later this is on down i'm talking about welding back when i'm dipping red in it we used to put bread but it's not called bread it was something else oatmeal okay used to put oatmeal some of you ain't old enough to know that we ate oatmeal hamburgers all right but it went down and it took care of a lot of things down in the body and we lived and i didn't know what a steak was until i got married i told you i thought when my wife cooked the first chicken she cooked the breast and asked her what in the world the thing was and all i was used to was the neck and the wings you know what we didn't get that when we was kids the preacher got the chicken all right make sure you don't go to sleep but listen see that's what i think people do you see the mail showing us pigs as we're calling a lot of times they want to down everybody why truth is truth your sisters have a place you have the right to prophet said and we'll get to it in a little bit that was where she was made she has a right to say yes or no and you don't blame nobody else don't blame nobody for how you wound up being made in your body you blame yourself for what you are that's right and then you do something about it it's almost to the point that it's just about like that women can't even be saved and i've even heard preachers preach that women shall be saved in childbearing and they just stop and i asked this brother one day i said why don't you quote the rest of that verse he said what i quoted the verse i said no you didn't you left off the last part i said you said some woman shall be chilled saved in you left off where it says if she continues in the faith you didn't talk about that if you just talk about her having babies she's going to be saved that's catholic church sister anna you mean it she came from there that's catholic church that's why they don't believe in birth controls right and things like that all right now let's go on get all the natural out but you know that one thing i like i looked for this and i found the part where i'm talking about adam brother adam said god looked down on adam and saw him not by himself he said he saw him lonely you know what because he was in heaven but there is a quote that runs close similar to it that he said because god at one time was lonely you know god had attributes in him to be a savior a healer deliverer etc you know father all of that and you know he wanted them displayed that's why he was lonely all right but he said adam was lonely because he had nobody he could look at the animals he could see them the male and the female he could see all of the things but nobody for him so god put him to sleep and made him help me it says now a lot of people read that and they still ain't getting it right it doesn't say help mate you make it don't say that read your bible it says help meet m-e-e-t two men can be mates two women can be mates but a wife is really a part of a man that's the way they ought to consider it and that's why don't ever ask me to do a wedding to work that you want to keep your mighty name right i'll tell you up front i ain't going to do it because that's what we took totally derogatory to the bible to say i'm going to keep my maiden name no we'll get into a few things in a minute maybe about a by-product but that's what i said i see most people talk about byproducts and just like and they preach it that she's just a garbage can well why don't they ever get to the point that she's the bride of christ why don't they ever get to the point of realizing they are the bride of christ you know that brothers no matter what you think about your masculinity in the body of christ we are feminist because we're body of christ he's the man we're the the wife that goes beyond your natural comprehension man but now get what i'm saying the spiritual man first genesis 1 26 made in the image of god because that was god the genesis 2 man was the man that was put in the garden adam to start that part of it and i'm going to try to go through a certain way this evening and then i'll drop back to pick up the whole thing of mankind and maybe wednesday but see when he put him in in flesh even though and that was what made him lonely what made him lonely was the in flesh inside of him was something else now i know two ways brother random does it and i'll try to give you both of them he covers it the word that it looked like in a scale going across some quotes that god didn't think enough of her to put her in the first creation does he say she's not an original and you can take that and you can run a long line of things that she was not in the original and then not being in the original then she would have been a byproduct but most people don't look up byproduct anyway they know all about it they're already educated spiritually they know all about it but your look up by product it means something of equal value right or even greater yeah brother ain't greater i didn't say that but there's one thing about it your sisters has got something that you can type the bride of christ you can type the bride of christ keep yourself unto your husband girls don't throw it out to everybody else because if they do i'm just blunt to say it you belong to everybody else and that's the same thing with boys keep yourself into the world today when you get married you won't have the problems life you know well i have trouble doing it you ain't got such a trouble as you will have if you go do it wrong all right but now think on it just trying to get something to you we know that eve was not made like the other animals but all the other animals was made in an original creation right but yet brother adam gets on to the other side of what i was saying there that you can bring her out it's you know god didn't even think enough in her to make her like a dog he just made a dog female didn't like that much as a woman well that's not exactly i don't believe the way to go he thought so much of the one we call eve until he never took a lump of clay to make her out of it you took her from adam you don't hear it that way do you no don't want to down see everybody but he thought so much until he didn't go to that he put adam to sleep when adam was lonely why didn't he just take a lot of clay just creating a wife because see she wouldn't have been part of adam and in no way could you have a type out of that because a male and a female animal is not a type of christ in the church we came out of the side of of jesus christ the same as eve came out of adam we had to come out of christ so as i said you can type it in every which way you want it but yet take the real time what was different about eve what was odd and different about her she was created perfect so that's what most people think you know they want to their little thoughts adam is perfect but she just didn't quite make it where do you get that from where did god get any imperfection to create the imperfect all i want to know where did god get anything to bring anything he creates nothing that's not perfect now there's different between the word perfect and eternal all right i didn't say eternal i said perfect he created adam perfect he created me perfect right if you're going to do anything with bringing and talk about byproducts bring it in to break more on over as stephen said when she gets that name and bringing her into the you know the things don't do it in the original because you didn't have a name that's why sisters you lose your name when you get married right that's why we lost our name when we married christ we become christians miss jesus see in that way you can keep it in the perfect order what about her being created co-equal you don't hear these quoted by the byproduct people okay how about being co-equal bring it up my brother anderson trying to remember who's pulling the cords today look what he's right around says on marriage and divorce 1965 2 21 the morning service number one on your notes paragraph 102. look what he says notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him we all know that she lost her co-equalness with man when she sinned and then god put her under the rulership notice the reason she had done these things and the way she was doing was what she's not in god's original creation all right now there's a quoting here somewhere where brother brown said that when he created adam he said and see we on the count one day he said it could have been years and years and years and years before eve came into being right but see she was co-equal now for my understanding of co-equal it'd be kind of hard to tack on the word byproduct there as our understanding of my product are you listening now take that quote from the prophet of co-equal and slap a by-product on top of it and see what what what can you do now the reason she's a byproduct is that he did not take another lump of clay and make her out of it that's the reason she's a byproduct he took a part of adam a product and took a part of it and made a byproduct and she was perfect beautiful everything wonderful no problem all right i told him i gave him a couple we don't have to jump on i called him to throw in quote so okay brother anderson throw in the quote where you got it on corinthians book of correction top of the page is the one i gave you with no number on it 1957 414 paragraph e49 so let's see hey man they get good in there you had it it just disappeared you know all right they they play with things back there a little you know because we're getting used to all this stuff but look read this one very carefully at the beginning they were one god when he made man he made him a dual person both male and female he separated him in flesh and put him here on earth and flesh and the female part was still in spirit look friends god was so careful oh how this don't let it leave you god never got a handful of dust and made it eve she'd have been a different creation and she's not a creation she's a by-product huh i don't degrade that he's explaining it all right be a difference he's not a he's not a creation she's a by-product and god goes over in the heart of adam his right hand right out from under his heart and takes a rib and makes a wife and the very part of adam's spirit was in the woman and they too are one soul body spirit now you argue with brother around you're going to argue with me because i'm going to argue me i'm going to read he said they were one body soul body and spirit okay don't look too much like a bad product looks like part of adam right so they're one they're a perfect oneness a real woman and a real husband a real wife they are one together what is it type of christ from out of his bosom not a by-product now watch what you say not a methodist now what's he saying he's making a by-product they're an organization right come on read it or a badness or a pentecostal hatch up no sir but out of his own heart he took the sweetheart that's as pure and loyal and she can be she's a as loyal as a lily then he goes to solomon while you're there brother anderson just drop them down to the spoken words original seed and let's get one beautiful look 1962 318 paragraph 51 look what your prophet had to say now he gave him a bribe atop the second atom he gave the first atom of bride she failed he gave the second adam christ a bride she failed that's exactly why she's not an original okay she's a by-product now we're going to get down to where you're gonna have to think in a little while to what really was the fall and why your prophet would make these statements he said the bride fell no no brother brad can't fall well now you talk to your prophet he said the bride failed on that other one he called the byproduct to measure just a baptist etc now what's he talking about he's talking about that they could not come back to originality no denomination can come back to originality we've got to come back to the seed in christ so what's he saying here look the bride today is a by-product oh brother now now he read she she calls herself the bride you say oh he can talk about the denominations until you and i come back to the original seed we are a byproduct a denomination now swallow that and pray no well bless god we ain't a denomination what's the difference what is a denomination well a denomination is a group of people got together attacking well we've got two souls seventh under virtue perusia solomon river jordan i'm still stamping and i don't know how many stamps they can stamp that's why i said it i'm in it until the bride of christ comes back to the original seed go to masterpiece god use them denominations go to masterpiece sometime and read it and notice where he stops with mary as a representative of azusa street pentecost because the word was in mary only to the ability to give birth he said mary was not the seed i'd ask you to get that book and read over and over and over said mary was not the seed said the seed was in mary she gave birth to it right we must give birth to the word right then we won't be a byproduct until we give birth to it we are a byproduct that's right because we're an organization right bless god i don't like it i'll turn you off goodbye come on all right when you say around here you'll find out we believe strong in what we believe come and show me where i'm wrong but you better bring your computer and brother brandon with you i'm not going to argue with you on nothing else we're going to see what he had to say about it see what the bible has to say about it but we said but brother daley was just a by-product all right your signification is what upon the basis of what we just brought what is a byproduct a byproduct simply means something taken from the original to make another product all right now when we get on down see then you see that as sin enters the picture surely he becomes a hybrid but now tell me how eve is a hybrid god made her did he make her a hybrid come on you better say no you didn't make her a hybrid right you made her right she became a hybrid because she accepted the wrong seed then really she became a high breeder there was nothing wrong with these right she wasn't made some vulgar form you know what her problem was she was made beautiful and she couldn't handle it she couldn't handle it no she was made beautiful she was co-equal got other quotes if you'd like them there was only one covenant when adam and eve was coequal there was only one covenant when he sinned god made another covenant put it up right let's go ahead pull up um 194 okay then we'll go through that number 95. and notice after the beginning after the beginning after time began back in that was eternity is over notice after that fall was made by eve after the fall there was no need to there was need to be another covenant now this is going to stumble you and he said i'll give you scripture god at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall right they didn't say he made it wrong after the fall we're going beyond the covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there is another covenant made but she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate covenant what made the two covenants come into being because of her fault because of what happened god never made two covenants in the beginning when he was in adam there was no need of two covenants you agree when eve was taken from adam and placed in a rightful position there was no need of two covenants she was coequal but when she done what she done she became to a position no longer co-equal now listen come on church this is the covenants that goes down to the polygamies et cetera et cetera et cetera i don't have time to explain it this is not talking about that a woman has one way of salvation a man has another there's only one way of salvation that's jesus christ don't get over on the other side with it the two covenants wound up to were that he wound up with more than one wife which she could never have but one husband that's right he can put her away marriage and divorce but there's no scripture for a woman to ever divorce a man period that's right mine not because that she was a bad egg but because she let the egg go bad two covenants look at the next one number three right record 198 marriage and divorce you talking about the beginning it wasn't so we got another covenant now it's another covenant now there's a there is a covenant for the product all right and the byproduct see now she's developed the wrong thing now she is a byproduct that is in bad shape a covenant for the product the male the covenant for the right product the female i didn't write the book but i do believe in the straightness of the book you keep it right now requiring another covenant see adam and eve was co-equal one man one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that throwed them all to death and god had to make a covenant by that another covenant here it is right here in genesis 3 16. he made another covenant all right i'll put enmity between thy seed and seed of the woman now by product what made the byproduct to be in our word or terminologies of what we look at it as a bad thing with what the by-product done will you go along with me i said all of that to say one statement will you go along with the statement that she done the wrong not that she was made wrong not that she was forced into a situation that she could not uh resist but she was the one that done the wrong now we get onto the basis of looking at it as something that's not right but still now get the whole point i know what brother branham says and i just quotes there i'll give them to you if you want them that she was made to where she could fall now what's he talking about he said she was made so she could fall now did god make her wrong that's my point if you believe that then there's no need to continue under the rest of the story if you believe god made her wrong she was made perfect she started from beauty as number one and she began to reason no female animal can reason you agree female animals dog cats whatever they don't reason she was made with the ability to reason you know there's nothing wrong with reasoning you know the bible says come let us reason together though your sins will be scarlet there'll be white us all right there's nothing wrong with reasoning if it's in the right way reasoning is what helps us in life and doings and doing better and better jobs and you know and reasoning upon the word of god right no blessed god i don't reason brother dale i just take what it says well then i'm sorry this you trying to convince me or yourself but what way was she made see lucifer was made perfect and on one of those quotes if you looked them down a little bit while ago is underlying lucifer at one time was co-equal with god except for the fact he couldn't create what did lucifer fall from reasoning beauty knowledge wisdoms wanting to know more wanting to be looked up to right what did he kill leave in the garden you be his god well you know what that was what she's supposed to be right you know if we believe that he was in adam and if we believe rhetoric said that she was in him in theophany right you may not agree with this that's all right show me where i'm wrong adam had eternal life what did he have right see now you want to drop down and say now she is created a little bit different you know she didn't get exactly all of it so that made her where she could uh now brother branham didn't say that right that's your thoughts sister asked me yesterday said about the mormons and the way they believe in them they said where did they get that from i said sitting down thinking amen but satan took the thing to remember the sin in heaven would have to be descent on earth and it would have to return in the end time he was not made a sex pot that is the attribute agreed she wasn't made that she couldn't control herself if you did you got trouble with god making her that way that's right you got trouble with god making her if you don't let him make her in a certain way if he does anything whatsoever to make her wrong in any form then other than what he made adam you got a problem you better remember one thing you say adam was perfect i agree okay but from my understanding of the bible even the beast brought cain adam and eve brought abel well you know then adam had the ability i don't want to get nasty do you follow me yeah he was perfect hey folks don't run down here to all of this stuff i've been asked this you know people say okay don't let me go down to the this is a point go down to the ymca and work out so good but how come in the ymca i think i've been to one i just take everybody else's word okay but there ain't never a 400 pound woman out there showing you how to work weights in her bikini you go in there and man they get them pumping and waste this little girl come back oh look at it man you're strong he goes home dying from pain right get what i'm talking about we look at adam and the beauty and all and it was perfect but you know he did have an act with eve you know that god never beat him to death about doing that you know why he was human amen don't go down to the honky tonks boys think you can testify to them women come on this gets the point of what i'm talking about i'm talking about what's the difference in adam and eve if you make it eve so lustfully sinful in her desires and her doings until she can't control herself why didn't adam say i don't want you no more i'm so holy and pious i can't do that but he did i ain't never heard nobody preach like you i agree with you they've never been nobody with me like i am well i hope it gives you a little understanding to get away from looking down on women and being byproducts you know dog meat you big old steak you know look at me i didn't fall the bible says in adam all die amen he never sold the human race adam sold the human race am i in the bible adam had a right to just throw her away you say top christ okay fine but he had the right to do it and the bible told him not to do it right there's a lot of incidents in the bible where that people would take back but the bible said don't do it you're going to stay in the scripture it's going to be plain but was he made such a way can't you see exactly what happened in heaven lucifer and what started out so simple i want things to be prettier that's right i want it to be beautiful i i kind of think maybe that that i'm a pretty nice guy and it wound up in a battle in heaven had to be cast out went up in sin right what happened in the garden it probably took years and years to explain to for the beast to explain to eve the whole situation and why would brother branham emphasize over and over and say she was wrong and said she still thinks she's right that's right come on did he do it emphasize it she still thinks he's right and she becomes what mess of this baptist presbyterian brandon mouse lula ice okay you know what the exaltation was i tried to explain it the other night and i'm sorry i don't have a way and sometimes i lose my thought and gotta preach like get it back but it's all right what's the problem today people come to a church and they don't know nothing hardly about you know the deeper things of bread around his message would you let them hang around for a few years and first thing you know they begin to get hooked into that real good and you know what they find out they know more than the you pastor the one that taught them well you know my brother daley is i hope you do know more than i do that don't bother me what bothers me is when people unless you get to the big head and they won't listen because that's what happened in heaven that's what happened to eve in the garden she got to knowing more about it than adam and you say but now brother dale what happened in the garden if it was over a period of time before the the things takes place as we call it why didn't adam know all about why didn't adam say he leave that based alone now what took care of it the whole beast and eve when i tried to explain to you the other night satan lucifer tried his best to destroy michael and michael was the thing that stood between him and god to keep him from being killed there in the garden god had to blind adam's eyes right looked like he was seeing what was going on but he didn't see it it was all in god's plan to kind of let everything just kind of run wouldn't it yes to give everybody a choice he gave the devil a choice he took his choice look what he went wrong with it and tell me i want to know i mean i'm honest i'm sorry i just like to know things show me the great thing that that lucifer done in heaven what was the great thing he done to get kicked out come on it's been preached to you but do you even see it now what was the great thing you've he done eat up in his own self pride look at me i'm more beautiful than michael that was my job and he took it away from me just help me and we'll get it back what else you're going to say happened in heaven we done done away with the fact that he was committing adultery running around and all that things were taking place in heaven because he wouldn't die and if it was angels couldn't have done it but they have no ways so when he come to even the garden they started real slow look how beautiful you are don't you know eve that they're withholding from you the very thing you know when she was in adam when god said multiply and replenish the earth agree don't you think that some of that would be retained when she would be put in her own natural being especially if she was part of adam's soul part of his being but we think we get it all figured out when we think that then adam was masculine and feminine we see him on one side and he said oh you're doing this one animal hi animals how you doing i don't think anyway i'm sorry here regardless of what you think was pulled out and put over the other you got to remember there were one that's right two people standing there with bodies right right but one identity her name was adam she don't get the name eve until the fall transmits that's right so the beauty of the things that she had the way she was made now i'm sorry i just talked plain so if you don't like it i'm sorry you don't see too many prostitutes that weigh 450 pounds not blown enough yes i'm sorry you don't see that that's right it's in beauty your sisters have your beauty but your beauty is your husband and why is it you get up and you pretty yourself up and you really smell good and you look good and you dress up just go buy groceries and the hubby comes in and there you are and there it all moves around okay you get the point and it will shock me if i come in one day my wife was standing there with a you know all dolled up and everything and said hi honey i'd say oh wrong house well honest she does dress up for me though i just hope you get the point i'm trying to get to you a simple little instruction what was the difference in adam and eve we don't solve one problem adam had ever ability and produced the ability and it says he killed the human rights he said brother daley never heard nobody talk like him i agree with you but is it the truth yes that's right but eve got in her beauty i know be glad to get them to you lord around said she was made that way he said she was made beautiful how did he know i'd run around but i loved it because i believe him he said there stood adam said he wasn't a great big masculine thing looking like a big city just kind of wasn't a guy problem maybe you know but he said understood if i get it wrong y'all correct what blond-headed blue-eyed beautiful he said i see all these pictures they draw and said makes it look so weird but he said no said she was the prettiest woman and you know what how many quotes you want that was her curse you want tim told you i don't bring everything you think i'd pray a lot but that was her curse the curse of making her beautiful to make her to give her to adam god didn't want to give adam an ugly woman he doesn't want an ugly woman i ain't talking about when you got run over by a truck you can't have it you know what i mean by that that's an old joke among us we're a bunch of we're just ugly but beauty is beauty i look at you girls and i see you i think oh god what if it would be for a world full of people the word that you see the sisters that are really dressed nice and you know not showing yourself to the world why would you want to show yourself to the world why would you want to unveil your body and show it to the world not realizing you're going to pay for commitment adultery but why wouldn't you want to have your beauty to your husband and your husband only see if he would have stayed right look what it would have been lucifer to stay right look what it would have been but eve was made and given a beautiful being of herself and satan says don't you realize that's what you're made for i've preached to you what 40 years and you know what i'm fixing to say what i preach for 40 years satan was trying to tell eve that she was going to bring forth the product that god wanted rob i've always believed that she believed she was going to bring forth what god had said multiply and replenish the earth she was trying to help god just as sarah was trying to help god when she gave hagar to abraham her beauty was her curse she wasn't made as i said to be all lustful you look beautiful she had to be brought into a place and that had to be through her spiritual being in their spiritual beings she began to accept satan's lie right and then things started happening then the beast could say look at the animals they are reproducing that's what you made for but at that time the animals were reproducing look what they're doing they're multiplying replenishing the earth because that's what you're money for brother brown said the mind things she done she mixed her seed she couldn't wait well where's original seed he said the church can't wait you look around this message people and you see that they can't wait they gotta have something tantalizing something going something running some way some new thing now brother brown said the way that the woman was made with one thing and i'll end with he said she was made to be able to receive at any time a male said whereas the animals you look at a line but he's mean and tough but he will not touch that female until she's ready because he knows he's going to have some scars on his he said she was made to work she could receive a mail at any time now i've been not going away i think a lot of times but i was going to say part of it what's wrong with a man and wife being husband and wife and living together now you understand my point everybody know what i'm talking about what's wrong with that nothing so was she made in a bad way but her beauty her desire of knowledge her all kind of things took her to a place that she eventually done the wrong thing no right act with the wrong person as you say she didn't become a hybrid for a high breeder because that's what she done she bred the animal race to the human race and then you can think all you want to of how holy and pious and lovely you are you ain't nothing but a hybrid that's right every human being in the world except jesus christ prophet priest king or who is a hybrid you want those quotes brother branham said i'm a hybrid because you see the byproduct that should have been that brother maloney said actually the word foreign and i don't know this in the greek i'm just quoting him sounds good he said in the greek that really eve was signifying as being a womb of wounds w-o-m-b one you know to reproduce the man that's how close it is she's given to reproduce man her problem was she refused to reproduce an animal in man because we know what happened in the garden you ever noticed then that god didn't curse adam you want the quote god didn't curse he you want the quote he cursed the animal because now the animal must be the sacrifice that's right because he said the animal calls to fall now it must be accepted as a sacrifice so then you started making your sacrifices of animals until jesus came a lot of people don't read enough to know what read around and say it but what about it you sisters you have the most wonderful opportunity in the world hold yourself keep yourself pure why won't you even want to go in and show your body why would you have any desires whatsoever as to anyone else besides your husband and i'll say say that brothers why would you because remember i just got through proving the point that you may not like a lot of people here that won't like it at all but you know adam had a part to do with this thing because he had a choice now let's don't go too far okay because there is doctrines among the people of the message that said adam grabbed eve and planted his seed within her to save her now you brother gary what was that you used to tell me about them when y'all live down on the 10th street you know the hippie movement free love if sex is what kept eve from being destroyed then what's wrong with it no no no come on sex didn't keep me from being destroyed sex was the original and then they'll take julian and tamar and they bring it over and they try to bring out these beautiful things and they show that tamar took you know judah took tamar planted his seed to savor let me quote brother branham i don't see how that adultery can be a predestinated seed quote brother there where does that leave me because i'm not don't worry about it because ain't none of us in this building original season naturally i don't care what you think your family come from what tree you come off of all the human race is a garbage can was run around saying that an illegitimate child he said i don't see how the illegitimate child can go into rapture you see why people want to quote but they don't answer the quote every one of us in this building was born from an adulterous act right oh no no my mom and dad was married well what about grandma grandpa what about grandpa grandpa grandpa grandpa grandpa don't remember the bibles this is bad for one's other that's right what's brother brown saying an illegitimate child is not a predestinated seed because he talked about the seed of natural things because if you get born again you're not illegitimate anymore and if i was bastard born from 40 generations and you could prove my dna went straight back to cain i would still stand here today and say jesus christ has saved me no sex act didn't save me a creation to come into being all right to take my place and pay my price my child going into rapture no but all babies go to heaven so what are you worried about that's right from the time we go into rapture it's only three and a half years maybe you can't believe it three and a half years old so don't worry about it but it's not going in the rapture with you because like i've always told you you have a child today and rapture takes place tomorrow that baby's going with you if mom and daddy are going i believe that because i believe in in jesus christ being a savior a redeemer he come to redeem you and i from those things that we thought were our ideas and that's the main sin that we have is our concept or thoughts of what we believe because mama told me grandma told me grandpa told me he said we're laying in the bible yes it is people are getting just upset with you because you tell them it's not in the bible mom told me what i don't want to call mama liar i just say mama didn't read it right that's right my mama your mama who it was they just didn't read it right because we're down here remember we're here where it can be brought into being now the thing that was in heaven that was unbelief and the thing that happened in the garden now why is it that you see around this message that is turning to beautiful buildings and beautiful congregations sorry not jealous i don't want 700 i'd wear my arm out because you know yourself when i go outside i shake hands with everybody you don't shake hands with me today it'll be your fault you won't hang around long enough if i had 700 i'd shake hands with 700. i know jealousy of all these people we could have that we could have a brand new building but instead of that we try to put it back in for the work of the lord okay i'm tickled but we really work good around here we look at the video sometimes when we see we did that the things here at sure oh yeah we got a little small 700 camera or something maybe i don't know what it was sitting over here and the man sitting on the still haven't operated don't even have automatic controls and we have a small place up here to the to the musicians have to play in harmony because if the film goes up the horn's got to go down they have enough room to breathe i need a lot about beauty around here but you know i love it i love her music i love people because we're trying the same thing we're trying amen trying to get rid of what he let get in her way oh look how y'all look at lulu got all the words ain't nobody look whoever said that where'd you get it i never said we got all the word that's right i hear a preacher come up here and say we've got all the word i'll get up right behind him say will he lie i'm not a problem we don't claim that we just claim to have what god gives us thank god for that a rejoicing time about all of it where do we got me all right all right anybody have any yes have amen decided is is oh i have decided let's see your party oh oh oh oh um me like your desires you leave so today inside so you\n"}, {"id": 23930, "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2013-01-04 - 10-0627pm - God Has Provided Himself a

It's such a pleasure to be here. I surely thank brother Sam for inviting me to come and brother Gavin for letting me tag along, you know. You know, actually when I come to the I was raised in church majority of my life, but when I said I got born again, the first actual message church I'd actually went to was brother Homer's. And brother Homer wasn't there. He was visiting preaching somewhere. And brother Gavin was actually the first person I ever heard preach a sermon in a message church. And I remember it was entitled, \"To whom I believe, I report.\" Right. And that day it ministered to me a whole lot. And I remember standing there that day cuz you know I done life had done God done take me down a road to where I guess you could say I done had a Pentecostal experience in my life. God had used me in many ways. I was raised in a Pentecostal church. Pentecostal gifts, the gifts of the spirit was a normal thing. Right. You know, but actually receiving the word That's right. Without the Holy Ghost, you'll never receive the word. That's right. And I remember standing in that sermon that in that service that day and I thought, Lord, what is it that I'm to do now? Cuz there was something much in my heart and I knew, you know, I knew the Lord done give me the Holy Ghost a time when I was sitting at my house when the Lord actually gave me the ability to believe his word. Amen. And you know, I had not been water baptized correctly yet. You know, but you know, we know scripture that's still correct according to Cornelius's man. You know, as when they heard and they believed, they received that power from on high. And you know, I remember in that service, the Lord just laid on my heart, be water baptized. You know, cuz he g me that revelation, the very first revelation. And I just love Brother Gab a whole lot. Means a lot to me. Feel real tiny up here. I know I'm a big guy, but I feel real tiny. I sat in brother way Sunday school lesson, and to hear him teach, I thought I felt real small, you know. I mean, I really enjoyed it, you know. I definitely there's nothing I can tell you that you never heard before. I felt just like a little kid, but I love the Lord and he lives in my heart and I just want to share something we hope to lift you up. I'm going to read from Genesis 15 starting at chapter or chapter 15 verse 4. If I had a title, the brother asked me said you had a title. I said I did until you asked me. My mind get to blame. But if I had a title, it would be God has provided himself a sacrifice. Yes. And behold, the word of the Lord came on him, saying, This shall not be thine air, but he that shall come forth out of thine own boughs, shall be thine air. And he brought him forth and brought us and said, \"Look now towards heaven, tell the stars, and sh thou shalt be able to number them.\" And he said unto them, \"So shall thy seed be.\" And he believed in the Lord, and he counted unto him for righteousness. And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of out of the Chaldes to give thee this land to inherit it. And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? He said unto him, \"Take me an heer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.\" And he took unto him all these, and divide them in a mist, and laid each piece one against another, but the birds divided he not. Now, let's skip down here to the 17th. And it came to pass that when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day, the Lord made a made a covenant with Abraham. You may be seated. Thank you, Lord. And I really love looking here at Abraham because Abraham reminds me a lot of myself. Abraham, he had never received the oracles of God. He was a club on his back, he come out of the southern part of of u of Babylon. He worshiped Ruth. They worshiped idols. He had no idea of one god. He was never taught that in his whole life. I was never taught to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I was never taught the things that I've been taught when God brought this word to me. So when I look at Abraham and I know the word teaching me that Abraham is the father of my faith for that same covenant Abraham gave that God gave Abraham, God gave it to me also. It's an unconditional covenant. Not by what I knew, not by the intellects, not what my parents taught me, not by the church that ingrained their doctrines into me, but by the mighty hand of Hoba coming down and picking me up and saying, \"I'm going to place my life inside of you. I'm going to put my mind inside of your soul. And from this day forth, you going to walk and possess the land that I have put before you.\" So therefore, I mean, I really when I look at Abraham, it makes me very excited. Amen. And I look here and it says, I'm going read some quotes here from all things. Brother Bram said, God's first decision was to pardon a man by the shed blood. That's right. And God cannot make the second decision against his first decision. If he did, then his first decision was wrong, and he couldn't be wrong and be God. That's right. Come on now. Come on down. He said, since that time, that's been God's only place of fellowship to meet with him. Before there, he met him in the Garden of Eden. No blood had to be necessary. But since that time, since the fall, his decision was to meet man back, redeemed by blood. It's been the only place that fellowship could be observed by God. It's the only place that God can meet a sinner. And we're all sinners by nature. It takes a blood sacrifice to bring us back into fellowship with Christ again. No other way. It is absolutely totally. That is the only way. And we know that looking back in the Garden of Eden, we know Genesis being the seed chapter. We see Cain and Well, we see Adam and Eve and when they fell, they were so embarrassed and they went and they hid themselves and they covered themselves with figal leaves and we know that that was nothing more than their own ideals, their own techniques to hide themselves from God. And then later on, here comes Cain and Abel. And when they come upon the earth, we know that brother Bren teaches us that they taught them their traditions and their doctrines. They taught Cain and Abel that hey, it was by the fruit that we failed. Of course, they wanted to cover up. Oh yeah. what they had done. Of course, it would be embarrassing. Here's Kane, an illegitimate child, basically. And Cain, you're really your daddy's really not Adam. It's is the beast. Of course, they wouldn't want to tell him that. And when I look back in my life growing up, I see things that was taught to me. I'd asked my parents at times, and God God knows my parents were some of the best people I think that ever walked the earth. They are not hypocrites. They live what they know, and they live it to the best of their ability. Sometimes they make me ashamed if you really want to know the truth, but they have not received truth. And there's things that was taught to me and I preachers and pastors, they sit there and they teach you say, \"What about the Bible here?\" When the Bible says this, well, it mean well, no, it don't really mean that. And the reason why most time is cuz they've already, if they're still walking alone, most time God's already presented them with truth. And at that time, they've already turned away from this truth, but yet they're still living a religious lifestyle. They're still receiving blessings. They're still getting healed. They're still financially blessed and they live a more victorious life than most of us do. And that's just the basic truth. Well, they still living in this religious facade, but yet they don't want to tell you the truth because if they do, then they're going to uncover their sin. Then they going to have to repent and they going to have to come and make things right and set a new example and actually stay before God. Well, here's Cain and Abel coming forth. And I and I can imagine, you know, when you see a child that has a defect or a child that has a problem, the parents kind of pamper that child. Even if the if the problem is not handicapping the child, they still kind of they pamper that child. They when they when they do things, they make excuses for why they do things. Well, a lot of parents do that regardless if the child's got problems or not. But anyhow, they sit there and they they pamper that child. Right. And I can see Cain out here cuz you know Cain did not have he did not have the same nature of his dead. He was a liar. He was a deceiver and he finally manifested himself as a murderer. We know that he did not have the characteristics of of Adam. So when he do things, I'm sure Abel and and everybody around would be like, you know, watch Kane and their mom and daddy because you know there's a secret there. Why does Cain act so much different than me? There's a secret there. They don't want that to be unleashed. They don't want him to know that. So throughout their whole life, they told him something totally different. And you know, here's Cain. He's a tiller of the ground. He produces the fruit. At this time, people did not eat animals. And here's Abel out there tending these stinking sheep for what purpose? I can't imagine, you know, here's Abel of of a kind nature. He has a nature of his daddy. Yeah. Right. He has a nature of God as much as he possibly can cuz he came from Adam. Here he is with his humble nature and he's out here and I can imagine what is he doing to provide for his family other than raising these sheep. Here's Kane out here with him being half beast. I'm sure he was probably bigger. He probably look more handsome. That's you know brother taught us that about the serpent. Well, here he is standing there. He produces all the food. I actually think him coming in one day and say, \"Yeah, what what why' you donate to the family today? you know. Yeah. He said, \"Well, I brought us all food today. I provide the whole family with food. My my two acres out here provided us with food. They provide us with live sufferings. What you provided us with?\" You know, but see the thing is when I go back into the Bible and I look, you know, Proverbs tell us that the goats were for milk and for meat, but the sheep were for clothing. So, here's Abel tending these sheep for one reason. One reason only, to provide clothing. Right. Right. M God's only provided way of a sacrifice was through this blood to be the spill blood of that that that innocent lamb laying there. Yeah, I can imagine if anybody I know brother D. I know a lot of people in here I'm sure you hunt and you fish people farm. One of the scariest most horrible heart feeling things man. We went to brother homers to get a goat and I cleaned a lot of animals you know but when we took this goat his nanny and his sibl was there when we took it out of the pin they all just started crying. Yeah. And started pitching a fit because they knew something was wrong. They knew this goat was some going somewhere to the slaughter and they just cry and they'd cry. And I can just imagine Abel sitting out there in the field tending these sheep. The brother been harassing him all this time doing all these great works, providing for them. And he's standing there in the field crying, \"Lord, why is it that I'm out here tending these sheep? Why is it that I got to take this rock and break their neck and cut them off and listen to them bleed and cry, get blood all over my hands? I have to rip their hide off and and disavow their entrance. My brother, he don't do nothing but go here and tear the ground and get all the glory. And all I do whenever we need new clothing, I'm over here and I got to do all this. You know, it breaks his heart to hear that lamb cry. You know, it did. He had the nature of God. Hey, I love to hunt, but I only kill so I can hunt. I don't hunt to kill. I hate to watch any animal die. But I can imagine Abel sitting there killing that lamb and he's screaming and crying and the blood coming at him, crying and waiting out to God and all of a sudden one day God just shows a flash in his mind and he sees God sitting on Calvary. He sees Jesus Christ sitting there and all a sudden a revelation breaks forth and he sees I remember my mom and daddy had a lamb. I remember they had clothes on them when they come out. They tell me about that. Where did he get that from? Who who crucified Ethan first? He stealed that first lamb. It was Jehovah. God provided his own sacrifice. He g his own clothing. And I can see everybody sitting there saying how God has provided a lamb for me. And even though he sit there and he was ridiculed by his intelligent brother. Oh yeah. His smarter brother. The one that made more money. The one that had a more luxurious car. Come on now. The one that took vacation three or four times a year. Oh Lord have mercy. He sit there and be persecuted by his more self-righteous brother. We know brother told us. He said Cain was a far better man than Abel. Esau was a far better man than Isaac or Jacob. And but where is the desire? Where's the nature of God? Where is the supernatural manifesting out into the natural? Anytime the supernatural manifests itself into the natural, that seed germ of God expressing himself in these five senses is always going to be ridiculed. It's going to be persecuted. It's going to be condemned. It's going to have to go through the hall of Christ before God can never put it to a place where it can be used. And I can see here, we know it's because the bloodshed that God accepted Abel's sacrifice. That's right. We know that. But the Bible says in Hebrews, it was by faith. Faith, we know, is a revelation. It's an understanding. It's not an intellectual indoctrination. It's not a memorization of of quotes. It's not a memorization of the Bible. It's not nothing of penance. It's not nothing that you can do. It's just something that most of the time when we out here living our daily life, scrubbing, trying to make ends meet in living for God, trying our best to walk one step in front of the other, trying to follow that life. God just flashes something in front of your eyes. No, it's not nothing that you can do. It's not nothing that you can do except for except yield to it and love him for it. Praise him for it. Oh, just worship him and just thank God that you're alive. Thank God that you can actually demonstrate God's nature to mankind. Amen. Amen. Amen. I can see Kane, you know, when he come up and offer the sacrifice to God. Yeah. And here's Abel. Man, you know, you know, Abel was not a hotty man. He was a humble man. He was a meek man. He was a lowly man. He had to be because that's the nature of God. That's the nature of his daddy. Here's Kane. Sure. He walks up there with this big pile of fruit. This the estate of his family. My parents told me that this was the most important thing. I've got their doctrines down to a pat. Yeah. I got their doctrines down to such a pat that when I go to church, they love me. They think I'm right with God. Oh yeah. They think I'm worshiping God. All my friends thinking I'm just fitting right in and they think I'm going to the ranch. I really don't know if I'm if I really got God in my life or not. But everybody else is happy. Everybody else believes I'm right on target. And not only that, if it wasn't for me, the church wouldn't be half of what it is. They wouldn't be able to have the facilities they got. They wouldn't have the nice equipment that they got. They wouldn't have none of that stuff if it wasn't for me. Yeah. So when he comes and he lays that before God, God said, \"Uh, Amen. I don't know. I I really don't like that too much. That didn't come from me. Yeah. But when animal comes, he offers up the fatted lambs. That's all he had to offer. I'm sure he could have went to Cain and said, \"Cane, can I have some of that fruit?\" Yeah. You know, since that is the the substance of our lives, since that is what makes our lives go, since that is our daily food, can I have some of that? I believe that would be a better sacrifice to God. All my sacrifice is is is a spiritual revelation. Yeah. But no, it didn't work that way. Cuz see, God showed him something beyond the veil of time. God showed him his mind. He showed him his plan. The great God of this universe. He showed him himself to Abel. So when Abel walked up, he presented that God said, \"I like that. I love that. That came from me. That didn't come from you. It didn't come from your mama. It didn't come from your daddy. It didn't come from your thinking. It didn't come from your ideas or your traditions. that came straight from me and I accept it. I love it. And I'm sure when Abel was out there in the field, I don't have anything to back this up. This is just me, but I'm sure when Cain and Abel was out there in the field, I just blessing. God has always had a path of redemption. God has always wanted to bring men into his bosom. I can see Abel out there with the nature of his daddy saying, \"Ke, this is why I offered up a lamb. God showed me one day when I was out there crying.\" Y having a skinless lamb. God show me this. This is why. Well, God didn't show me nothing. That ain't what a mama and daddy teaches. That ain't what pastor so and so teach us. That ain't what mama says, daddy says, deacon says. That ain't where'd you get that from? But God told me. I don't believe in it. Oh yeah. Well, he did. And after a while, he had to believe it because God honored it. And then God honored me and God vindicated it. That's when he slew, right? I believe with my whole heart that Abel was out there trying to convert his brother because that's the nature of his daddy. Always has been to bring me into his bosom. I believe he'll stand there saying, \"Cane, please, if you just do this, God will accept you. Listen to me.\" He couldn't do it. Pride. Pride will kill a man every single time. Not only will it kill him, it'll cause him to kill his brother. Every single time. Pride and envy. So, I truly believe that's exactly what happened to Abra. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. And I'm going come on down here. Looking at Abraham says here, first faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. Then the believer hears it recognizes and acts upon it. The carnal man will hear it. That's right. Cain heard it. Right. God gave him a witness. God told him, \"If you'll do as your brother do, you'll be fine.\" He gave him a witness. He always gives a man a way out. The carnal man will hear it. The sound of it, but never hears means to understand. Oh, come on now. Preach. Look at it. It's looking at something, but to see it is to understand it. Right? Except a man be born again, he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God. Right now, I'm fixing to say something. I want you to hear me out before you have any thoughts come through your mind. I hear, you know, I've only been born again, I say, for about eight years. I've been around God's re revealed word from that years. I come from the outside in. I come in brand new. Like I said, I'm like a little kid, right? But when I come in, you know, I hear people say often times, \"Well, Brother Bam said it. I believe it. I said it. I just believe it. Brother B says, so I believe it.\" And hey, the saddest thing about this people like that about their pastor. Now, I believe God sent ordained ministers, pastor, to see you through. I thank God for the one I got. I love Brother Homer to death. God could have placed me with no other pastor. Come on. Except for Brother Homer. That's just the way I feel about him because that's where God put me. Amen. I mean, I I may not be there my whole life. That's right. But for the time God has me there, there ain't no other pastor. You say, \"Well, maybe not for me.\" Well, I ain't talking about you. I'm talking about for me, cuz we're all different. I believe in a pastor. I believe in deacons, evangelists, teachers, apostles, prophets. I believe in that 100%. But people, they get, \"Well, mama said this or daddy said this, and I believe it. Brother Brown said this, I believe it, and as long as I believe it, I'm going to heaven.\" That is the fattest lie of the devil I ever heard in my entire life. And the thing is to even say the correct terminology, I believe it, but yet you don't understand it, you don't believe it. That's right. Cuz to believe it, you got to understand it. You may agree with it, right? But agreeing with it don't do nothing but get you into a place of responsibility to agree with it. The devil agrees with it. Everybody that's ever heard it that has any kind of common sense. The majority of it, they agree with it. But agreeing with it won't do nothing but get you a fast ticket to hell and they should get born again. So when people say, \"Well, I believe it. I don't understand it, but I believe it. As long as I believe it, I'm all right.\" That is a lie. That is a lie. We must press. Brother Graham says it right here. It's to understand it. He said a drunk will believe it on the street. He asked him, \"You believe Jesus Christ son?\" Oh, I believe. Intellectually, he agrees. But brother Brandham says that grace through intellectual knowledge. You first get intellectual knowledge. That's the first step. You got to become a recognization of the truth. But when that intellectual knowledge hits, brother Ram said, grace, grace drops in when the Holy Ghost and turns that intellectual knowledge into faith. So inside that soul where you once had doubt, it's now been turned into the faith of God. It's God's faith that makes you born again. And once you get born again, then brother said that seed it starts to grow and it drives out all the other seeds. It drives out every other seed. And to see how important that is. Oh, how important it is the only source of life. It is only source of life. Brother Graham taught us, you know, in the Old Testament, the high priest could only marry a virgin. That's the only thing he could marry. The only thing brother comes along marries divorce. He said that is a typhen of Christ and his bride. Now we know the regular priest they can marry a virgin or they can marry a widow of a priest. Blessing. This is the thing spiritually that's a spiritual type of Jesus Christ and the bride. Spiritually every one of us had a husband. I don't care if you're a male or female. And in a invisible union of Jesus Christ brother teaches us that we was all married to Satan. The Bible teaches that man has to die. He said you can't divorce that man. You can't put him up on the side. He has to die. But once you died, you ain't a virgin. Come on. You had a husband and that husband was not a priest. He was not a priesthood of a priesthood. It was not not at all. But that's why you got to be born again. And once you get born again, then it's just as if you never done it in the first place. People say, \"Well, what is justification? You ain't never done it in the first place. I know brother Brandham said a woman leaves her leaves her virtue that she can't be justified in this lifetime. In this lifetime. Exactly. Amen. I I had a very rough I got a very rough past in a lot of ways that I'm very much ashamed of. But I also it's a testimony to God. That's right. Uh, if you ever see me weep and cry, I'm sure it's like to most of you. It's just cuz how much I love God and how much he's done for me. Amen. I got arrested when I was a young. I was probably I was 19 when I got arrested for possession of drugs. I pleaded youthful offender. And what that meant is that it's actually I don't ever have to put it on the resume. Come on. Nobody ever has to know that I was ever prosecuted or convicted of that. misdemeanor, right? But the judge, if I ever go back to court, the judge sees that record. Yeah. On my personal record, when they pull it up, they see playful offender, misdemeanor, class, you know, B felony, drug charge or misdemeanor. But see, I to that judge, I can't tell him I never did do that. I can tell my employee that. Now, in this lifestyle, if a woman was to lose her virtue, she can't tell her husband, \"Well, I'm a virgin.\" You can't tell him that. If if if I get convicted of stealing something, you come up and said, \"Jimmy, have you ever stole anything?\" Well, yeah, I have. If I ask you if you're ever lied, yeah, I lied. But ask God that question. If you are dead in Christ and been born again, God says, \"What are you talking about?\" I don't know what you talking about. Unless you do it again, you never done it in the first place. God ain't like that judge that can see my misdemeanor because of a youthful offender plea. He can't see it. It is God justification. I I see people that I just wish Yeah. I can make them see justification because if God is saying can never come and bind you by your past, your whole victory is sacked. Anything that you think you can do in a supernatural walk, he takes it away from you. He strips it from you. He strips your faith. He strips your happiness. He strips your joy. He strips your healing. Everything your prayer life. It don't matter what it is. If he abides you by your past, I don't care how bad your past was. I don't care. I guarantee you a lot of too much worse than mine. I guarantee you. But see, the blood, the bleach blood of Jesus Christ, it does away with everyone. Don't you realize that's the only fellowship you'll ever have with God? and never get to the point that you never done in the first place. If you can't get to that point, you have no fellowship with God. He cannot fellowship with somebody that doubts and don't believe. You got to have faith to fellowship with God. And if you don't believe justifications, you ain't even to the first step yet. You ain't even there yet. Amen. So to believe and to understand is the same thing. And when you believe and understand, it creates an action. Amen. You do something. You don't sit there and say, \"Well, let me turn to this page and let's record it. Flip over here. Yeah, that compares.\" Yeah, that Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's good. Yeah, I like that. And do all this right here. And uh that's wonderful. I got this figured out. Yeah. I And it don't change your life. You don't understand nothing. You may can teach it. You may can explain it, but you don't believe it. Cuz if you believe that, whatever you looking at, your life will line up to it. Now, there's things that we agree with. Now, you may want to say, \"Well, we believe unto.\" That's all right. I understand. I understand what people say. I understand when people say, \"Well, I believe it any.\" I understand what they mean, right? But the thing is, the devil is so slight. Brother Brandham, in a in a deep call to the deep, he said there, he says, he's talking about people that have visions. He's talking about seers has visions. He said their subconscious, their conscious mind are just like this right here. He said they're not really ever asleep. They're not ever really awake. He said their their subconscious and consciousness is mixed. He said the subconscious is down here. He said that's actually the steam room in the locomotive. That's what actually drives you. He said the man up here. He said the conscious don't really drive you. He said it's the subconscious. He said it's the subconscious that I'm trying to contact. That's what I'm trying to get to. Cuz if you get to the subconscious, it will override the conscious. It'll make you the devil is so sly when you start saying words like that. If you ain't careful, he hits that subconscious. When you do, he done conceived you of a lie and that that that lie is done come in and it's conceived. It's going to give birth. And when it does, it's doubt. And when you don't believe the word just because of one slide of a man, I I've met people Well, I believe it. And it's like they just floating on a cloud, right? Yeah. Like nothing else in the world matters. And that uh that's it. That's all they got to do. Man, don't you realize that Christianity is not a bad ease? God said before he had to go preach marriage and divorce. He said if he said man run from presence of God. He said if you're floating down the stream I like to go kaying a whole lot. Love go fishing down a creek. So I can relate to this. When you going down a stream, he said and you just stop and you're sitting there and you're watching the birds and you're watching the butterflies. He said you ain't doing the will of God. He said it's when you roaming upstream. He said it's when you fight. He said when you just sitting there watching everything go by. You're sherking your responsibilities. It's when we fight and we press. It's not when we eat cookies. It ain't when we go to a PD. It ain't when we hear flowery things that make us feel good. It's when we press and we fight for an eagle to have to climb a hair. Then look, brother talking about Ishmael. He said Ishma was nothing more than a carnal believer. Right? We know here after Abraham after God come and showed him that pillar of fire right after that the next chapter Sarah brings Hagar to him right the very next chapter right I mean after this come has been made the supernatural he sees here comes Hagar and I'm sure Hagar we know she was already sterile excuse me or Baron but Abraham I feel like she may have thought he was running out of put it that way because it was 10 years finally 10 years Abraham he probably thought the same through and said I guess I will I take Hagar and it created Ishmael we know Ishmael was a seed of doubt and that seed of doubt took place now Abraham loved Ishmael he loved him he was his only son for I think I kind of calculated what 16 18 years something like that or that was when he was expelled I know his 13 years when he was circumcised but he had it for a long time the only son he had is blood. He didn't want him to go nowhere. And then when God when Sarah got mad at him the second time and to see how much God's hand was on Ishmael's life, it it confounds me because God saved God. Brother Ram said it was the same rot that came to Hagar was the same rock that gave the children of Israel water. The same rock, the same God that dropped down and heard the cries of Ishmael. So God because he said because that Ishmael is your seed I'll watch over him. He actually made in a way made a covenant with Ishmael as well. He did with Hagar said I'll multiply make him increasing just not a regular multitude but an increasing body. He's going to make him a powerful people 12 princes. But you know he says there it amazed me cuz you know brother Brandham points out shows how when it went when he when Abraham went to take Isaac he said me and the lad will return. Then he knew that was a type that even though God told him he was going to kill him, God knew that since he got him from a supernatural birth that he could raise him from the dead just the same. But when I look at Ishmael, Abraham had the same kind of faith. Cuz Abraham yearned in his heart, he actually come to God said, \"God, you know, basically just to dramatize this guy Sarah's going to kick him out again. He been persecuting. He been persecuting Isaac and she's mad and wants him out of here. I don't want Ishmael to go. That's my oldest son.\" God said, \"That's all right. I'm going to take care of him cuz he's thy seed. He said because he's thy seed, I'm going to take care of him. He said, \"But it will not be out of that lineage.\" He said, \"But it'll be through Isaac that your seed shall be caught.\" There's a big difference there, and we all know that. But here's that seed of Ishmael. He sends him out to the desert. Gives him one bottle of water. One bottle of water. One. You tell me for one minute. Abraham year painful. so painful that God actually comes down and talks to him directly to ease his pain, to tell him he's going to take care of him and actually give Ishmael a type of a covenant. Abraham knew that God was going to take care of him. Yeah. Just like he knew he was going to take care of Isaac. If not, he' gave him a whole camel full of water. He gave him one bottle of water and then God he sustained him. He had faith in God. He knew he was going to take care of him cuz God told him he would. Well, here's Ishmael out there. The Bible puts it in such a way when the angel comes to Hagar a second time, he says, you know, he'll make him a mighty nation. He said, but his hand will be against every man. Now, he laid it out in that platform in that scenario. He didn't say every man's hand will be against him and his against every. He said his hand will be against every man. And I'll tell you something, we got a whole lot of ismos running around. Hey, cuz see brother, the Bible says that he will dwell with his brethren. Who is his brethren? Isaac. That's who his brother was. They had the same day. He will dwell with his brethren and become a mighty nation. We got a bunch of Ishmails running around shooting bows and archers at one another. Hey, you see it all time. You let somebody watch something on the internet. I don't agree with that. 7. Yeah. Hey, you done shot a boat. You preach a sermon, you walk outside, brother, that ain't right. The reason I ain't right cuz brother B say they shot another air. Hey, you say was there something? Look, I know brother Bham said. He said if you hear me say something wrong, you're obligated to come and tell me. But see, there's a difference between you telling them and God telling. If you come, it depends on what your ambition, what's your motives, your objectives. Now, it's published up. The Bible says a sudden to show thyself approved unto God, not unto man. I don't care how much you know. I'm just going to let you know. I want to see how much you can live. That's what I want to see. I don't care how much you know. I see tell you all kinds of opinions. I tell you all kinds of traditions, doctrines. I tell you my ideas about all kinds of stuff. But that don't matter. I want to see how you live. Cuz if no proof, they'll prove who you are, you got nothing. Cuz truth is absolute. So when you come up, when God creates an atmosphere, correction can abide in love. When God creates the atmosphere, when man creates the atmosphere, it's just strife, it's murder. And if you ain't careful and both of you got the wrong spirit, you going get in a fight. That's right. You don't get in an argument. You don't get in a debate. But the thing is, one of you may actually have the Holy Ghost. Uh-oh. Actually, one of you may have the Holy Ghost. So, a bad atmosphere gets actually quenched by the Holy Ghost. That brother can take him. Well, brother, that's all right. Just pray for me. I love you. I I need all the help I can get. You know, that's right. But when you see brothers attacking one another over doctrine, blessing, you don't never see nobody fuss over, brother so and so got healed. Well, I don't like that. I don't like that at all. I wish I'd been over there and he so and so got saved, got filled with the Holy Ghost. Well, I just don't agree with that. I don't agree with that at all. Which I know, brother Brown said, it's only the word that brings separation. It's the word that always brings separation, but it's not Christ don't separate himself from others. It's disbelief that separates himself from Christ. It's darkness that flees from light. So if you walk around running about everybody off from you because what's coming out of your mouth, I don't care if it's 100% true. Guess what? That ain't God. That ain't the Holy Ghost. Now if your life, what you walking and what you living and your love and everything and that's running people off, we can't help it. That's being persecuted for the word's sake. God said, you know, the blessings you'll receive off of it. You know, he said, you know, if they do me that way, how are they going to do you, the master of the house? That's right. So, we got a lot of isshails running around. The thing is, and brother home preaches at home a lot of times. I've heard him before mention it. You know, brother Brandham, and I know brother heard, you know, said there's, it's always stuck out to me when I first heard it, but there's three types of believers in all services. Oh my. You know, brother Brandon, brother home, bring it on down. He said there's actually three types of believer in you cuz you are the church. Right? So, I'm going to kind of go off of that for a minute because it's so true. This flesh man is an unbeliever. This spiritual man, it's a make believer. It wants to believe, but the inside man is either a believer or an unbeliever. So, you got all which if you're a child of God, you got a believer, an unbeliever, and a make believe all in the same body right here. But see, the thing is, I better watch it cuz if I'm being motivated or influenced by the wrong spirit, I may just be playing the part of an Ishmael. I be a born again child of God. But when this carnal man, if I don't yield, if I've had a bad day, or if I ain't been in the presence of God, or if I've been just slack and I get influenced, if I ain't careful, I shoot a bow. And then when I do, but see, the difference is when a seed of God shoots a bow. Oh my. Oh, that's right. Oh, God. Right. And he's going to he ain't going to be able to hardly do nothing until he talks to that brother. He's going to have to tell that brother, I shouldn't have said that. You know, he's going to break it down and he's going to apologize and he's going to make things right. But if we ain't careful, I play the part of an issue. I've been guilty of it. Hey, this all relates to me just as much as it does to anybody. I'm preaching to myself because I want to walk in the way that God He wants me to walk. I see some faults in me that God allows me to see and I want them to be corrected. So, you know, just because we do play the part of Ishmael, sometimes, you know, we going to leave this brochure, this past house, you know, it ain't never going to be redeemed. Uh, it's just this man on the inside. So, we got on this thing until we get out of here. But the great thing is of his redemption power. It's the blood that God gives us that we can actually meet up under, right? And that's the only place. It is the only place. It is the absolute. Brother said that the blood is an absolute. and take this definition here. This actually brother Brown now I was hearing a man speak or talking not long ago he used the word absolute and I thought that's a very fine word to hear somebody use absolute comes down he said and it's an ultimate wester is perfect in itself unlimited in its power primarily an ultimate an ultimate is the amen the blood itself is an amen now we know that the word is the bleeding is the bleeding word of God now it's not that this Bible is bleeding. This Bible is just sitting here just fine. It's not that the letter if it was the letter or the tradition or it's the dogmas or whatever we can actually learn absorb into our brain. If that was a place that God gave us fellowship, then we would all have fellowship. Come on. There would not be three types of believers period. I mean true actually three types of believers. We would all be under a robe of fellowship. We'd be all up under that blood bumper. But the thing is it's right back to what Cain and Abel. It's right back to when when the log gods came and he came to Abraham and it made this covenant. The bleeding word is an actual sp true true uh happen to where the person a lot of times it you know sometime I told this guy at work I wish I could just take off my my brain or my heart and set it right here and let you just jack into it and just get cuz I can't give it the way I want to give it you know but you sit here and this word comes along and when it does it's not just a word it's not understanding. It's the actual logos. It's actually God himself coming to you and opening up himself. He's showing you who he is. And I don't mean blessing. What do we expect out of God? Do we expect God's blood sacrifice to be a doctrine? Do we expect it to be a lifestyle? Do we expect it something just to just walk us through until we get out of here and die? Or do we actually expect God's blood, believe sacrifice to be a personal relationship with an actual being? I ain't talking about some spoopy some kind of clown. I'm talking about a being walking, talking with you, coming to your house and talking to you. A lot of times, you know, I feel like we need to quit reading sometimes so much. I I ain't got no problem with study. I I I love to read about God, but sometimes we need to get away and go sit on the field somewhere. Go sit down by a creek bank. Go get somewhere and just sit there and let God come and talk to you. I ain't talking about some blind spirit. I'm talking about the person Jesus Christ coming and talking to you. That is the only light. That is the only light that will flash and bring that seed to life. That seed may be there, but if it don't flash, come on. Right? It ain't going to grow. Come on, brother. And only life is the actual person of Jesus Christ. It's the love God. God is so big, brother said. He's so great, he made himself small enough that we can see. He can hide himself in a little ball of light and come to talk to you. Do you believe God can come and talk to you in a pillar of fire? I want to ask you that question. Do you believe he can actually come in your living room and drop down a pillar of fire? If you believe it and look for it, it'll happen. If you don't believe it, it won't happen. and how close of a walk with God you want. Amen. God, brother said when I come to God, it was like I went to an arcade. He said, \"I've seen all the promises.\" He said, \"And I wanted every one of them.\" Brother, sister, that's mine and yours, how close a relationship you want with God, however close you want it to be, that's how close God will give it. Cuz if it's the right motive and if it's the right objective and if you're sitting there and you see something and it's pulling on you and it's pulling on you and it's not out of pride, it ain't out of well I want to do this and I want to do this, I want to do that, I want to be. No, if it's God, if it's the right attitude, the right motive and it's pulling on you and it's in the word, it's yours. There's somebody there pulling on you. His name is Jesus Christ. He's putting on you trying to say this is yours. Won't you take it and live it? Walk in it. How close do you want to live to me? Do you want to live like Daniel? Do you want to live like Joseph? That's right. How close relationship do you want with God? It's here for you. People say, \"Well, I can't do the things brother Brown did.\" Maybe not everything, but some of the things, yes, you can. God may not. No, he ain't going to come work through you as a seven church a message. That's already come and gone. But everything else, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, day, and forever. It's the same spiritual gift. It's the same fruit of the spirit. And if God don't do the same with you, he ain't going to do. He's a liar. He is a liar. But the motive and objectives have to be right. If your motive in objectives are wrong, brother Brandon said the right motive objectives and right attitude, any promise of God bring it to pass. Come on. Right? If your acting is bad, if your motives are wrong, really you're carnal believer unless God does something to you and makes you right. But if you're a true believer, you know, brother Brand said, \"I'd rather have a man right in his heart and wrong his doctrine.\" That's right. He said, \"Cuz I can do something with that man.\" Right. But if if if God ain't in your heart, he can't do nothing with you. And your attitude and your objections are always going to be bad. I was telling brother Gam on the way up here, you know, which I ain't, you know, I I've not been preaching long at all. And last time I went and preached, it's actually been about 6 months since I have preached. And then last time I preached before then, I had to go preach at a youth camp. And I was so scared. I was so nervous because you know whenever I sit down and I think of what I told I told the G I said right before then brother Josh Bennett comes over and he preaches at our church and I think Lord have mercy I said I can't do that you know there ain't no way you know I I can't do that you know really that's right and I was so scared and I was walking down the street on my lunch break and I was I said God I can't do this I can't do it but you know and God pushes on you to do something. You know, when God lays something on your heart to do something, he wants you to go do it. But then again, are you going to step out in faith and do it? I'm sitting here walking down the road and I'm literally a basket case and the Lord lays on my heart to listen to and I couldn't remember even what it was at that time. I never could even remember what was on the sermon, but perfect strength through perfect weakness. And when I listen to that, brother Brandham, he says, you know, the problem with a lot of you preachers, he says, you know, you think you can preach. He says, \"When you get to a place where you think you can do something,\" he said, \"God drops you right there.\" He said, \"God can't use you.\" He said, \"You take a man that wants to preach and wants to get up there and do this and that for God, God can't use the man.\" Because when he does, he going to put it on his own doctrines. He going to put his own ideas. He going to do it for money. He's going to do it for popularity. And I'll tell you something, anybody, anybody that preaches unadulterated word of God, you can ask Brother Sam, \"Yo, mister, it ain't fun. It's going to be a life of trouble, pain, sorrow, agony, grief. Why? Because you're going to be hated. Come on. There's going to be a certain amount is going to love you. And that's going to make it all worth the while other than the fact that you love God so much that you rather sacrifice your life's ambitions to do what he tells you to do. But other than that, it ain't going to get you no money. And if it does, if God does bless you with some money, everybody going to talk about you. So many of you do actually preach the unadulterated word of God. And I'm more concerned. I'm more con convinced that people don't no more want this message preached most time than anything. They don't want to hear it. They want a religion. They want a lifestyle. And as long as you don't touch their lifestyle, they happy. They happy. Talking about subconsciousness. You know, when you actually look at a TV, when you look at a TV, it throws your mind to a beta wave. And it goes from an alpha wave to a beta wave. And depending on how much you look at a TV, it actually trans the transition is faster. If you look at one of my bam, beta wave. A beta wave is close thing to a dream state with you being with your eyes open. So you're sitting there whileever you're watching, you're digesting into your subconscious mind. Do you realize how slick brother says then Satan done fooled you? He said you done quit going to the movie theater. to slip it into your house. Now you got people with DVD players that's got PR guardian on it just cuz it don't cuss. It's okay. I can't hear the cuss words. Well, let me tell you something. Is there a bohaired woman in in that movie? Yeah. Is there women? Is there a Jezebel painted up woman in that movie? I want to know because if it is, you said, \"Well, it don't bother me.\" Cuz see that spirit's in your house. Once you turn it on, there's spirits in your house. Brother Brandon said he liked to go to church and preach because when he went to the big uh gymnasiums, he said there are spirits hanging around. They they stay in there from after the boxing matches and stuff. So when you sit there and your wife said, you know, release that spirit in your house, say, \"Well, I'm 60 years old. It don't really bother me none. You know, I'm not ever going to cut my hair.\" How about your granddaughter? When your granddaughter comes to visit, she sits in that room. For some no reason, when she's 8 years old, she starts thinking about want to cut her hair. You know why? Cuz that spirit sitting in that room, she starts thinking about, \"Huh, I want to wear some lipstick.\" It might have been because the movie you watched there a week ago and you never had some Jezebel walking around that TV screen that's released right there in your living room and she's going to sit there and fight a battle. And I can't imagine how hard of a battle that would be for a little girl growing up and not even the people to sit there and let them watch it. Woman running around. Well, there ain't no bed scenes and they ain't hardly no cussing in here and they don't kiss really but one time. Are the people kissing married? Are they married? If not, now you got a spirit of fornication and adultery sitting in your living room. Say, I don't believe that, brother J. Well, well, like I said, it's the truth. He know you, brother Brandon, he taught the very same thing. It's the truth. It's there. has spirits there and your little girl, your little granddaughter, whoever comes over, they may not can handle that demon like you can. He may can watch you not bother you at all. But then it's a battle for them. It's like I say, you know, most time the devil, he is so sly, it's just like the play on words. If he can get to your subconscious mind, he knows, brother even pointed out. He knows how powerful the subconscious mind is. And if Satan can get that subconscious mind, he's got you in a place. He's got you in a place where he can manipulate you. He got you in a place where he can put things in your mind that really at the time when it's going on, you can't fight it. You have no defense against it. You You can't sit there and try to whack it away because you can't see it coming. Right? Let's look back here. Come back here to Abraham. Brother Brown says here he says, \"Now notice what he did. Oh, it's marvelous. He kept the birds off until the sun went down.\" Right? Now, that's relating back to Genesis. All you know, anybody don't understand. Going back to Genesis, he actually made a covenant after he actually tore apart the animals like God told him to. He came apart. He separated them. He pulled them out and he laid them on the rock. He sat there and he fought them. He kept the birds off of them so they won't go they wouldn't actually go and mess up the animals there to sacrifice. He said, \"Oh, it's tomorrow.\" He kept the birds off until the sun went down. Notice then a deep sleep fell on Abraham. First thing, Abraham, I'm just going to shut you off. I love this. First thing, Abraham, I'm just going to shut you off to show you there's not one thing you can do about it. Amen. He just laid him down to sleep. Brother said he done that as a sign to show there ain't nothing you can do. There ain't nothing you can do to get this. There ain't nothing you can do to keep from getting it. I'm going to shut you down and you going to watch this take place. He said after and it was done. This is my covenant. And it wasn't one thing, brother, that you could do about it. It isn't one thing, sister, that you've done about it. It's what God did for you in Christ. Not because you was good. Not because a mother was good, but what Christ was good. That's right. and what Christ did by calling you. That is the actual blood sacrifice again. It's the logos coming and it's actually saying, \"Hey, Jeremy, come on.\" It starts pulling on me. It starts showing me light to walk into. I've been doing some I did some research on the Muslims and I was very, very astounded by what I found. You got different, you know, Muslims, the Muslims now, you know, brother B actually makes comments. He said, \"Now everything in it perfect setting.\" He said, \"You know, you got Isaac descend. You got Ismail send. You got the Jews sitting there in a promised land fighting one another's neck.\" He said, \"It's continued over.\" It's the same thing going on, right? Well, you look, if that's the case, which we know the Bible's true, we know Brother was showing was true. We know that's the seed chapter. Well, now we got Muslims. That is the mighty nation of Ishmael. That is the mighty nation that God promised. He cut that nation alive. Right. Sure. Abraham had enough faith that he gave her one bottle of water that God was going to keep that nation alive. Now Islams or the Muslims are just like Christians in one sense that they got different denominations. Now Muhammad taught against denominations just like the Bible does. Right? He taught that it was of Satan, but those you got to shoot the Shiites and the Sunnis and all and there's actually tons of denominations. But then there's a group that's actually it reminds me of us because they're walking down the middle. They actually take the Quran at face value and they rest upon things that Muslim that that Muhammad teaches in the Quran and they actually walk down this road. And when they do, the only Muslims have to believe in Abraham. They have to believe in Noah. They have to believe in Moses and they have to believe that Mary was the virgin mother of God of Jesus Christ or not God of Jesus Christ. Right? They don't believe he was actually God reincarnated. They believe he was a prophet, but that was of a virgin birth. Oh yeah. They don't believe he was crucified. But they actually believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah that's going to come back in the end time. But the difference is they don't believe in the sh and the shed blood. They don't believe in the cross. But the sc one of the scariest things about it to me the actual one some of them believe that Muhammad's coming back to fight a battle to present Jesus Christ to the world and others believe that it's actually going to be the 12th descendant of Muhammad that's going to come back and wage this war. And I heard brother Mick comment one time that just slap me in the face of sobriety. He said, \"For 2,000 years, people have looking for the return of Jesus Christ.\" He said, \"Now, people are looking for the return of William Brown to show you how close the spiritual touch the flesh carnal believer, they believe almost the exact same thing. The only thing that they take out is the shed blood of Jesus Christ. It's not when the Muslims come and they took over Jerusalem. After Jerusalem fell, they built the the the mosque there. They went throughout all the world collecting books, collecting books of medical, architectural, science. They went collected all these books and brought back and made a library that was actually doing cataract surgeries and all kinds of stuff way back then. I just remind it reminds me of that old Hulk that jumped around that corner believer. He didn't figure out none of that on his own. He let somebody else kiss. He let somebody else learn all about that knowledge and he just went and gathered it up and ate all of it. He made a name for himself, made a nomination, made a place where he could stand and sit there and preach and gain prestige and take money into himself. He made himself a powerful empire of what somebody else killed, of what somebody else doing instead of flying down and letting God show him. Abraham after God made that covenant with him, Sarah them, they got tired of waiting. So many times there's things that I don't understand. I don't understand about the Bible. They don't understand, brother. Say it. I got to wait. If I don't wait, I'll make up my own idea. I'll make up my own opinion and my own tradition. And when I do, I create doubt. And that tradition burst in Ishmamail. And if I ain't careful, if my heart ain't right, God won't come kill that thing. You got to kill it. Cuz once you go around shooting everybody with it, you got to go make it right. And if you ain't careful when you waiting on a revelation from God, just wait. He will come and show it to you. It may be five years, right? But don't talk about it. Why talk about something you don't know? Don't be like that Hulk flying around cuz if God don't show it to you then it's something that you killed. That eagle represents the Holy Ghost. It don't represent you. It represents the Holy Ghost in you. It ain't a holy prophet. It's a holy God in a prophet. And if you got the Holy Ghost, it's the same spirit that was in the prophets. It represents the Holy Ghost coming and laying down that fresh food for you. Right. I'll prepare a meal for you in the face of your enemies. We fight every single day just to believe. We fight just to walk what God has showed us. We fight every single day. But God said if you'll wait upon the Lord, he will come and he'll bring that great eagle will come later right there. But where's the fighting? Is surrendering and is holding on. blood said that that Israel made their mistake when they spurned grace for law. He said Israel always wanted to do something. They always wanted to get their hands in it. They wanted a king. They wanted to do something, ask God, do something for God. God called us to be a bride. He called us to be under him. He gave us the Holy Ghost, which is the Sabbath, which is a rest. We're to sit and wait on God to bring it. And when he brings in this time, all we got to do is believe it. when he comes and brings it, we understand it. Just walk in it. That's all it is. It's just to walk in it. Right. When he sit here in Abraham when he went into that deep sleep, cuz I'm going tell you, I can't do nothing. I can't figure it out, right? I I cannot do it, right? But if I rest, that's it. It's been proven to me. I can go get tapes. I can get teaching tapes. I've tried it. I've tried to do all kinds of stuff. But one thing I've learned is a lot of times you just getting somebody's opinion anyhow. That's right. And I sit there and I absorb it in and then but if I just wait now, like I said, I ain't got nothing wrong. There ain't I ain't got nothing against from reading God. It reminds me God had me studying in a subject not long ago. I said, God, why in the world am I looking at this? Why? I would say everything I was looking at it was taking me right back to the word. I said, \"God, why am I looking at this?\" And as I sat out there talking to him, you know, he said, \"I'm filling it up.\" And it come so plain. This bottle, yeah, it can't put water in itself. He can't ask for water to be put in it. It don't matter what it does. It's a bottle. It's a vessel. Somebody of a divine nature, somebody in a higher state of being has to come and put water in this bottle. And then when the water's in the bottle, it can't say, \"Well, I want Coke.\" It ain't got a choice. Yeah. It takes whatever you put in that vessel. That vessel don't know how to pour it into a glass. He don't know how to pour it into your mouth. It don't know how to do nothing. All that vessel knows how to do is that just sit there. It takes a divine higher being to do anything. what's with the vessel whether to put something in it to pour it out or whatn not. So when you sit there God he's obligated he's promised to come it's just it's so it's my heart is so heavy for the simple fact that I see people so much that I know have never truly had an experience with God. Oh my right. That's right. And then God truly, he wants to be your best friend, right? Just as AB Abraham walked, he was I looked up the name Hebrew the other day, about two months ago. I say the other day, about two months ago, it means one from beyond. I thought, man, if I ain't a Hebrew, I don't know what I am. Called Abraham the one from beyond. From beyond where? Beyond the curtain of time. Yeah. They come and drop down and God had to manifest himself for me. That's right. That's right. But I see, you know, God, he actually, he so much wants to come. That's right. And walk us Amen. through this life, looking for a city whose maker is not man. The better maker is God. It's somebody that is actually having hope in what we don't see. Yeah. When I sit and I look at this world and the galaxy that we live in and I look even beyond that, for a person to actually really think logically that there is no God, it really there's something wrong with there's something wrong with but to think that that God actually come down here and calls me and wants to walk with me. He don't want He ain't calling me for church on Sunday. He ain't calling me for church on Wednesday. That's right. He ain't calling me to go out and to tell everybody how wrong they are. Come on, brother. He wants to be my lover. He wants to be your friend. He actually wants to come and talk to you. Right? I'm talking about the master of the universe wants to actually come and talk to you and walk with you and to show you. That's right. Cuz see, a lot of times, you know, Jesus died on the cross for our sins. We know that. We know that. But sometimes that's just such a it's just a story. I mean, I'm just sorry. A lot of times you hear so much, we get so gospel hardened. We get so we hear things so much that it's just a story. Well, it's a man that died for our sins. It goes so much more deeper than that. When we looking at That's right. When you actually look at science and its basics, you see God everywhere. Light and darkness in this galaxy, you got a you got a black hole that sits beneath the sun that actually eats light. It eats everything. But here's light that God chose to actually manifest himself in, right? In every form or fashion. When you look at the basics of science, whether it's energy, vibrations, light, or whatnot, God is there. Right. Right. And we see, and here's brother Brandham. He's talking about the the spilled blood, the innocent blood of God being the only fellowship. Brother Brandham tells that Abraham, he said even in the garden, he said that was God's first form. Then he says over here, Abraham even worshiped by spilled blood. when he torn him apart and that pillar of fire came through. See, it's so important to me because when I look at the Muslims, I look at the Jews, I look at the Christians, cuz I'm going to tell you something. I'll be just straight honest with you. If I didn't know how the Holy Ghost, right? And I seen the things I have seen over the last few months about a Muslim belief, right? Hey, I tell this stuff to to go as far as Christian denomination. I'll just be honest with you because them people are more real. And I'll tell you something. I challenge you to look at some of the things they actually teach cuz they profess. They profess that they know they are not the spiritual seed of Abraham, but they are the carnal seed of Abraham. They are the technological, the scientific. They are that strain of Abraham that's actually going to reunite again with Jesus Christ when he comes back and he's going to usher them in to the millennium. They believe that. Okay. But they even know enough. When you actually look at the things they actually teach about the end time, it will blow your mind. It lines up so closely with the things that brother Brown taught. The seventh church age messenger, the angel of the Lord that come and taught us spiritually. You take the spiritual happenings and tie them with the physical happenings and what they teach, it will scare you to death. You'll see that it's almost God promised them that he'd take care of them. He promised Abraham that's your seed and I'll take care of them. They'll be a mighty nation. But when I look, but where is God's seed called from? And we see that brother, he he explained to us when God said, \"Let there be light.\" He said, \"That's when that's when that logos came out. That's when Jesus come out.\" That's when he come out in a form that man could first actually identify. And that's super special to me because that's the origin the original. That's the first form that we could ever see God in that image in an image at all that we could actually pick up or detect with this sense of sight. When here's Abraham when he comes and makes the same covenant that he made with me, he he brings that pillar of fire right down through there. He busts him apart and there's a pillar of fire. When he comes to Moses, he has the pillar of fire. There's the pillar of fire. When he comes to Paul, he has the pillar of fire. And for me to see in this day that he come in the same form that's right of a pillar of fire again to me that makes my heart abound. I said and I sit by God at work and I talk to him and I just get so excited I forget that he's not even a believer and I start telling him all this stuff and he just looks at me kind of strange. But when you see God from the beginning until the end and you see God in the Muslims, you see him in the Jews, you see him in the nation that he called out. But then when you see him in the wild olive tree, but you see him in the same logo moving one down to another. But then when I see brother said, when he ripped Jesus Christ, he ripped his spirit from his body, ripped it apart, and it ascended on high. And then when it come back, it broke into 120 pieces and descended down on Gentiles. Right? Gentiles and Jews like it don't matter. The same logos, the one that was in the beginning is the same one that wants to come to me and you. It's the same. That is the innocent bloodshed. That is the bloodshed of the innocent one. That is the sacrifice that was made. The sacrifice is actually a covenant that was made between you and God. It's a covenant that you didn't do this. You don't deserve this, but I'm going to give it to you. Only if you'll accept it. Only if you'll accept it. Right. Wow. Right. There's no other way. Right. There's been many times when I was growing up in church. I can remember when I was 9 years old coming to the altar. I was raised in Pentecostal church. My parents didn't say nothing to me about coming to the altar. I took off running just about the altar when I was 9 years old. And when I got there, I cried and I squalled and I cried. Started smoking cigarettes when I was about 10. Started probably smoking pot when I was about 12, 13. And did all kinds of crazy stuff, you know. All kind. Even I go that time when I went and cried at the altar. I knew God did something to me that day. I knew he bore witness with me. Something happened. And I'd go back in the woods with my buddies and we had forts all in the woods, you know. We rode bicycles all me. And it wasn't the woods. Yeah. And we had all kinds of bass, you know, just was being wild humans, you know, we was wild humans and go out there to smoke and I felt so convicted on the inside. Oh, it tear me up, but you know, I didn't want to I didn't want to offend, right? I can remember times later on in life, and I'm not going to go too far into it, but I can remember times in life when God would pull on me. Sure. And I'd want to surrender to God. I'd want to so badly and I'd try. Amen. I mean, I tried. I'd come to the altar. I'd make an effort. I remember one time God miraculously healed me when I had a motorcycle wreck. I mean, miraculously healed me. I had hair down almost my back. I weighed 180 lbs. I was a drug deal. I had earrings in my ears. And God actually healed me in the hospital. He touched me so strongly that cussing totally left my vocabulary. And my buddies were embarrassed to go anywhere with me. I had such a filthy mouth. I didn't have to try to quit cussing. It was gone. That's right. And the thing is in my experience, I even went back out in the world again. Oh yeah. Being honest, I went to a church and I'd actually went to places and told people about the my experience with God, my healing. And I was going to a church that was so full of hypocrites. Now, I don't put this off on them. I'm just telling you the truth. I'm not putting it off on nobody. I didn't have to do I mean, I made my own choices, right? But it was so full of hypocrites that and I mean to the point to where you know man seen a choir actually taught Sunday school sometime you know he had a mistress that come church with him you know he had a wife and had two kids I mean I'm talking about just straight up hypocrisy people always want to cause trouble you know you know you'd be at church one time and go something go somewhere else wasn't that custom talking about women you know and I said I told him one night I said God I know what you done for me. I know you healed my leg. I know the thing. I I know you're real. But if these people are Christians, I don't want to be a Christian, right? Yeah. Amen. It totally just like brother Gamma said today, a lukewarm Christian will send more souls to hell, right? Than anything cuz it makes you have an idea that there's no bread in the bread house. That there's no actual life in this thing. That it's just a lifestyle. And I told him, I said, \"God, I don't want to be a Christian.\" And you know, and I actually went back out in the world for a while and I almost died twice. It come to the point one night I did so much coke. So much cocaine that I went to a restaurant and my left no, my left arm went numb. I had chest pains and next thing I know I'd blacked out and I'd lay in the floor and of course all the guys I was with so you know it was all drug dealers so you know they don't want nothing to do with that you know they want to give a run you know they don't care about you they just you know they know you going to bring the police and the ambulance I'm laying out in the floor don't even know how I got in the floor I get up in this restaurant it was so filthy so dirty All right. And I crawled into this bathroom as dirtiest as any gas station bathroom you ever seen in your life. I crawl in there on my hands and knees. My lights dimming, going in and out. My eyes are still open. I rip my shirt off and I start getting water out of the toilet. started splashing in my face. Yeah. And just crying to God, \"God, please don't let me die.\" Cuz I can honestly say at that time, I didn't know who God was. Oh, yeah. Right. But I knew that he was real. He had been with me since I was just a little kid. I'd always talked to him, but I didn't know who he was. Yeah. I didn't believe in him. I had no understanding of who he was. I cried, \"God, don't let me die. Please don't let me die.\" And somehow I know I didn't die. Probably went two months later. Me and my wife wasn't married at the time, but we was dating. was over around here in Atlanta, a big humongous party up in well, I can't remember the name of place, but a big bridge neighborhood. And I did a whole bunch of cocaine, a bunch of acid, a bunch of heroin. And I was sitting there and the next thing I know, I just fell backwards. and my eyes are open and the light just go out and they're just going in and out like this right here. But I'm totally my eyes will go away. I just keep stumbling. Now I was the type of person that kind of stuff didn't happen to me. I had a real high tolerance for stuff. And then again the same thing happens. I fall in my face. I start crawling again. He got me in the same place again in these people's bathroom. I tear my shirt off again and I soak my face with water out of the toilet. I ask God, \"Please don't let me die.\" And I don't die. And time comes on and I remember going to a church. My mama wanted us to go. I love my mama. There's things I do for my mama that's I just did it for her. And my wife my wife, she didn't know nothing about God. She wasn't really raised in church. And the only thing she did know was a bunch of you ain't supposed to cut your hair and you ain't supposed to wear pants. And that was really it. We go to this charismatic church and we do it. At this point, I didn't have a spot on my lung. I know. I smoked marijuana so heavily. I smoked it for years, all day long. And every time I'd breathe, I'd have a pain in my chest. It got so bad when I smoked dope. I It hurt so bad I didn't even want to smoke it no more cuz I get so paranoid I was going to die because I knew it was a spot. And uh but God was dealing with me. I had a happen that I I'm going to save time. I'm not going to share. But I had it and I remember sitting outside the front porch smoking a cigarette and I said, \"God, I don't care. I don't why would a drug addict think like this? I'm looking out there at my yard and I say, \"God, that blade of grass, I got to cut it all the time. His lifespan is just like that.\" I said, \"God, I know my lifespan is just like that.\" I said, \"But I want to die doing something for you, God. I want to I want to live for you. But I didn't know who God was. How can you do something for somebody? Brother Dale, but saying if I was willing to give you $25 and I didn't know who you were, I mean, how can I give you anything? I can't do it. I can't even I don't even know how to address you. We went to this church. My mother wanted to go my wife. You know, I grew up in church some and I see women that went to church and their husband ain't go to church. And I remember even back then, the old heathen that I was, it made me mad for some reason. I just thought I just thought if he loved her, he'd go to church. Whether he wanted to go to church or not, that's just me, you know. That's just my personality. And I'm not saying it's true. That's just my personality. And my wife, she's getting up to go to church one morning and I talk her out of it one morning. when the next Sunday comes around, she going to go and I lay in her bed and I try to talk her out of it and ain't no talking her out of it. And I said, \"Well, I ain't going to be like one of them men. I'm going to go to church.\" You know, they ain't want to go to church. High as a kite, they want to go to church. I go to church and we go two times and I remember I'm sitting there and this man, the Lord actually drops down on me in this charismatic church to the point to where I'm start snotting. I'm sitting there in a pew and they asked us to raise our hands and we raised our hands. Me and my wife did. She actually did first and I wanted to. She actually gave me a little courage cuz I was sitting there. I said, \"God, I'm sitting here lusting after these women. But I want to live right. I can't even think right. I don't even know how to even start to be right.\" But I was in such a condition that God was melting my heart. And he asked us to come up front. And when he did, the man didn't even touch me. The night before I was stoned as I'll get out. I was a druggie. He ain't even touch me. And he said like a I guess you call like a prophecy over me. And next thing I knew I was laying on the floor. I ain't never had nothing like that happen to me in my life. Never. The man didn't even touch me. I laid there for probably 30 to 40 minutes and my poor wife was standing there and people was around her speaking in tongues. She ain't never heard nobody talk in tongues. She and then she looked down. I'm laying in the floor. She ain't never been no Pentecostal church. I laid there and when I got up I was a different person. Bless him. When I had that motorcycle, I reckon God healed me and he took away my foul mouth. He did it again. Amen. Not only did he take away my foul mouth, but he took away my desire to do drugs. G. He took away my I loved golf. Now, I ain't got nothing against golf, but I love golf so much that it was about to tear my family apart. I wanted to retire playing golf. That was my goal. And when I went to play golf, I did it as if it was a job and if I was practicing. I was going to retire playing golf. There ain't no way I was going to live my life at the phone company. I was going to retire playing golf. When I got up out of that floor, I had no desire to play golf whatsoever. I didn't even didn't want to. Amen. But that was my passion. God healed me of that spot. You know, people think, you know, ain't nothing going on out in them churches out there. There's not unless you will see the God. Now, if you see to God, God will drop you a handful. God's going to come get you. He's gonna stop whatever he's doing and he's gonna come and get you. I don't care if you're in a Baptist, Methodist, or in a Catholic church. I think one of the scarest places to be a lot of times in a Methodist church. It takes more power of God coming out of this church than it does out church. That is [Applause] true. But when I was there, God done something for me. Amen. And then as I went all along my way, God began to justify me. Oh, I won't never forget. I was singing in the choir. I told brother I told brother day this morning. So about the end before I had the Holy Ghost, you know, life ain't hard when you got the Holy Ghost. Really, it's really simple. And uh for the most part, you just float around doing whatever you want to do. Devil don't much care about what you're doing. And I don't care how religious you I don't care how much you sing, preach, or help the sick, cast out devils. He don't care nothing about you. And uh I told the guy, I went to church three, four times a week. I just loved it. Every time I go to church, I go to church. I mean, you talking about sick, it didn't matter. There was nothing in me that ever made me not want to go to church. I mean, it was just right. Amen. You know, hey, when you get the Holy Ghost is different, you know, that's just the truth. I love going to truth. I mean, going to church right here, but like he said this morning, sometimes sometimes you don't out here, but back then it wasn't that way. But God healed me there, that spot in my lung. And you know, as I was saying, you know, when people say things don't happen, I was sitting there first time I ever took communion again. It wasn't even right communion. It was a little bit wafer and a thing of grape juice. And look, but you know, brother Maram says, you know, you taking a look at them Jews when they come to that sacrifice, how can they get numb to the sound of that bleeding lamb when they take it up there to be sacrificed? But he said it become a stench in the nostrils. But you know, God, if you do it sincerity, God honor it. You know, if it's God's way, you do it sincerity, he honors it. I didn't know no more what I was doing. But man, I was sitting there, I was weeping so much. I had so much love and joy in my heart that I could actually take communion. Amen. And that God loved me, right? And he picked me up. Glory. I mean, I was so full of love in my heart. I couldn't even hardly eat or drink it. I was in sitting there crying. And the man I had on a red shirt and the our pastor at that time he said somebody right there around that gym with that red shirt on. God just and right as he's saying that I feel fire go all the way from my waist up to my head. He said God just healed somebody of a chest condition right here. Right around this guy in a red shirt right here. And look that spot on my chest has never hurt. Glory. One time it hurt me a few years ago and I rebuked it and it was gone. But I mean, it hurts so bad to where if I just got out of a golf cart to walk up to a green to make a putt, oh, it would just kill me. It hurts so bad. But God healed me of that. And we come and God God used me in many ways. I mean, many ways. I seen people, me and some people, this guy was demonp possessed one night, spitting up foam at the mouth all the back of the church. We took him out there. Me and some more people prayed for him. The devil was trying to strangle him. All kinds of stuff. And before he left, the guy was speaking in tongues. He was in his same mind. And when we left that church, he was still going to that church. When he come in, he was a he was a real bad street walking crackhead. And he stayed there in his same mind till he left. Now, does that mean he was born again? No. Brother Brown said Peter was in a sanctified condition when he was casting out devil. Healing the sick. He never had he never been converted. But see things and I seen those things happen. and my wife's father-in-law and my wife's dead. My father-in-law, he come and he'd tell me about wheat and writing a name on a check and all this kind of stuff and tell me that, hey, he said, you know, you ain't even saved. I thought, man, you know, you got to be joking, man. I mean, you you done hit your head. Well, if you ain't baptized no more Jesus Christ, you can't even get the Holy Ghost. I said, are you are you crazy? I said, \"The life proves what I'm doing. Look at look at how God is actually manifesting himself in my life. God brought me out. He set my feet on a rock.\" I said, \"What? What are you talking about?\" He said, \"Well, you know, when wheat starts to sprout, it comes through, you got a stalk, and you have a tossel.\" And you I said, \"Man, are you what is wrong with you talking about some weed?\" I said, \"Want to talk about, you know, when when's the last time you went and and taught somebody about God? You know, when was the last time God prophesied through you? When was the last time God did this, did that?\" That's what we was used to. Yeah. Right. I will never forget one night he pointed his finger at me. He'd come there and I just about chased him out the house talking to him. I wouldn't listen to nothing he said. I mean, I was listening. One day I was sitting there, these people was actually they gave us a little syllabus when we first started. They gave their doctrine and it said uh it was about water baptism and it said we know that the New Testament church baptized in the Lord name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We know that Peter understood that that was you know Jehovah you know Lord God. We knew they had that understanding. He said, \"But we baptize and name Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" And I sit there, man, I and I was like this line went across and that's when God came and actually showed me something, right? God started to show me his sacrifice, right? And as I began to see this sacrifice, as I began to see him in his word, oh, it kind of hurt for me cuz I said, \"Man, I'm going to have to go and tell John, my father-in-law, so I go tell but John I was wrong. He's right.\" You know, and then all of a sudden, God started showing me all kind I mean, just start opening up his word to me. And the whole thing to get to is that that in itself is God's blood sacrifice. His word, him showing himself to you, you got to place your hands on that sacrifice. If you don't own that sacrifice, if you don't associate yourself with that sacrifice, if that sacrifice ate inside of you, there's no way that you can be dead in Christ and risen again. There's no way you can be born again without God coming and showing himself to you. Right? And I just urge any of my brothers and sisters, if there's a heaviness in your heart, if there's a heavy feeling on your chest at all, any kind of a feeling of pressure from God, just ask. Glory. Amen. If you ask in the right attitude and sincerely, he's got to tell you. And when he does, he's not a respector of person. You come his provided way. He's got to show you. And when he does, there's been times and times throughout life, I wanted to get right with God. I wanted to, but I couldn't. It was not God's time. When it's God's time, it will happen. But the thing is, if you get a a calling from God, you can't reject it. If you get a calling to go forward, you can't step back and say, \"I don't know. I don't want that.\" It's a fellowship. How can you disassociate yourself from your sacrifice? Don't you realize that staying with that logos, staying with that that unveiling of the word, that is your lamb. That's your sacrifice. If you ain't inside of that, there ain't no blood to cover you. You can't sit outside and say, \"Well, God, I'll come over there later.\" You can't do that. There's no blood bumper for you. I don't care what's going on. I don't care if you casting out devils. You got to hit a ministry. If you preach all over the world, God, there's no blood bumper for you. I just urge you if the musicians would come, I just urge you. I ask you please. You may have tried time and time again. I'm not going to give no prolonged altar call. And I tell you the reason why. I believe in him. I sure do. Lord, I believe in him 100%. But God come to me when I sitting in my bathroom. I believe a lot of times just like when Daniel sat there and he prayed, he fasted and Gabriel came. And he said, \"The prince of pers has been fighting me or I would have been here already.\" Yeah, that's right. It's just like the sister that accepted her healing and it had to come later on and come through to her neighborhood. I can't remember how many days later, but it come over and healed her and the other sister both. I'm not even going to ask you to raise your hand. Cuz it ain't between me and you. People say, \"Well, if you're ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you.\" And that's right. God said, \"I believe that.\" But if God does something for you, there ain't a devil in hell that'll keep you from manifesting that fruit in your life. There ain't a devil in hell that's going to make you be quiet about what God's doing for you. There ain't a devil in hell that's going to keep you bound by the same things you was bound beforehand. So you ain't got to worry about being ashamed because ain't nothing going to make you be ashamed if it's really God. Right? I'm just urging if you feel something. Brother D, if you got songs, go ahead, brother. Try number 80. If you got a feel, if there's a heaviness in your heart, the altar is in your heart. The altar ain't so much up here, you can leave here and have an emotional sensation. The altar is inside of your heart. Maybe when you go home or whatever, but if you make a conscious, sober decision, God will acknowledge that. Amen. He will meet you just like he met Abraham. He'll meet you just like he met me. He will meet you and give you life just said in your heart. If you got in heaven just pray pray on the inside bow down in your heart. Let's just worship God. [Music] You got any kind of sickness? I believe God. I don't believe there's nothing in me. He can heal you. But I believe inside of you. I believe the word is true. The prayer faith save the sick. I believe without you got any kind of problems. I just don't care if you want to come here and pray anything whatsoever. I don't want to shut anything up. I want if God wants to move, you come if you want anything [Music] done. We shall see. We shall see again. Are you ready? Goodness Savior today. But he [Applause] says come. We shall see the king.

So, we just better make sure which one we are. Amen. We're in one of them. We're the chaff or we're the stalker. We're the wheat. That's right. So, we just got to make up our mind which one we are.

We ask you, Lord, that you would just be with us now as we go our separate ways and everybody going home. We pray that you'd take care of us. Give a safe journey. And Lord, those that were prayed for today, we believe that they received what they were asking for because why would we pray if we didn't believe it that way, Father? cuz we know that thou are our God and that you want to do more than we ever would ever think about wanting you even to do. The prophet said you wanted to heal us more than we wanted to be healed. Well, surely when we're sick, we wanted to be healed. And Father, just have your way now. Guide each one.

turned out water to blood okay let's go to chapter 214. and he the first uh first miracle is uh a Jordan a river opened and he noticed the last miracle the Elijah did is the first miracle that the Elijah does and he took the man Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters instead where is the Lord God of Elijah and we when he had also has made in the water they parted hither and did her and Elijah went over let's go to Second Kings 2 20. he heals the waters and he said bring me a new cursed cruise and put salt there on and they brought it to him 21 and he went forth onto the spring of the water and cast that assault in there and said thus said the Lord I have healed their feel that this water there shall not be from this anymore dead or the barren land I feel as it contains two let's start at 23. cursing mocks the the person who talked and destroyed and he went up from 23 and he went out from dance onto Bethel and as he was born by the way there came four little children and now the city and Mark came and said unto him go up the ball head pull up the ball head he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord and there came forward to she buried out of the wood wood and Terry 40 and two children of men killed and kids right okay Second Kings 3 17 Victory through water in a trench oh for thou said the Lord You shall not see when neither shall you see rain yet that the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink Bogey and your cattle and your Beast yeah Second Kings four or five all the flow one to pay off the death and when they are coming to thou shall not shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out unto all those vessels set aside that which is full five so she went from him and shut the door up on her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and he came to class when the vessels were full and she said unto her son bring me yet at vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel born the second Kings uh 4:16 son given to the Sherman woman he said about this about this season according to the time of life thou shall Embrace her son and she said name a lord the man of God do not lie unto thy handmaid and the woman conceived and bear his son at that season that Elijah has said unto her according to the time of life Second Kings 4 35 . foreign times then he returned and walked into the house to and from went up and stretched himself up on him and the child's knees seven times that shall open his eyes and he called goose and said call the shermanite so he called her and when she was coming in unto him he said take up thy son then she went and I fell at his feet and bought herself to that run and took up her son and went up seven Kings 4 41 poison not purified poison pot purifier started at 40. so they pour out for the man to eat in a country pass as they were eating other orders that they cried and said all thy man of God there's death and Nepal and they could not eat thereof but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot 4 43 could multiply the food multiplied 42. and there came a man from well she shalisha and brought the man a god-bread of their first fruits 20 loaves of barley and whole ears of corn and uh and he said give unto the people that they may eat and as surveyor said what should I set these before and a hundred men he said again give the people that they may eat for that thus said the Lord they shall they shall eat and shall leave thereof so he said it before them and they did eat and left they're off according to the word of the Lord he is one of the Lord just like Jesus Second Kings 5 14. name and healed on a lepro seal then when he down and dipped himself seven times and Jordan according to say another man of God and his face came out again like unto the place of a little child and he was clean Second Kings 5 27 left for his judgment on the good Street let's start at 25. but he went in and stood me for his master Elijah said unto him France comes the truth and he said thy servant went no no wither and he said unto him

dropped him in the water and we looked and looked and couldn't find it and I pray that it did the same thing and see the see the knife would bloated in clothes I guess it didn't work for me it's all right at least at least you were trying I was trying you were trying absolutely I agree Second Kings 6 17 the servant's eyes open to see in the spirit uh let's start at 15. and when serve another man of God was risen early and going forward behold at host and a host come past the City Bowl with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him unless my master how shall we do and he asked her if you're not poor they that be with us or more than they be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray he opened his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes as a young man and his soul and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire around about Russia you know okay sure I got two more second king 6 18 Army defeated by blindness seriously and when it came down to him Elijah Elijah pray unto the Lord and he says might the people that I pray be with blindness and he smote them with minus according to the word of Elijah okay let's go to 17th 6 20. amen normally bond is removed and he came to pass my mate or come unto Samara that Elijah said Lord Open the Eyes of these men that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they sow and behold they were and they

to just look right there tonight for a little Foundation we'll start with tonight and just trust that something could be said tonight that will maybe be edifying or uplifting or help you some way as we walk in life amen there's uh uh I was just thinking the other day we was uh somewhere in a service and I got to my mind just kind of got to think about that uh you know it's so easy today to find fault or criticism or get uh you know bitter taste about things the way things are going and do you know and and and even as a Christian you know we have problem we have to watch out for that because we get bitterness in our heart because the way things are going but you know I read in the word where said all things work together for good to them that love God Amen all things work together praise the Lord so amen when I think about that then it changes everything else praise God but David was writing to us and Psalms 119 and verse 162 and we just kind of like to look at this little thought tonight David said I Rejoice at Thy word I Rejoice at Thy word you know there's so many things today we could think about that people love to get excited about but David found something that's Eternal of Eternal value he felt something that would be there when everything else was gone he found something that could stand in a position where all of his friends could forsake Him but there's always this would always be there that is the word of God Amen brothers and sisters and David said I Rejoice at Thy word as one that findeth great spoil Heavenly Father tonight dear God as we come to your throne of grace and mercy Lord it so good to see all these fine people here tonight Lord you're part of the Body of Christ upon the Earth your elect lady tonight oh God Heavenly Father the one that you paid the price for the one that you come to redeem the one whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world Lord the one dear God that you've come to Quicken that seed germ of life into their hearts oh God so tonight dear heavenly father just help us oh Lord to lay aside all the things that we've had the cares of today Lord and maybe the things that we'll have to do tomorrow maybe Lord Jesus just let us enter into that Fellowship behind that Veil tonight dear God lord where that hidden Mana is at where that Shak Glory will come down lord over that Mercy Seat dear heavenly father strike life upon the word tonight dear God lord Jesus and let it Blossom and bring forth life tonight oh God and every one of us tonight Lord and those that are not able to be in the house of the Lord Brother Dale and them where they at oh god brother brother in them dear father and brother Richard in them oh God be with them tonight dear heavenly father we ask your blessings to be upon us tonight all we ask father we remember the sick and The Afflicted tonight God we got unsaved loved ones tonight father Lord Jesus that need the touch of the Holy Spirit to come oh God and touch their heart tonight Lord Of Your Grace father we ask all things tonight father in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen God bless as you're seated tonight man it's good to see everybody tonight praise the Lord and I just trust that you're feeling real good tonight and uh uh you know the Holy Spirit can just Quicken something to your heart right just I thought uh as we're thinking about this I found a little thing here a while back and uh I shared it with the church and he said Jesus of Nazareth without money and without arms conquered more Millions than Alexander the Great or Caesar or Mohammad or Napoleon without science and learning he shed more light on things human and divine than all the philosophers and the scholars combined without the eloquence of school he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or S and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of an orator or a poet and with writing a single line he set more pens in motion and furnished more things for more sermons and orientations and discussions and learned volumes and works of art and songs of praise than the whole Army of Great Men of ancient and modern times what about that never even went 200 miles away from his birthplace and yet today Amen to God he's still changing hearts and lives Amen to God and saving Sinners and amen bringing people Amen to God that look like would never have been able Amen to rise up out of the gutters amen and never be able to rise up Amen in into a realm amen where they could be called Sons and Daughters of God still today he's saving praise the Lord and delivering Amen to God my still you go into a bookstore and there's just books on top of books amen people have tried to write all the different things about the Lord Jesus Christ amen we got got the Bible many sermons have been preached about it and still the volumes that we have will not cover it all yet praise God and the Bible says if all the books amen were written about the Lord the world couldn't contain all of them praise God one man Chang an entire globe of people praise God my bringing Deliverance Amen to the captives in distress amen Healing The Sick and The Afflicted praise the Lord God tonight amen somebody that could take a sinner Amen to God and wash him in his blood praise the Lord and bring a Perfection out of that imperfection praise the Lord I thank God for a god like that tonight I thank God tonight that God could reach down amen when I was on my road to the pits of Hell amen and transform my life and change me from what I was to what I am and what one day I will be praise the Lord God tonight amen so I get to thinking about the Lord and what all he is and no Wonder David could say I Rejoice at the word as one that findeth great spoil you know I think about David he wrote so many things about it he said in Psalms 119 verse 165 he said great peace have they which love thy law the law is a type of the word and nothing shall offend them in other words they'll have no stumbling block amen tonight to be able to open back the word of God Amen to a lot of people they open the word of God and they say well there's there's too many contrad I in the word so you have trouble uh to believe a book like this but you know what every time I open the word of God I've never found a contradiction in it yet praise Lord it depends on how you look at what you're looking at praise the Lord amen with what nine said amen to God somebody said well I find too many faults in it well I'm going to tell you what if you're looking for one you may find one but I've never found the fault yet praise the Lord as pilot said there's no fault in him praise the Lord oh my when people look at us they see all the imperfection but the thing they don't see is what's on the inside praise God what is on the inside what are we tabernacling tonight it's the word of God in our heart praise the Lord amen that can change us amen even change the way we think and the way we look at things am can bring us Amen to God from a place that looks like we' never be able to rise above where we're at ien but yet it would bring us up into a place the Bible say we can sit together in Heavenly places in the Lord Jesus Christ tonight in so much that we can even have the very mind of the Lord Jesus Christ now think like he thinks praise God talk like he talks and walk like he walks praise the Lord God oh my think about the word of God tonight amen there's power in the word amen to God depends on how you look at it though a lot of churches look at the word of God and they say oh you know the days of Miracles were P brother B kept talking about that amen the days of Miracles were P well to them they were P amen I thank God God never let me look at it that way but he let me look at it in another way there's still miracles in the word of God tonight I still believe it can open the blinded eyes tonight I believe it can unstop the death ears tonight I believe it can cause the lame to walk in the blind to see and the death to hear praise the Lord God he improved amen he can still raise from the dead tonight Hallelujah God thank God for that tonight amen to God brother man said he said M he the only one that can put life in the word amen you know if we just take the Bible itself without the Holy Spirit it just becomes a de L to us amen that's what happened to Israel they took the law amen without faith the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 2 they never mix Faith with the word amen to God and it become a dead letter to them and they try amen to off operate with god without faith you cannot operate with god without faith for the Bible say for without faith it is impossible to please God for by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God not beside but by the word of God hallelujah to God Amen the things that we see tonight were framed by the word of God everything in this buing was framed by the word of God tonight oh my the very Earth we sit and walk upon was framed by the very word of God tonight Hallelujah to God and I said the god that could create the Earth and bring it and hang it in the just hanging out here in open space and for trillions of years she's been hanging there praise God oh that kind of God he's wanting to live in my heart tonight I say Lord open the doors of my heart and come in tonight praise God amen amen the god little song S I think brother dick sang it sometime to Open the Eyes of My Heart Amen brother I want him to open him up real wide brother praise God hallelujah so he can put life into the word tonight amen here I would it be my body he says standing here without a spirit I'd be dead oh It's Only Life can can Quicken this body to move and it's only the holy spirit that can Quicken the word and he is the only one can put it in action praise God oh my that's a really Amen brother I could go to school amen and you know what amen they would do the best they could but you know what they can't put life in the word I can sit under a minister and that Minister can talk about the word he can preach about the word oh he can tell me all the great things but he can't put life in it praise God but there is one who can put life in it tonight and bring life out of it praise God when it comes into our heart to God oh my thank you Lord Jesus tonight oh he said God I me through a seat of his word and there is only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word praise God oh and he said when the life in the word meets the life in the spirit it produces whatever the seed is praise God Hallelujah to God oh I like that amen he said and as long as you take God at his word and then the word will produce what it's promised to do no wonder David got excited about the word of God when the word fell into his heart he began to pull on that word oh you say well Brother Jay he did this and he did that sure he did a lot of things praise God but there's one thing about it it was something in David's heart that looked beyond all of those things because a lot of times we walk through life and we have our little hangups we have our little things that goes wrong and we begin to look at that and we say oh but could God use somebody like me I'm going tell you what ien God can use anybody that will turn their life around and say Lord here I am as Isaiah said Lord here I am Use Me Lord praise God speak to me Lord God is just looking for a vessel who will yield himself unto him tonight that's what God looking for tonight he just wants us to surrender all that we have unto him praise God that's right Amen to God taking God at his word oh you say now look he said now maybe oh he said maybe you don't believe that that you say well my faith is what you hear a lot of people say what brother I just have a hard time having faith you know what I find out Faith sometimes is coming a mysterious thing because there's times if you ever get your mind off of whatever it is that you're trying to have faith for then you'll get healed because as long as you're looking at the situation it's hard to have faith most every time that God has ever healed my body it's when I got my mind off of it wasn't thinking about it and a lot of times it was in times I wouldn't even think about being there come on yeah because as long as I had the problem going on my mind it was hard to have faith but if I could just get it off my mind get off over here and begin to do something else ien to forget about what it was and next thing you wow what happened to it that's right that's what God likes to he likes to take those situations that we can just get our mind away from it and let him begin to work he said now look he said you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith now don't say you've got all faith brother say if you

HJ to God tonight amen amen praise the Lord rejoicing at the word now listen what David said Psalms 119 verse 130 I like I like these little scriptures maybe it just be a a little a stimula that you want get a little stimulation amen David said the entrance or the opening or the unfolding of thy words and I thought my goodness right that's it think about today now I'm just thinking about brother dick coming over here tonight how much knowledge that God has poured out in this age alone stop think about it just for a minute just just let your minds go and if you've had a lot of things going on today just you know just kind of block it out and just start and F God has opened back so much knowledge out of this word that no other age you young people listen to me cuz I come up in the

sharing a couple little things over the other day my mind just kept going justification by faith now Luther taught justification by faith I've got his books probably not all of them well Ain got several of them and I read what he talked about justification by the problem is with Luther he couldn't see how you could be justified by faith amen and turn around and be predestinated to do something justification and and and predestination and those things were there there was a lot of conflict in that to their thinking praise God and I thought here we are we can believe predestination we can believe the for knowledge of God we can believe in justification sanctification full restoration of the word no problem they had troubles back there trying to believe you go back and you read a lot of the older brothers that come on like Alexander Campbell and on back and on back through there and and John Knox and all of those they were great men preach great things but to see what we you see right brother right we have had a a such a such an old into the very Mind Of God we can realize today that we were actually with God in God as a very thought in his thinking they couldn't see that oh my God we just kind of hitting and missing look like a lot of but we find out that we were with God in God as a very thought and attribute of God that God could bring and bring down here to the earth oh my oh I begin to think about that my goodness gracious am what if I had have saved back after there pente cost running oh we oh yeah brother we have been running and running and running and

what he did uhuh I done a lot of dumb thing but I should would done what he done praise God oh David said the entrance or the opening or the unfolding of the word I I begin to think about here God comes and opens up four horse riders opening of the seven seal Redemption full restoration and all the great truths of God's word and letting us see where the great heart it was at what her work was where her conniving was going on and how that that religious spirit would be upon the Earth so strong it would deceive the very elect if it were possible Right but the word of God I believe it's not possible for an elect to be deceived praise God hallelujah oh I like to put that in the devil's ear amen and scream an interest on unfolding of that word it give us life or Enlighten of the eyes Amen to God remember when uh Saul made a proclamation one time he was going to battle and he told him to not eat anything and so Jonathan he didn't hear the report and so Jonathan and his buddy was out

just look into his word if you want to see it good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we're glad to have a visitor back there with us we always say to you when you come one time here you're visitor you come two times you're part of us so that's just a the way we we make it just make yourself to home and remember now Wade is in Oklahoma preaching and we'll be try back tomorrow and then also remember Aaron is down preaching brother Collins today so remember that and also remember these brothers that are out ministering the gospel you know unto the Lord right I don't know where brother Dean's ministering is he is he ministering today somewhere Brothers his brothers his brothers okay he's had his brothers on so so just remember these okay let's turn to Ephesians 1 one where we've been reading for quite a while and then John 15 cuz that's the ones we've used the last couple of messages to uh to try to bring it out now we're going to be using the uh screen this morning so you will be doing it and some have said well they couldn't see you know that was the ones their eyesight was bad not the basics that you can't see from the back because everybody can pretty well see and uh but I will make those who cannot see each week you know a copy of the the quotes and things but uh what I want to do until I finish this series of what we're on right now I'm going to continue to give you the quotes cuz I want you to read and see that that's what brother randam said cuz you take it up here you can read it and that's well and good all right but you'll forget it you know and you'll say well I don't know what that is so this is this is a very very important series to me it's very very uh valuable I believe and like I said the other day if it gets boring to you then you don't know what I'm talking about that's as plain as any way of making it not sarcastic just plan telling the truth if you get bored to hear me talk about chosen in him then you wouldn't chosen in him cuz I really love to hear about water baptism it tickles me to death to hear Brother random talking about it and he seemed it didn't bother he get the seals and you know on questions and answers he'd still be on water baptism so you know just you know take that from me but we will try to get the point across as much as we can I did try another few little points on my wife again uh yesterday to see how things were going and and uh you know to kind of telling her the the future points of what I'm talk going to be talking about but let's go to Ephesians 1 and John 15 father we thank you for for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we know you give them to us freely and we appreciate that and just bless and guide each one bless the minister brothers that are away today Wen Aaron and Brother Dean and way preaching we pray that you'd bless them and and be with them Lord and just let them bring forth Thy word unto the people and be with us here Lord as we speak about you come upon the seen in each one of our hearts and lives be in the speaker and the hearer that we may each one receive receive from you forgive our sins because we want to be cleansed Lord of all things all unrighteousness all thoughts and and meditations or anything that would be contrary to you we ask you to just cleanse them out of the way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts guide us now and keep us Lord in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 and brother Joe's putting them up for you there so they work out good verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now let's end there because we're staying remember in the thought back before the foundation of the world so if we go into predestination that's Destiny to determined down here so let's stop at that point now and go back to to uh John right John 15:15 henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you have not chosen me but I've have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we'll be using both so we will be giving you the quotes and things and uh you know I I want to express something to you that you know maybe will help us you know we think that I know people say brother Dale's deep and we get into things it's hard to understand well U I thought that's the way the Bible was because I didn't know we could understand it in our human carnality I thought it took a revelation to understand but I'd like to ask you a question just a simple ordinary question now we know the disciples were tutored for three and 1/2 years right we can understand but on the day of Pentecost they heard one sermon and people that had maybe never heard of spoke to had any thoughts of Jesus Christ they come to Salvation by hearing one sermon now my point is is this a way we say that you know I you need to make it simple I agree with you but I'm going to say it the right way now you take it the right way I try my best to make it simple to those that are born again because you're the ones that needs it made simple I'm letting you think that thought over all right you say yeah but but it needs to be made simple to everybody we then you know what I try to make it simple to everybody but I'm just making a point what great thing or what what was it that triggered on the day of Pentecost when all they heard was a story that about a man dying and him being the Fulfillment of the scriptures they didn't have a background right come on get with me what my thought they didn't have any background right they hadn't heard a whole bunch of sermons The Disciples had heard him and they talked to the Lord Jesus they didn't know about Jesus Christ and salvation but when they heard a sermon they were pricked in their heart now one day we'll understand why the prophet of God would make it an emphatic or however how you say it definite thing to say that the seed has to come through the body right amen the seed has to come through the body amen and faith has to come by hearing right hearing how by the word all right now if that be true and we claim we believe it then could not a person be born again under the deepest teaching of the seals plagues vs trumpets anything marriage and divorce or whatever and then you'll understand why my brother brandham kept going on in the message deeper and deeper and deeper into the word and people were being converted right okay now are you listening yes see and I click off your computer about all the quotes and the things and listen to what I'm saying I know that offend somebody because you don't like to be told what to do but are you listening yes yes sir what simple sermon did the disciples preach that brought 3,000 people to the Lord and they only heard one sermon right how was it the Ethiopian unic he did have a little bit of an advantage because he was reading the Bible and we assume then that probably the 3,000 uh back there was in one way or the other in a religious point of hearing of God and maybe had heard about Jesus in some form or other but never met with him and all I'm just asking you a simple question what is deep that's right well I just don't understand it is that deep or is it because we don't have the understander amen inside of us or not now listen the people that heard the one message on the day of Pentecost they gave you a key to what happened there they were pricked in their heart that the scripture that's right now we ought to be able to understand why Jesus would say no man can come unto me I'll get to that after a while unless the father draws in amen is that scripture we quote them but do we you know and read them but do we really understand yes my brother D we believe in Salvation right sure we do right we do it's a blanket it's for everybody yes but we also know that everybody won't receive it it's not the fact that they don't hear it those that don't hear the gospel will have a greater opportunity at the day of judgment than those who have heard the gospel right you agree right because they will not have the responsibility only of their lives and their doings and the prophet said then they there'll be a people will be given eternal life that you know know nothing about Jesus Christ that's right I'm just asking you it's a simple thing because I know people have made one brother he made a point here and he preached a sermon one time and you know I enjoyed always did enjoyed his sermons but you know I thought he's trying to say something but I don't know what it is but any kept saying feed my sheep feed my sheep and they rocked home for about probably 5 years maybe and we were discussing something one day that he was getting on to me about something of being sadique and he said that's why I preach that message M I said oh about to feed the sheep he said yeah he said I wanted you to get off them deep things and feed my family now this happened SOC but you know what I thought then just like I do now why didn't he teach his family right if I was deep why didn't he teach his family right he was a minister why wasn't he teaching his family right I've try to teach my family the gospel but I just want to get that a point to you I want you to think about it cuz you think in the Bible I want you to read the Bible and when you're reading it think about it if it had not been for God quickening those people's heart about what was said on the day of Pentecost you know the the sermon of Peter and him then they would have been no 3,000 converted right so we look at it you know I like what brother Ram said one time he said I like for God to work on both ends you remember that work on both ends you know working on the person working on the person then you can see people can be saved if you're preaching the seals the plagues the vows the trumpets as you call the Deep things I wish we would get that away from our understanding if God doesn't Quicken anything there's no way for you to be saved anyway if God never chose you then you're not going to be chosen you say that's predestination without a choice no I've been preaching it God gives you a choice that's right but I want you to think on that maybe you'll get away from thinking about deep things and get around to thinking about simple things you know what deep things are to me is the most simple things there are in the world that that's what's deep right how that we were chosen in him he said I can't understand that you know why you can't understand it because it hasn't been made alive to you right it hasn't been quickened to you it hasn't been revealed to you it's a good quote you remember a few weeks or so ago and I talking about the Bible says we're just by being in Jesus Christ we're just as righteous as God is but has that been revealed or is that just a quote if it's a quote it's deep things if it's revealed I thought we believe that God was hidden and revealed were simp in simplicity so then ask for God to reveal to you what I'm talking about when I'm speaking to you or anyone else right because he doesn't reveal it we won't get to [Music] point but you just think about it you go back go back to the prophet's message go back to all the other and look at the things that he would be preaching and people come to the altar to be saved I'm tried my best to tell you what the prophet said one day that a preacher has nothing but a gift to be able to break Satan's spell over your eyes that God may be speaking can speak to you that's sure he must preach it correctly he must bring it correctly Etc we know that all right but all that I do is try to break that spell say ain't no spell on my eyes with you the one that's got it right simple you're the one that's got the spell over your eyes cuz you're missing the whole point this message was not brought to be uh deck things quotes and show how much intelligence we have and how we can out quote everybody else and how we can use the Great swelling word theop is and all of this that logos and and just make everybody think we know all about what we're talking about it was made to be revealed and lived that's right that's what it's made for that's right to be revealed to us that we could live it that's Simplicity all right so think on that now so then maybe it'll take away from the thoughts of people's mind that you know you need to preach simple things to the children you'd be surprised that these children are understanding sometimes better than you are that's right that's you want to get upset with me for talking like that go right ahead but if you get upset with me for saying it then you know for sure that you're the one I'm talking about it's not because their mind is so sharp it's because that they believe it you know children will believe what you say so be careful what you say to them they will believe it why can't we believe it see Faith truly then comes by hearing and hearing by the word right amen so then it order bring us to a place of understanding okay now I just that's been on my mind for quite a while of thinking and and I wanted to just get it off to the basis of getting understanding to you that we call things deep when it means it's simply not been revealed right when you say that's deep that means it's not been revealed to you is that simple enough but that hurts your feelings doesn't it well I'm sorry but truth is trth as I say again what great what great thing read the read the the the the book of Acts there where that before the Holy Ghost fell on the 3000 read it to me and give me a simple sermon out of it here's a man telling people about somebody they know nothing about probably a lot of them knew nothing about Jesus right you know it's not that they heard three years like the others they heard nothing nothing about Jesus see what you're making it is that we're to take the people and sit down and train them to be able to believe now that would do away with God's calling that would not be the father calling that would be you calling them with words and see then you you get offended at me for saying but I try to make it as simple as I possibly can because we've been doing this for 40 something years and I've been preaching and go back with Brother Ray and ask him and sit down and he can tell you where I was preaching this 20 years ago that's right CU he's taking them off and put them into where that you have the ability and if you want to go back and do it and like I've always said I I'd make the takes for two purposes one for you to take home and listen to and one for us to keep it where you come up and you say brother Dale you said so and so you changed your Doctrine I said show me that's right well I heard you I told a brother one day he said you said so I said no I didn't I said if I did my mind was out of it I didn't mean it that way but I said I don't think I said it yes he did I said well let's go get the tape we'll play the tape and see whether I said it or not well you know what that that generally kills people they don't want to cuz they want to go away thinking well I still believe he said it but I'm just not going to argue with him anymore he's sarcastic arguing and hateful ain't arguing and hateful I well go listen to the T see if I said if I did I come to the church repent all right see that's what we ought to be well all right now let's get into what we're talking about today now we've been we covered the last message that you know we were The Offspring of God as Paul said The Offspring of God you remember that now what is an offspring an offspring is in the natural is you are an offspring of your mother and father you know that you come into the world but in the spiritual you're your mother is God and your father is God so you're not dealing with that form you're dealing with whether or not you're born again CU if you're born again then you prove what you was and remember now what we're trying to do we're trying to stay back up I haven't brought it down to earth yet when we get to earth we'll start dealing with predestination for knowledges and you choosing and and all cuz I believe in never been of that there's a couple of quotes in here that I gave you where brother R said see you chose you call you you you know you accepted it you got to see we we run that in the ground where we say well brother brandom said no man sought god well what do you mean well I mean nobody sought him would you didn't cry and pray and seek God you didn't repent of your sins come on you didn't repent of your sins then you're not saved simple amen plain language you're not saved right cuz if you don't repent of your sins how could you have eternal life come on see we we think we know what we're talking about but then when it's faced by the word that someone does know what they're talking about then well I'm not going to argue ain't no argument to it right takes two side to argue you ain't got one that's being sarcastic no been true amen if you had to repented God wouldn't give you the Holy Ghost come on Amen on that but see he knew your choice right he knew You' choose him we'll get to that on down into to where we call it over into time but now we're trying to stay back before the Earth before the world to see whatever was back there or what went on or or you know whatever we're doing I'll tell you when we drop down to earth you remember we were talking about that we were The Offspring of God and we've been dealing with that we were chosen the scripture says in him and we read where Jesus said there in the gospels John 14 uh John 1516 you didn't choose me I chose you that's right before the world Jeremiah I chose you to be a prophet right before the world well did Jeremiah have anything to do with life he did actually got here but I've got a quote in here that we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet said this that we're talking about was billions of trillions of trillions and millions of years before the world ever begun he said then how could you choose now that's simple that's as simple as anything could be he said how could you choose that's right well now what it is he saw my choice well I've done covered that and I'll go back to it again if he saw your choice then you chose right okay but if it was billions of billions of years ago you wasn't there to make a choice as a human mortal or being or whatever you had to be part of that eternal life amen and if you was not not part of that eternal life you never will be part of that eternal life see that's as simple as we've been trying to make it see but now our study is back DIY but what we're trying to cover is what was our existed or whatever happened before the world now the Lord willing maybe Wednesday night we'll get into where the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy but just remember if that was a not a reality it never will happen on Earth because listen I'm giving you the key the same scripture that said he was crucified before the world is the same scripture that said you shout it okay that's right see that's simple but see know you want to make one this way and one that way no simple if it says it it says it we'll get to that in a minute cuz that's the point of want you don't get anything out of the whole day of one thing I want to drive the point to you and I that God's word is eternal and that his thoughts are Eternal and he can never have another thought and we've got to be those attributes if we're not those attributes we never will be the attributes right right that's all I want to tell you so if you missed the whole sleep to or whatever you turn off your computer and get upset with me and just go on I can't help it cuz I can't can't control you right all right now this is before we start our Earthly journey of anything whatsoever so now let's start out let's see what the scriptures the scripture there the prophet gave I mean the scripture we read said we were chosen in him now you remember what I've been trying to make the point it's not that we were chosen by him right that comes on over into life we were not chosen you know by him or anything like that because if it was that that deals over here but we were chosen in him right see then if we can find where we were at diary remember I kept asking the question in one service about it who's the hym the Bible said we were chosen in him who's the himy all right so we know and for sure and see it's the Christ right and that's how that we would be in Jesus Christ to walk the shores of Galilee right not as little bitty identities running around in the body but it to be in that eternal life that he had within him all right so now we know who the HM is it's Christ now who done the choosing we're not trinitarians we don't believe in two Gods but we believe God can show himself in many forms or many ways he can make himself manifest and what people don't want to believe is in how that one form of God can communicate with another form of God that's that's the hardest thing seemingly here to get across to you cuz you just what do you mean if there's a God here and a god there that's two of them you know no that's not you ever talk to yourself oh who are you talk to come on you talk to yourself like one brother said said only the time that I can figure I'm caring on an intelligent conversations when I'm talking to myself now talking to yourself you ever answer your own questions oh we're getting down where we live now that's how simple the gospel is now let me give you another one and we'll break it on down a little further okay now brother collie you believe you have eternal life don't you okay brother dick you believe you have eternal life do you ever talk to brother colie or brother colie ever talked to you what do you mean both of you got the same eternal life but you know you don't have all of it right so you know that within the other person is part of God Amen so you can talk to each other right amen that simple illustrations we're talking about almighty God not a peanut brain outfit that you and I used to think he was we're talking about the great Eternal that never had another thought he cannot have another thought he cannot think another thought you know in any way that would change any thought he had he never changes his mind he doesn't do anything like that well we got no you got the message too he didn't change his mind that's right he gave the man 15 years he didn't change his mind he knew he was going to give him that for a man ever asked for it and the man died cuz that's what he was told sit your house in order you'll die right and he did die right right after the 15 years amen see that's simple see we going to be far enough in the message now to be able to talk about these things and I'm telling you that that it's 40 something years of me preaching and God is unveiling now things to me that I had questions about for 40 something years and would not dare try to express what I believed because I did not see the end of it if I don't see the end of something then I I can't preach it to you because that means I don't understand it so I'll just wait but once I start on it and see it then you know for sure we're going somewhere if I didn't know the answer to two or three questions in this message I would just call in somebody have to let them preach and forget it but the Lord keeps unfolding it to me now listen the thoughts of God are Eternal can never have a new thought that's right amen can't change his mind amen can't say he was wrong cuz he never was his thoughts are Eternal that's why you've always heard me say what what is one of my favorite saying I don't want to be in the mind of God because everybody is in the mind of God Judas is car was in the mind of God the Bible spoke of him coming and the things happening before he got here but that doesn't make Judas Eternal right I don't want to be in the mind of God I like to think that he thought of me that's all right you know but I want to be a part of his mind that's right amen so when we're dealing with thoughts now remember the Bible I didn't bring these with me because you surely you should know it but what is it in Isaiah where he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways my thoughts are so much beyond your thoughts until your thoughts in other words paraphrasing what I'm saying they're not even in considered brother kie preached that years about 30 something years ago he thinks I can't remember but I do he used to call it Thro I remember that I'm not making fun of his words I'm just telling you I can remember but now listen what about those thoughts well brother Dale you don't understand predestination and things it's just that that we were just in God's mind and he just thought of us now how can you bring eternal life that way come on you you you can't bring ET eternal life to a mortal being by your concept of that point you going to have change somewhere of you're thinking because you would only be dealing with what you know well I'm sure I'm glad I done something or didn't do something and God saved me then where's Abraham's unconditional Covenant why you just don't understand God knew Abraham would believe him I know that too but I know he gave him an unconditional Covenant and I know that he gave all the Seed of Abraham that same unconditional Covenant amen well then I'll just go out and live like the devil well then go ahead cuz you prove you're not a Seed of Abraham cuz Abraham done what God God knew what Abraham would do right and Abraham done it but he had a choice in doing it that's why when we get there there there's things in this life if we don't correct them here we're going to have to answer for them there it won't be a decision of whether we're going to heaven or not no it be the decision upon the basis of of rewards we don't have to stand before the white Throne judgment we sit on the Judgment seat judging the others but the Bible also speaks of a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad we don't make right here we got to answer some word that's right amen he said well then how's it unconditional well it's unconditional cuz he ain't going to send you to hell cuz you done but you're going to give an account all right now listen to what your Prophet had to say this is Page 150 of the church age book which is really soar in church age and brother Joe tries to give you this what I I do and and everything but you read the whole thing is read I'm going to give them to you until I finish this God I want you to to know brother random said these things I don't mean to just put it up here and it be something that you read it and didn't understand I want you to have in your possession then you can't argue the point you can't say I didn't have an opportunity so look what brother around said he's talking about his substance and things you know from Psalms 139 15- 16 about my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and ciously WR in the lower parts of the earth th eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance was fashioned were fashioned when as yet there was none of them now watch it that as I said was not written about Adam another words it this wasn't written about Adam right it was written about the spiritual seed it was written about the the ones who would receive eternal life am so it wasn't just written about Adam but you use an Adam as an example all right watch it was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was Dire in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed it had to be expressed so when Adam was formed to the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought Express and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested was there any way to change the situation of Adam no now we get to it where that you you've got to consider what I'm saying Adam didn't have a choice when Adam took a choice he felled right agree but he didn't have a choice how he got here amen he didn't have a choice of being what he was that's right because God started you that way that's right right he had to start it perfect and Adam had eternal life in his soul but now his body and spirit was not Eternal that's right but see Adam wasn't given a choice he never had a choice of whether he was going to have Eve or not come on see the eternal life was not on the basis of anything Adam would be doing or not doing it was on impartation from God he never had a choice about his wife he didn't get to choose God gave him a wife of God's choosing but knowing see we'll have to come back to these later when we get over on this sidey but knowing that they would fall once he gave them a choice so we better deal with that choice one of these days right God knew if he ever put man here even giving eternal life in the soul that they would fall right now you can argue about Eve all you want too I just tell you what I believe I believe she was in Adam and theop because that's what brother random said in theop is a soul so I believe Eve had eternal life in her soul right so you want to make I know the point you want to make Adam with some great something but Eve just just garbage can you no Perfect Right perfect but God knew she'd make a choice and then Adam would follow her choice and the fall would take place we'll get back to that but remember Adam was was not Eternal in body his body was a creation yes he only had eternal life in his soul that's blasphemous names read the prophet his body was not Eternal there's where the problem was right had there not been a fall which we know could not be because God had attributes in him right but had there not been a fall then it wouldn't have been a devil okay you know if it was going to be that there wasn't going to be no fou it wasn't going to be no devil there wasn't going to be no problems it would have just been there it was been Adam and Eve and all they had to do would just go to the tree of life and eat the tree of life and their bodies would have been made Eternal simple simple language simple point and they would have brought us here you can argue all you want to up and down they do in the message whether that would be spoken word children or where it would be by sex that we were brought or whatever you just argue all you want to ain't concerned about I just know for certain we didn't come that way that's right but had God brought us that way they would have not been a fall you go along with it that been no fall it would have been no devil it would have been no curse wouldn't have been no problem but God could not have displayed all of his attributes you say well how would it been some way we would have come then we would have all went to the tree of life and our bodies would have been made Eternal and everything would have been okay now you tell me that's not exactly what's taking place I want you to sit down and discuss that with me sometime that's exactly what's taking place we fail we came here but we come to Jesus Christ in the soul to make the the soul Eternal and then we're going to the tree of life which is the word which will eventually change these bodies so the ultimate end of of the way God's doing it don't make no difference he's going to bring it the way he wants all right but you see Adam and Eve beautiful but yet they sinned don't you know that was God's thought now don't you think that God knew that if he allowed us to come we would fall now here's one thing I want to get across to you but I'm I want to make sure you understand it this is one of the things I was covered with my wife yesterday I want to make sure you understand understand this you know the way brother Dale lives and what he believes your children know that you know I don't believe in living like a garbage can you've been around me you know that but don't you ever get in your mind adults especially cuz the children won't even ever get it there don't you adults ever get into your mind that you can't do wrong just because you're born again don't you do it cuz you're right in the devil's trap when you think you can't do wrong cuz you got the new birth you are lost in out of the word of God is the best way for me to say it now that don't justify us doing wrong I said it while ago there's going to be a judgment of Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad if we don't repent of them here we're going to face things that in the world to come amen not a choice of eternal life I keep saying that but the fact that we won't repent on this Earth but you see we we want to make it you listen to the preachers preach and they say oh bless God when you get that Holy Ghost there just no way for you to do wrong now show me that in the Bible that's right well you just don't believe in the Holy Ghost being able to keep you you better think things over right it would sound like that I would be saying that it doesn't matter what you do no I didn't say that you kids these kids understand me they know I'm not talking like that so it's adults that I'm talking to right see we are capable of sinning oh that the seed cannot sin that's the seed that's inside of there that's the new birth it can't sin but this body and spirit that I'm dwelling in can still do wrong you better keep it under subjection to the Holy Spirit that's within you cuz not you'll be running out here and saying it don't it don't bother me I'll go down to the beard store and get me some beer I'll go down to The Honky TS and hang around cuz it don't bother me now you lying hypocrite of a devil how much stronger can I make it that's right that's right don't ever get the idea that you can get by with anything that's right amen you better keep the idea of repenting amen brother randam said they said he said do you sin brother Ram he said every day now this his words well he didn't really mean that well you argue with God about it I'm just trying to make a point don't ever think this because you have eternal life that you can't make a mistake and do wrong don't think that you can't do wrong with the new birth inside of you that's right now the new birth inside of you will make you then repent yes when you do the wrong if not then the Holy Ghost is not there simple enough but it doesn't keep us from doing wrong we're human Mortals living in a world of mortality as you want to call it whatever I'm just trying to be straight and honest see to keep us from falling off into the wrong thing to think about it and to see that God really chose us back there thank you Jesus follow that thought of what I'm talking about don't go out and just do wrong and say Well it don't matter I'm Christian now you're lost you remember the man in the Hebrew series had a guy to go out and there wanted somebody to go get him some beer as a preacher and he quit you know he said if I was a Christian and I wouldn't be preach I wouldn't be doing this but brother Brown said it was his child that's right but he said he took him home because he couldn't Mar his name the man wouldn't repent so he had to go home amen the Bible says some men sins go before them and some follow after if we repent they go before us and hit the blood and they're gone but if they follow after us we're going to have to give an account somewhere not a decision of eternal life no but now listen my Point's always been if we have eternal life why wouldn't we want to be right why wouldn't we want to repent I mean what's wrong why wouldn't we want to be right that's what the people of the world look at us and they see the garbage can of this message the polygamy and the hookies and all kind of things that in the Mage all around but yet and that's what's going to bring the the the things down on us but I don't blame the government for closing out it like I've always told you you let me find one of you guilty of of molesting a child or doing something like that I'll be the one that take you to court and I know the quotes from brother brownon he wouldn't turn in them people that was Crooks and things he said that's not my job that's up to the law you want that quote don't you think he knew what was going on but there are some things that man wouldn't have put up with and neither will I amen because we're try to do honest to be straight now forgive me lost 30 minutes to 45 talking to you all right but now listen now we know for assurity that God's thoughts are Eternal all right now I just want to read that and go down to a little bit with you and just remember now what he thinks of is not necessarily Eternal right he thought of Judas he thought of Hitler he thought of everybody he thought of the the whole world he thought of all of the people Etc what would be it doesn't make it Eternal you must receive eternal life to have eternal life but remember now and we'll try to get this point in heavily the prophet said it's not not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God 154 Church age book I didn't give you that one but you ought to remember it he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God he said it's the seed our word right now who was it when he was talking about Jeremiah that I knew you and ordained you to be a prophet before the world gifts and callings are without repentance that's right but you know you can have gifts you could have all of the nine spiritual gifts and be lost that's right that's another thing people don't like for you to talk about well look at so they have gifts why do that matter gifts some colge or without you can have all the gifts and still be lost but you can't have the giver and be lost I don't I want the giver with the giver comes the gift but gifts without the giver is just a g can that's right amen I was called to preach before the world ever begun cuz that's a gift now there was a day when the man here you're looking at didn't believe that call but then I see what a call to the ministry is and it's not a rooster up in a tree cow her mama calls daddy scent businesses right well I just feel like ought to preach go sit down and listen for a while and find out what you're going to preach when you do preach that's what I told Wade right that's right y I told him I said don't you run with it you you sat down and wait till God runs you and he can't you can't run no further than you get up and go preach but the prophet of God said a man had volunteers himself God can't use him right now he didn't say God couldn't use him to make speed and get other people converted he didn't say that he just can't use him to bring the word you see why I around the message then they're not bringing the word that's just as plain as can be that's all right with me I'm not trying to make nothing out of it just be truthful Jeremiah was a man the gift was the prophet right right so what did God order name before the world the gift to stand there and condemn Israel but before the world has for let him know that Jeremiah would be the man right amen I want to preach one of these days I tried it about 30 years ago and it didn't go over I want to preach on the real you amen if I ever get to enough time I will yes and I tried it years ago and everybody went haywire with me about it you just back off and try to move on believe it but listen to what brother R goes on to say in this quote that we're talking about that was number one is going down to number two it's a little point on the side there 15 2 down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah that's two in the Old Testament one one in new now to bring him to to TI the 2 two together in the middle excuse me with John and John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season each one of them was the word now I just got to explaining it so if you have trouble with it go back and listen to what I said Jeremiah was a man but the gift to speak out against Israel was God's word it dwelt in a man and made a man and the word one but it's after he got here yes see the gifts and callings are without repentance there was no way that there was not going to be a Malachi 4 take place in the last days but there had to be a man on Earth could accept that choice and make his own and for God to use it but look what he says then we come to Jesus the Loos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he has chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it right but now in case somebody clicks onto this one had heard the other one we don't believe in Eternal Sinners we don't believe you come into the world with eternal life that's right as they're teaching in the message around the country you must receive eternal life that's right am if not Jesus Christ died in vain and they wouldn't no day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell there wouldn't be anything so we don't believe that we believe you must receive eternal life but the eternal life that you receive never had a beginning and never had an ending that's right amen and if you receive it here then there's one thing about it you're part of it back there amen amen if you don't get it here you wouldn't have part of it back there you could be impartations you can do all kind of things you see that gives an ET Eternal quality to you and I makes us to realize that God did really love us desire us to walk with us amen because we were a part of him remember we kept stressing that point we were part of him now what does it mean to be an offspring you remember we covered that what does it mean to be an offspring that say want to go an offspring is God in another form we're not talking about Mom and Daddy having children an offspring of God is God in another form because how else you going to keep your truth about the the true Oneness of the Bible that's right well you're just a Oneness well okay let's see you bring it together I'll be glad to discuss it with you than that's open to anyone if there just one God if there is just one eternal life and that eternal life now dwells in you that eternal life was in God before the world so that's what he chose an offspring is God in another form Jesus we get the scripture Jesus was an I mean the quot the pro Jesus was an offspring of God what he was God in another form called a son who are we the life form of God to the Gentile dispensation is the Bride of Jesus Christ right we are his offspring we're his children yes and a child of God see we look at a child of God like we look at our own children it took me and my wife to get the kids here God didn't have no help to get to bring himself here that's why it's different right on the day of Pentecost he divided himself but see God is the only one that can divide himself and still still be completely God Amen there's no way a human mortal can comprehend that right brother Mo said you take and try to describe you know that the parts of and you take an apple and you cut it up you give it out you run out of apple but God on the day of Pentecost gave 120 eternal life that didn't make him no less God that's right he gave 3,000 at the next time that didn't make him no less God how many millions of him has been down through the time from the day Pentecost of 2,000 years that don't make him no less you know what that makes him greater the more he gives away the greater he gets like I've always told you eternal life is the only thing I want to give away you said give away your eternal life I wish I could I want to give somebody that eternal life that I have within me that's why I preach the gospel cuz the only way I can impart is not go out and lay hands on the only way I can impart is to preach the truth and let you see that truth as I was trying to say a while too and then you get converted you get pricked in your heart you get condemned in your heart and you go to God because you heard the word amen then the seed is really coming through the body but it gives an eternal quality to the elect look on down at the next one 284 which is still Church age book but this is already in church age he's talking about the record the book of eternal life for that is another book though contain in The Book of Life all right do you understand what he saying I put a word right here there's not two books there's not the book of life and the Book of eternal life it's one book but it's sections of that book now he explains this in the church age book and he explains it on the um inter Veil oh no excuse me do I'll get it in a minute it'll click but he explains it it's not two books it's two sections of one book invisible Union about of Christ see it's two sections you have a section of life there's actually four I ain't got time to cover there's four qualifications goes in there but there's a section in there that's just the book of life which is life right and all names will be placed in that book of life amen because when you come into the world your name was put in the book right but there's a difference between that and the Lamb's Book of Life section but the reason this one book is because when you started in the world you know where you started you started with your name in the book now go to the invisible Union see if I'm not right you started with your name in The Book of Life as a human mortal yes when you received the new birth your name is transferred the prophet said to the Lamb's Book of Life you say that's adding new words no that's just a record down here just a record down here are you following me yes see now you understand the book see it's the Bible this this is The Book of Life yes yes now in this Book of Life there a lot of Records about people that that lived in this world and they're going to be the records here of a lot of people going to die and go to hell because that their names were here and they were part of this and different things that's right but then in here is the bride of Christ amen which is eternal life that's right right here in this book which is the Bible that's what this was what was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne that's right the prophet are called in a book of names this is a book of names Peter James John Paul but it's also a record of their life all right you you you following with me now it's simple when you understand so look what he saying now this is the record God hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he puts Eternal par and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal in par and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him him before the foundation of the world the great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted Now where's he coming down to where he was at on Earth cuz we were in him he was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant which is the church ages all and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seed having the same life in them and being like the original because by Spirit they are original by Spirit we're original by the new birth we're original that's the real you is the new birth amen but now follow me we were chosen in him not just chosen of him because of something you done not chosen by him because of him seeing that you would want it and he would choose you that way we're back before the world that's right we're back there when there's a lot of things going on that you and I before we heard this prophet's message we didn't know what was going on in Earth let alone what's going on in heaven you agree oh we thought we did sure we we believe you know we do the best we could do oh yeah but he come to expound the scriptures to open the scriptures to open our understanding of God's word right that God could reveal it so look that on the next one this is the message of Israel and the church which is part one or number one 19th 53 325 which is paragraph 56 now watch according amen now here it is I hope it really I'm going to let it soak in right real good cause cause it's so good it might go Plum into the bones you know according as he had chosen Us in him who did I heard it and I come now what' he say no no you never all right see he's before the world he's not down here where we're at he's before the world you remember a prophet is speaking the mind of God right he is not speaking a human mortal mind that's right he is telling us what's in God's mind cuz he's the only one can go back there and get it that's who did it I heard it and I come no no you never he hath chosen hath past tense has chosen us the church in him how long ago oh last week or when you heard the Revival no before the foundation of the world now can now you can ride on the cloud see he's done what he chose us in him Christ before the foundation of the world Amen all right questions and answers on Genesis 1953 7:29 paragraph 61 now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first creation image now what is our first created image if we're returning it back it would have to be back there we're going to get into redeeming this when we we finally get to the point when God created me William Brown I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but the I was dark oh I I don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now there were some part of me Arman Neville and the rest of you all that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever begun and here is to my analysis is of that it's all right where were we at we was in Christ now as I tried to explain it in many times and and expressing it and trying to get better words to do I I said I was trying these on my wife she gave me some better words to say so I try to use them but we know the first thing that come out of God was God in another form called a son what else you going to call it a son is Offspring a son is a product of his father Yes but in spiritual terms you would have a trinity if you wouldn't careful but in spiritual terms a Son of God is God in another form amen whether it be back there in Jesus or be in you right it's God in another form that's right all right but you see then we look back there and we see him and run around said a little Halo of light goes out comes over and said he begins to say Let There Be and he said who is that he said it's the Son of God even your Scholars called it that go back in your Bible and read it in Genesis cuz they knew my Lord if he seen anything what else would it be so would it be the man looking down in the fiery furnace and and Nebuchadnezzar wouldn't it whatever it was throw him in and said we we see we throw three in and said we look down in there fourth and said he's like the Son of God why because if he was protecting them every who was in there was protecting them from being burnt right so it had to be God and if it's God it had to be in another form if you could see it so then what are we talking about we're talking about the Simplicity of understanding that when he stepped over into that form the prophet will call it the word he'll call it the theophany he called it a part of God God in another form which is a part of God now there Earth where a human mind goes into gears and we need to click it off and listen see we say a part of God right well I no no no no that was all of God that's all God going to reveal right that's where people don't understand me and the way I preach that's why brother R could say on the River Jordan he became the fullness of the godhead bodily he didn't say he wasn't born God it was just part of God hadn't been made manifest right see when he stepped over into that form and begin to say Let There be all right now brother brand says if we wouldn't there then in him right then we'll never be there with eternal life cuz that's what stepped over there was eternal life it's just a story it's a way of expressing things right but brother randam then would say and I don't mind covering it with you he said who this meled he said see we byass the the offy and come over to human to to die and be a sinner how do we bypass it 285 goes around Atlanta you know that's good terms Ain it no we just never come that way cuz he stood there as part of God right called a son we wasn't standing all around there looking like him we wasin him we are part of God that was in him that was all of God for what he going to reveal that's right that's why people don't follow me I can look back and see God coming down condescending and still see my heavenly father setting up there in glory amen calling me that has eternal life down here that's where you don't understand the God here let me say something to you what are the attributes of God father son Holy Ghost right three attributes but we talk about attributes being savior healer Etc do you know that when he stepped over in that form that would be called a son that made him a father now listen to what I'm saying I didn't think I'd bring it but I got to get it now what is the attribute of a father what is the attribute called father you're automatically when you're you're you're dealing with attributes what is it healer savior Redeemer EXC Etc but where did Brother ROM ever cover the attribute of a father I want you to bring it CU you see he was already a father that's right father is one of his attributes right that's right when he created that logos theop what all those words are that part of God that form and stepped over he was a father could communicate back with him say let us brother around said father and son and you can do what you want to with it that's what he said he said word and spirit said let us make man in our image you know that when he created Adam in the Garden that made him father right and you see we're going a long ways but Adam and the garden never made him the father he wanted to be right I want you to Coast there a little bit made him father you remember the prophet saying that he was God but said he wasn't God he said cuz he was nothing to worship him he said he made angels and they worshiped him that made him God see we We Roll on that but now roll with me on father where is the attribute of father he created Adam and that made him a father that's right but that was not the father he wanted to be right he created a logos the form and stood there but that was that was the greatest of all and would ever be but that was not what he wanted to be got a long way to go I'm going to leave that cuz that way if you want to run off and just do all you want to with it then you can do it I'll come back to it but just remember Adam never made him the father he wanted to be right and brother brandom if he had made one statement you and I would be in terrible shape yes he said he's the son of man that's the only way he can be the father that's right okay we're going somewhere makes you more Curious maybe and thinking make you listen look go the next one the believer's position in Christ 55 uh 116a according as he has as he God has chosen us not my desire not your desire wasn't Paul's desire but he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world do you think of that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we why did you Cho us watch the rest of we Ain got no time to get to this we will eventually but that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love is what the rest of the scripture say that's why he chose us back there how would it do any good for him to choose down here and us be holy we're not holy right right right where's your Holiness but he chose us before the world that we may be holy says not cause I lived right because he chose me to be that way that's right he done it not it goes on continuing now now back there before the foundation of the world God chose you in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world you see it all right let me find one in here I want to make sure and put it on this this message oh excuse me a minute okay flip over and get number 11 brother Joe it will be um he's got the numbers find he'll find it quicker than I can questions and answers 1959 1223 he done got it up there all right read all the way down to the positions you are and that God placed you and the IR filled people and in the coming down to bring you to a me bring you a message and all the things but then look at the scriptures according as he had chosen us and he hath he has chosen us now we didn't choose how could I choose him listen to it 400 billion million billion trillion years ago how could I have chose him right now he's asking a simple question how could I chose him but he chose me all right we're back up to there and covered this evening I just wanted to bring that one out cuz we got to quit here in a minute but listen let me get one more where you won't leave you danging let's go to uh let's let's go to number six the position of a believer in Christ 1955 227 a which is paragraph e44 all right come back friends come back to the love of God don't go after every wind of Doctrine and jumping here and there now listen and every time a little something flies up run away from the church and go over here and over here it's just Cults jumping up now you better read that off I don't like it I just go somewhere okay I don't say that they're they're wrong speaking but yet they're their hungry children hungry hearted children he wasn't throwing off on them right he said it Formed Cults and done this that and the other but he said they're hungry children you know he made a statement one day time is outstanding to me he said children would eat out of a garbage can he said he got to to live now youin talking about natural right right exactly right okay so what do we need all get to get together somewhere and come together and set in Heavenly places and get back to God then God will go to working with you watch sitting in Heavenly places according to third verse coming on this morning he chosen Us in him according as he has chosen Us in him our him choosing Us in him and read according as he ha chosen Us in him are him choosing Us in him who done the choosing God did you didn't I didn't God did you haven't chose me but I have chose you said Jesus look according as he has chosen Us in him how chosen us the elect now the ones that's in Christ Jesus he chose us in him when yesterday the day before listen the scripture before the foundation of the world I'm surely not reading that wrong that's the way it reads here in the King James version God CH you in Christ before the foundation of the world was ever laid then if God knew that what you scared about if God knew way back before the foundation of the world to choose you in Christ Jesus and you come in and accepted the call what you scared about what's the matter sisters he can heal he can say you come and accepted the call I this over here right so the prophet never left us dangling chosen in him just listen to that little tug in your heart right yeah but brother I have so many troubles I have so many problems I need to quit this I need to quit that I ain't never preached nothing like that and I never will I'll never preach you quit doing things wrong and God will save you cuz there is no scripture that is our Holy Ghost righteousness of our own we think I didn't drink I didn't do now like oh oh really so and so or sister so and so I I've been good all my life and God chose me now you are in a garbage can of Satan's delusion that's why it doesn't bother me to preach to people that'll come to me and tell me brother Dale I've been married before I've had all these problems I've been this I've been in adultery I've been in all kind of things I believe in Deliverance amen I don't believe in going on and doing it after you see the truth no but I believe in Deliverance I believe in Salvation amen but see we think we was just maybe and that's what a lot of people say they I'm just not good enough to be saved no sir I agree with you 100% that's there's never been a mortal in the world good enough to be saved there was Jesus Christ died in vain but why can't we accept what he done for us right and believe it why can't we look at it then and see that he chose me back there you said but Brother D I don't have that eternal life dwelling in me all right that's the thing you need that's right well how do I get it by believing God's word and you may do it in 5 minutes or you may do it in 5 years that's between you and God right but you see we got all of the things that we think that we were this and we were that I'm trying to tell you that eternal life the prophet was speaking of was a part of God and he imparts that to you and I and gives us eternal life then we're part of God we're an offspring of God we're a child of God which means we're God in another form right what El are you well don't Brother D I'm just a child of God you're making it too big I'm not making it big enough right he chose it this way he knew there was going to be a fall but he knew he was going to have children amen why because they were a part of it that's right you better think about what I said about father because healer savior Redeemer and all is just bringing you back that's right paying a price but if he wasn't my father why do you think brother random would make this statement I didn't give it to you now but he said Jesus never came to give me an inheritance you remember that he said he came to redeem me to my inheritance he said my inheritance was eternal life with the father before the world that's my inheritance eternal life well then you know maybe I was born with eternal life I don't believe that I don't even believe Adam was born with eternal life I've preached it to you Adam was standing in the garden living moving human being wrote around and said BL see his name and God breathed into his nostrils your breath of eternal life go read the book that's right amen why cuz if it had it would have been God standing there it wouldn't have been Adam that's right see Adam was created Body Spirit and soul of man right and then God breathe into him eternal life or else he would have been God standing there wouldn't have been Adam sech We Are The Offspring of God the prophet said that the full the the that godhead was not complete without you if you're a part of God how can God be complete without you come on Brothers think on these things eternal life a possession that we can have you said but if you could just make it simple enough I could get saved what else can I say then what the Bible says repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it didn't say you get it to minute is baptized it didn't make that statement it said ye shall that's right which could be years later but it don't have to be it can be that very minute if you believe it right if God is tugging at your heart don't turn down that Brother D I just feel condemned that's God tugging at your heart right then they say God forgive me come and save me yes and you know what this is what a lot of people don't like see then after you to be a Christian after you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're still have that longing in your heart and you still want to say God forgive me and help me and Lead me there's not a day passes that I don't pray God forgive me Lead Me Lord help me guide me give me what for the people let me walk in you back on next anybody have a need I all while I sing and at Jesus I am freest is Joy unable and full of GL love of GL you feeling T your heart oh if he ever get the word and he not Jing in my heart I'm worried it never stops I never stop because the eternal life that I now have part of God before the world is now as a part of God living in me making me a Son of God is not another person God made manifest in another form the least member of the body of Jesus Christ had within him the omnipotent almighty God the very person of almighty God that existed before the world before anything ever come now living in your heart and he can give everybody in the world today 7 billion people or more today he can give everybody the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then make him no less God and make him that much greater you can't explain that you know what every Born Again believer has quoting brother around the person of Jesus Christ Living in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost explain that can't be but I believe it I believe it I thank God for it brother oh his Jo and of Glory of that to one another servic and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is Jo unspeakable and full of Glory over the half has never yet been told I have found the joy no Tong and tell how it way the We Roll it's like a great or we bring up with in my soul oh joy unable and full of Glory oh of Glory oh our glory is your un speakable and full of Glory oh the heaven has never yet and it is St unspeakable and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is your unspeakable

got to start believing that bless I uh God bless you bless you buddy love you appreciate everybody here thank you for your prayers I had a headache don't have one now so it was a sick one I mean I was sick in my stomach that usually doesn't happen but uh thank you for your prayer even though the ones of you that didn't know I did you prayed for me anyway so so we thank God for that if you have your Bibles turn to the book of First Corinthians just for one scripture and get started um this will be the Journey of a Christian part three uh part one and two was a couple of Sundays ago for those of you that missed it you'll just have to get the tape I can't background much cuz if you'll remember right at the end I kind of rushed through and I want to kind of back up a little bit right what I want to do tonight is I want to start at chapter 17 of Genesis but don't turn there now but where the new birth and type begins and then go through the latter part of Abraham's life and then you know you you want to uh uh you know you see what the Old Testament says about Abraham right he laughed at God he gave his wife away away gave her away twice tried to and how God preserved Abraham and his seed but now remember Galatians says the promise is not to the seed singular the seed one I mean the seed as of many which was the seeds of Abraham the natural seed the natural genetics of of Abraham we're going to read tonight in Romans 4 and in Galatians where Paul picks up the spiritual part of that that you and I need to look at if you and I were an observer of Abraham and Abram of course if you were an observer of of Abram you probably would not have understood his journey by just looking at Abram because you know Abram had lot with him and lot was always a thorn in the flesh for him a little bit but we're going to find out too that lot was a righteous man oh yeah we're going to find out too that even though ishma was the wrong son God blessed him right so see it's not all that that that uh uh doesn't seem on the surface a lot of things that that we look at but but we want to kind of broaden our scope a little bit of Abram and Abraham but let's read this first in First Corinthians because I believe if we'll if we'll see this excuse me then we will then we'll see what the pretense of Paul's writings in the New Testament will give us because you can't take everything and make it an example of Christianity that happened in the Old Testament right but in First Corinthians let's pray before we get started dear heavenly father we come to you tonight Lord with Humble Hearts and and open ears Lord that you may speak to us Lord what we need in this end time yes Father we pray that you would just consecrate us now Lord just take care of us bless us yes be with us Lord be with the con conation Lord may you not be Lord a bystander but be an active participant and Lord may you come down and and be Lord one that opens the eyes and one that opens the ears and the one that does the speaking Lord be the one that that looks Through The Eyes of Faith as Abraham did Lord looking at the promise looking at a city Lord who Builder maker was God but not being able to complete that Lord It's given to us in the end time to complete that mission Lord we pray that You' just be with the sick among us father you said you sent your word and healed us Lord and delivered us from our destruction Lord and as the word Goes Forth father we ask that many times we we see that you've just come down and healed us father and touched us and Lord what greater healing Lord would be than the healing of our soul that Lord some of them that are sin sick father that that don't have you Lord that that don't have that promise Lord we pray now that you would just fill them with the Holy Spirit Lord that we'll be able to understand you tonight Lord be able to understand what you're saying to his father you said Lord that you would be with us you said you'd leave us and never forsake us we depend on that Lord we depend on you today Lord in Jesus name amen amen First Corinthians chap 10: 11 now all these things wow all these things it's talking about Moses but all these things what the old things in the Old Testament happened unto them for example and they are written for would you like to say that for me they were written for our kind of makes it personal doesn't it right upon whom the ends of the world are come that's um you and I if you don't realize we're in the end time now let's go to Genesis oh you may be seated I want I want you to see that that even Paul was looking let's go back to for the sake of the ones that that are that haven't didn't come on Sunday or or was out or sick or or for whatever reason I want you to realize one thing that God is not a respector of person amen amen God did not pick Abram over anybody else he had to give everybody an opportunity Glory during that time of Abram I'm like brother Dale I believe God spoke to many people right now the only one that it did any good was the one that took it and held it like Mary did in her heart and held it and continued on what did the brother Rand say that the reason that God gave Abraham the promise was he knew that Abraham would take what he was told amen and give it to the future generation all right he wouldn't be a selfish person and keep all this for itself but now I don't believe Abram just comes up one day and Abram says I'm going to walk through justification Abram didn't know anything about justification Abram didn't know anything about sanctification Abraham didn't know anything about the new birth but there's one thing Abraham and Abram knew that they walked through life they walked a journey amen right through life not knowing maybe that you and I that he was going to be an example right I don't think he got up every morning and said well boy and when two 10,000 or 5,000 years from now when these people get on the earth no he just walked with God right all right now I want you to keep this in the back of your mind now this is kind of strange that I was going to use brother Chris for an example cuz he usually doesn't come on Wednesday nights and he's here he told me today he said I'm coming I said oh well okay but I didn't say anymore but you know look at Abram and I'm going to use brother Chris in this journey I may not use him all cuz cuz you know he may not be all the way through that Journey but you know there was this man named Elijah one time the Bible just said Elijah with a Tish bite there was no genealogy there was no great mom and daddy there was no great life before all of a sudden Elijah appears in the Bible right now Abram had a genealogy from sham but here Abram comes up one day and he disappears yeah God said get up and leave right and I was thinking about that after I finished the service Sunday that you know you see brother Chris and I told him when he got finished playing after that after that great um sermon that he preached for Sunday he said that's not right well it's a Ministry whether you like it or not he preached his first sermon last Sunday you know because it was Ministry all right and he told us this week he said he wondered all the to he told us outside afterwards he had wondered why that God had given or maybe not God or why he had this gift right right what what am I doing with this gift why am I why is this this way well he proved that Sunday but all but see now look 6 months ago I told Tyler he need to stay up here today Richard's back in the back this is okay listen he said sister Gail can do it I said she can't get up and down that many times to change the camera but one day a year ago this time a year ago Chris wasn't here right Chris was just who Abram right Chris right he wasn't a brother he was just Chris yeah one day God said Chris start talking to these two guys right here for those of you that don't know brother Chris works with us with brother uh whatever his name is brother Mark and brother Donnie so you know he wasn't in the mix are you catching what I'm tell what I'm saying here we may not even finish this this what my head was killing me before service and I kind of laid down for about 30 minutes didn't write a note today so I got a few notes now but they're they consist of one sticky note so but anyway so but brother Chris wasn't here he wasn't among the Brethren sisters right when they appear why he appear right many are called right but few were chosen many in Abram's time was called even lot I believe lot was called cuz the scripture the Eternal Word said lot was just sure so lot was justified right lived in a Justified condition but he didn't go on and so ish the same way ish was blessed of God sure and we talking about that today you can be blessed and not be a Christian right so don't think ishma was blessed of God but he was blessed of God but he wasn't blessed with the promise right that's the difference right see brother our our U John dou could be blessed but brother Chris was blessed with a promise amen he accepted what God said to him am I too loud what God said to him I thank God I didn't speak this loud my head was killing me a minute ago but here's this man that appears sorry buddy I was going to use you you weren't here but you're here so right maybe he need I got a living example exactly right I got a living example but no he wasn't here and then all of a sudden now he's here why he answered a call right right he answer God spoke and he answered Abram all right justification chapter 12 now the Lord had said unto Abram get out of the country right leave your people leave what what you're doing right and now this man Abram appears and he just starts on a journey right he goes to work about 9:00 which is banking hours but you understand what I'm saying I don't want you to to to think about Abram and Abraham and think oh this great man and this great journey he was so pck pick might sound good he was so picked of God no he was ABR right right because God can't be a respector a person exactly right right right but Abram accepted and therefore that put him in a journey amen amen Danny Fon wasn't here for a while right wait they wasn't even here for a while right am man some have been here brother collie's been here some of you's been here for a long time but all of a sudden we start appearing right and when we start appearing We Begin into a journey Abram Abram Chris begins into a journey right and that Journey takes him through life and God is maybe not audibly saying Chris do this Chris do that we all have them little things in our head every once in a while do this don't do this don't do this do but you know what I think what Abram realized whoever was talking to him it was consistent right yeah right it was consistent with now remember they were uh you know the Bible says men of old Renown they didn't have they weren't under the law right the law didn't come into effect till till Moses but we're going to read when when Paul brings this all together we he will talk about the law and he'll talk about Abram and Abraham according to the flesh then he's going to bring it to Abraham according to the word of God right and Daddy was almost getting ready to preach it Sunday he read some of the same scriptures I was going to finish with so if he would have finished I wouldn't had have done this so it's his fault but Abram Abraham according to the flesh was no better than you and I exactly right according to the flesh amen he was no better than the rest of us brother Chris was No Better In the Flesh better no better than the next guy that somebody you know that you know you can just call a name Fred Tom John right but what's wrong with what's what's Chris I'm not calling him brother yet hold on Chris cuz Abram was Abram then he became Abra became Abram right there not say not to call a brother brother before he's born again but you understand what I'm saying there's a there's a there's a development of a name here right Abram was Abram Abram had problem Abram heard God but he did a lot of things on his own God told him to separate he did but he took lot with him right right so he's got problems remember we already been through this I'm kind of get get everybody caught up cuz in justification you're you're you're you're just you're new um you you like a little baby you stumble and you fall and and and then God picks you up and here you go on your journey again and man you'll hit a brick wall and and and fall backwards and think where did that come from and it's going to happen don't worry yeah but brother Chris goes into a walk of God that nobody else can walk right that's right Glory there's not one ABR that's right there's only one Donnie fall Bush right there's only one Tommy FSH right right there's only one there was only one Abram right you know Danny I got to thinking the other day I think about the our walk in life mine and yours you know how we fished and did all the things before and how that we kind of kind of hung together there for a while but then we kind of got separated cuz we did you know we were doing other things but how this is more special to me now then when me and you fished for geez we caught 300 fish one year we we fish till we fish till we fish till we fish till we fish but you know this is more special now amen right and even then right and even in Abram's Journey Abram probably did a lot of things in life that he really enjoyed and really loved but when he started with this walk here's my point when he started that walk with God he was focused right now sure his Focus may be a little out of focus right right he took lot give his life away give his wife away give um uh didn't understand really what God was talking about have we all been that way didn't understand what God was talking about so he so he went into his bond woman and had a child thought that was the promised child yeah said all that is may walk before you kind of cloudy in his in his revelation we all that way right right we all got a little clouds in our Revelation I'm trying to hurry through but Genesis 12 1314 watch now that Abram God does one thing I want you to get this tonight God does one thing for Abram He blesses him amen right even in Abram's terrible condition which we say he he he did a lot of things wrong God everywhere Abram went God blessed him right even when you come to Abram in sanctification God everywhere he went you remember he went down to pharaoh and gave his wife away what did the Bible say I read it Sunday Pharaoh just gave him half the kingdom said here here horses cattle gold silver just said here this is yours yeah I mean Pharaoh's fixing the T I mean that this guy lied to Pharaoh said this is my sister and Pharaoh's a little bit confused but you know what in God always Christians are odd right amen all of our walking life has always been odd we've always been oddballs which is fine with me that but remember and I wrote this down God blessed Abram all the way through now remember in chapter 13: 6 the land was not able to Bear Abram and lot it was they were so blessed with cattle right you understand what I'm saying God is going to bless you if you continue on your journey amen that's right exactly see I like somebody like brother Chris that comes in and and he he sits there then all of a sudden light comes on right how many people have you seen come in now look watch AEL my point is Abram didn't jump up in Genesis 15 or 12 and go Glory Glory this is it I'm not no he didn't he just got up and walked and he got the D he went down to Egypt he went to Canaan he went back to bethl he went back to Canaan he was just but he was moving amen but he was moving right he was moving he had a goal he had an objective and he was moving he was continually at least he was trying even though through all the mistakes but remember one thing God still blessed him amen God still blessed him right he was not a son of God by birth you understand that but he was a Son of God that God was taking care of at the time he was not a son of God by birth all right he wasn't a born again Christian but God was so pleased with Abram Abram cuz remember mzc met Abram right in justification right go God I don't know where they did it for you but see God had to help me through a lot of these stages sure amen that's right cuz I couldn't help myself remember that's right amen I couldn't do this on my own that's right Abram was just fling around and all of a sudden God called him but God said okay I know you're going to make it Abram that's right cuz I'm all knowing right but you just don't know you're going to make it right but when you know that you're going to make it you you're going to be solid right same way with somebody like brother Chris same way a lot of us a lot of us come in kicking and screaming right amen that's right I mean sure you come under this gospel and it's the greatest thing since since sliced bread and you think man this is this is it but you stay there and you sit there right and you continue moving amen Abram continued he moved straight on and God met him and served in community right in justification right in other words God said hey this guy I'm putting my stamp on Amen now I'm using brother Chris for an example but it's this should be all of our examples right exactly reason I'm using him as he's kind of the newest guy on the Block the newest one in you know all of us were the same way right amen but he appears among the congregation and any begins to play it begins to play the instrument hey Abram's a pretty nice guy right amen let's let him play a little bit right let's let him enter into worship a little bit right okay you mind is that okay I don't beat me tomorrow okay but you watch you watch somebody moving and honest to goodness some of you hadn't moved in 20 years I've known you for 12 in this church you got to keep moving amen you got to have a Zeal and a fire yes that's right that's beyond all fire this beyond all Zeal this beyond all uh um job is not worth it football's not worth it hunting's not worth it uh friendship's not worth it right I Think Jesus looked at him one day and said can you forsake your father your mother your sister and your brother see that's what he was telling Abram in so many words Abram walk before me and be thou perfect remember one thing when God ever says anything about you and calls your name he's going to see it through Amen brother R he's going to see it through whether you think you're going to make it through or not if he said Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect Abraham he had a purpose for that boy right he had a purpose for that man and you know what he knew he was going to make it amen now let's turn to chapter 17 and just kind of flip through real quick and for those of you that weren't here a couple Sundays ago uh Genesis 12-4 types justification chapters 15 and 16 type sanctification and now we're going to go 17- 19 we'll type in in your journey as a baptism of the Holy Ghost you said well I maybe I didn't um maybe I didn't walk exactly like this that's okay that's right I just read that it was an example an example for you to walk by some of you could have went through justification sanctification in two days one day hey the ones in the upper room how long did it take them right brother D how long did it take them in the upper room boom boom boom right one night or whatever day it was third hour of the day so it was early right they went through justification why they had the word planted in their heart amen Abram's problem was he didn't have the word pre-planted in his heart right Abram was learning like most of us should day by day by day by day right all right they they had been tutored by God himself the Lord Jesus tuted those disciples excuse me for three and 1/2 years so they had all that word on already planted they had that fireball inside of them you know what though it was laying there dormant right right amen remember what somebody yesterday how many times have you ever took a field some of you Farmers or even some of us that plant food plots how you ever looked at the field and you take you spend $200 on Roundup you just kill the whole field right turn it under and leave it there till the spring yeah now where those seeds come from right where those seeds come from you didn't put them there all kind of weed seed why you stirred up the ground the seed was already laying there you just stirred up the environment that it was in right so it can get moisture and so it can get some a little bit of sunlight so the 120 in the upper room had been tutored by God himself that word was laying there dormant the word's not dormant right but it can lay inside of you dormant amen cuz you don't know how to use it that's right Abram didn't know how to use what God was given him glory Abram didn't know how to use it till he became Abraham right then when he met MDC he met MDC as a type of the new birth where God will meet you right right tell you Secrets he said can I withhold anything from my that's right servant Abraham anything from my servant Abraham same way with you and I Brother Martin and I were talking yesterday no today was today I guess it no it was yesterday or Monday evening Listen People you ought to be able to enter into every service right if you're a born un believer right amen you're you should be able you say well I don't know understand everything that's okay but just listen to what I'm trying to say right if Jesus if Jesus said Aaron before Abraham was I am where was he noic right look to Abram Abraham I Bal albone amen he met God face to face right what Jesus was telling those people Jesus was saying before Abraham was here your father was here I was already here amen the problem they couldn't I'm going to pinch you don't jump up the problem they couldn't get was this problem right here and I'm pinching F human flesh they couldn't get that part you be a man 50 years old you was before Abraham listen what was looking at Abraham that day when he changed his name from Abram to Abraham he sat down and fed God right Glory a calf amen now the eyeballs that that mzc were using fleshly was not the same eyeballs that Jesus had everybody okay with that that was not the Flesh of Jesus standing there in MDC but it was the person of Jesus Christ amen in the form of me H it right right in the theophany amen right and the theophany is no different than the flesh form right exactly right right amen no different same form right you're not going to look any different you did 20 years when you were 20 years old when we when we go over there why because God took a picture of you remember at 20 years old that's right and he said that is the form you're going to be in remember I told you about Jesus about God God is not some old man with a can that needs to be helped around right so and I saw I pulled up a line on MDC and it showed this old man with the beard you know standing there feeding um communion to to Abram on his journey I don't believe that you know Joshua met that same guy right and Joshua must have been afraid of him it wasn't no old man standing there Joshua got his sword and said are you for us or against us in other words he may look like a pretty good adversary amen right put a little MMA on them you know I mean kind of stout right but I mean really Danny if if you're a warrior and you meet somebody that's 90 years old and they're like this you're not going to pull a sword you're just going to go over there and say hey buddy what are you doing here you're old no this guy was young right when he met that captain of the host he met a young man Glory when Abraham met God he met a young man Glory when Mary Magdalene met that same man after he had resurrected right it was a young man she thought it was a gardener right but she heard a voice amen Abram heard that man's voice he' already met him one time right amen that's why God's got to meet you in justification Glory that way you'll know who he is right exactly when he gives you the new birth right remember I told you about the new spirit there was some questions in Bible study about that now remember the the new spirit you get in Ezekiel is not it it's a work of the Holy Spirit remember justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the same Holy Spirit but brother Bram said God gives you a you Spirit at sanctification so that you can what contact him amen he said the old Spirit you had you couldn't even contact yourself or even be able to to to to stand yourself so it's not a different Spirit but it's that same Holy Spirit softening up right that old nature you got amen right cuz you know what you're not going to keep that nature right it's going to die right right you're not going to divorce it you're not going to put it away right cuz you can't marry again amen you can't marry again if you got a living husband right right that old husband must be dead right now God don't kill your soul cuz that's your soul God kills the nature of that right the old nature that you have is what's going to die right so he gives you part of the Holy Spirit that's the only way I can say it the only way my maybe ddy can make it make it better but but when God gives you the new spirit in Ezekiel that's still his Spirit right cuz what he's doing is he's coming to you real slow amen he came to Abram slow didn't he that's right right took him a few few times meeting and you you knocks in the journey before he walks up and said Abraham you're going to have a son right right I'm going to visit you I personal pronoun I going to meet you right not I'm going to send another one I'm going to meet you amen did we read that in Genesis 17 I'm going to meet you according to the time of life right exactly and you're going to have a promised son Glory God's going to do the same to you and I because if he don't come remember it's the person of Jesus Christ that comes to you at the new birth same person same MDC same Holy Ghost exactly so now here's the bombshell if that's that big word if brother if the spirit of him that dwells in you is the same spirit that talk to ABR amen that's right exactly then what's wrong with our eyes not being able to see that's right what that man was talking to Abram about amen you say well those are flesh eyeballs that your mom and daddy gave you well God looked through a set of human eyes right right and then I think he said I'm going to go away or something like that didn't he say I'm going to go away amen but didn't he say he's going to come back and not be just with you that's right I don't think we got the end part right right that's right I think we're still looking at at the Old Testament anointing where God just anoints Abram and anoints Abraham and anoint David and then he leaves that's not that's not us folks that's right man so these same flesh eyes that I have tonight by the Holy Spirit ought to be able to see and understand amen what happened when that man MDC met ABR right cuz you know what you and I are going to have to produce that one that's right that talked to Abraham that's right now we know Abraham produced I right natural a natural baby but folks that wasn't the promise son right right it was according to the flesh right but it wasn't according to the spirit amen exactly mzc was trying to say Abram you're now going to be Abraham you're going to be able to I'm going to change your condition from a sinner to a saint right right that's what he's doing to you brother amen that's what he's doing to all of us that don't have anybody that doesn't have a new birth he's changing you from a sinner to a saint because I'll promise you one thing you can't do it yourself right don't ever try to think you can do it because according to the flesh you'll fail that's right right according to the flesh Abram fell according to the flesh hold on to your seat Abraham fa right sure remember he gave his wife away amen when he was Abraham right right exactly he had the promise in his hand he could sa the child right but yet he still wanted to save this old man right here right right but God told AMC God told him Abraham didn't go in and change nothing right right he didn't go in there and say oh I'm sorry I got I'm under conviction no no no aich God met aich that night in a vision right that's right he said if you touch that woman you're as good as a dead man right that's right why because God had already made a promise that that woman is where that natural seed was going to come from amen and if he touched her that whole line was gone right that whole line was dead but you know what Abraham was probably sitting back like this right here cuz he wasn't with her cuz you know what happens when a when the king wants to take a wife go back and study Esther yeah yeah they separate them right sure they put them in a place and they wash them they put real pretty spices on them and they put a real nice pretty gown on them and they separate them from everybody that's what they did Esther cuz when the king's ready to to have a woman presented in front of him she separated so I don't think that was Abraham and Sarah back and forth going on you I don't think Sarah was was was was huling for Abraham no she was quiet right and Abraham but you know what though God preserve that line he knew so much that when Abraham did get the Revelation see God don't mind if we don't get to Revelation first first go around or even the second go around or even the third go around yeah he doesn't mind fourth going around or fifth or right he really doesn't mind right but you know what he knows you're going to get it Glory you're the one that don't amen but what did Abraham do he kept walking when when AIT come and said Abraham sir why did you do that God spoke to me in a vision right that night and said said that that that was not your sister that was your wife and he said funny thing he said God told me you going to have to pray for me yeah and you're the one that goofed up right exactly a b didn't goof up huh he was just doing what he thought was right he saw a beautiful woman that already went through the change of the body not the change of life but went through the change of the body and she was beautiful right right so he was just doing whatever a king would do but God preserved what am I trying to say all the inadequacies and and the things that we do wrong God still if he gave you a promise right he's going to preserve you that's right Glory I got names right here you see this list I'm putting these names up downstairs and some of you have told me I want you to see this some of you have told me that you weren't born again and your name's on this list cuz this is the family album of children not yet born you know if you knew how many children you was going to have you could have an album

colie Josh Dale Hannah Dale Zack Dale Matthew Dale BB Dale Katrina hanses Kendra Carline Richard hon you say what does this mean Tyler hering Jeff Lance and I'm leaving it out because of time I tried to get all of your names that had kids that means something when God called Abram's name that separated him from a group of people right now whether Abram separated from them or not he didn't he brought lot with him right but in God's eyes Abram was already beginning the separation process but he said Abram Sarah what that brought those names into God's thinking right so these names if you got any to add not friends not friends I'm talking about just immediate your blood yeah your blood okay your blood K call her name we're going to write them on the left Glory right that's right Jeremiah mcfar Jeffrey Stewart Amy Stewart here was two that that uh Joseph didn't know I had down till he saw him and I don't know what Sharon's last name is or Anna's last name but Joseph Canada's Got Two Sisters that's right Esther you've got two sisters that are not here three three sisters that are not here Deborah forgot her Danielle Dale Tom McMillan Francis Gabriel Dale Fook you can put your other brothers in there I will Timothy Dy Rebecca Atkins Junior didn't that mean anything to you when I called these names amen that's right what that do you spark something in your life exactly you know what it done it brought them to your remembrance that's right and if God made Abram a promise then he made Abraham a promise amen that's right he said your seed will possess the gates of exactly you all this is natural Isaac was natural right but he was promised amen even poor O ish the Wild Child God promised he'd make him a great nation amen I didn't put him here it was okay fine what do you think church amen ain't it time for us to do what God Said to do exactly because if we're all born again if we say we're born if you're not born again put your name on that list right I want everybody in this building Born Again sure amen I don't care if you understand the seals I don't care if you understand all this and that and the other I just want you born again amen amen I just want you to be able to be like Abraham and look mezc right in the eye and believe what that man said Glory you say well mezc remember mezc became Jesus Christ and if Jesus Christ died to come back into a group of people he didn't come back just to be an unknown visitor Amen Brother Gary your son Brent right and I got your two on the list too Julie and forgive me if I didn't add your your family because they're on there but there's probably 40 people that are just our blood K right that God maybe is waiting on you to call some names amen exactly and we're not going to make a shrine out of this but I want it to be a remembrance Glory because God in Corinthians gave those people's name Abram Abraham Jacob Isaac they're all given for examples for those of us that the end of the world's come to amen and that's us that's me and you brother Danny that's us so who's God depending on he's not dependent on Abraham anymore right he's dependent on the Seed of Abraham Glory which is what faith seed Abraham believed beyond belief Glory you say my kids Abram Abraham didn't even have anything to even look at exactly he didn't even have a physical Robbie mcferon to walk into the door and I got yours on there but he didn't but we've got physical people right we got Flesh and Blood I'm not trying to make you people feel good I want these people saved Glory I want these people full of the Holy Ghost amen I want these people like that can meet mezic not cuz Papa did right right I believe he met meaz but I got to meet meaz in my journey I got to meet him glory exactly come on people sure I wasn't going this way but I'm going this way now yeah but that same mezic is a high priest right right amen cuz everybody's got that confused about being the order of mezd it was God right it was the great healer the great Redeemer right the great all and all the Great I Am cuz Jesus even identified he said before Abraham was I am right right amen now look at Hebrews 11 and watch look what look what you don't have to go there now Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God Amen amen Abraham didn't the only problem with Abraham Abraham didn't have the new birth or he would have been able to see that that city was right there you you realize that you realize that when he met me when Abraham met mezc there was the city but there was no way that City could get inside of Abraham because it was promised for his children exactly right sure and is that promised to you sure oh you believe that oh yeah I know you do but we got to start believing it for the Bible said our children's children amen right our generation right I'm not any better than any one of you so why God pick me yeah CU I said yes a't that simple Abram said yes right ABR said okay I I'll just do what this voice is telling me to do but remember he learned that voice right and that same voice that was so consistent he finally one day when he walked up to him in a tent and he said Abraham you're going to have a child amen and buddy that brought all of his journey down to one place glory and that was under that oak tree he met the city he was looking for but see remember Abraham didn't have he had flesh eyes he had spiritual eyes enough to realize that that was somebody different but he didn't have enough spiritual eyes to realize that was the city he was looking for yeah but what did God tell him he said you are going to be a father of many nations glory and said in Galatians 3:16 not his seed as of many he told ABR he said look down at the ground look up at the stars that was his natural seed but God was telling him in a type that the faith seat of Abraham is where all this is going to come from Glory all right let's turn to galatian you love the Lord and you got to love me then I told him about in Oklahoma somebody said we were talking about something and I said well you may not love me but the Lord done cuz you know what Abram was just a regular kind of guy right he didn't uh he wasn't very talented but God blessed him glory now listen Romans chapter 4 we're not going to get you should know that when Abraham met mezd Romans CH 4:1 when when U Abraham met mecdc that was the type of the baptism of the Holy Spirit right it comes in and then Abraham circumcises himself and his whole household and that type's there and then you look and you see that the type of Isaac being the promis son and he said take thy son thy only son because remember for those of you that maybe have not heard this before God doesn't finish with you at the new birth that's right he just begins to use you amen he just begins to use you at the new Earth so then you go through justification all over again right just a higher form you go through sanctification a higher form you go through the new birth a higher form you say another not another New Birth why do you think this holy spirit's right here for though right justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost gets you in the body right amen then God starts building these virtues In You by Justified Sanctified you realizing what God's done then brother Brown said the Holy Spirit does what SEALs in these virtues not that you're sealed in the Kingdom again there's only one your birth that seals you in the kingdom of God but this in the end time this is what's required of us right brother Richard Robert this this is what's required amen he never heard that that was requirement right we laugh but most of you didn't either it's a requirement that these virtues be formed in us they don't just write the Bible just to put in verses just to fill Up's space right all right so justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost seals this in then we got to walk about talk about this guy amen you know I told you the other day and I forgot to bring it I found a quote with brother Brown your flesh has got to be born again amen your flesh has got to be born again right exactly yeah cuz the first one wasn't right right that's what we're going to talk about right here now watch this is Paul after he reads the Old Testament and he gets the revelation of what's going on all right Ro in Romans chapter 1 I told him if they wanted to put it up they could but I want you to read it in your own Bible cuz you know what you mark it up you won't forget it what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh ha found question mark for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof the glory but not before God in other words if God would have just give him everything right at the at justification what's the journey amen what's the journey right see if if for If Abraham look you can read it up here if Abraham were justified by works he hath where of the glory hey look at me yeah I did it that's where you go wrong right right the only ey I worried about is the eye when he said I'm going to visit you amen right I'm going to visit you the eye I am the personal pronoun the one that can do it because we can't for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted or imputed unto him for righteousness not to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt like they said something we owe that was owed to us no but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify right you see that th right that's an ongoing right justify the ungodly there's me did he not you oh he justified The Godly no he justifies the ungodly right his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also describeth the blessedness of man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works in other words what David's been preaching on where David said blessed is the man who God will not impute or reckon right sin all right now listen if you're truly if you truly been Justified today your sins are gone amen right exactly right amen right you're just lot was just the Bible said it vexed lot's righteous soul to be where he was at right amen the problem with lot was though lot didn't continue on with God right lot plopped down in Sodom and said this is it Abraham was continually looking for that City Glory all right well you know why that's why Abram got the promise and Abraham that's why they got the promise right blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not accute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only he's asking a question or upon the uncircumcision also but we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness right how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but uncircumcision did everybody understand that Sunday let me break that down for you just a second in other words Abraham Abram was walking through justification and sanctification uncircumcised exactly let's talk natural all right click on for a minute we're talking about flesh he was not circumcised and you and I same way right spiritually justification sanctification are works of the Holy Spirit not in you and not cutting off the excess worldly part of the flesh all right so Abraham was look he reckoned Abraham righteous when Abram got up and started walking man you saw oh no way over there he had to meat milk I know that go knows that but you don't know that right so just keep walking and somewhere he's going to meet you amen he promised How It Was Then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not circumcision now what's he what question is he answering Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness verse n how was it reckoned after he had met mezc and after he' been circumcised and after he no it says not in circumcision but in uncircum all right and he received the sign of circumcision was a seal tell what's righteous amen of the righteousness of the faith which he had exactly when he got up and started walking sister B he had Faith amen already wasn't a god started walking right you say is't that too simple yeah brother Chris is probably scratching his head wondering why is he here and what is he doing he just got up and start walking yeah got a lot of questions but you got up and started walking amen you got to where the fountain was right and he received the sign of circumcision the Seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised right that he might be the father of all of them that believe right what's he saying Abram believed from the beginning now he didn't know he's going to have a son and all that but but he promised him he said you going to be the father of many nations right now listen people then it's God's responsibility if Abram put himself in that place then it's God's responsibility to fulfill exactly not mine or yours and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only oh I'm sorry I missed it and he verse 11 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the face which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised right that righteousness might be imputed unto them or reckoned right so God knows that you're going to make it so he imputes it that's why those who he has Justified he is already amen glorified exactly doesn't that put the scripture together those who he's Justified you say baby form justification if it's true justification absolutely cuz you can't be reckoned Abraham could not be reckoned with unbelief right or he' have never had the child exactly and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham huh right if you're not born again tonight walk in the steps of your father Abraham amen hallelujah and you can put dick Addison you put that that's why God puts you around people right sure does that's why God puts you around people okay to do what to see God right to see how to act or not and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet which he had yet being uncircumcised you see that which he had yet being uncircumcised we always think well oh Abraham got the promise cuz he become Abraham and he be this right here Paul is picking it up telling you that even before Abra abam became Abraham right he had Faith amen exactly that's the only reason he got the promise Glory was that he had Faith at the beginning for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law because the law is not of Faith right but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void all you got to do is do the Ten Commandments 1 2 3 4 9:10 and you go to heaven oh yeah wrong Rich Young Ruler did it remember he said I've kept the law since my youth but he didn't have enough Faith come on people right Jesus knew one thing he could not get rid of and that was his money yeah in other words the Rich Young Ruler did not have enough Faith to say I believe what you're telling me right so I'm going to lay all this down and become one of your disciples he didn't have the faith to believe that covered the law because the law worketh what wrath right but where no law is there's no transgression right if you don't do it you don't do it that's right exactly therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed Not seeds right we'll get to that in a minute in Galatians not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all now look in parentheses as it is written I have made thee a father of many Nation right before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things what which be not as though they were who against hope Dy believed in Hope right but his hope became Faith right exactly that's right hope is not good if it stays hope right that's right but when hope becomes Faith it's solid right I hope I'm going to heaven I hope I'm going to heaven that don't sound good does it but when you know that you know that you know that's right it opens up a lot of doors right cuz you know what that's Faith who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according watch this right here to that which was spoken right not what Abram thought not even what Abraham said Abraham never come out and put his hands in his suspenders and said I'm going to be a father of many nations he didn't have a clue how he was going to be a father of many Nation did he he even tried to figure it out one time and got in trouble yeah with his handmade with his bond woman see that's why the Bond woman this guy is going to always keep you bound right but the son of the free woman is the promise amen which is by what f a i right amen where was I 19 and being not weak in faith he consider not his own body no I'm sorry according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be now who Adam I mean Abraham didn't speak that who spoke that God told Abraham that right God told you amen thank you sister Jim God told you God spoke to you you ought all said amen right amen y'all are still looking at Abraham y'all are looking back 4,000 years of what God did to some man you don't even know tonight Glory right tonight so shall thy seed be right and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead now here Paul is picking up natural cuz his body was dead come on folks he was 100 years old right he knew whether nobody else knew it or not he knew he was dead right and his lovely wife Sarah he knew she was dead and gone too cuz she was right at his age right yeah when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's wom now what's he doing being not weak in faith right he considered not in other words that didn't enter into Abraham's equation right he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief now wait a minute okay wait a minute sister Teresa didn't God didn't Abraham get on his face and laugh at God me produce a son remember Sarah got in trouble for just laughing her heart Abraham got down on the ground yeah and laughed exactly but Paul what do you say about it he staggered not hm what was what was Paul looking at I think Paul was looking at the end result right right he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory amen to God cuz you know what people there's nothing you done right to God be the glory cuz it ain't none of yours and it ain't none of mine that's right and being fully persuaded in other words he convinced himself that God was right fully persuaded now what is persuasion he had to lean to his own carnal I can't do it in the flesh yeah but he was fully persuaded what God you said I was going to have it right now God didn't beg and plead with him right cuz see that's the difference in Abraham and lot Abraham just believed it lot was like well maybe I'll just take this part of the land over here and you know you you can have all this over here and I'll go down here toward Sodom cuz it looks like a better place you see what I'm saying you watch look Read that read that about Abram and Abraham read how focused he was really you say well he was no he was moving he was looking for something cuz we're going to read it in just minute if we have time that he was looking for a city yeah now that was never written in the Old Testament right right it never was written pinned in the Old Testament Abraham was looking for a city now why do we get in Hebrews 11 and see the father of our faith looking for a city right being fully persuaded that what he had promised who that's not that he is not Abraham right that's right and that he is not able to perform that's not Abraham right that's God glory and therefore it was what reckoned to him for righteousness right now it was not written for his sake alone thank God that it was imputed to him right but for who us one more time for who us us also to whom it shall be what imputed here we go we say all this Abraham this great person there was this great person Paul's making it very personal here for us also to whom it shall be imputed what righteousness right if brother dick there's your big word if right we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for what raised again right again yeah you reckon that may be talking about us right Glory cuz he was raised one time right 2,000 years ago that says again amen for our thank you sister Anna she said for our for our justification right what to whom the ends of the world has coming if I can put Corinthians in with that right now let's go to Galatians just for a few minutes everything is it okay it's 8:30 we're all right cuz I love in Galatians what he said watch this excuse me Galatians 4 we'll read Galatians 3 in just a minute we're going to read verse 30 and 31 don't put it up there brother oh you can boy Brother Anderson he's a good kid just R you need to keep him he's good good guy see there's another one who's this Anderson big tall guy he just walks into our life amen glory brother dick when you first came to church here you were the song leader the guitar player the head musician the the third string fiddle and the fourth string guitar player in the banjo and the piano player point I'm trying to make when brother dick first got here he was about it right the stage was empty full now is it right with some absolute just wonderful amen and brother dick listen brother Dick had to do all the song leading if he was sick he still had to do all the song leading now if he don't feel good got Richard Marlo now where'd he come from that boy too I'm coming to that okay and then you know when I started coming to church there was a a dark headed guy that that that married the little girl I Used to Know call D it and Son of a going if he didn't start leaving thing now brother dick can almost not even be here do you understand what I'm saying yeah watch how God does God puts people in place you know why I put them names on there number two number one cuz I want to see the Soul saved number two if this thing goes another 10 years a lot of you going to be dead and I could die tomorrow but some of you that are in your 70s are going to be in your 80s we need young people right amen if there is going to be another generation who do you raise up right brother dickon be no another generation no there won't be another generation but if brother dick can't get do it anymore Richard's a little bit younger than brother dick not much you understand you see what I'm saying watch how God's program works we didn't hardly have nobody qualified for a deacon you had brother collie that was here and brother Dy some of the others now we got a church full amen why cuz you somebody believed the promise amen right that's right so the Next Generation if we have another 10 or 15 years those people's names that I called a lot of them are in their teens and their 20s we're going to need them to do things that maybe some of us old people forget to do exactly and that's the truth people right nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be a with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of bond of the Bond woman but of the free now just for a second the Bond woman produced a son but now when it comes to the promise when it comes to God telling Abraham to take his son his only son right now folks naturally he had more than one son right B woman right right here this is binding us right now Glory exactly but if you stay on that God's going to bless you cuz you blessed ishma he blessed Hagar remember Hagar went out under the tree and and S must just read it but she sits down and and Abraham gives her some water and gives her some bread and she's out right God God the Bible said God comes to that woman and hears her cry that's right exactly and takes care of that woman right opens up a well for see you're going to be blessed even the bond woman's blessed but that wasn't the prom son folks we want the promised son right we don't want to be bound I don't even like that word bond bound I like free amen shall not be a remember when he got to one place when he got to one place what did God have to do though Abraham said Hagar you take ish and you leave right because Isaac was the promised son he didn't want those two mixing and mingling right right exactly this is going to be a wild child as long as we let it be one right but that free woman is inside here the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what's supposed to set us free right right so will not be air cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bor woman but of the free now let's go to Galatians 3 back up when it we be finish right there I like somebody you know when when when brother Dale or any of you Brothers brother de used to do a lot and brother colie used to do a lot he would just take scripture and just go right down through and explain you know what I forget a lot but God let me be able to write these things down in my Bible right so that I can uh remember now look go to Galatians 3 verse 6 let's go to go to verse six just just scroll up to verse six Brother Anderson 1-5 is okay but look this is this is where he's getting to Abraham even as Abraham believed God it was a counted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham exactly and the scripture look foreseeing for knowing for knowledge that God would justify Richard Roberts and Richard htis he's not here but that's okay and I can't remember Richard Marlo's last name and Richard Marlo that word heathen I told you many times when I first came back to Lord sister Teresa I the Lord showed me one thing Abraham's not going to do me any good right unless I walk the steps of Abraham but as long as I leave Abraham in there that really is not going to do me any good but if I put way Dale's name in there right and I know folks I was a heathen so were you right so and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen right through what faith right preached before the gospel preached preached that's the first time that's ever been brought up God talked to Abraham God talked to ABR no God preached to Abraham right God preached to Abram preached before the gospel un Abraham saying in the shall All Nations be blessed right so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are the works of the law are under the curse now what a minute whoa verse 10 hold on a second here what does that say for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse what is the curse death the law is death right righten for as many as under the works and I wrote in my Bible of the law or under and I underline the curse and I wrote Death for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth see that th can be mean bad things too yeah that continueth not in all things what which are written in the book of the law to do them right but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident right for the just shall live by faith Amen in other words what that's what that's what Luther saw that the keeping of the law or the keeping of the Roman Catholic law was not going to justify he just going to condemn you cuz Luther tried to do Penance he tried to do the things the Catholic Church said but one day God said hey read verse 11 yeah the just shall not live by works right the just shall live by faith Glory not by works L any man should boast the law is not a faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them amen in other words you were doing okay to do the law but was it faith it was just doing what somebody wrote down on a piece of paper right but look verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the death of the law right being made death for us I'm not changing the scripture all right I'm not adding to or taking from right anybody understand where I'm getting that from amen curse is the death death is a curse right right if you don't know that just keep getting older you'll understand for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree which we know Jesus was that the blessings of Abraham what the J live by faith right that was the blessings of Abraham he saith not no wait a minute that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith right in other words what to meet MDC and bring forth the promise right that's what we're supposed to do amen bring forth the the promised son it wasn't it just Abraham brought Isaac I hope you're I hope you're trying to brother Bron preached taking God out of History amen take all these people out of History right exactly get them out of History right I thought the B said these were given for examples Amen to whom the ends of the world will come upon which is you and I Glory Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed now how did God confirm the Covenant with Abraham circumcision amen yet if it be confirmed no man diseth or adth theto right now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many stop not natural right not the same you know he told Abraham he said look down and see the sand look up and see the stars he didn't say as two seeds as of many right but as of one Glory Genesis 1 26 and 27 amen that's the man that he talking about that God want him keep sin to cuz God can impute sin to me and you but he can't he cannot impute sin to himself right and to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he said Not seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after what after Abraham remember he promised him that his seed was soj for 400 years and they went ahead in 430 years God gave him Grace down in in Egypt remember and then Moses come along I'm just trying to catch sh up with that right the Covenant that was conf confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after in other words boy you going to hate this that promise that God made to Abraham doesn't matter what the law said on a piece of paper right you're not going to disan the promise that God made to Abraham exactly amen the law didn't come to change the promise exactly that's right right am that's what he's saying right here the law which was 430 years after God met Abraham and said you're going to have this promised seed cannot disan that it should make the promise of none effect exactly people thought well now we're going to start doing the law but see watch what they did when Jesus came when they met MDC again they were the this is my point they were the natural Seed of Abraham amen right you keep them creases between your eyes and you going to get little old brother Mark talks to you and he but really that's what they were the Pharisees and Sadducees that was looking at MDC again they said we be of the Seed of Abraham amen now I'm telling you people don't let that happen in the end time yeah cuz it will they looked at MDC again but they were not of the faith seed of Abra right they were of the natural exactly can't deny that they show you their lineage all the way back natural but they were not of the spiritual Beed because Jesus told them said you of your father not of Abraham but of the devil for if the inheritance be of the law see that's what the Pharisees and sagues they thought they were going to get the inheritance and would have and did before Jesus came but when Jesus came it didn't anull it he just actually brought that promise In the Flesh amen the one that should have come not Isaac right but Jesus Christ for if the inheritance be of the law it's no more promise right dos and don'ts cut your hair don't cut your hair wear pants don't wear pants come to church don't come to church if it be just by that then it's not the promise anymore right exactly but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law question mark it was added because of the transgressions of men let me add that in there just to make you realize that's what he did he added that transgression because of our sins right till what amen till the 120 in the upper room came came to who the promise was made amen some of you smileing I'm not changing the word but that's what that's where the promise began that's where the real promise began right wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of our transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by Angels now Angels can't give you the promise but it was ordained by little angels right ministers right in the hands of a mediator now mediator is not the mediator of one not a pope Pope's not the mediator between God and man we know who that was now the mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one is the law then against the promise of God God forbid if you don't do the things you're supposed to do you don't have the promise right but if you do do the things you're supposed to do you have the promise and you have your Justified watch is the law then against the promise of God God forbid other words like d said God forbid man that you think that this law was just for nothing right it's all this Old Testament exactly but that's what they had as an example or foundation for you and I cuz let me just be real honest when milasan met Abraham sure he was talking to him in a twofold manner one you're going to have a natural son you going to have but all these seeds are going to be yours but he was not speaking of seeds as of many right Paul picked that up MDC was talking about you and I exactly cuz he had us on his mind amen you Lord we were there with him glory you said oh brother Brown said we were there in the shores of Galilee absolutely but you know what we were there talking to Abraham too right sister Gil you were there not you the person I'm looking at but if you have the Holy Spirit that same Holy Ghost right that's in you tonight had to be or it's a different person right right then this whole thing's a lie come on people this whole thing is a lie if the Holy Ghost you have in you tonight wasn't standing in front of Abraham talking just like I'm talking now cuz how do you think we get it it com through the priesthood still right but not a levitical priesthood anymore not a priesthood of lineage anymore right but Jesus is the high priest and he speaks it to us and we speak it to you amen problem is sometimes we get our own speaking involved it's a law then against the promise of God God forbid if there had been a law given which could have given life in other words if the Ten Commandments is all we had and it was just in 10 pages and that's all we had in the Bible if it could have given life then he would have never should have never talked to Abraham right barely righteousness should have been by the law right but the scripture have concluded now wait a minute Paul you said we're righteous you said we're just ain't that what he just said in all scriptures before but the scripture have concluded what the law all understand right that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that that's amen believe amen that's it now let's go to Hebrews 11 read that we'll be finished let's read what Paul said the great faith chapter listen to our now remember see Abraham's not our Father by anything except Faith amen Hebrews 11:8 you guys can put it up if you want to that's okay but we read it in our Bible by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after to receive for an inheritance I underlined that word twice obeyed yeah obedience and he went out not knowing whther he went right by faith he so sojourn in the land of promise see he was in that land the whole time right he was in the land the whole time he just didn't realize it amen you're in the workings of the new birth all the time right you just don't realize it yet right oh if we could just see that I wish I could open up the head and pour it in myself too by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and the sand which is by the seashore innumerable now listen to this verse 13 look at that right there look up on the board these all died right in faith not having received amen exactly not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off right and were persuaded by them when that word them that's the promises yeah and were persuaded of them and embrac them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they all died in faith not having received right the promises right so it must have been for another generation right must have been for another people verse 14 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now verse 16 but now they desire a better country amen that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city Glory by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it is said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from when also he received him in a figure that's right what he received the figure of the promise amen but Isaac was not the promise Jesus Christ was the promised SE amen but now let's not do away with you and I because by faith they never received the promise right that's right Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph they never received the promise all they lived in such Glory they lived in such Splendor they lived in a world that maybe sometimes you and I would would like to live in where God would just rain down all kind of blessings but they never received what they were looking for what about you and I right amen I leave that with you today by Faith by faith they believed by Faith by faith they believed it said by faith but they did not receive the promise because who was the promise given to not to seeds as of many that's right and Paul picked it up and said it was Christ in you amen the hope of glory right MDC was not talking to physical Abraham he was talking to me and you glory amen he was talking to me and you that's right cuz remember Abraham was The Promise by faith we're the faith Seed of Abraham but Abraham was not our savior right Abraham couldn't redeem us now through the same faith that Abraham had we could go toward that promise right but if we just had the faith of Abraham it said right there we couldn't receive the promise right yeah in other words what are you trying to say our faith and hope is built on nothing left Glory but Jesus blood and right Glory right all the songs sing in one person not Abraham right but through faith right we got the promise Glory if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight let's stand you got the promise you've got what MDC wanted Abraham to have but Abraham could not have it right in the condition that he was in right you say oh he's great yeah yeah the great father of our faith right but the promise had to not of the law or anything that Abraham or Abram did but it was speaking of Jesus Christ The Promised right and Abraham can't do anything to this group of people right here right this group of people right here can only be saved by Jesus Christ Glory can't be saved by D giby way Dale I wished I could Glory I wished I could but I can't but if you're ashamed to put your kids on this list I'm ashamed of you yeah okay but this list is going to stay with me brother Joe's got a copy of it if you want to add now listen I'm not talking about friends we all love our friends I want my friends to be saved too but I want my blood my family right family that's where my genetics natural are and Jesus you know the Bible says you'd be there with your offsprings and that was The Offspring Francis came from you and you and her you can't deny that right right right so we believe she's going where we going amen exactly I know you do but you know what Abraham walked 25 years before Isaac's name was added to this or was taken off of this list right amen until the you understand until the promis son came right Abraham and Abram walked 25 years calling these names you sure he didn't know Isaac's name you're not getting the point God made him a promise amen that's right of a promised seed a promised child that would carry on his genetics Glory now we're not talking about natural genetics natural genetics got us nowhere that's right even coming from Abra I mean coming from Adam his natural genetics I was reading it the other day brother R said Adam's seed natural polluted this whole world sure now how could that one seed do anything to save anybody if it killed the whole human race but we got to get away from that natural seed right and it wasn't coming from the loins of Abraham it's the faith Seed of Abraham now coming from the spoken word amen this right here spoken seed word this Jesus said plainly this is the seed that the SE went to seow he SED the word that's what we got to do get these people here it's not going to take a miracle it's just going to take believing the word amen Abraham and Sarah they they it wasn't a miracle they had that baby cuz you know what God told him he was going to and you know what he changed their body back so they could Glory Abraham and Sarah there's no way they could develop and have this right here Isaac no way brother Chris but they believed what God that's right and It produced this right let's bow oure dear heavenly father Lord we love you and we thank you that you've given us even an opportunity to stand before these people that you in the form of MDC looked at Abraham one time several thousand years ago go and said I'm going to have a promised group of people not seeds as of many of natural genetics but of a spiritual genealogy yes they come down through there in the Old Testament and was hidden in the law but father the law couldn't save anybody It could only push sin away but oh God you promised that you would come yourself with no natural genealogy on this Earth no Abraham as your natural father or Moses or anybody that was great father you came through the womb of a virgin you created the egg and The Germ and placed it in Mary and came onto the Earth Lord as a child and lived went through trials and troubles and heartaches and growth of life and suffered Lord and then you became a man and father you started sewing the word into the Earth you started speaking the gospel that was before the foundation of the world written and what MDC was trying to give to Abraham father you gave in a little man named Jesus Glory the only time your beautiful name was spoken is when you came on this Earth yes the name of Jesus Christ Glory that where all man was waiting and even you father was waiting for a time that you could fulfill that Genesis 3:15 that you would come through the womb of a virgin father with no natural genealogy to look back on to say it was great or or what more but Lord when you came on Earth they branded you as illegitimate and all these other things Lord being made from the purest birth that could ever be made in the world they called you the lowest name they could call you but father that didn't bother you you were still looking at a promise that you made that through the seat of the woman you would bring all this back yes and then you met a man named Abraham gave him the promise and then here you come down and fulfill that promise so that people like the names I called that have not come yet Lord and the ones that are here Lord that are that are called and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord that you can call us your children yes the very children that you wanted on the earth before there was all this chaos father you went on the cross with us on your mind and a list of names were stared before the foundation of the world Lord and then you came here to be crucified but that crucifixion didn't stop anything Lord you had a promise that it would be a seed that would come on the earth in the end time all down Through the Ages have been many brides and many things Lord but down here at the end we're promised to be set free yes and you told us Lord that if we would have the faith of Abraham that the promise will be given to each and every one of us and Lord you know in my heart a few weeks ago Lord I started calling these names Lord I know you don't get deaf to them that you hear every one of them father I pray Lord that you would as you promised several years ago Lord that that many of these names some of them would would be back yes Lord and you promise Lord that many more would come back to you father I pray now Lord that our focus and our aim and our goal is to serve you father and serving you is the serve others and serving others is to tell them about this great gospel Lord not so much that that this great prophet came in the end time or we know that comes with it but Lord let's just tell the world about you Lord Jesus Christ the savior of the world and tell them how you came and we'll tell them how you came and how you came back and said you promised that you would not only be with us but you'd be in US and that Lord that you promised that we'd be flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone and father this great holy spirit that you've given us Lord in the end time is now able to look into this word to look into the prophet's message and see things that Abraham would have loved to see Isaac would have loved to seen David all those Old Testament prophets even John the Baptist even some of the ones back there Lord would love to see this day and father don't let us take it lightly then from now on that they all the whole Bible is pointing toward this bride at the end time the promises are to be fulfilled in her and we're to be a part of it Lord but we pray that you would just now bring our families in Lord yes great yes Lord we love you father thank you for giving us the burden for these Souls thank you for giving us the burden Lord to preach your gospel and Lord to just give up oursel to you Lord may we do it more may we all give up everything of ourself that we'll not have our own righteousness Paul said with just filthy rags but to have the righteousness of Jesus Christ Grant it Lord yes in the calmness now of the Holy Spirit I pray that you would just go to these people on this list you know who they are Lord and the ones that now in the congregation I'm sure that they're they're calling the names and they're in their memory Lord that their family members Lord that are lost and need salvation that you would Lord in the sweetness of your Holy Spirit go to them Lord and just prick their hearts as you did on the day of Pentecost and that they would come back and say men and Brethren what can we do to have this great salvation Lord we'll just tell them to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the promise will be to them that was the promise that Abraham was looking for Lord we love you we Praise Your Great Name thank you for a church group Lord thank you for the people that you've gathered together in your name father now we pray that you'd go with us Lord in the furtherment of this service that we sing the songs to you Lord and to no one else that our love will be focused toward you father and no one else that our that our desires will be for you father glory and nothing else bless us now Lord Keep keep us safe we know the devil is going to try everything he can to stop a son and daughter of God from being born but father greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world that's we need to start believing that we need to realize that you've already spoken it and there will be a bride there will be a people that will stand and resist the Ws of the devil but it won't be of our own Works father but it'll be you inside of us because we've taken the promise and held it by one word and that's faith we believe you Lord thank you for the blessings thank you for the ones that are coming Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen you believe amen this is it right here amen I want these people saved filled with the Holy Ghost glory

said well why should I do that now he prays he said Lord fill him with the Holy Ghost and then bless him right he said fill him with the Holy Ghost and then bless him he said cuz I don't want him to have no blessing till they get the Holy Ghost I don't want them I want their water to be stirred so bad till they think a tsunami would not would be like would be a whirl pool in the bathroom compared to uh to that but you know what one day God came and stirred your water amen and he made it so miserable for you till you had to have something different right I did that was me I had to have

sitting over and we we prayed before he went just said a prayer and asked the lord to take it away and you know had to kill the little insect but we that's the way it works when they sting you and uh he uh got over there and he set for a few minutes and about 15 or 20 minutes and finally just said you know nothing's happening this thing has gone away i believe it but it stops from happening and

can do all things we just love him and appreciate him so much and i sure appreciate y'all it's your beautiful bunch of people to preach to make it easy you know you've got to come with a desire in your heart you know prophet god told us we'll only get what we expect you know so we can't blame it on jesus when we don't get what we want because we didn't become not expecting anything then don't be disappointed if you don't i mean because the master he don't force nothing on us i'm thankful he don't do that he don't he don't make us do anything that's why he put us under a free moral agency he don't we don't serve him through fear and they serve him through love all right i'm thankful for that love that you get for us could you turn with me into the book of leviticus chapter 27 i'd like to read a few verses of scripture probably one through 10 i try not to be too long this afternoon but we surely want to let god have in his way you know you want him to get all the glory and all the honor glory all respect every thing to him and moses spake and the lord speaking to moses saying speaking to the children of israel and saying to them when a man shall make a single vow the person shall be for the lord by thy estimation and the estimation and thy estimation shall be of the male from 20 years old even to 60 years old even thy estimation shall be 50 shekels of silver after the shackle of the sanctuary and if it be a female then the estimation shall be 30 shekels and if it be from 5 years old even to 20 years old then thy estimation shall be of the male 20 shekels and for the female 10 shekels and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver and if it be from 60 years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be 15 shekels and for the female 10 shackles but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vow shall the priests value him and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord and all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy but he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for good and if he shall at all change beasts for beasts then it shall be the exchange thereof shall be holy let us pray father we pray this afternoon that you would come once again father and minister to us father i pray that you would sanctify our minds sanctify our spirits father and father may you find a welcoming heart here this afternoon god for father you only go where you're invited and father we want to go beyond an invitation to your father lord the church next door father they invited you but father we want to make you welcome lord father we want to wash your feet father we want to anoint your head father we want to put the robe on your father father we want you to be the main one here father that receives all the glory and honor father we want to see you high and lifted up father father which is the song says would you open the eyes of our heart that father as you did that day father when moses and elijah stood there and they was talking to your father peter and james and john was observing father you speaking to him father the cloud covered father but father when the smoke cleared there was no one left but jesus father that's where we're looking to this morning open this afternoon oh god father we're looking to you lord for inspiration father we're looking for you to do everything father this afternoon lord father your children have come long ways traveled lord not to hear from a man lord but father would you meet him father will you come now lord father and anoint me father with your word lord not me with your spirit father would you take my lips lord and speak to him father father they're hungry lord father i realize within myself i can do nothing lord father no ability within man but just to read the word lord but oh god would you send the angel now father the divine interpreter of the word the holy ghost and step into this man lord and father speak to your children father and may as this service is over with lord father will they i want them to have this testimony lord as the children on the road to emmaus walk father and they begin to talk and they begin to think on you and they begin to say these things father and here you appeared lord father we talked about you after the service father we we we've done everything we could father we prayed we asked your father but then you appeared lord will you appear to us this afternoon lord and father after everything is said and done father give them this testimony will you lord for your glory did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way lord speak to us this afternoon lord father we'll be so clear quick to listen father and respond father for father we just don't want to be hearers of the word but we want to be doers lord and father the only way we can do your word lord is we have to become your word lord and father we want to become your word father we d we want to leave better christians father grant it to us lord meet the needs of your children father continue to give them strength father touch brother dale for his labor here in this vineyard lord father may your father bring forth great fruit for your kingdom father lord may they see you see be so pleased father that the work father you've allowed used this brother to do lord may there be a great trophy in your crown lord may there be jewels in the crown of jesus lord father way we become jewels lord father we thank you and we love you for your grace lord touch his wife lord brother dylan father meet that need father just having served you like myself but oh god you're a healer we've seen your power this morning lord man couldn't hardly speak yesterday fallen sick but oh god when jesus came no sickness can stand before you lord thank you for that transfusion of the blood lord father we thank you this afternoon that have your willing way for we ask you in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may receive it i'd like you to talk a little bit about this afternoon the value of the blood amen you realize that the blood is so valuable to us we look without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin you know a lot of people say you know a lot of times they say that maybe you know we don't we don't need we've gone beyond the blood we don't need the blood but i'm here to tell you this afternoon it's so precious to us for without that blood there'd be no remission of sin and without that blood there'd be no life come back on the believer right for the blood didn't have any value then why wouldn't the blood of bulls and goats work that wouldn't all it did was just to cover it oh my when jesus came right when he came and gave that supreme sacrifice on calvary when he shed that precious blood he had a purpose in his life he come to shed that blood into his very life the very life would come right upon the believer that me and you once again could be reconciled back together with christ to thank that the prophet god said here's jesus and he took the hand of god and took the hand of man and put him back together that is how valuable it is to us this afternoon that's how wonderful that blood is to us i know that we've been saying the prophet said we went went beyond the blood but he was talking about the the lift that the lat the blood itself not that not the life or nothing to do with the blood but we're going to the whole going on into the holy ghost the life in the blood but we're so thankful for that shedding that shedding to think that he the king of kings the lord of lords would estimate me and you more valuable than his very own life i mean it's a paradox to think that the the king of glory would come down step into a human body and live the life of a man because in his heart in his desire he wanted to become kinsmen he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer he wanted to be all those attributes and the only way he could redeem mankind because of the fall in the garden is he had to come down and become near kinsmen amen he become brothers to us he become blessed brothers to us he becomes took on the blood of man the blood of god in a man come down into a human form and loved us so much that he would take all that the theme of leaving his glory to come down here to be spilled to have his beard plucked out to be malt to be made fun of and we we see that he was so so intact with his desires his will to please the father and fulfill the scriptures but it didn't stop him he didn't have no guile found in his mouth you could find nothing wrong with what he said how he conducted himself how he moved as a human being how he lived and he comes with such a great testimony to us right that he would show us that he's not by might amen not by power but it's by his spirit amen and we see with that spirit he showed us how we can take this word my brother and sister take this word and defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime that's right he could tell he had the devil and this afternoon we have the devil's answer we have the answer to the devil when he tells us this and he uses scripture on us so many times but we have the ability to say satan it's also written more right it's also written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god i'm thankful this afternoon for that i'd like to look at just for a moment the estimation what do we estimate our savior at tonight what do we estimate this message at what value have we put on it what how much does it mean to us does it really mean as much to us as we say we do right is it more mean more to you than your very life your wife your brothers your sister your children your pastor is it that valuable to you oh it's more valuable to us than anything in this world for the true value that was placed was on the lost souls right jesus because everything else is going to pass away he become the word made flesh for he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she said i want little little messiahs little word bodies of mine you know we don't realize how valuable we are to each other right for paul talks about when one member of the body suffers the whole body suffers you'd never think a big toe would humble somebody so much you don't understand how valuable that toe is how valuable you need that thing a lot of times we'll say well you know this brother's weak and he went off and he done these things he's backslidden he couldn't you know a lot of times they'll say well he went out from us because he was not elvis but we have to be careful right maybe it's just overtaking it a fault right you know a lot of times we don't value our brothers and sisters it's a value we should value right our lord valued us and more valuable than our very own life right when we realize when one part of the body suffers the whole body pays for it right when my toe begins to start giving me so much trouble i never realized that my toe could affect my whole body but once it got infected right it started affecting the bloodstream you know when there's an infection in the church and it gets in the bloodstream it affects every member of the church shut it let one part of the body start to have infection in it and see where the whole body responds to it you don't think right you don't have right pain changes people suffering changes people either it builds character in us oh yeah oh it shows what we really made pressure shows what we have let's look at this word estimation for just for a few moments the estimation is to form or to give an approximate opinion or calculation in his mind the great mighty god thought of me in you as he hung on that cross he knew there was no way back for man ever to come back and to be in full fellowship with god again right that's why they went into a place he had to prepare for him before the blood was called paradise and even the witch of endor could communicate with him still through man or through a gift could it be communicated with right but we see that when the blood come there's no more communication for the unbeliever to communicate with the believer i'm so thankful that he separated me and you from that place right he gave it an approximate opinion of me and you even though he was dead in sins and trespasses this bad shape is or some of us might have been in he valued you more than his own life when he walked down that crawl when he walked down walked down that hill del gotham i like what a buddy of mine sings you know he said he traveled the last mile on his knees you know what's wrong with us brothers and sisters we ain't traveled long enough on our knees god give me this trick the cow this last mile of the journey on my knees turn my cross carry my cross up the hill to down right you know that's what we need we need to kill him even through all the pain and the suffering and the agony that he went through amen it never stopped him he cried so much for me and you in the garden of gethsemane that his own tears became blood right his sweat became blood you talk about agonizing for his children what about me and you when our brothers and sisters have need we'll never maybe get to that place to do those things but we can we can sign and cry what about he said he's sending an angel to mark those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in this city what about your neighbor that you live aside and he's in trouble and he needs help you know what we're writing there'll be a time attempt that we'll pray for and they'll get rain where's the mercy see that right send the bride amen i'm glad he lives on the heart of man it's a primary opinion or statement of an approximate cost for a certain thing i can i cannot even ima i can't even comprehend in the natural mind the value that he placed on me in you yeah the value that the king of heaven would place that kind of value on me and you never love me and you more than anything even his very own life we look at romans 3 verse 23-26 he says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god being freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and a justifier of him which believeth in jesus oh my i'm so thankful that he even gave us the faith to believe in him right you could go out and ask anybody do you believe in god they'd say yes problem you could ask a drunkard do you believe in god do you believe jesus christ yes i do but it's a different kind right i believe it's the faith of god believing in god's word he give us this faith right and then he's going to reward me and you for accepting it it's a paradox brother dale the thing that he'll give you he has given us these things he's going to reward him just because we accepted him and we believed him you didn't have to work for it you didn't have to slave what you had to put in so many hours you didn't have to do anything you freely give he said free life give unto you freely you give unto others you know it's already the cost has already been paid for i like what paul said in hebrews 9 14 through 22. he said how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god you know i had a pastor in this message tell me one time brother there he said that jesus was not the perfect sacrifice and then i began to wonder if he really was in this message because if he wasn't that perfect sacrifice then we're all right amen because he had to be accepted right well there was no acceptance of god for me in you and you know you begin to wonder those things it's just the way people you know it's not it's a spirit's all it is it's not the man it's not the person and i said thank you lord for letting me see that glory he said how much more shall the blood of christ who threw the eternal spirit over himself without spot to god purge your conscience we needed it because look at when the blood of bulls and goats was applied they went right back out and done the same old scene every year they come back and offered it for the same things they was doing but this flight this power this spirit that come back has purged us purged our conscience from dead works to serve a living god amen right when we was out in the world we served everything we served sports stars we made islands out of them we served this we served that brother said we was nothing but a bunch of healers we walked around with a club on our back right we worshiped everything i like what the great apostle paul said when he was over there he walked up seeing that inscription to the unknown god amen boy you talk about revelation he said let me tell you who he is i'm glad that it takes revelation to be able to say those things and to be able to witness to people about who god really is that's right they still brushing him up in three pieces the denominational world even when he get down to the jesus only still got him in a box right they don't understand that he he is omnipotent omnipresent he is everywhere but we see that it comes through revelation he said and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament right meaning you needed a mediator we needed somebody to stand in mine in your corner we needed an attorney right we was guilty we deserved hell but this great mediator of the new testament by the means of death for the redemption of transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there are also a necessity be the death of the testator amen the death that blows him and goats wouldn't do it brother aaron right right he said for the for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is it is of no strength at all while the testator lived he had to die he had to show us that he was willing to give his life right oh you we can't help but love him look at the price he has paid for us he says for the testament for testament is a force after the men are dead otherwise it is no strength at all while the testator lived whereupon neither the first testament was decided was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hiss and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god has enjoyed unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law of purge with blood and without shedding of blood he's no remission right i am so thankful for that that he was willing to pray the supreme price for me and you right you know when i first heard the prophet said that there was a more near kismet redeemer than god it kind of being a young christian i'm like wow how could that be from god created all things and by here all things were created for him right but he said because of the fall in the garden right there was one called lucifer and he was afraid that me and you would mar just testimony oh yeah well i'm glad he refused to redeem me under his covenant right because we didn't all belong to covenant of death hell in the grave right but there was one that said ah i'll take it right i'll take it since you don't want it lucifer i'll come down right i'll give my life i'll take on the kids will redeem me i'll take it i like what the apostle john wrote in john chapter 1 verse 17 he says any of his fullness have already received grace for grace brother said in this age we have received double grace right oh my brothers and sisters what a magnificent thing to see that god has sent in the most wicked the most adulterous age of all he has sent me in you double grace we see that in corinthians first term went to the book of the corinthians first corinthians six read two little scriptures here 19 and 20. amen you still love the lord amen amen we can't help but love him it says verse 19 and what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you what you have of god and you are not your home you know what's wrong with a lot of us we still have our own will we have our own desire we still have our own want to know he said for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god right in your body and in your spirit which are gods you see here the apostle paul is showing us that we have been bought with a price it's a double declaration to the believer we have been brought through redemption and then reconciled reconciliation back to god but to become one with god look at jesus he said my greatest desire father as as me and you are one that father they'll be one right oh my not one like this but one with god amen god living in us we see that redemption has a greater source of obligation than creation or preservation redemption of this man the man that he created he said and he breathed the breath of life into the breath of adam but his obligation let's look at that obligation look at when the angels fell god never moved but when man failed god came to him amen oh come down to see where fallen man was where the fallen woman was god himself came down right adam where are you son i'm so thankful that that's his love for his creation he let the one well one-third of the angels fall off lucifer and all them but when man fell right our lord loved us so much that god himself come down look at you where are you i'm glad he gave me that call one day when i was out there in the wilderness of sin out there in god out there in satan's pigpen eating the swine huss is a prodigal son he came one day and said yeah richie where are you me lord why do you want me lord that's the first thing we ask you lord what do you want with me why do you want me i'm worthless i'm wretched i'm no good there ain't no hope for me he said but oh yes they are yeah all right you know what i'm even saying many times those are the people that's been raised in the message and they went off but you know what the satan played with my mind for all them years brother donny he played with my mind he said you went too far yeah you crossed the line your predestination see you cannot cross the line right because god wanted paul said in ignorance i even blessed me right the holy ghost talking about redemption that's the only sin unpardonable that's right but look where grace was right grace come to him knowing it was in ignorance calling the condition he was right right so we have to be careful what would you say about one another right you know they used to tell my mother said well you know you serpent seed you know you know if you can't you know your son you know raise this mess you went off you know how hard they used to be bro yeah no hope for us you know what i believe that brother i believe this man this flesh man believes something on the inside wouldn't let me swallow it he wouldn't do it but i believe i said yeah maybe i did satan said yes you did you know i held that carry that rock in my sack all in years until jesus came you know i told him i said lord i went too far i went too far he said your problem son you never went far enough you never did get bored again i'm glad he he made a one-on-one visitation to me i'm glad he loved me that much that he would come down and speak to me all right i like what brother brown said in the results of a decision that jeff and uh chicago illinois 1955. he said not long ago i was standing by a big museum we've heard this many times he said it had the estimation of the human body a man that weighed about a hundred and fifty pounds was worth 84 cents in chemicals he kind of he said last year he said put a ten dollar hat on at 84 cents boy i'm telling you he said put a 500 mink coat around 84 cents and stick your nose up if it rained it drown you he said then you think you're somebody and worth 84 cents he said you sure take care of that but brother you've got a soul that'll never die somewhere you'll take any old kind of dogmatic stuff for that swallow it down i like where he said even he tells somebody said you're going to a restaurant if we went to the cracker barrel last night and there was a spider in my in my crawling around in my roast beef and gravy i've been mad but he said and you'd want to serve but he said you take any old thing yeah and swallow it down whatever we watch just any old thing we listen to just any old thing we do just any old thing be careful what you feed you're so less than right right the white and the black dog live do you think you can't resurrect that black dog oh yeah he loves to eat you see but the only one way you can control him is you have to starve him right if you feed him and then you wonder why he raises up so much you've been feeding him some good nutritions the world you've been giving him the taste that he likes you know what that's even the world don't understand it when the prophet god preached a message called the thinking man's filter has a holy man's taste you know what people a lot of people around we don't understand but they can be a religious filter i'm gonna preach on that sometimes a religious film you know religious filler he can take any old thing he can take all these old he can take all his old contemporary a lot of contemporary music he'll take a lot of these other things and he can suck it right through there and you know what he gets a religious man's taste he jumps he rejoices but you know what i thought about taking temporary music we have to be very careful about that music because i come out of the world yeah i used to listen to all that rock and roll and boogie woogie just because they say certain things don't mean it's christian but he said many will cry lord lord in that day and won't enter in i've often wondered about this and you know when they've probably seen that preview of america's bride she was being led by a witch to the beat of rock and roll i wonder if it was contemporary gospel music because she was religious but she had no covering she was naked that's a religious man's filter right you know what i've never seen so many brothers there's so many people that say they're christians look at the homosexuals that make such a great move into christianity and saying you know we're all one yeah well that sounds like that sounds like the tower of babel they're doing a lot of foolish battling you know because not all of us are christians only those who are about by the blood of jesus christ and i believe the homosexual can be saved amen but he still won't do the same thing he still won't deal with john right you know what one of the biggest moves in contemporary one of the biggest ones i heard him say this i'm gonna say i'm gonna drop this i'm gonna drop this was ray boltz powerful contemporary singer from that pledge allegiance to the lamb the anchor hose but you know what he came out and said he said i am a homosexual and i believe i'm closer to god now than i've ever been you better be careful but we are here right you better be careful the bible tells me to try every spirit you know what some people say i want you to listen to songs so religious i mean it's so so beautiful and you get to listen to that thing and you pull it through that thank you mess filter and you know what it won't go you're good it's like having a piece of it you ever been drinking your tea and sucked up one of those uh lemon seeds in there that's the same way it is with god's filter right when you go to sucking on that thing he'll stop it up see the holy man's the holy man's children won't allow to go through that you don't get no more teeth until you get to until you get the seed out of the straw so what we need is we need a filter cleaning we need the holy ghost to clean out our filter so we can draw off the things of god right right i like what hebrews 7 7 says and without contradiction the less is blessed of the better me and you being the less has been blessed as the better of jesus christ i'm so thankful for that so thankful that he loved me in you so much that he give his life for me and you see when you have a blood transfusion you don't have all that confusion right because when you get that holy spirit he said he'd lead you and guide you into all truth right you know what when there's something said and it ain't quite right it's a little red light goes off you're right i've heard people say something i mean they'd be good yeah and it wasn't right right wasn't right i said oh that rob brown said they said that man had that dream he said it's a good dream but it ain't according to the word it won't go through the thinking man's filter so we have to try and see well it's all gone amen then we try to bring it through here and then what if it don't light up it ain't no good right i'm thankful for that i'm thankful that we got our own little light that lights up on the inside and tells us right tells us what we are you know without that blood we have no blood type you know what we're all humans but i said every one of those cattles was cows every one of them but he said he wasn't looking at even the brand on them that's right the brand they all had different brands on them all right you want to say well this one right here is from lula and this one's right here so gastonia this one here is from tennessee this one here is from kentucky he went looking at that right he was looking for a black tank all right now that you was born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life blood of his blood spirit of your spirit i'm glad we have a tag i'm glad we've not been bored through our ears they all had something but they we all had to have that we all have to have the dna of god right we all come from different races different cultures different ways of life but we're all born progressing the holy ghost all right no different right i'm thankful for that when the holy ghost comes here we all right we all like like our daddy i'm glad we're bored of god you see somebody ain't acting right they hadn't been born again or they hadn't mercy or they've got a spirit on because daddy don't misconduct himself our father knew how to conduct himself as we spoke this morning he knew he had the right behavior he he conducted himself just like the father he was so much like him i like what t.l.r said the prophet to god one time they got him you might have heard this brother they got him over there and they wanted him to say something against the prophet of god you know he's in the first assemblies and all those still out there i don't understand why i ain't come out of that i don't understand that that's between him and god and i'm not calling names or be little people but uh they got over there he was in africa because you know the message has just boomed over there well not longer they called him over there and they want him to because he'd been with the prophet they wanted him to say something about it tell me this is all frozen this can't be of god but i like what he did he got up and he said him and hit him in the pool but they said kill we want you to kill it count it on him show him surely this is a fanatical move this is all wrong but i like what he's saying he said he said tell him he's a false prophet but he got up early said you know so there's one thing i can say if there was a prophet hey for this age it was william amen thank god for him understanding and then we we're afraid to say we think about this message here's a man that ain't even in this message that has enough love of god to stand there and tell what's truth right for that no matter what he what he's done or whatever however he believes but he stood and told the truth honesty always counts and you know what they said well you know tal said well they baptize him his name and they do all these things he said well let me tell you something about william man brett he said you know it's like an old blacksmith he said when he put that piece of iron in that fire and he got that hot fire so hot he said that iron and that fire become one he said you couldn't tell the iron from the fire he said that's the way the william branham was he said he lived so close to god that people mistake him for god i want to ask us this afternoon has anybody been stick mistaking me and you i don't want to go we got to come to that place my brothers and sisters i got to come to that place that's the greatest testimony he could ever say about the prophet he lived so close to him right until he become one with the father glory and people he mistaken him for god not that we worship the prophet by no means we worship the same god i serve the god of elijah that's right and he works with him in spirit and truth right he he was lived such a life and he lived so close to god that he manifest that he manifested the fruits yeah that's what we need to do we need to start manifesting some fruits we've been in the garden a long time but we need a lot of pruning yeah we need putting off the flowers to bring forth to bring forth the fruit we're producing a lot of leaves we ain't producing a lot of fruit oh i'm glad the master of the vineyard sent somebody to come and come to the grave let's look at what jesus said here in matthew 10 verse 29-31 he says and not to spare us so for our father and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father he said but the very hairs of your head are numbered so i hadn't lost one they're all coming back he said fear ye not therefore ye are more they uh of more value than many spirits he didn't die for creation right he died for man right he died he caught he he got creation in the in the price he paid right he come and shed his blood on the ground and redemp and redeemed that but he come that that life in that blood might come on me and you amen see they don't have a soul come on but me and you do right so your soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds right and i like what the prophet said in one place my pastor said he seen one place where he said 10 million worlds yeah so what value where do we place our value look at moses just for a minute now moses could have been the greatest man in egypt and he was he was fixing to be the pharaoh right and if he wouldn't have done what he did he wouldn't took his choice right now i wonder a lot of times what choice would we make right yeah when it come even preachers i wonder what choice will you come saul had a choice too king saul but the people was we want that come on let us keep these calves let us keep these guns you know what i thank god for a man is not not afraid to tell the truth that's the difference between a higher level right and one that god has called right right it's not about big who who's got the most it's about genuine robin said hey god ain't into all that glitter and shine he's into the glowing i'm looking for character that's what god's looking for the character of christ when he come for a wife when he talked about the man he was coming looking for the wife he's looking for character you know old lady little girl she went out there and she watches this she didn't complain her cousins made fun of her malta many of us and our fam members of our family and people wrestle they make fun of us and say you know he's in that club he's one of those oh yeah he's a brand of might everybody you know you don't know one day they're going to stand before god and be held accountable for every idle word you spoke we better be careful right you know what we have to be careful what we how we respond to them too the lord checked me one day he said don't push them don't push them because they can cross the line that's right and they'll lose anything they would ever got so we have to be careful you know only if we're led by the spirit it's like somebody called me one time a friend of mine and his wife they started going to church you know they heard i know he's out in the world we went to the things of the world you know not glorifying the world we're not trying to put anything on that that's the devil we don't we don't go off right now that stuff that was all i wish i never would have done there's no glory on that but they called me and they said well we won't you his wife got on the phone she said i want to ask you something i want to ask you something you know questions i thought well okay you get wonderful once people want to ask your questions because you know they're they was in that charismatic move you know and the first thing he did was he asked me man i'm in gospel music now i knew you played the bar the guitar all that stuff sung all that stuff said i want you to counseling i'm playing in the gospel band now i thought well um i probably should have prayed more i was just a young christian i went down with this church and they had a strobe light and they had all that moving this was in the church assemblies of god now oh there i thought oh my i went right back in the bar i started playing the blood i started playing the blood i said god had mercy on me but you know what he began to play those things he began to play the contemporary music i thought oh my god i'm sitting right here and i said you know what scripture come to me he said he'll sit in the synagogues of god and be worshipped as god yeah i said they don't even realize it commercially so you know that you know you came up to me after that you know i was trying to be nice you know brother said he went in somewhere he was the one preaching trying to be nice don't get up right there and show respect and i was trying to give respect to him he came up to me they put you on the spot he said how'd you like that for oh my lord what can i say i said well i'll tell you one thing i've never seen gospel music approached that way they said oh i know what you are you want them old cornbread you like that old-fashioned stuff i said praise god you hit me on the head that nail will clench and then you know they said well you know then they started calling well you know he's a bible thumper but it's just god that shows us what i mean when i first met i couldn't hardly read none of that but god gave me i still a little weak but you know he helped me he helped me to do these things and uh she called me up she said i want to ask you something i see what she's gonna ask me because i knew she believed in certain things you know and it wasn't scriptural that was going this big thing you know and they said she said i want to talk don't ask you something said do you believe in deaconesses do you believe in women preachers my boy those are hard questions i thought now oh lord you got me in the sun now lord you're gonna have to help me get out of here you know what i said the lord gave me a soft answer i said well i if you ask me again i was trying to give her an escape you know being a young christian trying to get him escaped even as older christians a lot of times we want to give him a way of escape right and i said uh i said well if you ask me again then i'm obligated you know being a christian we're obligated to tell them the truth i said if you ask me again then i really know you want to know what god has showed me it's not me that knows it right it took him to show me what the word said i said now the only thing i can say is what the word says you know she said okay answer this question me being that man god just let's you know when he comes brother oh he comes out such a sweet loving spirit and he said take her over there through the qualifications right i'm a deacon you know i'm hidden he said she must he must be the husband of one wife amen i said besides where is the word dickiness in the bible so he bailed me out of that i thought hold on she said well wait a minute i want to know about the woman preacher i knew it was coming i knew i could i could tell the tension was built and i said well show me one place in the bible where there was a priest that handled the fire the word of god that was a woman right she said i could hear you know that religious demons said that's a powerful deal that's a powerful name or being preaching on the radio i've run into a lot of those powerful demons you'll get more response to have a raw center than you will the religious people they'll stone you they'll pick up stones and they'll stone like they said they pull them out of their bag their bag's empty because they've used them careful that our bag's not empty she said well so i took it over the table god said turn over to timothy i said oh my okay lord with that spirit was in that sweet spirit and then when he comes in he there that's right i mean you know a lot of us get more let me tell you you're wrong we're going to hell in that way right it's just a sweet homeless spirit i said well let's look over in timothy let's look over there this wasn't me i couldn't do those things he's bringing them back to me brother whenever i show your word you know worship not a woman to teach have authority over the man but to be silent in church that's all she can stood that's obviously just good to stand well that see i said show me one apostle yeah i mean i'm still young but he showed me this thing and boy i could feel her growling i could hear her breath on the other hand that's an old man i made this bull man you know she said you know what you are you're a male shown this pig i said if i i said i'm the word offending that's a different thing i said that if i have offended you forgive me i said but if you're offended by the word you know and she said here give the other you're talking that man he ain't nothing but a male show this pig now he can't wait to get on the phone he said he said but you know what brother i said but he said that's the way our pastor you know a lot of times that's what we say around the message that's the way our pastor teaches it oh my god sees anything but a word i said well it's like this you know god gives you wisdom i said it's like this i said now if a man told you to walk and he said now buddy you can fly now this is how simple god just made me a simple man i'm glad he did he said if a man tells you you can jump off that empire state building you can fly i said would you get up on top of that empire state building and jump off because he told you you could fly he said no way i said that's the same thing you're doing now right you ain't in the word you are committing spiritual suicide right i got the phone hung up the phone and grief come on me brother and i began to pray for him i said god forgive them that's right for they don't know because i didn't want to lay that charge too right hoping that god would save their soul right see you don't understand the holy spirit that wouldn't mean i couldn't do that a lot of times in this collection they said that boy i want to show them yeah boy let me show you you know this man wants to be he wants to be he wants to take credit if he ain't got the holy ghost that man wants to make himself known he wants to prove something i like what my pastor told me one time he said brother richard brother richard he said one thing about he said well god gives a man revelation it humbles you he said but when man gets revelation it exalts you right exactly so that's how you can tell if god give it to him by another man the way he conducts himself and he says those things and you know i just thank god that he gives us this ability the value you know you could we can we have to be careful this message because this message is like an atomic bomb we got to we got a bomb that's right this is that and we have to be careful who we use them right right we've got to be careful when we drop that bomb right we can destroy people's lives amen and they can seal their destinations by their words exactly right we have to be very careful we have to be led the spirit yes you know but they still kept calling they'd call me said when you pray for me and we pray for you to sit i thought praise god thank god just moved it over lord if i'd have done it myself i'd mess it up we always the lord does me brother sometimes you know you want to tell somebody and then when you tell when i can tell when it ain't when it ain't god he'll stutter me all right i know he knows what that man will think or what that woman will say and we have to be careful how we give it to him that's right because they can turn that thing around and they can blaspheme that's right he knows this thing i'm glad he does that when i'm saying okay okay lord i understand that you know we have to grow up but let's look over in matthew chapter 27 just for a minute i'm gonna stop right here i'm gonna get this right here i'm gonna finish it right here we sure appreciate each and every one of you verse three said then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders this is saying i have sinned and that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us look at their attitude he says see thou to that and he cast down the 30 pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priest took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood right he said and they took counsel and brought with them bought with it and bought within the potter's field to bury strangers in oh god hit you glad repent buried in christ he said wherefore the field was called the field of blood unto this day then once fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the 30 pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they are the children of israel did value and gave them for the potter's field as the lord appointed me remember when we read over there and deuteronomy and uh deuteronomy i want to look at the price right here for just a minute i'm going to stop right here let's look at this now let's look at those silver pieces god showed me this little simple thing and i want to share it with you now let's look at a joseph he was estimated at the young man's price you can turn back to look with me in deuteronomy chapter 27. look at those first 10 verses everybody talks about values but look at this now we know that joseph was a soul of his brother for the price of 20 pieces of silver god spoke to me and said that was the price of a young man right and look at the woman she was sold for 30 pieces of silver god said i wasn't even valued at the price of a man because i didn't come to redeem me i came to redeem my wife right and there is the estimation of those 30 pieces of silver that judas sold jesus for the female was estimated he took the value of the woman to redeem his wife 30 pieces of silver amen he said i come to redeem my way amen not to redeem the man the man was 50 pieces of silver what about that what about that god went ahead and said i'll take the value of the woman you can value me at the value of a woman it was supposed to be it was supposed to be disgraceful to him to be valued as a man at that price that's 30 pieces of silver but in his disgrace we took on his grace isn't that beautiful how god and you know what every scripture has a meaning every scripture has a thought and i dolphin wondered what did that 30 pieces of silver had a value what did it really mean i knew it solely for but where it has to be somewhere in the scripture and the lord showed it to me one day he said read that again i preached on the vein of the blood one other time uh another time and he said go back and read that again i want to show you something i was back there in the study he said read that again i read that he said look at joseph 20 pieces i said ah i never thought that you know it's i think when god gives it to us because he gets the glory he said read on down 30 pieces for the female woman you know he didn't come to buy our baby and come to marry a woman i'm a cuter bride and he said now look at what judah sold me for they estimated me like the value of a woman amen he said but i was willing to take that because i didn't need redemption but the woman did and i said my thank you lord that you estimated me that you estimate yourself and you took on my price you know where it said the priest will value and give an estimation he was willing being the faithful high priest to take that value of what they valued at him and he took that on and he become the redemption for mankind amen now i like where it says down in the scripture you know what and the prophet of god talked about jeremiah when he talked about that he went down and he bought the potter's feet with that that's where me and you come from the partner went down into the field and getting in you to mold me and make you into vessels of honor i said oh my god you make the scripture so alive all right you make the scripture come so alive you went down to the you know what the problem god said one time he said we have come we got to be like jeremiah he said i'm going down to the potter's house to be broken when he go down to the potter's house he's breaks you and he mows you and makes you into what he wants you to do i pray that god is breaking us with his word and molding us and making us into vessels of honor let us stand i'm thankful that god has given us the ability to receive the word of god and to love him and just think he was estimated at the value of a woman you know i thought my what a disgrace to ask to estimate a man at the value of a woman him being a man but he said there was no disgrace to me he said because i didn't need redemption i come from my wife so i was willing to pay the price right just like just like hosea he was willing to pay the price willing to pay the price are we willing this afternoon to pay the price are we willing to forsake all things and make jesus christ our center peace willing to give our all to him willing to let go and let god have his way every head now maybe i close if you have a need would you raise your hand god knows all about it have you really estimated him as much value as his estimated jesus i raised my hand and said god help me to look at my brothers and sisters in a different way help me to look at you in a different way father father with more love with more joy with more desire for one another with more of that brotherly kindness father that's your pastors without brother kindness will never come to perfect love father we're here once again father in the potter's

jesus christ you know i noticed one thing as the brother was reading there that there's an odd part of that scripture too that says that the male's price from one month up to five years was five sickles all the others would always hide five five five right but not in that verse it says the females price was three shekels now they knew how to say two and a half no problem with it but you see

kind of shocked him a little bit out in Kansas when we did that but that's okay we need to be shocked every once in a while need to have a little joke maybe some of us need to have an electrode stuck to us somewhere if you got your Bibles let's turn in the book of Jeremiah and read a scripture got a little thought on the plane going out last Saturday and uh wrote a few things down I didn't have a thing to speak at brother claud's and this little thought came to my heart so we'll uh see how the Lord leads here um Ever every sermon is the same but every sermon is different and you preach the same sermon in five different places and go at it five different ways you know you can get to New York by by I 95 or 81 or 82 or so you can get you can get to a lot of different things a lot of different ways tonight we're going to look at the thought predestination the mystery Satan can't stand right let's bow our heads before we start dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you would come Among Us in a special way not be Lord just a bystander but be an active participant in the service father that you would take total preeminence and that you would be the one that does the speaking father not be a man Lord but be you Lord taking this word that is truly before the foundation of the world that's that's tried and tested and true and bring it to the hearts of the people father we ask you that you just bless us now as the pilgrims long time ago sat down tomorrow Lord with with the Indians and and bless the food of the the Bountiful Harvest that they had and thank you Lord for a new country that they had moved to well father we're moving to another country not this United States of America father but we're moving to a country a kingdom that you've set up without hammering nails that you promised Lord that you would come back and get us that you would build this place father we believe that you're building it now in the heart of the believer not up in heaven somewhere fixing something up but you're fixing up the hearts and minds of the Believers so that we can be the part of that City father we pray that You' just touch each one if there's any sick here Lord you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from destruction so Lord as the word Goes Forth May the eyes of the Holy Spirit just smooth things over may they people be blessed Lord by just being here father may we be blessed just by reading your word be with the ones that are not here that are traveling the ones that are homesick father we ask you just touch them now father just be with us and bless us and keep us forgive us of our many sins and our mistakes we ask these things in Jesus name amen the book of Jeremiah 1 verse 5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee right wow and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations right then said I oh Lord God behold I cannot speak for I'm a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee look at those eyes before I form thee in the belly I I knew Thee I I I who's doing all this God Jeremiah didn't have one thing to do with it amen and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak now let's turn to Romans 9 just get another another part of the thought Romans 9:13 and then you may be seated as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated right you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to reading of his word now folks God is not a respector of persons but it looks like in these two scriptures Brother Ray that God is a respector of person that he actually picked these people before they even breathed the breath of air they were chosen to do a job God had already wrote in his word what was going to happen there wasn't one thing had to do with it Jeremiah or Esau or Jacob but the Bible says God is not a respector person amen now tonight we're going to remember brother random said the word predestination was not a good word to use in the congregation maybe he said in a congregation he was trying to say that was a little unlearned but I think we're sitting in a congregation that's a little bit learning so let's talk about predestination because the word predestination means that your destiny was determined before you even got here predestined Destiny predetermined before your destiny was determined before you even got here everybody not just Jacob and Esau not just Jeremiah right so let's look at this and see and look that back before the world God knew what was going to happen happen amen all right now but Satan was there but Satan was not in the mind of God right so we're going to we're going to speak a little bit and then try to put two services in one to get to the point but this is the mystery Satan can't stand he can't stand how how that God has already picked you chose you stamped you and put you already in the future home hold on just a minute but God is not a respector of persons he can't say I pick Timothy and don't pick brother deck right so how can he predetermine that all this was going to happen before we got here when we say all that's for knowledge oh well that's true amen but I thought God's thoughts were Eternal and cannot change right so predestination is like this a line I got something thank you predestination is a line God cannot change his mind about what he's already said God cannot go back on his word God cannot go back on what he's already saw because what he saw is eternal right amen so that's why I think brother brandom was trying to get it to the people that predestination is not a real bad word if you know what you're talking about right all right but now predestination in a in a in a in a baby form is Brother Gary it's it's more like you say there's nothing I can do about it God just knew I was going to you know be a sinner all my life you know it always bothered me that that that I could see how God could could take Adolf Hitler and if he gave Adolf Hitler a million years he'd never repent exactly he could give him 2 million years he'd never repent right he'd give him 3 million years he'd never repent exactly so Adolf Hitler done what he did and went off the scene and God knew that's exactly what he's going to do he knew Adolf Hitler would never ever ask for forgiveness never would come to the knowledge he may come to the knowledge of God but not to the very Mind Of God cuz that's what we're going to try to get to that's the mystery Satan can't stand Brother D he can't get into the mind of God right even the prophet told us one time he said if I speak it watch Satan he'll try to copy oh yeah but he said but if I keep it in my mind or Heart Right heart not in this thumping gizard heart right here but in my heart in the heart of my being right okay if I can keep it right here Satan won't do can't do anything about it well what about God God's got secrets in his mind that he wrote us a letter and tonight across the country if they're having services in the Baptist and the Methodist and the Presbyterians and the Catholics and Brites or whatever right you want to claim same words right and they can preach predestination is that God did choose one and didn't choose the other yeah or they can do like some do and say well it's already pre-planned there's nothing I can do about it I'm just going to go right on through with it but what about a prophet that came and gave us this book or we're talking about tonight we're talking about the perfect will of God because the perfect will of God will never change that's that line that will never change the perfect will of God will never waver it will never falter but now the permissive will of God is what you and I work in a lot of times and that's not the string that you pull across that we call eternity because that's the things listen to this this came to my mind I think while I was on the on the plane but the way for me to understand the perfect will or the permissive will of God is write this down or put it in your mind the perfect will of God he saw it would happen right the permissive will of God let it happen yeah right by your choice exactly the perfect will of God God saw it would happen standing in eternity he saw this was going to happen tonight just this same cting but in permissive will he let it happen by one thing and that's your choice right right exactly so perfect will of God is never going to change right God don't change his mind about his word I was looking up in the back we talk about will brother Dick's going to like this one when I tell him but remember we say well the perfect will of God we say what is what is Will well it's a desire if it's a if it's a verb or if it's a a noun it is the word of somebody or what somebody desires or something that's going to be said that's going to be done but listen to this we always say the perfect will of God or the permissive will of God but have you ever looked at the will of God as a document Y what is a will right right a will is a legal description of a person's wishes regarding the disposal of his or her property yeah or estate after his death that's why the prophet could say that God's will is his word yeah not just that he will it to happen he wrote us a will amen he wrote us this will that's right and out of this will after he died come on had to be the death of a testator right had somebody had to die to give you a will right now this is the perfect will of God right the perfect will written right of God right and I looked up the word self will you know what the word self-will mean Bullhead yeah told you bullheaded but brother randam said there was either what 5 cents is outside 5 cents is the next Rim one cents in the middle Rim which is what self will right bullheaded yeah one way or the other right you can be bullheaded for God or you can be bullheaded for Satan right but we look at well a little bit different way though we say well okay this is the perfect will of God this is the way it's going to happen this is the way God sees it and it is it's his purpose and it is eternal because it is his word this Bible was written brother Bram said your name was written before the foundation of the world so guess what in a in a in an eternal sense it's done and over with finished Paul picks it up and says sitting in Heavenly places because if you go to work long enough you'll realize one thing you're not sitting in Heavenly places down here but everybody's Destiny is determine before they get here but now the perfect will of God is the standard right Eternal cannot change the permissive will of God is what we do with this that's right they understand that the perfect will of God is this but what we do with it right is the permissive will of God right God permits us right he actually permits the Baptist to preach a sermon out of this book right Methodist bramit whoever right but there's only one Mind Of God right one right and it's not a Baptist Faith or a Methodist Faith or a bromite faith you understand what I'm saying putting everything together right it's what he said and saw would happen right hey brother Tom how you doing buddy appreciate that song I knew that's what she was going to sing I asked brother boy didn't get you saying and I knew that's what you going to saying but we were guilty we we were guilty but we were guilty by this right here but what did we do we picked up the will one day read where that if you'll accept the death of something sure see if Daddy died and had a will for me unless I go accept that will right right right unless I go accept that will it'll lay there for centuries amen and nobody can touch it right but if you say okay I claim because I am the son of I am the daughter of come on if I can prove my lineage my genealogy that's what's happening to us now amen we're proving our genealogy that's right right whether we're going to lean toward Mama and Daddy on the Earth our mom and daddy in heaven right perfect will of God Amen but it's all going to work back to this perfect will but in permissive will we can work around in here a little bit let me read you a quote brother R says I'm not going to read all these cuz I read them for two services but we'll skip through some of them brother Brown said does God change his mind 1965 427 so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he said yeah he always keeps it true but he has a permissive will now there where the trouble lay we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it yes but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work together to glorify his perfect will glory right in other words he's going to let us have permissive will but it's always going to work back to this right here all right so you got your perfect will God let it drop down because of the fall and the things that we've done wrong and he's letting us Roll Along in a permissive will but it's going to always go right back up to the perfect will of almighty God if you hook yourself to that if you become part of the family right we know we can write wheels for people that's not in the family but but let's get it right right brother dick I have absolutely if he were to pass away you know here I go right in the middle of Brad Laur and all them here I go sitting down right in the middle of a whole thing I know you wouldn't you might dick wouldn't like for me to get his money but here I am sitting in front of the judge though I know she's got it all look how I finish my point so I'm sitting here in this room with all these Addison and I'm a Dale right and the judge looks at me and goes what are you doing here I said well I knew brother dick I went to church with him for 20 years roding his car he and him me and him kind of think Al like a little bit judge said that's good anything else no he said well I don't see your name in the whe right I I don't see you were a part of the don't take me out if fam um I don't see him in the in the will why cuz I wasn't a part of his family right I wasn't part of his family exactly so I have no right in claim to anything that brother dick has exactly because I'm not in the will that brother dick made amen right do you understand that exactly and that's the same way with the rest of us if we're not if we don't hook oursel to the right family get the right genealogy right this becomes a judgment book right oh my right because remember permissive is always going to work to the perfect will of God right out here at the end we're going back to that same line again everybody understand that it's not a different line that started here God thought it he knew it he loved Jacob and hated Esau right he loved Jeremiah he knew what Isaiah was going to do made it available for for them and they accepted it Jacob took it Esau turned it down God saw it so now just keep that in mind God's word is always Eternal it's all in the Bible everything in this Bible is predestinated right all right but now he's not going to make you do it let's read Romans 9 while we're right here at 9:13 because um as you've seen Paul's writings he he brings out a thought and then he finishes it so in verse 13 he saying as written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated Paul didn't leave it there Paul explained why right verse 19 to save time thou will say then unto me why do he yet find fault right for who hath resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God right Cain did remember Cain did right Cain said am I my Brother's Keeper right shall the thing formed he's talking about he's still keeping the thought of Jacob and Esau right shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus right somewhere people like it or not God's going to come to every person in the world and tell them the time and the day that he tried to get them to become part of this well exactly because if not he'd be a respector of persons that's right now we know that the little babies that's why praise God that the prophet could could tell us that that babies before the age of accountability why they have nothing to go on Amen they're automatically in the will right you thought of all I thought of that sister Gil a long time you know about the how many little babies have died we think boy Heaven's going to be so empty Heaven's going to be full this Earth is going to be full the Bible says full it won't be overflowing everybody will have their place but it will be full right CU think of all the babies down through the centuries of time that's died that will be given eternal life there in heaven so so it's not going to be that we going to have to search out and look for somebody no it's going to be full right but listen we bring in a little word called election because we have to bring election in because of one thing God is not a respector a person right and by election he said we'll we'll read it in a few minutes and we're going heading toward Ephesians you know should know that by now but God has set up a a thing called an election we just went through one correct what did you do when you went to an election you cast it a vat right all right and the prophet explains it very simple he says God voted for you the devil voted against you a two to one vote wins this thing got it right vote for this guy you going in his Direction vote for this guy you're going in his Direction so the Bible says by election election looks back we'll read it in just a few minutes God saw what you would elect to vote for who you would elect to vote for all right but now remember people God's not going to make you do anything right that's one thing God will not do he limited himself enough to know one thing that when he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency he put Satan on free moral agency right everybody's on free moral agency and I believe I got a quote somewhere where brother Brown said God was on free moral agency cuz he could choose he's got he made a choice but he makes a choice by what you choose yeah you talking about Jesus doing some things that I mean we doing things Jesus can't do there one thing God can't do he can't make you go to heaven right right he can't make you go to heaven right now before the age accountability don't get me wrong but he can if you're a same person tonight he can't just say I'm going to put you in heaven or he' be a respect your person so he has to go by your choice all right let's read another quote get through real quick but if and does God ever change his mind same same uh book but and if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he will let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will yeah all right number two now listen father of Abraham 1955 11:18 and predestination is a hard word word among a congregation of people because predestination really forn knowledge is a better word right and predestination looks back to forn knowledge and for knowledge looks on to Destiny that God being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do right so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore before Esau or Jacob either one was born God could say Esau I've hated and Jacob I've loved because he forew what they could be he never made Esau the way he was right he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice God knew what would take place they what would take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool God that's right cuz he knows your heart and that's the thing about God God knowing your heart I believe believe there'll be a lot of people be giv eternal life cuz God knew remember brother Bram said you and I are going to give an account right for the people we can't get to and God won't hold that against them all right pretty tough right but that's what he said right faith of Abraham same same um book chapter paragraph E20 therefore he by election I like this one he chose Abraham now remember I don't think he just spoke just to Abraham right I think he spoke to a lot of people right Abraham's the only one that said I'll do it right that's how simple that is Mary was the only one that said in her heart right be it unto me according to Thy word now she many of them probably could have said that listen to what he said about Abraham listen to this Prophet you remember when he called him out there and said he had not keep a thing a secret from him when he was going down to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for he said now this is not verb Adam in the Bible but listen to what brother what brother R said about it this is his quote he said from about God for I know that Abraham will teach his children Amen in other words he knew what Abraham would do with it right when God give it to him he knew what he knew that maybe maybe John Doe the the neighbor of Abraham wouldn't do that right he keep it to himself or wouldn't do but listen for I know that Abraham will teach his children I know it God himself I know that Abraham will send this message on down from one generation to the other right brother dony that's what he saw in Abraham he saw that Abraham would be the father of our faith but he would not keep it to himself but he would pass it down from generation to generation God's covenant with Abraham sou Falls South Dakota 1956 now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for a halfhazard thought well I'll die up there perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus came for one specific purpose that was to redeem those that God forne would be redeemed right now listen brother Ram told us and it shocked the people in Bartlesville because they didn't remember the quote but dad's preached on it several times Jesus never come to give you an inheritance right exactly Jesus never came to give you an inheritance am your inheritance was before the foundation of the world Jesus just came down here to take you back to it right now I don't like that word just cuz that limits everything you know Jesus didn't just come to do that I mean come to save those that that were lost but he had a specific plan and it was not to bring you an inheritance right you're inheritance was before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the book God just came down here to tell you you're written here somewhere in this book that we call a will but it kind of shock people when you when you when you quote that to them because they said ma'am Jesus had to come to do something exactly and let me see if I can find it he made the way exactly let me see if I can find it I'll just read it now and if I don't I'll get to it in just a minute position in Christ 1960 522 inheritance by predestination see that's what Satan can't stand he looks down here and sees us working in permissive will of God sinning doing things wrong we're humans he can't understand though that God he knows that God had some plan or he wouldn't be doing what he's doing but he's got some plan for you and I but but Satan can't understand that he's still accusing us of things right but listen inheritance by predestination position in Christ 196 522 now Joseph's got all these copies so they'll be on the internet if you need them inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leaving me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance remember we were in to inherit eternal life that was our inheritance to live on this Earth Body Spirit and soul Eternal right right brother Gary amen I believe that 100% but remember what happened the separation came right Adam couldn't get back to God God couldn't get to Adam so it wasn't that that Adam totally lost everything the inheritance was still there right remember brother re said it wasn't that God didn't annihilate the inheritance he just took it away from Adam and said you're not going to be able to produce this will anymore I'm going to have to come and die because remember Adam couldn't die for mine and your sins right so somebody's got to die to give you a will amen right that's right so that's what God did God Jesus didn't come to to to give you a new inheritance he came to say look believe in me become part of my family and I'll give you this what my father the will of My Father which is the word of God all right beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jes Jesus never left you one he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first right there's that line Brother D there's that line that's that perfect will of God right that I'm going to have children right I'm going to have a family and this is the way it's going to be right now we choose to get to that is where the choice comes in sure we dropped down here brother R said to make a choice right but God knew what choice he was going to make before you even got here amen Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated now let's go on through but remember we were back in God before the foundation of the world in what not in a body form no not in a in a theophany as individuals but in what God Said right right but now remember before God said it he had to think it right right I going to try to find it I'm kind of getting a littlee because I'm trying to produce two services in one but that's okay okay here we go number three God's power to transform you were in your great great great grandfather you were in the loins of your father but your father could not have any fellowship with you until you were transformed into a body of Flesh right my son there was in me I wanted a son but he was in me then he was in me then but through wedlock he was transformed into a man like me and then he became like me amen and you become like your parents CU it was in you to begin with now if you are the Son of God his attributes which you are an attribute of your father not your mother your father The Germ lays in the father now your mother was an incubator that bears you you Bears the seed of your father read on down just skip a few more um paragraphs same God's power to transformed and the Earth in flesh is also the incubator incubator that bears the seed of God not the world how great the world is is how great the god that made it Glory now if you are a son and daughter of God then you were in God at the beginning you're his attribute if you wasn't there then you never was or you never will be right keep reading now then now you can fellowship with him in other words you're you're out now you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him right right a seed Jesus said a sore the seed goes out all right what the son of man do he sowed the seed what he slded the foundation or he solded the the way for you and us to you and I to get here I'm like Daddy we went out to Kansas and we didn't have a bit of problem with our voice or or sinuses or nothing we come back home and it's got both of us but anyway praise the lord we got back so it's okay amen you couldn't back there because you were just a word and him a seed but now he's manifested in you and now he wants you to fellowship with him see the perfect Fellowship right oh my them deep mysteries of God how wonderful God could not Fellowship in spirit so God became man right Jesus Christ was God himself manifested cuz he was a son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in that's right glor praise the Lord for that amen but now what can he do he can now be our brother to do what to be a brother put you in the family right right then it puts you in line for the will sometimes we look at perfect will permissive will and we look at a God that says all right that's the way it's going to be which that's true but he knows what it was before he started all right try to get back to that I know it's very very simple but we were in C germ 4 and brother brandham said God thought it and then when he spoke it it had to become material right all right so he started bringing all these things forth and guess what happened you and I were an attribute in his thoughts and if you are if you were if you're born again tonight if you're born again if you have the new birth you have that same theophany that was before the foundation of the world dwelling in your soul the very Creator folks let me tell you this is why without the new birth you can't understand these things but with the new birth I actually you can go into that very mind of the man that made this thing right and you can glean things out of this will that a lot of people are not going to ever get out of it right because let me tell you one thing this is a good point if I come and I write a book about my life yeah I can't use any of the family take brother Joe Solace he doesn't know all of my past than brother Joe Solace I write a book and I hand that book to brother Joe I'm the author yeah and it's a biography of of a true story of my life and I hand it to brother Joe and brother Joe reads it and he says oh that's a good story but if some way my personality my being my vision could be transformed into Joe Solace now when Joe Solus reads that book it's as if he lived it right but Tom that's what this book that we call a Bible is right it can be read as a good story book it can be read as just some good like brother Tom said War Stories right brother Tom it can be read to say oh somebody is over there somebody over here somebody over there but what about when the very author of the book come on takes a hold of your being not the being your Mom and Daddy brought in the world but that being inside of you that Supernatural part of you and he takes that little speck of himself and he places it in your heart right and he don't give it to you to take it away from you exct right when he gives it to you he vulcanize he takes that rubber and melts it to rubber right he takes that old Stony heart out which is made of stone and he puts a heart of Flesh and then what does God do he takes his spirit and puts it in that man now brother joose Solus can read that book and enter into the same life that the author lived right that's what we got to do people amen am amen that's what's going to get us out of here I believe that that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here because that book is read by billions and billions of people sermons are preached by billions and billions of people there's no telling how many sermons that that been preached since brother bram's been dead right just out of the 1160 sermons right of the interpretation of the Bible that's right right amen but how many interpretations they had they never entered into the heart of the composer those little stories brother Brown told was not just little stories to fill in till God give him something to say I believe that was what God was giving him to say cuz he'd say if I was bethoven tonight what would I do I'd write a symphony if I was God Almighty tonight I could understand this book right now we know we're limited by our human ability so was Jesus but he chose it that way right you and I didn't have a choice we were born this way am but we do have a choice to get back right to that part amen right right I like that amen you enter in to the very it's not that you're reading as a second person cuz remember brother Bram always said if it's two right one's God one's the devil that's right so if you read this and not get what the author was saying that's how close Christ and Antichrist is in this end time right if you can't read it in the heart of the composer that wrote it it's Antichrist it's anti- word amen cuz it's just a letter right it's just a form but you know what if we take it as a will that makes us part right if it it says on top of that will somewhere it says Dale right I'm going to be sitting at the in the lawyer's office right you couldn't stop me don't thing stop me be Church lot of you wouldn't stop you there right but we got here but now look when we got here our choice was whether to stay the son of who you were naturally born by or through right or like Jesus told Nicodemus the same sitting is you say well poor Nicodemus we all were the same way carnally we said or we just shake a hand take the right hand of Fellowship a lot of people get the left foot of Fellowship but a right hand of Fellowship that's what Nicodemus was saying if I got carnally he said if I got to go back and get in my mother's womb in other words we got to do this same birthing process over again what did Jesus say he said no he said Nicodemus you can't you're already born down here Born Again means it's the second time right right you got to be born from above right same way with you and I you say oh poor Nicodemus that's the same way you and I have a choice to stay the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale are become the son of Jesus Christ exactly all of us all right now look for knowledge we spoke a little bit about but let's go into forn knowledge just for a second because you have to bring in for knowledge or people say well God did just just pull me through a cube now let's listen Book of Exodus 1955 the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word forn knowledge is better better you know what the word for knowledge means very simple knowledge before it happens right knowledge of what's going to happen before it happens that's simple as you can make for knowledge predestination looks back to for knowledge why God can't predestinate and be giving you a choice if he didn't go by for knowledge cuz he had to see it first therefore he could predestinate all right so predestination looks back to where he was at in for knowledge okay for knowledge looks to destination God saw your destination exactly very simple but God not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but God in order to be God he know the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order going happen where I think Pentecost failed 1955 1111 now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or minister to use because it kind of confuses the people when you say predestinate predestination speaks looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to forge knowledge for knowledge goes to destination in other words God didn't say now I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning right so in order to forn knowledge that he knew I'm reading this what he said he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and knows where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages right you say well how in the world somewhere God saw you before the foundation of the world had to see you had to know what age you'd be and had to some way brother BR said through this one through this one breeding this one with this one this one this one this one this one to get you here no all right not of you're choosing to get here but after you got here God knew what you'd do okay Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated look Ephesians parallels Joshua predestination looks back to for knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that election looks back here here it is I was a cucklebur I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies now this quote right here a lot of people can't stand right they hate this quote because brother Bram said I was an eagle I always was an eagle I always was this eternal life or this seed or whatever but listen to this I was a cuckle bar right I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among Sinners father and mother and all my whole family were Sinners right I was a cucklebur right but all of a sudden I became a wheat Jour amen I thought God's power to transform did that yeah I became a wheat grain how did it happen what was it election God knew what you choose was an election you're choosing an officer to fill a position right you elect him because you vote more votes for this guy than you do for this guy like I said you voted you know God voted for you devil voted against you you swing the vote God before the foundation of the world elected that that c was to become a grain of wheat by for knowledge he seen that I would love him so he made a pritu through his own son that through him I might become from a cleur to a grain of wheat we were all born in sin going in One Direction Right Prophet priest our King doesn't matter it's like brother Ryan asked uh here tonight ask in the Bible study that how it looked that that God did um was a respector persons by telling brother Brandon before he even begin to to to come to a knowledge of anything he said told Brother Brom he said now don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body right you'd think well boy he if he done that to me maybe I'd be different no or he would have sorry that's just the way God is no sorry you say boy if I was back there when Jesus was crucified no you'd have been just the rest of them exactly that's why God had you in this age to believe this all right but brother Ryan said that looked more like a respected person but daddy said in great wisdom he said well son he was not protecting William brandham he was protecting the gift right because look brother brandham picked up the bottle it wasn't that he said I never done those things I never smoked never drank never defile my body no he picked the cigarette up and was going to smoke it he picked the bottle up and was going to drink it right he said I was going to drink it right he said I was going to kill them boys I was going to kill that man that pour in my dog right I put a gun to my head to commit suicide right I was going to do those things he didn't say I thought about doing them he said I was going to do them exactly but God protected the gift that the a man had he had to Glory cuz that gift had to come but it came through that man because it molded itself together same way with you and I I got a quote here brother bam said said God knew he said he didn't just make you a preacher because he want just to fill a place right he knew you could handle certain things he knew others couldn't handle certain things that's why it's not a it's not a shame to not be a everybody wants to be a preacher everybody wants to be preacher why why yeah I'd love to come in 5 minutes before the service starts or later and sit in the front Pew and just say praise the Lord can't do that right I can't do that right I'm constantly thinking about you people amen constantly thinking about all the people I go speak for constantly just thinking about now God knows I don't 24 hours a day I don't think about it I'm sorry got a job got kids and the family you know but I do it's on my mind right you know what does the people need right I wish I could go home and lay down at night and just say Lord bless them I can't do that cuz we all got problems we all got things that we got to deal with but God by for knowledge knew that you know you somebody people say well how can you handle things like brother Dale he how do he handles things maybe different than I do and there's some things I disagree that he that he handles but I see telling me from his face but I'm not the boss right I'm just the secretary come on it's like Claud said Claud said if I want to talk he called me he said where's your daddy at I said well he so and so and so and so I said what do you need he said well I need to ask him a question and I started to say one time I said well just ask you know I ask me I'll see if I can answer it he said I don't want to talk to the secretary he said I want to talk to the boss I said okay I give his number don't call me back dick he just knows we're highly opinionated he may listen to this but that's okay but listen God had us in his mind right knew what age we would fit in there's no other age we could be a lot of us would be scared cowards if we were in that fourth age we may not have made it oh that's right come on people we may not have made it right but God put us in this age to do a certain thing that's what I want to get to I'm going to skip a little bit and get down to right here let's go to Romans no let's don't let's let's forget that we got to get through well it's just 8:15 Lord yall who got to get go to work tomorrow Sarah you can slip out if you need to and sister Trudy if you nod your head fall asleep that's okay the rest of us don't have to get up in the morning praise the Lord so we can go on a little bit further can we do that Romans 8 you love the Lord amen I do too love you guys too miss you while we were gone sure did Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them are who are the called according to his purpose see we were called according to his purpose not our purpose right we were called according to his purpose he called and we answered his purpose he didn't call and we answered our own purpose right those he may have called did and they didn't respond like Abraham's time he probably asked a bunch of people hey would you must believe me and probably a lot of people said no probably a lot of people had other things to do but listen to this excuse me for whom he did Forno in other words he had to know you before that's what forn knowledge is for them whom he did for know he also did predestinate there's the key right set in stone but your name's not right there unless you believe it's right there right exactly you make the choice to put yourself in this scripture right here right see because way Dale's not right here but I can say I am because why he also did predestin to be conformed right right not to the image of the son of Samuel and pegy day right right but it said the image of his son right that he might be the first born among many many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate ly drawn Eternal no way you can get out of it why moreover whom he did predestinate them he called right right and whom he called right not Mama call and daddy sent they like that Daddy was in Barbersville and they really got a chuckle out of that Mama called and daddy sent moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified look at all them he nothing we did we just accepted it he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things repeat after me if God be for us who can be against us Happy Thanksgiving cuz that's what God give you but now look if we're not born again we're going to come to this perfect part of we're going to meet this part exactly that's perfect does everybody understand that if we don't accept the pardon if we don't accept this will if we don't attach oursel to this economy or this or this uh family of God you're going to me it's not like say well well if I don't choose to accept then I'm okay no if you don't choose to accept then you've got to meet that perfect again and God is going to ask you why right you didn't exactly and when you turn that down that brings the Judgment right that's why that we're already judged now and don't have to be judged later okay and has passed from death death and life now let's go to Ephesians 1 if we don't come to this word birth or the old adamic nature must die right then we've got to give an account for that old man right but just like I told him in in in Oklahoma my grandfather Daddy's Daddy has been dead since 19 45 there's no way I could go out tomorrow and go to and get me a lawyer and go to court and tell the whole Court my grandpa robbed a bank yesterday why he's dead right been dead right go show you where he's buried that's the same thing's got to happen to me and you right because if he was alive alive I'd have a case right if he was alive I'm telling you if he was alive I'd have a case right right but if he's dead there's no case in the court of the land going to ever accuse a dead man of doing something after he's already died same way with you and I that old adamic Nature has to die now Ephesians 1 I hope you knew that's where we were coming to now remember the mind of god is perfect amen the mind of God was back before the foundation of the world the mind of God was way up here up here all right and then we had to come down here to get into the permissive part all right but even getting into the permissive part there's a way back amen okay this is the simple part but let's watch Ephesians chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so it's not to the world it's to the saints that are in Christ Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us with [Music] him oh what did that say in not with in where were we we were in him amen before the foundation of the world Amen chosen Us in him before for the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that cannot be talking about tonight in a natural form none of us are holy we're holy if we're in Christ right and Without Blame oh NOP sorry I saw you do it you saw me do it so this must be in heaven this must be what God has stamped that's going to be this is the mind of God this is eternal before the foundation world that we should be holy God took a picture of you before you ever got here and that's what you're going to Glory Without Blame before him in love having pred destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's nothing in that's permissive his will is perfect right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved all let's say it like this wherein he ha made us accepted in the attribute Brother G is that okay in the attribute cuz if you weren't in that attribute you're never going to get down here to this verse 7 through 14 exactly so verse 1-6 is what God has already said about us that perfect will of God that can never be changed can never go away listen people if we're holy and Without Blame Satan's blaming us already we understand that but this part of God is what he's already saw that's going to happen now look at verse seven he's dropping down to tell you how yeah that we're going to get back up to verse 3 through6 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace right now I believe that's right here now wherein Heath abounded toward us look at all those uses and we and all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us right now that wasn't before the foundation of the world we were already in him we were there but look at this having made known unto us what reading of his will after the death of the testator shedding see look say in Redemption through his blood we know he died 2,000 years ago but we know he died before the foundation of the world but brother brand said if if he didn't die 2,000 years ago and shed his natural blood there was no 4,000 years ago that he died in the mind of God exactly so he had to come here and do it so we look to that amen that he absolutely came on this Earth and did what he said he was going to do Glory shed through his blood that's right having made known unto us the mystery of his word will when not before the foundation of the world right here right glory after you've heard the word trth of Salvation truth we'll get to that that's what he's saying right here Paul is going to bring us take us from Heaven show us it's already done and finished bring us down on Earth and tell us how we're going to get to that amen because look having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good good pleasure remember it all works back to his pleasure which he has purposed in himself I am going to have a bride amen look I am going to have this string right here that's called eternity I am going to have what was in my mind there's nothing going to stop that right the reason he can do that though he saw what we would want and we would want that right the Eternal part so he had it there for us a fish he could have never brother R said a lot of times you know he say well the sulfur the the sulfur had to be there in the rubber the had to be there before the child had a desire same thing with you and I yeah there had to be a God in heaven there had to be eternal life there had to be shed of the blood for us to want it for that desire to be drawn to that right can't be drawn you know water can't if there's no water there why do you need a fish right but since we got water now we have a fish all right that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now when is that now this is the dispensation of the fullness of all things amen right he might gather together in one what one mystery all things in Christ right both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance am what being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen are the for knowledge of his word that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ L now 13 13- 14 Paul's going to sum it all up he's going to put this all together in whom you ye also Trust after I told him that word after after and if are two big words yeah if may be a little word but if is a very big word right if you believe if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life always was eternal amen if but if you don't then what you weren't right in whom ye also trusted what you had Faith trusted yeah if I trust Brother Gary I got faith in it in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth right look in the book of Acts no one received the Holy Ghost without a message being preached to him there was a message preached the Holy Ghost fell after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation right in whom also there's that word again after Paul said come to those those Brethren and said that you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe also after that you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise right which is the earnest of our inheritance right until the Redemption of the purchased possession amen unto the praise of his glory are his perfect will right Paul takes you to heaven shows you what the mind of God said showed us how it was going to happen to the shedding of the blood that we after that we heard the word of Truth after that we believed and then we receive an Earnest now if you put money down it's been explained before but listen to this if you take your earnest money and say you've got three payments which we got a lot more than that that's 30 years most of us but you take this earnest money and you go to the bank and the bank says there's no way you can have this loan without this earnest money but now after you put this earnest money down if you meet the requirements through your term of your loan the house is yours right though the earnest money be only a maybe 5% 10% and you get a $200,000 house that's $220,000 you say man that's only you know 10% of the of the purchase of the purchase price cuz the price is $200,000 but now which is more important the payments or the earning money if that Banker says you've got to put 20% or 10% down or you Ain got to worry about these payments right you got to make this first earnest money right here think it so which one's more important right earnest money or getting the full possession right it's it's more important or just as important as any of these payments that you make and if you make that earnest money you then are given a payment book and in God's economy brother Ram said God gives you a checkbook amen how do you pay for most of your payments most of us used to be by cash but they don't do that anymore they don't know what cash is anymore check check brother Brown said God gives you a check but with his name on it when you start but said when you get up to a certain part you know when you get up to a certain part you're paying a lot of interest but when you get toward the end of that loan you're paying a bundle of principal then then God finally he says hey I trust you here's you some blank ones yeah make the full payment right make the full payment right amen what is the full payment Body Spirit and soul Eternal GL not just walking around here with with with with um you know with troubles and trials and problems no it's knowing what God wants right knowing what God is and knowing what God is doing listen to this quote right here then we'll then we'll we'll kind of wrap it up Blasphemous names 1962 now let me read this one first cuz this this one's kind of cute Brother brownman spoken words Original Seed 1962 well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you came the way you did you're subject to the fall right but being that you're predestinated and you hear the word and it brings you right back where you were predestinated right amen never saw that before amen right never saw that before brings you right and what makes you believe the word of God and turn down these other things is because there's something in you way back y you were supposed you what you may you are made to live here forever now Blasphemous names 1962 I believe there is a bride that's predestinated I believe God said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination he didn't have a problem saying it then right he didn't say that wasn't a bad word to say he said I believe in predestination right that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there I hope I'm with her see I'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God and then sealed into theing kingdom of God there's the Holy Spirit brother Donnie there's the genuine works of God it's sealed until the day of redemption that was her dream he's talking about the sister that had a dream the church is predestinated to be there right there's a bride there's going to be a bride right gu what God everybody said well well then it seems like it's stamped no there are certain things that God said he was going to have but that he purposed in his mind I'm going to have children right I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have a future home whatever's in this book right here that that through what what happened Moses picked up the mind of God then what did he do he wrote it in a book well who was it Moses writing it no Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden who was in the Garden of Eden the one that was helping Moses right right he was just using Moses's hand right CU Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden right but the one that was right in he had got into the what he got into the mind of the composer come on Amen and he and the composer became one right but now remember Moses That Couldn't reside and stay on Moses that had to come away from Moses and he was just a mortal man right but what about you and I come on folks we're supposed to be that that thing comes on us and stays in us not that it just and I know there's different anointings that we have but we're supposed to be the mind of God all the time now listen there's one other thing Jesus said in Matthew 28:18 he said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given to me like we talked about the other night this is what sparked his old thing we were talking about that me and brother dick I believe that we've got to come to that place Amen to where we stand not just not just say I believe what he said right we can't just believe what he said right we got to become what he said amen and when Jesus stood and said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me where's the power of death and Hell where's the power of anything all power has been given unto me both in heaven and on Earth glory and where is that man tonight he's in the heart of the Believers hallelujah amen that is what Satan can't understand he can't understand that even all down through those Church ages there was a group of people that come to an understanding of God and it looked like that God wasn't even with those people like in the fourth age look like God had done like the author said stood back with his arms folded but all those people had to come there had to be a falling away there had to be a dying off for the for the uh the sheeps to come back up and to get the grain back out but let's one more thing let me see for my book we'll be done this little message called the word became flesh in India trip now brother Joe you don't have these this is 1954 brother brandom just got back from India October the 3rd 1954 and he's speaking about the India trip and then he preached a little message because of the word becoming flesh this is 1954 right page 26 paragraph 124 and every word in the Bible is God's thought laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass right thank you amen hard to swallow amen let me read that one more time how big does it make you not and every word word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass Glory that's the speaking of the word right see what I mean how powerful could the church be this is 1954 right right the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinking in think in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought right so God in the creation created the world by his thought first then he spoke it right right and the thought expressed became material see what I mean now he didn't stop there listen to this now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that if that same mind that was in Christ be in you oh how much could it say let there be no cancer oh my and it would be gone come on GL let the blind eyes be opened yes and it would be so right so it's your thought Jesus said verily you said that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for ver verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain right be moved and plucked and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say it'll come to pass you'll have whatever things thou sayest is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception that's right read right or you can quote it right listen to this I'm going to read it slow but if let me read the the sentence over again now you can EXP express it by mental conception period but if it becomes a real revelation of God glory that you see it before it happened yeah and express it in word form come on that word takes a hold oh my and becomes material come on think about it a thought expressed right if your heart and your mind mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts oh thank you Lord you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit as you so build until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be paragraph 131 I'm not finished it's get get it's good and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts then your thoughts will become words right and words will become material amen look how many times he said that I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves that they don't see themselves they don't have no Blank Spot on tape but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity amen because deity will be revealed in human beings amen but by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thoughts of their mind right let's stand he said our thoughts run different right A lot of times we walk up and say how do you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart and a lot of times we say I'm this and I'm that you don't mean that in your heart I don't mean it in my in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all that your entire makeup is of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts will be pure your heart your heart and you know what brought all this on let me tell you what brought all this on cuz you get over to the end of the book and brother Brenham is praying he said Lord page 40 and I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me oh my of saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God is the one to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy that's right when I was unlovable he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely let me love him the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in us I love him I love him and there several times in this book that when he got back from India a saving is to the last a prophet so so reading this word that I just read to you how gripping that was to me yes and he says all that came about because I had a selfish Spirit coming upon me and I was critical about about people yeah that's why he was coming I believe he was preaching the gospel and he was actually asking God said look that was in my mind so I I want that out of my mind s Gil I want this spirit that I've been reading you where so much of God is in my mind that I don't have a problem with somebody right that I don't have somebody's wrong brother R said if they're wrong let God deal with them but he had a selfish Spirit on him is what caused him really if you'll read this whole book it's a good book word become flesh in India trip 1954 read that book that's where these Quotes come from he want want the mind of Christ that's what I wrote here cuz that's what he wanted he said God I want your mind I don't want my selfish attitude my selfish spirit that I'm so selfish that I can't love my brothers right amen all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me and where did he give that power to I thought on the day of Pentecost he give it to the people the will sin is Will [Music] this wh and now guess what I'm bullheaded I'm bullheaded to the gospel want to be more bullheaded to the gospel but I don't want to be so have a so selfish Spirit though that I'm arrogant about it's like brother dick when I was reading that on the plane I was like Lord we got a long way to go I got a long way to go if that's what I got to be but see God said he'd show you where he's at if he shows you where he's at then he's got enough Grace to get you to where this is right here where I just read that brother Bram said we must become deity in human beings Glory where not just God's thought are just Bo by his stripes you're healed uh-uh no we're not doing away with this like brother's been preaching that's the foundation Glory let us go on to Perfection right brother you never had in the first place whatever you have is gone right Lord it never had a beginning right cuz all power in heaven Earth has been given unto you right so does the devil have it does some other person have it you have the Holy Ghost then you have exactly right that's too simple exactly let's sing a song Amen pick out some 46 in the notebook word of God every true 46 [Music] 4ly preserve for our

tomorrow is the day of Thanksgiving but we should be the most thankful people in the world God has G us all this true word mother de not a not a a guess now just like I said about the book brother Joe could guess what I was saying if he read my biography but if I was some way to impose take myself and put myself in brother Joe it wouldn't be a get well I I really don't understand what white was saying when he said he was but if I was somehow in that man you could read the words that I wrote and and just live it be right there just like it happened to you that's what I want us to do with this word of God because we've come to a place to where we've got this great message we've got this great church and I mean Church all over we've got these great people we're all nice we're all [Music] lovable but are we this are we this made manifest in human form flesh this thing right here is got to put Flesh on it right without putting Flesh on it it's going to be our condemnation cuz it's going to be laid before us right if we're not in it if we're in it like I said before you can take a flashlight and I can shine it in your eyes and it would blind you but if you ever could become that light that was in that flashlight it'd never put your eyes out it doesn't matter how bright it gets right you understand what I'm saying I can take that light and shine in Sister G's eyes and it would blind her but if she ever become that same light it never it would never ever ever blind her never bother her because she would become what was blinding her that's what God wants cuz Satan is blinded us to this exactly but if we become this that's why I titled it the way it did Satan can't stand this mystery of predestination cuz he can't become a part of it exactly that's his problem he can imitate it but he never can be it word of God ever true changing me changing you we have come with open heart oh let the word of God in one more time word of God true changing me changing you we have come with

Sermon\nLanguage:English\nURL:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt66Eg0-I_w\n========================================\n\nbrother Bron preached different messages on door he said uh door and door I stand at the door knock uh door to the heart but uh what what I want to talk this morning about is uh the key to the door then I went up here was faith is the key and Jesus is the door s right like to talk to Sister GW upstairs let's go to uh Revelation 20 verse1 in the message said ke to the door brother said now in the Book of Revelation beginning with verse one I wish to read the 20th verse on the first first verse of the 20th chapter he said I saw an angel come down from heaven having a key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he said now wish to speak if it would be if I could call it the text from this or draw a context from this text so that uh next 20 or 25 minutes I would like to call it the key to the door he said I do not wish to call it the keys because Peter was given the keys to the kingdom but I want to call it the key to the door he said now key notice here as we read that this angel came down from heaven having a key in his hand I believe it's Revelation 13 or 19 we find again another angel coming with a key and a key is a purpose of a key is to unlock something something that's been locked up or it's something that should be locked up but a key is given for that purpose now there are many kinds of keys because we have many US of keys there are keys to the storehouses there keys to your own house there's key to your automobile and we call them keys and they are keys and they can be duplicated many times or to the house there sometimes can be made what we call a skeleton key in other words it's a key that's kind of made with levels act on it that the twist the lock in a certain way and can almost unlock any door called a skeleton key it's a skeleton frame of many keys and they can be unlocked that way with our houses or even to our Auto automobiles can be duplicated any key cannot unlock no door unless it's used by hand it's got to have something to use the key the key in itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield men carry a few keys and women carry my keys somebody told me that a lot of women carry a lot of keys and puts a strain on your ignition I don't know if it's true or not asking sometimes they have to change that ignition itself because the way the technology is sh g roll may have SE for here lotions and hand sanitizer and all that stuff he when you asked me to borrow my keys I didn't know you were going to bash let's go to Daniel 124 Daniel 12 or four 12 12 go chapter the fourth verse it says uh thou Daniel shut up the works and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fr and knowledge shall increase you buy a electronic uh piece of equipment or something uh next week it might be up to leave they come out with something better Bea was sh me that U iPad I pretty neat you know you can write your little notes on there whatever you know up oh sorry now for your home they have that technology that you can uh open your door with the hardw work is still still in that and the you punch his numbers on your door and opens your door M or some building you can just scan a little part it open your door right and uh and your cars with this little clicker you can do a lot of stuff you can open your doors this open my windows my trunk and the new cars I don't have a new car that Esther has she can start a car from a this one and uh even brother Brandon talks about this car going down the road and that nobody's driving at the people are back playing some kind of game or something but I think I'm not sure I think they have to have the sensors or something to put on the road to make it oll I guess I got an article it says uh a California company Tuesday will announce an iPhone application and car receiver that will enable users to lock and unlock and remotely start to car with the phone rather than with the car car keys the Viper Smart Start is the latest example of automatic technology El Electronics functions migrating into Apple iPhone and other smartphones including turn by turn directions or located in the closest gas station says such ideas are Challen are a challenge for automakers aftermarket suppliers to for whom advanced auto electronics been highly profitable the Smart Start remote start and locked up lets the owner be really remote like Mike Simmons Executive Vice President of direct Electronics the parent at the maker has demonstrated starting his car using an eyeb bone starting his car in California using iPhone in Kansas City now I I don't know if how long it keeps it uh I guess brother Bo could have used this system last week and we all can once in all cuz we keep locking our keys but I try to have extra keys on my car somewhere because even I did it Monday I like the keys on the truck but I always keep an extra keys so he said what is a Smart Start GPS smart star GPS a combination of new hardware and update that works with the DM bunch of numbers is a brand new generation Smart Start modular with GPS built-in the new V2 Viper Smart Start includes a simple to use interactive manner for setting up GPS alerts to protect your vehicles and family like never before it's got a vehicle locator press the button on your smartphone and receive vehicle's current location plus speed if it's moving for the teenagers speed alert receive notification if the family vehicle exceed your

secure Stone around your vehicle so you'll be alerted if your vehicle Le The Zone hotspot s that's a virtual do not enter Sone around a location so it will be alerted if your vehicle goes there scheduling time frames and curfews for notifications the message ke to the said uh now key is the same thing pardon me the key is only to be held in a hand that unlocks the door see it's got to be hand and hand now and in the key I'm going to speak about tonight it's only one hand can hold this key and that's the the hand of Faith it's the only thing can hold this key and hand whole other keys and he takes a hand I paid for that the same message now there is such an evil as polio M Small Co yellow Beaver p l so forth the sign this evils has been able to fly day and night till they found inoculation from it because it's evil it's a killer how much more is there a key to Salvation for a man that's imprison House of sin there's a key to that door to liberate men from it a key used usually when you turn the lock and when you find a key it's got to be some treasure something that's worthwhile or you want to even lock it up if it ain't worth locking it up just let it go but when it's worth locking it up so key usually is a note to something or the way to enter to something that's worthwhile the key that's what's it for now it unlocks something that's worth well let's go to St John 10 John 10 starting at uh start at 7 s verse then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever come before me are thevs and rubbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man Enter he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I'm the good Shepherd the Good Shepherd give his life for the sheep and he did at the cross but he that is in Harland and not the shepherd who's own the sheep or not see if the wolf cometh and leaveth the sheep and flee and the Wolf catch them and scare the Sheep the harling flee because he is a harling and care not for the Sheep said I am the good Shepherd and know my sheep I am known of mine as the father knowe me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep brother brother boy talks about when he goes to camp he lays at the close to the door so them kids don't get out at night so he's kind of like playing that the Good Shepherd at the door Jesus said I the door to sheep I'm the door not a door the door the only door on the on the way the only way the truth and life and no man cometh unto the father but by me I'm the door to the che and all that come before me is enemies theves and R he's the door to sheeple he is the door to Salvation there's not another name given under heaven where you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ no church no denomination no Creed no doctrines of anything only through Jesus name that is that is the key no wonder Peter could use one of them on the key they a Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into the door he used the the key and there's only only one key because there's just one door I am the door and Peter had that key to it and he said repent every one of you and be be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the commission of your sins and you shall receive the treasures of God it's the key to the door and Jesus is the door there's only one door to healing and Jesus is that door there's only one door to peace yeah my peace I give unto you he's only one he's the only Lord to jine peace you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home might accumulate no money to get your children cloes have food to eat but you might have accumulated enough populated to be popular amongst the people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace and that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one one peace and that's Jesus is the peace peace are peace he our healing I'm the Lord Our God and heals all our diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other or no other way but through Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven and now Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key and unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all this Promises of God they and has finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God see he is Faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that faith and his finished work is this keys that were were speaking on now in Hebrews 11 chapter I got a great string of themer rald down here of these Heroes of fa it was the key to the door that stuffed them mou the Lions it was the key of faith that unlocked the prison houses he was Faith the key of faith that quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword but the dead back to life again it was Faith the key of faith in the living of God that had that man that woman who can take the key of faith that can unlock every promise God made but if you haven't got that key you're just you you'll never unlock it you'll be against it because this key any correct make key have levs on the inside of lock that they take a certain form certain shape of anti to turn this level and just one little level out of the way will mess the whole thing up you know a key that locks unlocks too see me can't lose her V that's right the same key that locks unlocks the key that unlocks and lock up and that's exactly see because it works both ways how pitiful it is that church has lost his vision of that What a Sad thing it was when the church sold the sell out to Creed as we've done today and now called to unite see the key Vision the word of the Lord there's nothing can change it or stop it what the church needs tonight is not an education what the church needs tonight is not a denomination what the church needs tonight is not a greed what the church needs tonight is a key to the scripture the door which Christ is the door and he is the work faith and the work of the Living God out of let's go to Matthew uh 7 78 said ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that ask it receive it and he that seek it find it and he and through him that knock it shall be open the key is ask ask is the key just like brother talks about sister uh hary right that she said the right thing he said uh he said God just told me that you could ask for anything that you wanted but she asked for the Salvation of the two boys he said he would ask for a million God been obligated let's go to Psalms uh 8410 David said for day that course is better than thousand I rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tense wickedness let's go to 1 Chronicles 15:23 now David wasn't just talking about being a a a doorkeeper cuz they there is doorkeepers to the ark and uh one place in Second Kings I talked about three ladke Keepers right here talks about two uh 1 Chronicles 1523 I don't know why they make these Nam so hard to pronounce and bar CH and El were doorkeepers for the ark this go to Matthew uh 3134 25 25 sorry 25 25 31 and 34 it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels of him and then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gather all nations he shall separate them from one another as a Shepherd divides his sheep his sheep from his goats and he shall set the Sheep on the right his right hand but the goat on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed are my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so we have to we have to make sure we are cheap not goats or something else amen thank you thank you\n"}, {"id":

20 verse 19 oh open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord unto which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee now remember it's a gate it's an opening a way to enter there in all right you'll find out later while we keep reading this same scripture because it has everything in it that we want to cover in the series that we're trying to to do all right I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord all right let's go over to 1 John 2 we just use verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking for quite a while this is message number nine on the coming of the Lord now as one believer in the Bible I believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ right now I don't believe it like we used to believe it but uh you know you know we used to be Tau that there'd be something out in the Eastern Skies would split and we'd hear a great big too too you know and the Lord would come down and the dead would be raised and you'd know he's doing that because all the graves be open and airplanes be crashing out of the Skies called the pilot went to Rapture you know different things you know we we used to to believe all of those things but through the opening of the word we come to find out that those things are not necessarily uh true uh we were doing the best we could do right but now through the the end time with the prophet's message and all uh we should be able to talk about the coming of the Lord in a greater manner or way than ever before because of him speaking to us the things of God right now I preached our last Wednesday on a message and I titled it um let's see something I forgot how I even titled it but anyhow it's the coming of the Lord but I want to make sure you get that tonight I want to make sure because I don't want us to make miss this point I believe if we miss this point we will miss uh the rest of it as we try to go along but now I've been speaking as I said about the second coming of Jesus Christ right now in the second coming of Jesus Christ I've given it to you over and over uh where the Prophet said the second coming of Jesus Christ would be the bride coming of Christ right right coming out of the church all right now so that's the second coming of Jesus Christ and we know for assurity that the prophet taught us that he will not set foot on Earth in this coming you know physically be here on Earth as a being so that does away from what we used to think about the sky of splitting and all of the things that would happen you know and all so then and we know that the second coming of Jesus Christ as I said last Wednesday has got to be covered in three stages or phases or whatever you want to call it I don't have the education but um not much sense but I do know that if you cross up the scriptures or the prophet's message then if you mislocate it you know misinterpret it Etc miss you you're going to miss the whole thing so in the second coming of Jesus Christ you got to cover the bride coming to Christ right coming out of the Church you got to cover the two witnesses going to Israel right and 144,000 receiving Christ right and still that will not be a physical uh mortal being standing there it'll be through the two witnesses all right then it goes on over and the prophet said that Jesus does not come back to earth until the Millennium so then in the Millennium would be finishing up the second coming which would would cover and not only will we be there but the 144,000 will also be there so it's all related to the to the same thing but that's what we've been trying to get you to see but if you cross up your scriptures see and and you say well well look at there it says the Lord's coming and and even to the Jews you know the 144,000 it says they'll say where did you get the nail prints in your hand well what do you mean the god out nail prints show them to them you know see and that's what we think we have it all figured out in our understanding but then we find out that the Corporal body of Jesus Christ does not come back that way all right see then in the second coming we're looking for some kind of a second coming you know something to come down right like that all right and I gave it to you I don't think you have them tonight in your notes but we'll be glad to show them to you page what is it 208 is that the one I gave him last week or 308 of the seal book where brother R said the second coming of Jesus Christ The Rapture right because we meet him in the air he doesn't come here physically right we meet him in the air all right now that's tying together all the scriptures see then in that way then looking at the second coming it's not looking looking for something to up there that's coming down here that way right see it's looking at it as a scriptural lineup of the truth to see that uh you know then we we look at it to see what what is his second coming and as I said the prophet said it's the bride coming to Christ right amen coming out of the church what is the rapture going to do to you and I what is this message supposed to do to you and I get us out of the church amen that's right all right get us out of our ideas well I never was brother Dale I never went to a church well you're just as bad as anybody else cuz we were all born that way right that's the human mind that's what the prophet is talking about not because you as brother Mo you say you can get your coat and hat and leave a church and go to another church what good have you done right but if it's not a coming out then where are we all right so now we read then and try to use that for a background I'm sorry that to try to these that are here but to try to move on because I don't like to keep backing up so much uh the tapes are there you're welcome to get them and the quotes are there now as I said we were talking about in the message there of to where the Prophet called it let me see entitled the message even to that appearing before his coming right and he says that there's two different words there now the word appear is used in John but in uh 1 Peter 1:7 it talks about the appearing you know of the Lord and the prophet said there's a difference in the appearing he said in the scriptures you got two different words all right that's what we want to talk about tonight two different words appearing and coming all watch are two different works right one is appearing the other one is coming right two different works you say well now works is something we do we see there's your definition on it so let's go over just while we're getting that point and let's read it look at Romans uh 9 and let's get a little something that this script opened up to me years ago and and I really thank God for it let look at Romans 9 verse 27 excuse me verse 28 for he will finish the work once and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth now our definition of that would mean that God meant for it to go this far but he decided to cut it off is that what it kind of looks like you know that maybe God intended for it to go on down this way but he decided no I'll just cut it off here now you'll understand then why I'm using the word as two different words are two different works because the original translation of Romans 9:28 which uses the word work but that word work is 3056 in your Strong's Concordance which means word right the Lord is going to do a short word he's not going to do a short word he's not going to cut it short in righteousness he's not going to as I said have his thoughts of enduring this but instead of that well I'll just cut it off no he's going to do a short word right that's what your original says huh word works the word works there is 3056 words or word saying speech I like this a word uttered by a living voice right now that's how the strongs concordance so it's not a short work that he was going to do and going to quit it and all it's a short word right what's he going to do he's going to pour it in in hurry in the last days right it's not that he's going was intending to reveal whole lot of word and he's going to cut it out no he's going to reveal it in a hurry amen I mean it used to be that some of you were there and things and especially people here in the message tonight that you know back even in my day that we would uh we'd get a tape or two and get a book or two and and it' be a while before we get anything else you know and we just wasn't able to say well brother BR said this said this said this well see I had it in my Bible because there in in John where we was reading about the difference in the appearing and the coming I had a couple of messages written there and showing that brother brandham said that there was a difference in the two words right all right now we went through and there laying in the office if you want it we went through this past Wednesday with the the part of showing the difference between the word appearing right and the word coming literally in the scriptures right the word appearing is like I said in 1 Peter 1:7 it means to uncover or lay open what has been veiled or covered up disclose make bar to make known make manifest disclose what before was unknown that's what the appearing is right all right but then the word coming is the Greek word used 3950 uh two which is the word they argue in the message a lot about that's called paraca or perusia see that was the they say it's pronounced paria that's all right I don't know the difference I just know the definition CU I can read right see the King James version says in 1 John 228 at his coming the original translation says in the presence of him that is what the word coming means cuz it means coming it means presence it means the coming arrival Advent especially the future visible return from Heaven of Jesus to raise the dead hold the last judgment and set up formal and glorious the kingdom all right so I gave you the definitions to were that you would have it to be able to understand the prophet said it's two different words right one of them is something being seen the other one is in physical actual happen happening now that's where that then in the actual happening I'll get to it later on the message where the Prophet said that Jesus would be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go in Rapture I've given you that quote over and over what the Holy Ghost was given for all right but that's not physical that's not mortal amen that's visible right visible means apparent to the eye Webster in other words it's not the physical eye necessarily it's the spiritual eye that sees you don't see with your natural eye you see with your your your inward being your ey is only a transmitter of backwards and forward all but see then to be visible Among Us doesn't mean he's going to be standing here in the physical body right amen no it means he's going to be here so visible until it's close to the fact but it will be outside of a glor a body like that cuz we're his body amen right why would he want to come back now we're his body amen right all right that's why we meet him in the air amen we only meet we only meet him in the air in the when it comes to the basis that he can be visible Among Us right right amen now in that then is the statement and reason why I preach the way I do cuz I believed this for 40 years I guess I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ to the bride you understand the bride amen is what the prophet said coming out of the church so I believe that on the day of Pentecost started the second coming of Jesus Christ amen we'll get to that point in a minute I believe that on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost descended that that started the second coming amen all right now then that would be finished in this day amen I don't want to go too far on the word of it because I want to keep your thought in a line but if you'll just get the definition of the words and look at those words I ask you to read those quotes that I gave you last Wednesday old over and over and over how many I ain't going to ask for to raise hand but that's the way brother Rams one it said it right all right see then he said there's a difference in the appearing and the coming right right a difference in the appearing and the coming he said in the scripture so I gave you the definition of the words appearing in coming now see I believe that's what I I just tell you what I believe I don't hide nothing with nobody I believe that the Lord can appear in many places that's right amen okay I believe he can appear out there in the denominations tonight right I believe he can appear in the Catholic church that's right I believe he can appear in the in the the mosque of Omar right I believe he can appear in many places all right because that is a spiritual sense he can be there if there's anybody ever healed anywhere when the Beatles were singing the songs right and and the the people were healed who healed them the be a come on right no it had to be the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ CU only God is the Healer right all right so presence are appear the appearing he can be anywhere he can appear in a barroom like Brother Richard Wilson tells you about his testimony that he was sitting in a bar and and drinking Y and he turned to start out and when he did said a voice said you won't be back in here again well brother R said on the tape one day he said he may have to come in the barroom and get you you see now now that was his appearing right amen okay cuz he can appear but now the coming of the Lord see the appearing is apparent to the eye or like Paul I gave you the definitions like the word Vision the word vision is the same word as appear appearing Etc all right but the word coming is his presence right right now his presence now you got to hold on cuz listen his presence is not in the barroom right he didn't give you the new birth sitting on the bar stool he called you out of the barroom I read one time about these women that were in a thing you know and they do a strip tease and then when it was over with they'd sat down and talk to the people about the Lord and try to get people converted what to right the bar room and the stripped off naked woman come on but that's the way people think right right see the women thought that was their Ministry to get people saved like Brother Gary Atkins used to say about the if that what is hippie Street down in town was what it supposed to be you know the love movement you the hippies then they already had it but no but now listen his appearing can be in many places but his coming is only through his presence being revealed to you amen that's why I believe the new birth is the revealing of God's word amen you tell me what else it is right shouting screaming Glory Hallelujah no that's after effects right that is not the new birth that's what you do after you get the new birth the birth is the birth of the word amen see the birth of the word brings the presence of God to you then the presence of God is a greater form our works of God than in his appearing when we go out of here in the Rapture you know what a lot of people will still be shouting Glory hallelujah amen right but the Lord's done gone Prophet said he's still thinking to getting the Holy Ghost right now let me ask you a question for where I won't miss it cuz I got in here somewhere what was the first coming of the Lord now he appeared many times throughout the Old Testament many forms many ways Pillar of Fire Cloud even as mount chesc amen Angel of the Lord to be in the fiery furnace with the Hebrew children he appeared in many ways but one day he came in human flesh amen that was his first coming am right right yes so what would you want to change the second coming Brother Gary to be right why do you want to try to make it some form that it's not what exactly what the first coming would be the first coming was God revealed in human flesh amen the second coming is what God revealed in your flesh by the new birth so he begin his second coming on the day of Pentecost amen we're in the ending of all things you know we're in the ending of all forms I don't don't think I've run out of something and run off because we're going to get into one of these days talking about the coming of the Lord as The Headstone you'll see why I kept reading Psalms all right so don't worry about that going on down the road I'm going to cover one of these days and got notes for it to cover that he will become visible Among Us where your Prophet said it and raised the dead and we go in Rapture amen so don't worry about it just just listen see see I believe that the Lord has been coming since the day of Pentecost in the heart of the bride of Christ right because that was what would be taking the bride out of the church now is your thoughts that when the prophet said the second coming of Jesus Christ is is the bright coming of Christ coming out of church that that's just in this time no right am he's been coming all the way down to that cuz it's not a physical coming but it's a presence of himself right In You by the new birth right now do you see the difference in the appearing but he can appear to you to lead you out of a bar run but when he gives you the new birth that's not his appearing that's right amen that's his coming to you amen well I I heard that not in the denomination they talking about to come and is coming to you well that's all right you're going to hear it a whole lot more if you hang around here amen because that's what I believe right go what are you looking for right oh no we're not looking for the Eastern Skies to split we're not looking for the trumpet to sound we're not well what do you believe well I just believe in his coming well praise the Lord I do too I'm just not looking for it up there right about 30 something years ago the Lord showed me something and you know I quit then trying to go to heaven that's right am because I realized if I ever got there that he's going to have to come here and get me and take me there right but he's not coming here physical right Corporal body and get me I'm going to meet that in the a right they going to come here in a presence that's right so don't worry about it that in you word is it really you know the brothers preached it and I'm not against that's their business they preached the peruas 1963 and that's when the Lord came and there's a lot of Truth to what they're talking about but I believe that the Lord came by the new birth amen because 1963 doesn't have anything to do with me and you unless we're born again right that's right that's right I mean if you're not born again they don't have anything do we you amen it's a condemnation right all right now God is living in You by the new birth are the word being revealed to you which is not just a a uh an anointing right because you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit right and die and go to hell right well wouldn't that be appearing come on I gave you a lot of the quotes where the brother ROM was covering he said appearing now in the church right course you know everybody said oh yeah he appeared and around him we believe that but I gave you the quotes where he was talking about about the appearing in the church amen in the bride all right now I gave you these this is one that was given to you last Wednesday where brother Brown says on we would see Jesus 1962 627 you don't have this one now you'll have one to follow in this one you see the West Coast the s o n is appearing before his coming he's appearing before he's coming remember appearing and coming is two different words see he's appearing now into church showing himself alive after 2,000 years sir we would see Jesus two different words right appearing and coming now pick up where you got them I just added that one cuz I've got the others laying here and if you want them after the service we'll be glad to give them to you of all of the quotes that we used last week but in the message perseverance preach in 1962 608 did you know that the Bible speaks of the appearing of the Lord and also the coming of the lord it's two different works now look at you no it's two different works why I titled it two different words two different works is two different works right search it and find out if that's right the appearing and the coming is two different things the appearing of the Lord is now he's appearing amongst his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical being it will be to catch the church up you go right on down reading the rest of goes on down in that's paragraph uh I e95 e96 so the Lord is now appearing among his people great signs and wonders raising the dead Healing The Sick and doing the very same things he did that hasn't been done for 2,000 years now like I said Wednesday brother brandham prayed for a man for his nose to be restored a few days later it was restored brother Bosworth if I Ain mistaken prayed and it was instantly healed or restored see we think brother randam was the only one that had it why don't you think he called it Divine Healing campaign right or Roberts and all of those men went forth that God was using them amen it was a healing campaign T osbor all those men used to do great wonders and signs am well we don't know about that we just know about brother brand well you're not even in his coming anyway so you don't have the new birth right you had a new birth you'd have enough sense to realize what it said the true right that he was back there he's still here now right if you can't see him now in the new birth and his presence with you healing and delivering right amen then you're blind right amen it's a best way to say it at least you can't say I don't play around you I tell you like it is because brother R said when you say it hard and strong people won't know won't think you're trying to pull something over on you say it real soft you know they don't know what you're doing but now listen brother brandom says on Christ The Mystery of God revealed that he had to wait God had to wait page 32 number two on your nose he had to wait until the secret could be given in full right look at what under line waiting to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it waiting for it to be fully comprehended what's he talking about the next paragraph tells you now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming right well brother Dale the prophet said he didn't even know how he's coming and you told us his coming was the New Birth well if you're not sensible enough to know what the prophet is doing you need a new birth come on because surely at this time he knew what the second coming of Jesus Christ was right amen this is 63 you know by then he knew cuz he preached a three-fold revelation of it that's right right Amen on the seventh seal he only preached one fold of it spoke a little bit of the second stopped and left it for quite a while then on Christ of mystery he preached the three-fold Revelation amen of what the coming of Jesus Christ right right and that way he said it had to be weit until it could be comprehended what what was he waiting for it to be able to comprehend is coming you say but now now Jesus didn't even know no but I can quote too because I remember everybody calls me intellectual and that's all right if that's because I can quote brother ROM you got a problem brother rown said when Jesus come to John on patmas he knew when he would be coming and he said he put it there when he come to John on pmas he knew when he would be coming cuz he had went back to where he was originally and come back that's right all right now see if we must meet him in the air and he does not come to Earth in a physical body then we better be thinking about the coming of the Lord has been revealed right what do you think of his message was Far amen I haven't even got to the scripture where it said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel trumpet I even got to there yet we just building the background to talk about some things right see it is only revealed the second coming of Jesus Christ can only be revealed to those who have the new birth amen that don't mean a light bub turned on does it right that ought to be sensible the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ what except what am your Prophet said except by the new birth right cuz you're only saying what somebody else says and that's her problem Mama told us come on brother mama said the heavens are open one of these days like I told you somebody told me when I was a little kid that I know when the Lord was coming because it'd be a cloud and there'd be an umbrella in the cloud oh man I'd go out every time he come up a cloud I'm looking for an umbrella what was your stupidity I admit mine what is yours now come on I will admit what I am but listen the prophet said there's a difference in the appearing and the coming right now I used to think as I told there was only just a few of those until I I got to run it through the computer again and I got to find in a whole lot and I gave them to you last week and uh you know a lot of the things and if you would have time and you want to read them I'll be glad for you to take these where that he says that the appearing of the Lord comes before the coming of the Lord that's the message letting off the pressure 62 it is I Be not Afraid you know there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ that's two different words all together the appearing now to church we see him right Be not Afraid 62 there's a different word used the appearing and of Christ and the coming of Christ there two different words all together Christ is appearing in these last days in his church bringing his church together in unity we would see Jesus 62 after 2,000 years we see the infallible proof that we can see Jesus us he's appearing in our midst just before his coming he's making his appearance in his church in the last days you'll be welcome to these I don't mean that sarcastically I'm just say it if you don't know brother R said it run in the message appearing and then coming now there is some catches to it that sometimes it will not appear it's appearing and coming so if you want these welcome to cut you down on your short on trying to do it but go back last Wednesday and you hear the prophet saying the things that I'm talking about cuz you see I believe he's been appearing right but the mystery of it was at the same time he was appearing his coming was transpiring right amen cuz he was coming in the bride right who led Luther out of the Catholic Church that was this coming we see to be climaxed in you and I because the prophet of God said the coming of the Lord is Mystery is in a mystery his coming is in a mystery amen we know in the Scripture it talks about the mystery of the Gentiles everybody thinks of what brother Ram is talking about when he'll use that scripture he's not talking about the coming of the Gentiles Bing knew about that and told us about he's talking about an end time coming the word of the Lord can descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel will have to be in the bride cuz she's the final voice under her message let me quote it under her messenger she'll be the final voice to the final age amen so the voice of the Resurrection will have to be in the bride amen God's waiting on you and IA right but in time where he can pour in his fullness right amen come on you see I want to make sure you understand see the seventh seal souls in prison you look at number five on your notes watch that seven that's the Finish seventh is always a mystery that was the coming of the Lord and noticed he said that was the coming of the Lord right amen right like I said to you I haven't got to this yet so hang on to it all the quotes that you find of the appearing and the coming was from 62 back I've never found one after 62 where he was talking about the peering and the coming of two different words if you do let me know it's all right it won't change what I'm saying right could you see he was looking at the peering of Jesus Jesus Christ but when he met God out there and come back to preach those seals he never spoke anymore about his appearing right he never spoke of anything that's why he called let's see where it say don't Christ the mystery the seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbid to write the coming of the Lord what is the coming of the Lord Brother Brandon Feast of the trumpets number six on your notes 64 719 the seventh seal has an open yet you know that's his coming see the seventh is a mystery that's is coming and you can't explain that to anyone else right because it can only be revealed to you personally amen I can't reveal it to you brother randam couldn't reveal it to you right that's right now brother randam said Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that that's right that's right so now no man can reveal to another man anything right right you can only use words to speak of something long enough for the Holy Spirit to be able to Quicken it in your heart now if you don't have the Holy Spirit that's why you see so many doctrines that's right and ideas see Amen in the denominations and in this message y because everybody has their own concept y That's right people actually literally preached years ago the perusia or paria people now I ain't saying everybody cuz but the ones I heard was preaching what that in 1963 the Lord came well then others went on to make brother r on that Lord and how that the Lord died on amarilla road and in Texas 65 but you see I believe what the prophet is talking about amen but I believe there's a difference in the appearing amen and the coming right amen and then you'll see one day why that it was up until 62 he kept speaking and I ain't one of them come on I don't play games I'm not one of them that until 62 he taught one thing and after 62 he taught something else I do not believe that I believe he talked the same all the way through he so he changed the new birth show me where it did Future home he said that he taught three processes from the beginning and show me where he changed that's right oh of course that doesn't do any good but it just flows through people's mind right on out the other side and they pass it back behind them to the next one cuz they got it all figured out right you see brother Ram didn't have it figured out right God is the only one that knows am that's right but if he can reveal that mystery read Christ The Mystery of God revealed when he gets over about page 17 and talking about the coming of the Lord the seventh seal Yen and showing you exactly what it is in a three-fold revelation amen all God was he pour into Christ all Christ in the church and what then to take her back to the Garden of Eden right restore Fallen Eve amen all right so now you say well brother D what are you talking about he's appearing among us but if we can just see what that new birth means right you say brother Dale you preached so deep I don't understand you show me how more simple you can make it please come up here and do it and I'm not saying it wrong right women whatever come on tell us how simple it is right when I preach that the coming of the Lord is a revealing of his word that gives you a new birth right making you God manifested in human flesh for the portion you are right amen when all of that is finished brother said when that Holy Ghost is fully given out it'll be all with right because the coming of the Lord is what the revealing of his Worden and you tell me how more simple that can be you know the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right that's what he says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen that's why he calls it Christ the mystery didn't say Jesus the mystery M cuz Jesus never fulfilled the full mystery it was all in him yeah cuz we were in him Amen in the New Birth not in physical people but it's Christ the mystery brother R said I couldn't understand how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something he said until I seen it was Christ he didn't say I seen it was Jesus he said I seen it was Christ amen the Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's right now listen we must during the time that he's appearing in this last days with great signs and wonders now are you are you going to be dumb enough excuse me are you going to be far enough off to say that that that God is not outd there in the denominations Healing The Sick are you that far mentally off that he's not out there Healing The Sick and doing great wonders come on he's out there more than most of us because that's all they dealing with but see that's his anointing right right exactly right that's his anointing that's out there amen but that's not his coming right right amen he's only coming in his bride am amen not Rebecca knew what Isaac looked like right right amen right now come on I guess we we we get into a lot of things but I mean you pick out a husband a wife for your husband and and then you w't at least tell them what it look like you know I mean even in these marriage things that brother prash and India and them they do at least they know most all way their life that that who they're going to marry maybe because they and they've seen them and and everything else it's not just a guy over here decides to get this and his over side well let's put them together and make a marriage no they know a lot about each other Rebecca had heard so much about Isaac right right until she said is that him standing in the field I your Prophet used that to show what that Jesus we would meet him in the air right right amen but we're going to have to know all about him right because if not we're going to be caught by these Antichrist oh my that will be telling us they are Jesus and they are this and they're that right but see Rebecca she knew but there's another thing that Rebecca done you remember the story of the little woman that armor meat packing company man down to find a wife and he told her I'll be back in one year yeah well in that story The Prophet never said that he provided her a garment she got herself ready right she got her own dress she done her own thing amen but in God see God supplies everything but you know Rebecca she wasn't running out through there across the yard you know looking like Joy saw me going through Walmart one day with an old slashy hat pulled over one way and a and an old flattery looking shirt that was one color and a pair of pants it was another and paint all over them and wearing tennis shoes it was wor slap out and my toes were sticking out and uh I was going to speak to her when she came around cuz I saw her but she didn't know who I was she could only see from the head down and she walked around she didn't say hey Pastor she didn't say that you know what she said she said you know what I just talk who in the world girl would look like that it would me her pastor but you see now Rebecca was ready right amen Rebecca was ready right the little girl was ready relationship Hallelujah we got to be ready you got to put on the wedding garment he supplies it don't worry about trying to get it and don't worry about it whether it fits or not don't worry about whether it's got to be reemed or SE or else don't worry about it it'll fit perfectly because it's the word cuz we're not all the there none of us is all of the word that's why I believe the coming of the Lord is around the world right I don't believe it's just in Lula Georgia righten I believe it's around the world as the revealing of God's word right amen and seeing the bride of Christ got to couple of from Brother Rocky most of you remember from from uh Philippines and uh brother uh narcis got an email telling me that they were praying for my wife Hallelujah I mean one called me the other day he said brother there when you coming I said look man I can't come now I'm sending to you years old I'm wore out we got to let somebody else do these things bless he said well we just want to know when you're coming see people want to hear the word that's right right amen they're tired of hearing Doctrine they got emails but this man said he was tied up in this certain Doctrine y was that actually about the coming of the Lord and how did he come there in 63 and that's it you know you just you did you see church we were 963 right but see God was there that was the coming of the Lord to the prophet amen right right which was the revealing of the word right now it's got to be the coming of the Lord to you and I and the word is our wedding garment that we must put on F vir H his temper patience G in this brotherly kindness right the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then finally The Headstone amen M that headstone is not going to sit down on the foot come on that's right God ain't going to adopt a child just because he's 2 years old and because he belongs to his mom and daddy right and I like the way that I believe it too that God ain't going to adopt the devil's children that's right he's going to make you a child of his before he starts your adoption you can holler all you want to I come into the world with this I come into the world with that would just holler all you want to cuz you're going to be in the tribulation one of these days and just keep on hollering that's right said Brother D you shouldn't why not Isaac had left the father's house when he met Rebecca in the field right we got to be prepared to meet him right that can only be done by the revealing of God's word amen what can take away the things are are are clothe us I just don't I don't want to be clothed with a uh you see me on Wednesday we always say they going around here on Wednesday where's a TI of preacher you know and you see me at Wednesday I walk in the door and they say well we no you're not going to preach tonight well see I I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not just that old preacher image that my brother-in-law he used to cut his grace and work on his car and everything else with a suit on I'm not joking you never SE him didn't I was suit them I see I'm I'm sorry I'm not that I guess the only thing I got for me I can preach a little you know but listen folks he must appear That's right now tie this together I'll quit in that appearing is where he becomes visible right that's right now that sounds a little odd don't do away with the appearing and start oh we're in the coming we're in the coming oh now we're in the coming we're not in appearing no more we're in the coming we toot you horn all you want to you going to be in the tribulation tooting it he's appearing now right he's going to become visible Among Us right he's going to raise the dead and we're going to go into Rapture right it's not you and me right is him amen it is he that hath made us and not we are his not we ourselves right he's made us for a purpose to know and realize the coming of the Lord is that new birth that's within your heart but that's not the finish of the coming of the Lord come on Amen right that's just the beginning of the coming that's right but that is the beginning of it right as Jesus was there on Earth he appeared in the Old Testament as the Christ right right but then one day he walked out there in human flesh right amen by the new birth is God in you I've heard people say that I wish I could come to the place where that that it would be like Jesus where he says he's pleased to dwell what you don't have the new birth then because if you got the new birth exactly where he said he he pleased to dwell in you right amen are you going to wait till you get up to the top of the pyramid then he gets pleased no amen he either dwells in you by the new birth or he's not d right we don't grab ourselves like brother Mo said by shoe heels our straps you know strings and jump up in The Headstone right now you're going to have to be birthed into it you're going to be born into these things and being born into him can only be one thing what the revealing of his word right amen I'm not looking for his coming I'm saying he's here right now I'm going to make one more statement and I'll quit Brother Gary tell them what page it's on bless he knows what I'm saying I preached the seals back there in 79 then preached it again in ' 82 cuz it wasn't satisfied I didn't finish in 79 and I couldn't see the end of all things but in ' 82 I begin to preach the seals I've never preached on them again why cuz I don't need to right but you know in that I made a statement I said why is people so concerned about the coming of the Lord you realized that when he raised from the dead he appeared right now are you listening he appeared to those and they went out a message that he is risen right right right well why wouldn't the seventh seal being in the end of all things be one simple thing he is here right he is here well where's he at get born again you'll know exactly where he's at he's inside of you by the new birth that's his coming I that's not all of it I've never taught nothing like that I said we'll get to the point of the coming of The Headstone cuz we could preach the statue of a perfect man of the coming of virtue to Faith and then knowledge coming Temperance coming patience coming godliness coming all of those things is is coming just get one thing appearing it's like Visions it's like apparent to the eye which means that it's not necessarily to the physical eye it doesn't even mean that in Webster it can be the spiritual eye of understanding I've had a couple of Visions I used to say I had one now I've had two and those Visions I had nothing to do with it I was standing here reading the scripture one night and looking down reading the scripture literally and some other form took over and I kept reading and right across there I saw the coming of the Lord I'm just tell you what I saw all right and that's what I try to preach cuz I saw like the United States and like the old uh Pony Express When They Carried the mail you know and how they You' seen movies where they put the Pony Express guy you know and he runs to Utah over into Arizona and then he you know the hores that's what I saw but you you know what I saw I saw each state with a little light in it that was the coming of the Lord right but listen Church those Visions can be tampered with by Satan right that's right he can impersonate all of them but there's one thing he can't impersonate he cannot impersonate the second coming of Jesus Christ he knows nothing about it right you say he just heard it cuz you said it that don't make any difference right if it can't be revealed to him he doesn't know what I'm talking about right I think people to tell me you need to be careful what you say cuz the devil hears it hey I want him to hear it I wish he could get born again bless him and if he got born again he'd be able to understand what I'm talking about right but he can't do it why cuz he turned it down right don't turn down the Simplicity of the new birth right do you understand Jesus appeared in the Old Testament but then he was come that was his first coming what would be the difference then in his second coming he would appear down through time on one side of the gauge is appearing the other way he's coming right but see that's a mystery that's been hidden from the foundation of the world but is now made known by the end time Prophet it is appearing and coming is two different words brother Dale you're not yes I'm looking for one of these days there something to happen and we go up in the sky right and we'll meet him in the air right that's right don't believe in getting a new body believe in this body being redeemed right you're all laughing at the hospital about it you know we were laughing a little bit today about it you know some of you who got nuts and bolts and screws Danny was here he tell you about all of The Metalist was in his body you know what in one way or another he's getting a new body he's got a new elbow he I mean a shoulder my wife's got a new knee you know but that ain't it because you could make all of it over you remember the $6 Million Man where they found a brain and a heart and this that and the other and they made him a body oh Danny he's almost on a million now you getting all these new parts but that ain't doing no good that's right cuz it's the same body my wife goes into the change she won't carry the metal with her and have to worry about the metal detector going off when she gets to Glory bless amen it'll be this body redeemed right the prophet said ever higher you ever lost right God knows about it amen that's right I know this is kind of a comical way of expressing it but I remember brother Hans is preaching one time you go take you take bass at your house over about 10 years there's actually bigger you in the septic tank than there are are standing there looking at me right said what well you wash all skin every time don't you but you see that's not what God's going to do reach down the septic tank and grab your body he's going to speak you come from the original amen because you remember how I preached it Jesus's body brother BR said come from the 16 elements of the earth and you tell me it come out of this dirty earth and I'm going to tell you I don't believe it right I don't believe running around talking about it coming out of the dirty earth right right I believe he was talking about from the original that brought Adam amen which was a word right you see why I love the word amen come on brother I love that word so what is it two different words now keep it in mind read those things over and over what appearing and then coming he's appearing but his coming is a secret amen that's right the only way you can know that secret is be a part of it right course the way we do it is about like the little boy little boy one time he was going to tell somebody something and he said I want to tell you something said it's the secret said me and Grandpa he said only one that knows it he stood there a minute and he he started crying he said you know I forgot what it is and said now Grandpa's only that knows it you see the secret coming of the Lord to take you and I away the revealing of his word right I'd like to hear your definition about it I'll be glad to sit down and talk with anybody about it around the world internet or whatever as you explaining all about the coming I don't send me a thing that he come in 63 I believe he did but that was to brother brandom only amen but I believe the reason he never spoke of the appearing and coming after the opening of the seals was because he knew what the coming was he knew the coming of the Lord was right there that's why he could say and don't misinterpret it cuz people have brother R said here stands a lamb tonight with a book in his hand and out there goes the white horse rider he said see there the white horse rider is the Antichrist but he even can say well he would say here stands God right here and you you know that's okay like I told a man up at Jeffersonville one time he was telling me he was talking to these people about brother ROM being deity and they're standing in front of the old um Armory where the PO word used to be and I looked at him I said brother if you'll tell me that that brother right there by the new birth is deity now he's not got the gifts brother around him had he's not got the things that he could do we're not talking about that we're talking about just the deity part I said if you'll tell me that brother with a new birth is deity I'll agree with you that brother ROM was deity by the new birth he said oh no brother said okay I just l left CU ain't no need talking to them you're not going to convince anybody right I've never tried to convince anybody my own family my wife or anybody I don't try to convince my family of what I what I try to preach CU if they can't see it not going to do them any good you must have your own Revelation you must see yourself it's not a husband and wife situation it's you and God together together it's not cuz Mom and Daddy's in that I'm going no it's you and I together but if you're in why can't you believe for your children amen why can't you I stand what we got 392 in the red book 392 in the red book anybody have a need Jesus the light of the world you have a need come I believe that same God that walk the shores of Galilee is here tonight the of the world I believe it we walk in the with Bey come where the of Mercy are

about five Services where the Prophet I gave you where he was saying blessed is he that believeth that the Lord has come in this that's what he had to say he believed in God being real right he didn't believe in mythologies and thoughts he believed God was real you know that's what caught me because that was how serious he was cuz I I had met God before and say I knew there was a God but I didn't have anybody could get me there to him what I seen him just so real to he could have created worlds now nobody that could tell me about it I'd ask people and they say you need to go i' BST and say you need to go to a Pentecostal I didn't know that really what I need to do when that Prophet began to talk about God he is years I come that same one but it took me 2 years to get rid of myself to be able to get born again just because you say I believe brother randam and thing like that I read six books a day listen to two tapes done that many days don't put it on you B put it on that word Jesus

and different ones Clarence has already done this he'll remember that part father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us we thank you for Calvary and we just ask you Lord to help us this morning as we try to Endeavor to speak a little bit about some things that's in your word and that we may see you Lord and be guided in your understanding and father as we do then you come on the scene and help us and teach us by Thy word forgive our sins bless those that are sick among us the Lord just touch each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you may be seated now if anybody didn't get a copy of the notes we're trying to make 60 of them but uh not being uh right you know read with somebody next to you and uh that way maybe a husband and wipe my checkbooks together if you're reading the same notes we were our occasion probably but uh but as I said now we're trying we're going to try to to the new ones that haven't seen and heard the things um we're going to try to cover the Plan of Redemption for the Bride of Jesus Christ in her journey and and then we're going to do that by covering uh the Journey of redemption for Israel all right so then if we can see that and it ties together then we have a beautiful picture so we can follow it throughout the word of God so go ahead brother uh Anderson now if I say Joe and Anderson have who flips to which one I don't know but uh we've got this set up the best we could yesterday to try to help you to understand all right so look at the uh thing and we'll read Daniel 9 24. through 27. all right 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and make reconciliation for iniquity and bring in Everlasting righteousness and the self-division in Prophecy and anoint the most holy now if we finish we get to the part you'll see that that covers the Plan of Redemption for Israel and also as Wade will be covering this afternoon of the holy city the uh you know and and it will be not till this that it'll be a three-point Plan of Redemption to see the bride Israel and even the city because you know of what will happen in the Millennium huh verse 25 no therefore and understand that from the going forth to the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks now watch that keep that in mind we'll keep pointing to it three score and two weeks which would be 69 all right now mathematically all right and the street shall be built again in the wall even in trouble this time and after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end there I shall be with the flood and unto the end of the war desolation is determined and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determines shall be poured up on the desolate that's right so you see then you you've got verse 26 that you've got 62 three score and two weeks 62 to the coming up to Jesus Christ and him being cut off amen all right now verse 27 is basically aligned with the Antichrist that's right because it comes to the end time and he shall come from the Covenant with many for a week all right God never made a covenant with anybody for a week that's right he makes a covenant for returning to amen Satan copies because he knows what's left for Israel will have to do with it but then he it will come in in the Desolation and the different things man will take place all right now let's get started and read Fast and Furious and see all right now I want you to remember one thing brother Brown and we believe was the prophet we don't believe he was God we have never believed nothing like that right he was the prophet just like Paul was a prophet amen uh brother random calls um Paul Iranians or Colombo Martin Luther Wesley and even says the prophet came on today of Pentecost to Zeus's Street Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so then he could cover a prophet and and have no problems but we believe that God finished this whole thing up by sending us Elijah the prophet Amen to bring us the fullness of the word and make ready for a Rapture all right now in believing that then we must believe that what he says is correct amen no matter what we argue about whether it fits or not right but remember he's the prophet amen we are not and anybody listen to this you me whoever we have no right whatsoever to try to correct the prophet right a prophet stands before God and God only amen he will answer to God that's why he said you say what I say right all right and I've done it for 40 something years I've been standing in the Pulpit preaching that long and showing that brother random was not contradictory amen like everybody thinks you know well he might demonstrate here he made a mistake here well you want to go up here and talk about 30 minutes and let me dispect your message and I'll tell you you have any mistakes you make because that's human in error part but now the message is Right amen the man himself even taught like why horse rider was a Holy Ghost but then he corrected that right because he was not infallible right right that's right but the message is invaluable because the message is the Bible amen that's right do you believe the Bible's infallible amen all right and I can show you a lot of things in there that looks like it's contrary right you remember when you read it yes you remember how you argued about the water baptism words in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or father Son and Holy Ghost you know well you know it's in there George got to come together and make a picture if not you got a contradiction that's right a little Sonny Wade if we would deal with the prophets mentioned but if it fits together then it cannot be in any argument whatsoever as to what it is all right you might say well um why is it important that we understand the Daniel 70 weeks what is important well why is it important to understand anything I remember discussing this years ago with someone and they they said do you think water baptism is essential under salvation I've talked for a minute I said the truth is Right amen the truth is essential in Salvation well Jesus said You shall know the truth all right so then the truth is essential right so if it's in the word of God then it's essential amen what do we need to know these things to be saved well some people are saved by knowing you're in these things then but some people are known and say by hearing John 3 16 you want to take it out no no we want to leave all of it correct or that we can depend upon the Bible and then you come and show me I invite it to the world come and show me we're running around and missed it but now don't come and say he say it you bring it to me from the Bible and you bring me what he said amen all right and then we'll discuss it amen but you're going to have to listen to what I say right about the rest of it because I believe it'll all fit together or else he wasn't the problem right that's right amen and if he wasn't the prophet maybe you are the prophet that can straighten him out yeah thanks I am my wife don't like me to go like that into the camera but that just gets the point across you'll never forget that when I do that statement and make that point all right but now this do you say well why is it important to understand all right let's just read about it three or four other statements real fast and get it done do it with number one brother and you got your notes you can follow with us make these homes and now it may be hard for you to follow down the side of it over here with a little bitty one two three four but smaller the quote this on the screen all right I said anyone Vehicles instructions to Daniel Revelation 6 1 to 19 21 is connected with the 70 weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 in weeks because if you don't want you you miss there's no seals you miss the trumpets you miss the vowels those flags those three unclean spirits like frogs no stream woes and casting out of the red dragon the woman in the sun you'll miss it all if you don't and that code it takes place right here in this 70th week that's where it takes place all right now so it seemed like it must be important heaven thank you forgive me for putting a cough drop in okay I don't Advocate you putting a candy in the mouth but you know sometimes my voice goes and we gotta have that part all right don't forget me look at the next one this is paragraph 22 the sixth full purpose and I do not believe there's one person here for that purpose I believe that we are here tonight because we are deadly sincere honestly at wanting to know the saith the Lord amen number three that's the reason we're praying to God to make that so perfect that there will be no one chatter of doubt be not one shot of that finance a word you just put it any harm I'm 72. okay so God we're not supposed to put her on interpretation to to those things it's got to come through thus say of the Lord or I'm leaving it right there until I understand try all right all right now is this important with the next one paragraph 191 now the 70th week let me say something here to you and to the world I mean anybody listening I'm using the 2010 version of the message the 99 version will say the 70 weeks of Daniel just in case somebody you know looks up and says that's wrong the 99 and the 95s and all users and they'll say the 70 we can send you 70 weeks a day but then the new version uses the 70th week when it comes to that last part all right to remember that I got 191 and I wish you'd listen quietly now just for a moment the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting again re-quoting so you won't forget this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my pen while I was writing all right so is it true what the prophet would be saying in the dangle 70 weeks amen he said we we need to wait till we have to accept the Lord he said I won't speak until I do so he did all right yep that's right now he says this is what the Holy Spirit put on his pen to write the people of the message are real good to go over to spoken words original see we wrote around and said in the back said the holy spirit said take up your pen and write and they'll have that for thus saith the Lord but what about Daniel 70 weeks all right amen so now you tell me he was wrong because that's what we're going to get into in a minute we're going to see that people are going to say he's wrong here he's wrong here he's wrong there okay I want your Vindication all right that's all I'm asking for that's right I want your Vindication I don't want her stupidities right amen I want your Vindication right all right now see then all right what is it then is it important to know so let's cover the 70 weeks of Daniel all right you're going to find out it'll be 490 years because they're 70 weeks and we'll cover in a minute in a week in seven years and the prophet will prove it by the Bible as we go along so we just let him make the statements all right so we're going to have to see the Plan of Redemption amen all right so then we've already said and read in Daniel that they were seven years in building our 49 years seven weeks in building the Temple we'll get to that in a minute you know back there all right we've got that in here in case you're smart enough to figure out the Bible says 46. we got that in the second floor covered all right but then you got the 62 weeks right and then you got one week left Amen to make you 490 years to Israel all right now watch the Oddity in a second on that in case I repeat it isn't it odd that Jesus said I mean they said how many times do we forgive what did Jesus say yeah he said we'll forgive him seven times he said no 70 times seven multiply that that's 490 in case you need it all right that's kind of an odd point isn't it but it's not too hard go ahead and listen let's start with number five all right these are basically all be interested in the week of Daniel so if I forget to do it I'll give you the purpose paragraph 49. now today we're approaching what is the 70 weeks this is about a part of the 70 weeks now we know the scripture cannot lie they have to be truth and if this Angel Gabriel come and told Daniel that there was only 70 weeks left to the Jews now if we apply that to six days or seven days see where would you be right if you're only going to cover it right 70 weeks you've learned it just weeks seven days in a week and 70 weeks you know you you have four to 90 days or something you'd calculate all but you ain't gonna do no good right but look what he said but in Prophecy it's always give in Parable amen all right giving Parables next Matthew 13 34 says and all these things Jesus take unto the multitude and parables and why without a parable spake he not unto them you remember all of the parables in the Bible and Jesus would the disciples would come and what is this parable you know the Pharisees finally one day figured out this guy is Parabola using Parables to kill us so that's why they killed him right because he was using Parables they figured it out there in a while get out the end of the reading right they said he's talking about us all right man without a parable expect you not now so remember Daniel 70 weeks I told Wade when years ago when he asked me what about the 70 weeks of Daniel and I said right over the top of every page of the book Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable Parable that's right and I said when you finish the book you'll see it's a parable amen correct all right now what is a parable go ahead the Greek word for that is 38.50 means a parable figure comparison proverb I'm placing a one thing by the side of another usual position of what that word is which means side by side to position anything as of ships in battle that's metaphor I guess you call it a comparing comparison of one thing with another likeness similitude an example by which a Doctrine or precept is Illustrated right so that's a parable you listen to a man that planted a seed or locking into this or locking them to that right see do we say it no we've good Baptists and all you know well we can understand it we understand because Jesus explained The Parables we read the next verses where explain it to the disciples you know that was still a parable sure until you're born again legal scripture no man can call Jesus a Christ except it be why what the Holy Ghost amen see though you can read and understand reading and understanding is not what it is it must be revealed you're gonna stop a drunk going down the highway and say Jesus say Jesus is a Christ you say Jesus Christ oh he's born again that's no more than someone that said water baptism under regeneration let's go to Lake Lanier we'll fill up the kingdom we'll just push them in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you see that silly no that's what I'm saying is how silly we are see we say we know we understand the parables but do we do we understand The Parables that's right not until we're born again that's right that's the key to the whole thing neither is it Daniel 70 weeks understood unless you're born again all right yes sir now so they're doing that now why would God put things in a parable anyway number eight why would he put in for our appreciate these brothers that will do these things in the videos and run them back and forth because this killed you a lot of times look what he said on this paragraph 71 to 70 a week you come back to what's done and things are going on but that all was done in the great economy of God to keep the church watching and praying being ready how their garments washed in the blood of the Lamb amen it's done to keep you and I checking up all right amen the Bible says examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not all right we better examine ourselves every day especially now right that's right right so God does it number nine Deuteronomy 13 1-3 we like that one word says if a prophet comes and gives you a sign that come to pass you got to believe him but people don't read this one Deuteronomy 13 1-3 if there arise among your Prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give it thee a sign or a wonder what and this sign our Wonder come to pass 40 people laying out in exist to prove I'm right and they're all going to raise the debt and they'll raise them to death now what are you gonna do what are you gonna do see I'm not asking are you going to believe the man now watch what he said where are these fake unto thee saying he's going to give you the signs and wonders will take place but then he's teaching you a Doctrine watch it yep bro he speak unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them now watch amen I shall not hearken unto the words of that Prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you right to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul he does it to prove it right yeah yeah all right what about a wonderful guy to do that you mean he would let signs and wonders take place sure he's doing it in the in those taking place to prove yep but it's to prove whether or not we love him because we love him we love his word amen right that's right and if we won't stay with his word then we fail the test simple amen not to scare nobody plain language right that's right it's true all right so now let's get on with it well there's one more just bypass 10. oh yeah this is time tested time tested Memorials of God prayer e47 every time the sickness strikes your home every time the trial strikes your home every time the neighbor say something bad about you it's only shaking you he's explaining the tree how it is shaking to the tree makes it grow into the ground and get deeper Roots right and only shaking you loosening you up as soon as you get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word that's how God does it he sends those trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you a new hope it's good sometimes for somebody to differ with you then somebody comes along they say hey what happened what about this yeah yeah I'm gonna go read again all right right so it's good for us okay now go ahead and let's place it only the board the chart now this is the drawing wrote a random made and used and we have proof now canceled this one for one time right now all right we have proof that this is the official one that brought around drug I received mine and I have it in my Bible you know Weatherby but I received mine in 67 or 68 one the first time I guess we were close to the Tabernacle or something and uh may have even been 66 when I met brother Mo but anyhow we have proof from people and I don't call names anymore couldn't get out of there but if they say that was the drawing we use it this afternoon because they knew how the copies to where the brother sent it to them to prove that that was the very drawing brought around May all right now I contend this drawing and the Bible and the prophet's message are all the same amen yes sir and to go contrary to it yep we would be having to change what he's saying amen let me see we can't do it right we've got to stay with what he's saying amen even though as I said we would maybe not uh find some seats for some of these even though we would differ as to what we think man go ahead I didn't make my statement do what you want to amen we don't correct the prophet that's what they're doing in the end time now that's right that's right they're saying he was wrong here and he was wrong go ahead you just need your own hope amen all right no problem ain't mad at nobody I just think what I believe right yeah but look what he says now we read in Daniel they're seven weeks three score in two weeks all right that's 69. okay far end you'll see seven years or seven death week right all right you look at your drawing you have it you'll turn over in your nose you have a drawing if you'd like to follow along I believe that fits exactly the Bible or that Daniel says that they'll be you know the building of the temple then it would be um 62 weeks and then it would be one week left Amen to Israel and Satan copies after that to run his amen oh deal at the end all right now this may look odd because of the people that are teaching the message and leaving this over here you know all right but now he done it so now do that right argue with that all you want to we'll give you a couple of quotes I think he uses about six times speaking of the chart as a matter of fact he even spoke of the chart down in Tifton Georgia all right go ahead and pull up your brother Joe not the other drawing jump over that for a second and pull up the number 11a you know which is 41. oh there we go maybe you don't have it in yours okay he's doing it back up okay we got we got a split condition on this thing all right forgive me now look what he said he said oh this is perfect 41 this end of the week oh what a lesson I said to my wife the other day yep I wonder if the people are really getting it now I want you to get it amen don't if you we have to stay here all day long just stay amen now we'll we may have to be here like lunch now we'll we we want to get it see we we want to know what that is true you see they want to know through and you if you can just only see it I asked Mike maybe then afterwards I'm going to leave the chart here the chart the drawing we just showed yeah I'm going to leave it here and you can draw it out afterwards come in here this afternoon when you want to and draw out the charts and so forth and it'll help you to understand that's the reason I put it in dark okay go ahead brother Anderson to the next program 99. and if you notice on my chart here I want you to get this now and draw it you notice here where I got the cross that's where they rejected but the time extended out just a little bit further on see why 30 40 50 60 seven that's the Titus and we'll go back to the drawing you'll see 40 years later it's Titus the Roman general destroyed Jerusalem destroy Israel Jerusalem and Scattered the people of the world okay thank you brother Anderson go back now brother Joe to the to the drawing right not the sex of the first one the original okay okay there you go now we got it all right then you see seven weeks 62. come on over there he said to check it and see that's right all right now a lot of people don't believe that drawing to be authentic but we have proof that it is and that's fine that's right I have proof enough to note myself but when I received it that I did receive that drawing right there are a couple of other drawings that are kind of touched up and there was one recently that would put out in the Philippines that went over a little bit too far right and I'll compare that with this next drawing that we do now so you see what I'm saying seven weeks 62 weeks make 69 weeks 483 years right here that means that there's exactly seven years left over on the other side all right now go up and I will show you what people believe you're looking in your notes you'll see it turned kind of sideways let's see what people believe now legal drawings that's where we got them I Want It That Way see this is what people believe right most of the people of the message I've ever talked to this is their Doctrine that's right all right and to make their Doctrine come out right then I just made a little by Brother Joe's help a little drawing where we kind of edited what we originally had you know you look over here they're 69 weeks one week left this is what basically people believe they believe that seven weeks 62 and a half weeks which would give you the three and a half years of the ministry of Jesus Christ in this three and a half years over here on that side through the two prophets now you keep that drawing because that drawing is vital to you because that is exactly what most people are saying and the one from the Philippines that's right almost identically matches right that all right so you see that there's a difference I'm showing you what people believe because the only way you can believe it is that away if you're not going to believe the truth then amen all right you're gonna have to believe that Jesus preached see what they believe is Jesus come up here to 80 30. we'll get something in just a minute on that and over there and then he preached three and a half years to come up to 80 33. you see that's what they think right did Jesus come up 69 weeks up to here and one half a week extended over here on Jesus ministry and that makes it work out now simple little mathematical calculations if you look back over here you'll see a little calculations called 80 30 and you'll see another one called 80 70. all right if this drawing is right you would have to have that ad70 three and a half it wouldn't calculate and what I'm saying is none of these things will match as we go through it you'll see that don't match right all right so then we got to stay with us we've got ahead and cancel this one and let's move on all right go to number 12. all right now let's take what he's saying and get on with it and remember the drawing is there any way you can put that drawing back up over here or switch to folks over there in this number here how many original one I want the original drawing okay so you can watch as we read now let's Outlet outline Daniel 70 of weeks Burger 61. now I'm not repeat here again Ministers of gospel if you disagree with this all right they were divided in three periods amen and we find out in Daniel now we read Daniel in divides in three periods that's right first a seven week period I hear the inner three score let me get my corner not seven weeks we're trying to figure out why not get something I brought my sword out here I said if that don't work on this brother calling you different all right so what's he say it's divided into three periods one two three all right now first just one week here seven seven week period 49 years to build another Temple right here all right and then a three score in two weeks 60 which is 62 weeks then a one week period left amen they're divided into three and he said I got to divide it on the board here's the first period second period to my understanding by the gospel the End of Time returns to the Jews all right so now you say but now brother Dale let's see is that the one where we got it next on it I have to follow my own notes all right we're going down we're going down one more then we'll pick up or something so watch that when we get down so go ahead and change it 72 progress 72. now if there was look there's exactly 49 days not 49 years rather than the time of the building of the temple the seven or seven prophetic weeks seven weeks because there was seven weeks determined to the temple to rebuild the Temple and it was to build it was built in exactly 49 years now watch that we're going to get a scripture in a second now we have the meaning of the time of weeks because as the Bible said the angel said it taken seven weeks until the building of the Temple that's a that's uh Daniel 9 24. all right and it was exactly 49 years building the Temple from the March the 14th until the BC 538 until the temple was restored again and the streets were bestowed remember the temple was trying to try to build a two or three times back in the Old Testament they finally got it built I'm not talking about the rich that's talking about the original but it was talking about also the owners coming through right all right so what do we got what do you get for seven weeks it means 49 years then one week equals seven years seven times seven is 49 just exactly there you are now there's no more questioning about it we know now that each week meant seven years have you got it let's say it together one week's equal seven years one week into seven years all right now in case you two are out there or anyone else click up the next my brother's joke and brother Anderson never who's pulling those quotes right look at John then said the Jews 40 and six years you remember Jesus said destroyed this Temple my raise up three days this was their answer 46 years was his temple in building you look down rearing up in three days wow contradiction between Daniel 9 24 and John two unless you go back and read Daniel 9 24 if you look back in front of your page and he said and the walls and the streets were built in trouble sometimes 46 years they were correct in the temple restoration are building the Temple but it took the other three three years to do the streets in the city so Daniel and John is not contrary that's not a contradiction see that's what I said as long as you lay them out yeah and you keep studying God put them together where you don't have a question about it all right now here's the one going with number 15. here's the one that we were talking about a while ago where Jesus said well how many times you forgive a man Jesus said 70 times 7. that's 490 or 490 times if you read on you'll find out it says and again if yes so you say now brother Mark I'm right on the border you only got one more but it said and again make your life a little get going all right now let's start on this part and cover the 62 weeks seven years we've covered in the building Temple let's cover the 62 weeks before and we'll get up to 483 years all right so we can pull up number 16. all right Cindy equipment Daniel progress 78. Messiah was Christ now he comes right in here but here's where he's crucified amen all right you say yeah but that's 30. hang on okay just hold on a little bit and made it to it make it 69 weeks so whatever you do back here is 69 weeks it's not 69 and a half in the cross amen it's 69 weeks all right you're mathematically off if you go the other way of that drawing we just had oh and I don't believe that yeah okay 7.69 483 years and getting it down if you want to run over it I'll be glad to do it now we're told from the going for the command to rebuild it send it to the Messiah shall be seven that's seven that's the first first right here seven weeks three score in two weeks 62 weeks and seven is 69 and that's 69 weeks seven times 69 would make 483 years therefore until the Messiah now we're coming up to this part here so evidently he was pointing them here right yeah it's going to be 483 years that's right okay amen now in that 483 years there is even a quote and brought around in the silver that word that Jesus is actually cut off 62 weeks out of the 70. and that's exactly what happened when they finish that template the Jews rejected God sure for 62 weeks come on when they finish that Temple it was downhill way back here but when they got that temple built it was downhill and they finally killed a man and all of this was about that's right and that's just to show you how technical bro around a minute he said it's 62 weeks he was cut off I didn't bring that quote all right but now listen let's see something here as we go let's make sure these are correct so we go up to paragraph 80. now now Jesus rode into the city of Jerusalem drive on the back of about you on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30. right all right Jesus wrote in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and remember Palm Sunday is one Sunday before the resurrection all right amen so this is not the start of his ministry right right you understand this is not the start of his ministry when he rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday was was the Sunday before the crew for the resurrection so he was crucified on Friday raised on Sunday right amen now now for bc445 the ad30 is exactly 473 years but we've already seen now watch it the 69 weeks makes 183 years now there's where the trouble comes in right there we've got only with the marking of the Bible here time only 475 years and actually it's 483 a difference of eight years all right now God can't make it Miss if he said it would be so many days or so many days he said so much to me so much what are we going to do BC 475 to 80 30 if you in our astronomy years which are 365 and a four in each but we reduce them days to our prophetic calendar prophetic calendar is 360 days right amen each month only had 30 days all right all right when you come over to the flood and you come over to the fall the in the garden it would have been 360 when you fell to the fall and Men come out it made it for 365 and a fourth and especially vindicating up to the flood because that's where the Earth went from this to this right right and begin to wobble so you got 365 to four days right amen all right now watch so go ahead and put up the next number 16. we got 16a tonight we got to go to this notice uh as part of that looks modification okay maybe we didn't put in the modification because we don't multiplication Brother Anderson okay all right you can figure it out anyway all right you multiply 475. Now watch how close your profit was mathematically brother Joe's noted on this side okay okay 475 he says we're off because we got 475 right he said we need 483. sodium multiply 475 by 365.25 don't do it with one-fourth you've got a problem 0.25 you mathematicians are good at that especially if we can make our one even he's a rafter he knows that goes 25. all right all right equals 173493.75 let's do it by 365.25 are what did we say take that number one seven three four nine point seven five divide it by 360 you come out to be 481.9270833333 in other words you come out to 482. do you say yeah he said they don't pay one year off you're in the period of time are you familiar with this we mentioned this at The Minister's meeting you know a lot of them didn't even know this the calendars has been changed three times you've got the Greg ruin the Pope the Alexandra Julian the calendars has been changed so it's easy to miss one one week I mean one one year I'm not trying to justify him I'm just saying because when he said it's got to be 483 I don't care if we modify that and it don't come out right it's 483. that's what God says okay you know that's what your Prophet said it was amen amen all right but you've got your calendars have changed one year they had 200 and something days in one year uh one year they had a change into the calendar one year they had 13 months in the in the year the line of stars back up see you know you noticed the other day not too long ago the prophet mentioned ain't done it again that had a faculty clock right come on you're wobbling right they had to add a second to the time clock to make it perfect they're having to change all constantly because we're wobbling but when she goes back to 360. right yeah you're right you'd be perfect amen right now okay so then just to show them you how I close and how mathematically a man can be and yet people will argue all right look at 17 and let's pick up something very interesting paragraph 84. our prophetic calendar to bring us to 360 days and we use now in the scripture we have exactly 483 there it is 183. how we have exactly proof of the prophecy exactly the truth more far from the time of the going forward to build a temple and to destroy or when they rejected Christ and killed him in A.D 33. and we just read one where that they killed him in A.D 30. okay when Christ was killed makes exactly 483 years pull the drawing back up over here 493 a year 62 7 483. right keep that in mind just leave that number okay all right safe job going to the next when God had the undiluvian world and destroy the water they changed the astronomy date and then let the Romans come in and make up their calendar which it hits and Miss until 4 short and disproving the point get to the bottom there it is exactly 483 years from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to restore the bill until the time of prayer Messiah was rejected rejected 183 years still keeping your calendars and everything is balanced all right and we're going to get something in a second about that well here we are go ahead with number 19. no let's take something you just see if you understand you know that our calendar systems is all goofed up you know that Jesus were actually born in 4 BC that's right sure how many of you know that I mean I actually know that he was born in 4 BC because you can prove it by the king that was in command in his death and what took place and all you can prove right they see they were trying to run the calendars now we've got this so we don't need it don't pull it up brother joke on this two headaches I'm going to make a statement it's going to be contrary to your thinking right around is exactly right when he said 483 and he's exactly right I mean when he said 1833 and he's exactly right when he said 80 30. because according to the calendar we're under Jesus was crucified 80 33. according to the calendar we're under because they put us on number one right but according to what happened really Jesus was born for BC 432-1123 you might imagine that they've had it figured out totally 80 33 in 80 30 is the same date if you got chance enough to be able to think our calendar starts one two three four five right but if Jesus was born for BC you're gonna go four one four three two one one two three four five so he's riding both places this needs a little sense a lot of Revelation now you're a mathematician but I got a little sense but this is what I want you to see Jesus rode into Jerusalem until they see the Jerusalem trap on the back of a hot mule on Palm Sunday April 2nd 80 30. right Palm Sunday was one week one Sunday before the resurrection everybody know that amen Palm Sunday is one Sunday before the Resurrection Sunday we call it so he was crucified on Friday we got the proof of these they argue this even in the message they're arguing it but Jesus was crucified on Friday raised the Bible said early the first day of the week amen the old Doctrine is and he was crucified on Wednesday and he went into grade three days and three nights and when it finally all got councilmated out he come up on Saturday afternoon nope you never heard that old doctor that's all you organized religious God he raised on Saturday afternoon hung around all night appeared to John appeared to the disciples Sunday morning your Prophet said he died on Friday raised on Sunday that's right the Bible said he rose early the first day of the week they didn't say he rose on Saturday the last day the seventh and finally come up on the eighth day now I said he rose right so we got the Bible and I want you to remember that April 2nd he said will he change that later well let's see if he did look tonight making sure you're not stable but I know it's a little bit okay so here's brother random speaking in 1963 324 in the morning series questions and answered on the sealed paragraph 188 now we know that Jesus was slain about 80 30. all right that's right it was about the middle of the year I guess 80 30. but the Bible said he was fighting for the foundation work right okay so now after the seals because people want to say I want what he's got in his sword in that hand you know that's what everybody wants when the word comes to the prophet you better remember when the word comes to the Prophet The Sword in his hand he come to the Tabernacle and was going to preach the white horse rider as the Holy Spirit until he was corrected that's right so because he's got the sword in the hand don't mean he's got it in his heart right right simple right Revelation you say well let's go with god let's go one more minute look at this one now on The Sixth Seal paragraph 148. now let's stop there these three verses it took place actually on Tuesday afternoon April the 4th 80 30. and the first two remember that's when they asked him the questions and the answers that come up into the seals right in Matthew in the scripture April the 4th A.D 30 and the two verses took place in the at first two verses that plays an afternoon of the April the 4th at 80 30. Julius three times he's using 80 30. right now you showed me where he uses 33 and keeps it correct all I'm asking but did you catch what we're looking at the first one was Palm Sunday April the second Sunday Monday Tuesday your profit was so mathematically correct this statement says that that took place on April the 2nd this one says April the 4th yeah how perfect can a man be that had a nice great education her seventh grade just giving you that approval Point amen all right so keep that in mind Sunday Monday Tuesday April 2nd was Sunday Monday is the third Tuesday is the fourth Jesus was crucified on Friday about the seventh or something Rose then on the first day of the week amen so he's mathematically correct he knows but even though now I say this I don't know of any word would run around and said Jesus was born before BC I'll run that I don't know but evidently new because his mathematics is right right and his mathematics is yours right and see Jesus then was crucified 80 30. God dealt with the Jews to 80 70. we'll cover that more this afternoon when I think about it April the 2nd April the 4th Lydia's crucifixion Resurrection Church ages and then he comes back to deal so if this is right over here that'll have to be right away and that's the main thing I want to deal with so go ahead and paragraph 23. well we got you know we got Luke in there yeah all right the reason we got Luke is because maybe you didn't notice your Prophet says that Jesus was born in April right and crucified in April now get me three and a half years of ministry in there thank you if you're doing that you'll come exactly where I'm talking about but if you're not you're going to lap yourself over and miss it right how could it be born in April crucified in April preach 33 or have a 33 and a half years everybody wants to die did you understand what I'm saying if he's born in April crucified April how do you preached three and a half years because Luke says in Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age so we entered the ministry at 29 and a half right he entered the minister at 29.5 he did not the way he was 30 to enter the ministry internet 29.5 according to Luke all right so that makes it perfectly correct all right all right then you can preach three and a half years because he could enter the ministry at 29 and a half man and I give him the half a year Technically when you're putting it that he was crucified in April 83rd you would go back to 26 and a half or 27-91 of the two way to cover that this evening you would come to Mary come up to 80 30. right but if you get what I'm saying he entered the ministry 2909. all right now let's get into it and try to run real fast go ahead and run it number 20 28. 3 all right I got 94. you thought about 144 000 don't appear all right the road they appear not in the third chapter they're on over in the scriptures father and now we see that all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week last week now that they're now that they're already at 69 weeks and living exactly the way God said they did and happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more week promise to the Jews all right now here's where the people say according to that drawing we had want to go they say there's only three and a half years I've been around say that one week after the Rapture yes sir let's prove that moment as we go along go to the next one I got 96. now we come up and we're we got them up here to the rejection of Messiah and from the rejecting them beside the last week all right and you can read all the way down we got all the rights today 70 weeks left one more than seven years you know so you got in front of trying to short time okay go to the next 25 this is paradigm 105. and you you haven't got any limited time like the Jews see we don't Virginia well we got a sign what is a sign this one's our sign amen all right yes was our sign God did oh back it up you click one too quick leave it at one radio well God did with the Jews exactly what he said he would do in them 69 years or 483 years for 69 weeks and one week left one week she had determined amen you want to say at the doctrine among the people is only three and a half years after the Rapture but around 77 years actually that's right so which one we're going to tell you hey man go to the next one this is paragraph 188 right here where did the massage get cut off exactly where the word said where will that 70th Week begin exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jew amen where will send this week begin amen right all right it'll begin exactly when the church is cut off happy 165. and in the middle of this week now here's the 70. now these exactly were seven years in each one of the weeks we were already at 69 weeks and then we have the Gentiles page and we know that we're at the end Gentile then there's one more week left for the Jews that's exactly seven years trying to save time you've got the quilts even real next you notice we're giving about four or five quotes which is one week left amen all right notice the 69 weeks hit perfectly the Jews were in their Homeland in a gentile Church age exactly to the end time to the Nickelodeon time or to the lady of CNN how close it is to the coming of the Lord the ending of the thing into the thing the end of this age in the Rapture the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone amen and he said if you can see that raise your hand now hand many by God raised their hand everybody the congregation was waving yeah we see it but when he died we don't see him the hand went down you know they missed what he was to say all right let's see what else brother next these 69 weeks hit perfectly going away the juicy perfectly the church ate it perfectly we're at the end the end time jump down the morning he starts the 70s week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting you read this in the morning you read that one long ago right the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone now listen I'm quoting again re-quoting so he won't forget this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my opinion while I was writing so they just went through that's right proven this is right this is right and this is right that's right so there's seven years after the Rapture of the church amen that is not is not the old denominational teaching the old denominational teaching is that there is a seven year tribulation period right after the Rapture there's a chosen people who go up but there's some people that are going to be left that are bride Church that are going to be here for three and a half years and have to give their lives and things but that's still part of the Bride you know and then go into chaos with Elisha height and that's to Israel so they got what they call a minor tribulation for the first three and I in a major tribulation that is not what brother Brown is talking about right but I started out with my saying he never taught no word show it to me did he ever taught a seven years of tribulation right no that's not only art right to me you always talked three and a half years of tribulation amen that lines up with Jacob's trouble all right all right in your Bible about to line up with Jacob struggle let's see what we're in 29. we'll get back to this part down in here in just a minute if we don't get it just remember Jacob's trouble is great and one high of year it's not Jacob working for them amen Jacob's trouble Jacob's trouble is this right here three and a half years of the tribulation that will strike Israel this is exactly what he says Great Tribulation period a cleansing I'm standing it away ahead of time a cleansing of the land right here's Armageddon you got it right there Armageddon takes place here and then there's time passed the Armageddon amen for the cleansing of the land getting ready for the Millennium amen we'll get down the description do something look at number 30. not on the marathon mode this is paragraph 83. no excuse and he's coming down with the times of the 77 I'm not going to get into and here we are at the End of the Age after coming into this Indian we we don't know what time that the church will be gone oh my we don't know coming into the 70th week okay now look at 31. I have 83. yesterday's over here in Revelations 13 or 11 chapter in the third version them two prophets will prophesy 1203 score days then they're cut off an Armageddon sits in and if that be so you're talking about the 30 days and the months and the protein backers and forth go to the next paragraph 167. this is where the Antichrist comes back in what he's doing he makes a covenant quick as we leave out of here right and we've got a thing that I'm not going to release it here we've got a thing proven something that's that I say is the very head of what the world is going to think when they find out that this Pope is going to set that Covenant in motion I won't say it on here because we got the paper today but it was on the news of what the pope said uh-huh but if we can't prove that we better hold on now we've got the papers to prove this off another some of you already heard it know what it is I'm just not putting it on here I say that's the beginning because the man made an honest statement that's right of what preceded now the world is going to fall at his feet and say he's honest we would write about what was back here but now this man is changing because you got to make a covenant right come on folks now we work for General Motors right some of us the Bible said he'll confirm his Covenant for a week confirmed is not the word covenant heart when you had a covenant you started a year or two but when the contract was running out you started a year before the ending of the contract and they started negotiating negotiating negotiating it runs up to the time of the contract and they shine in agreement with the with the big head of the Union officials and the big head of the company officials that's not a contract that's why it says he confirmed to confirm is to ratify or establish but when the rank and file voted on that contract it became a contract when the world system takes the Antichrist Doctrine she will confirm that Covenant that's right brother amen the Catholic Church as of the last I know of I said me he is not a member of the World Council churches all right all right you may think it is go check it they're not a member of the workouts in church because the Bible said you got to come in by flattery is going to be invited in to control run around in the field books that they're looking for a Superman to come and take over and he said they're going to get one they don't believe it run any computer Superman you'll go straight to the seal book they're going to get a Satan Superman that's right brother that Satan Superman is going to be so sweet and humble until he's invited in and he makes craft to prosper is that the Book of Daniel that's right amen oh we need it right now don't we it'd be better if they put the pope as president God he's the guy that's got the money yeah that's right right my parents said we all moved up years ago when brother Branham said that the Catholic church was given a fall ago that was when it was probably 35 an ounce you just think if we took a thousand dollars a piece and bought a thousand dollars worth of gold at 35 an ounce you realize what you'd have ma'am when it's 17 or 18. 17 point something 100 from that we don't be rich then I'd get to talk to me I'd be super real you knew it Danny why didn't you do it then all right listen get you buy it where you thank them but now listen you know sometimes people think that ain't a good thing to do but I'm not a speaker but a speaker knows how to get your attention to get you back now done we can talk okay he makes his Covenant and in the midst of the 70th week no bring that over here to you and you only have three and a half here no you got him right here right that's right he don't break his gun a year I've seen before the church as you start come on yep so after we get out of here in that one week he breaks just go to the nurse worm again he sets in the temple of God showing himself to be as God oh he goes in smooth and flattery to get the whole world behind you you're going to make everything work oh you'll have you think it didn't work out when this last guy said and lady come out of it and I'm not throwing off on him telling the truth she said he's gonna pay my house rent yeah he gonna buy me a car yeah right yeah well didn't work out too good all right let's see when they're going to flattery this guy in yep he's going to be the greatest of all he's going to admit that he was wrong he already is he's admitted he's right boy it's gonna be beautiful because she's going to cause crap to prosper and then how can you argue with it come on we're all under the big buddy system Brothers how many is in here one two three four five six calling Social Security I'm just counting that someone's I know what happened to Mark me cut that out why did he do that don't tell him he can't do that they've done done did it that's okay man right what if they kill you you can't get into more well fire you can't get into more assistance who are you going to eat I didn't say what are you going to eat I said who are you going to eat ain't enough Dearborn come on all right let's go on he makes a covenant he breaks it in the middle of the week taking breaks his Covenant in the middle of the week right here at arm again that's when God comes down when he breaks that Covenant that devil stands right there incarnate in the Beast absolutely amen he went from the Mount of sin and through here until there and he stands in the temple being the Beast amen he asked the prophet questions answers I mean you don't question an answer did second Thessalonians the amount of sin I think well God show himself to be out of God fulfill the first seal he said yes right so when that Antichrist comes in there he's going to be the beast in common Satan right when he had the Beast back like it was in the garden Right started with a beast Minds up with me but those two prophets will be what giving their message right here right and then he moves in right here that is a cleansing purifying we're going to prove I got time before hold on here is the statements most people make is it only three and a half years of time after the Rapture and that's what most of you Ministers of the message that I've ever heard speak on it that's right now I say it never hurts me coming right that they have three and a half years after the Rapture of the church then Armageddon and chaos nothing else all right quote number 33. let's prove this fallacy to be wrong Daniel 11 verse 12 11 and 12. and from the time of the daily sacrifice I'm gonna read something right there now let's see how many kids and from the time of the daily sacrifice shall be taken away in the ablation that make an excellent setup there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days right anybody caught it that's 10 days overdone over the two witnesses hang on blessed is he that waiteth and come to the thousand three hundred five in 30 days so in the Book of Daniel there's time after the Armageddon right right at least 1300 and something days but as I said in what wage copy it's gonna be a thousand two hundred and ninety days 42 months according to the Bible with the two witnesses is 1260 days Daniel know what he's talking about he goes to 30 days past it and then even says Glory it's blessed if you make it to 75 days so there's got to be according to the Bible 75 days past Armageddon now let's go over the Bible there could be a whole lot more so we had with paragraph 34. watch the temple now here's what's contrary to most people in the nation they don't believe a temple to be built in the millennium listen it is not a temple for offering sacrifices that 144 000 is turned to Christ they will not be offering sacrifices in the Millennium don't worry about your little animals it ain't going to be killed in the millennium all right but there is a temple to be built amen what far do prove the curse is gone right amen why do we have a Thousand-Year Millennial Reign to prove the sin curse it was put on in the garden right that Methuselah live 969 years but he didn't make it to a thousand so somebody's going to live a thousand years called Millennial Reign amen you don't make no difference to me and you because we're going to be Eternal there we're going to be on a honeymoon we're going to be there with our husband watch I got 199. I see full purpose of getting a visit to Daniel now watch the description of the temple that is to be built in the millennium well that's just his words okay now anyone any reader all right theologians where you at yeah in the message where you at that from Ezekiel 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter there's nothing in the world but the millennium temple being arrested on Earth damn it he gives you the scripture during the Millennium is going to be a temple Bell now Ezekiel 40-44 we just read in Daniel what 75 extra days right proving this time after the Millennium I mean after the Armageddon early time after Armageddon we've proved by the Bible now let's prove it again go ahead to Ezekiel look at this now remember Ezekiel 44 is a millennium Temple Ezekiel 39. one before you get to 40 . yeah right right read the whole chapter I was going to read it all but don't have time to look right they that dwell in the city of Jerusalem shall go for it and she'll set on fire and burn the weapons both the Shields and the buffers the bows and the arrows and stays and the spirits and they should burn them with fire seven years we just picked up seven years verse 10. and you say well how do you know this is right from us chapter 39 now don't get massively confused there you know we don't have them kind of Shields and bucklers and bows and arrows and and staves you know let's change it over to uniforms and and and uh Bazookas and and all kinds of things like that okay right you know Ezekiel when he went and saw what the wheels in the middle of the wheel and he's so far out of heaven nuclear stuff falling but he could call it fire out of Heaven name and saw chariots Jocelyn in the streets running like lightning Buicks and Oldsmobiles run up down the highway with lights on man why could he call it chariots right I throw it in you terrible they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any then they're cut down any out of the forest where they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoil to him and Rob those that robbed them says the Lord God and he shall come to pass that I will give unto God a place there of graves in Israel the valley of passengers on the east of the sea and they shall stop the no no it's not the passengers in other words everything gets the stinking all right yeah you know you get it and they there are they shall bury God in his multitude and they shall call it the value I'm a God can make August Russian right coming down come on seven months your house of Israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land yeah all of the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a Renown the day that I shall that I shall be glorified saith the Lord and they shall sever out out men of continual employment passion through the land of bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the Earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months until they served we got seven years seven months be like Wade was saying up there we think of Armageddon it means termination of forces when we just thank Armageddon that it's going to be standard Bloom we just burned everything is what we're showing it don't go Glenn Armageddon can be a long time it could be handy for a while one bomb ain't gonna blow us to pieces to prove that but setting them off I turn the desert didn't belong didn't do it they proved it in Japan two of them didn't launch the pieces it only blow the city to Pieces right when we go out of here fire bombs is going to be falling on everybody right anybody's got anything left gonna fire them when Israel finds out the natural nation of Israel right there when they find out that Armageddon that they've missed this thing they say now we don't worry about our enemy we got the Samson effect yep you know what the Samson effect was Samson died with his enemy when he pulled them down we can take them down with our own bombs right and destroy everything now the Israel gets their message right here right that's really 144 000 come in then here is this a cleansing every land that's all I'm trying to describe to you and then we'll read a little all right too much information not enough time all right jump we'll try to scatter uh don't go go to 37 11 36 because that's Jacob's trouble the tribulation is three tonight just three and a half years through the period of tribulation it's only three and a half years right here that's Jacob's trouble this is not Jacob's trouble no all right do you know you ever even thought about it the 144 000 that are killed you know who's gonna kill the Jews the literal Jew dad thinks he's right he's going to kill the 144 000 of the wrong people when they go in there and tell them don't you start none of this Temple back Jesus is the temple amen print out here they're going to preach and then finally going to be killed the Bible says two witnesses be killed 144 000 be killed men are going to have a chaos actually that's right all right let's go on let's get her line up here's a good lineup you ever want one in the Bible right you'll know what comes after what I've had this in a long time marked down now this is not the no no no no oh the other quotes are going to get that this is paragraph 75 question answered 1964 638 which scenario four question 392. no no yeah I wish that I could just run more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church order watch it the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease maybe you'll see it goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period says it's up on the sleeping virgins for three and a half years while Israel is getting their message in this prophecy then tribulation sets in upon right Israel and a natural not Israel at 144 000 their tribulation is here all right then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroyed all things and then the bride returns back in with a groom in a thousand years the millennial Reign after that come to watch on judgment after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth and the new city coming down from Glory Out of Heaven eternity in time if you ever want to line up of events just write that down and read it it's a lineup of what one come back to the other right all right okay let's go fast this is part of 196 and Sixth Seal these messages of Revelations 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the kingdom is at hand now watch the kingdom the millennium yep our kingdom is here the baptism of the Holy Ghost man the kingdom is at hand right here in the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth that's right the witness is going to preach the kingdom is at hand the Millennium is a kingdom to Israel we don't have time to cover it I got 10 minutes okay the kingdom is to be set up the time lies three and a half years of Daniel's 70th week promise to the Jews where it's going to be said this is going to cleanse it and that's going to be it that it brought around never talked seven years tribulation he talked to realize and he taught the cleansing of the world that's why I put D or put Great Tribulation period this is the Tribulation that falls upon natural Israel and it falls upon the 144 000 the slipping virgins and things here are killed then these people natural Israel when they see the Covenant is broke here and they see that man of seeing what he's done look around and said the Obama had to Rome and paraphrases but he said Obama hit straight to Rome because they'll see they missed it this is a cleansing getting ready to go into the Millennium amen Sydney weeks was determined upon thy people upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression Daniel 9 24. make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everybody some Bryson we're able to bring these out today I'm only going to build the last one because you'll see that six of them three oh let's see four five and six is in the Millennium right he brings in Everlasting righteousness but around says Satan is seal for a thousand years All I'm gonna deal with is one thing I'm doing pretty good look at the next one remember a minute ago look at number 40. you remember a minute ago we talked about the temple being built a Temple's built's got to be anointed amen every Temple has got to be Anointed with Bill even they re-anointed or how you want to say are redone the things in the rebuildings of the temple you know right all right look what he said paragraph 120. the sixth full purpose to be able to visit today anointing anointing that Temple for the millennial Reign right I know it's in Leviticus Now watch how it was dedicated to the business and we'll go back to the event because we find out Moses anointing the temple and going on through all right go to the next this is America 141 pull it up you know you can see that's tied with the temple now I came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not thy holy place would anoint the most holy place the Millennium Temple not a person right and we noticed that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that descends out of God from heaven got out of heaven holy place the Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon us your natural now here's your spiritual and the anointing will be up on the New Jerusalem that sends us from going out of Heaven prepared as a brother going for her husband the anointing will be upon them we are the anointing to the temple amen that's right we come back in Revelations 19. right we go up in Revelations 4 1 come back in 19 as the anointing to the temple amen what's going to happen in that period of time here this two witnesses will go up 144 000 go to Cleansing of the land the Jews will precede us here you see how many I don't know I know the 144 000 is coming but they're going to build a millennium Temple and I quote again not to offer sacrifices get that out of your mind Jesus Christ is our sacrifice but it'll be there to show it a temple to show it amen that we can go into that Temple right and we can worship the real God of the temple amen the Bible says the lamb will be not amen it's not dealing with trying to have times and dates and all it's a cleansing of the land getting ready and in the millennial rain comes they precede us here and build a temple now here's a question that would ask me you know but right now we're going to be going to match up right here three and a half here we're going to match up it's only three and a half years then we got to come back to Millennium but I just proved to you could be seven years whether you believe it or not it just went that far sure 1300 something days even up to seven years in the millennium we ride back after the temple is finished amen because we're the New Jerusalem you did you listen here's the city here's the building it is the New Jerusalem because it's what it's called but this New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven John John described the city and told it to ride he described the ride College of City read revelation 21-22 that's right well that's how close we are we ride back into the millennium it's not a seven year period of time like we're looking at it it's a getting ready for the millennium like I said the brothers asked me a question I thought we're just gonna be up for three and a half years of marriage supper and I just asked a simple question let me find somebody who won't get offended for me evening y'all got married in the church today right and you all had a wedding shepherdy we have a move here after so it doesn't matter over there they go back and forth you had a wedding supper didn't you and you know why you disappeared right and you got in the car and drove oh right with the bells hanging on the back and the cans of cloth and nobody didn't see you for a quite a while unless you'd like me and my wife all we could do is run up the motel and come back home good afford it I'm talking about people that can't afford to drink into it you see one darling man three and a half years at the marriage suffered that's going to be a beautiful work marriage supper ain't it that's right amen but now not 144 000 don't go on the honeymoon and our honeymoon starts in heaven you gonna come to that prepare a honeymoon on Earth Richard and Anna they got married and they spent the first night up here on our cabinet we used to have up the mountains you know of course we put a few tricks on them but they went upstairs and they thought the kids who sneaked in was going to stay up there and go cut it upstairs they went up to the bedroom and there was a great big humped like kids so they start pounding on the kids thanking the grandkids is in the bed come find out it was a bunch of balloons and all them balloons and all over that bed was money and boy they started Gathering it up you know you understand what I mean right when you get married and you get that marriage supper ended you disappeared for a while yeah and that's what we're going to do in heaven amen we're going to be with him until they finish us down here then we're going to ride back with you see in this ties the Millennium introduction amen whatever puts them into the Millennium will put you and I in the morning right amen it's the Plan of Redemption all right Simple Plan of Redemption I'll give you these this is where people don't fall everyone around them and every one of these is but around he uses it he said 70 weeks equals seven years energy powerful way to get this afternoon 70 weeks equals seven years remember it was a parable right this of time is a parable oh three and a half years of promises Ministry in three and a half years of Jesus right yeah which is seven years I wrote a random eye to the seals broke I'll give you three quotes of it said 70 weeks equals seven years never did run around them anywhere I challenge you to find it never preached 490 years to Israel except in the message of the Daniel 78. were they thinking we're so massively confused he said the Lord put it on his pen what do they think well it's got to be over here it's 70 weeks equals seven years of Ministry of Jesus Christ right here right do they tapped it but the greatest of all times is Rose Redemption is a type of the Redemption of right right which one do we get this ministry or this ministry all right he said well we got to get this because we're done going over there now I can go back Williamson and preach because you see what them two prophets preach right there there's Seven Seals to Israel so we get this three and a half years Ministry and then we understand by prophecy what they will get all right until we get it all right amen so depend on coming stay in three hours may not be a joke that might be true I hope we're trying to explain it amen simple terminologies right amen how's the entire Bible together you said well I don't see how it's important well it's important to understand Redemption that's important all right is it important to do what the word says again baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the Bible said you should know the truth the truth amen right back on these things anybody have a need for prayer just come over I'm gonna pray with you right now I love you because jealous Minds foreign we thank you for this morning we know we had to run through so far I assume you forgive us and it takes

them in your prayers keep us in your prayers keep brother Dale and I in your prayers cuz we're the ones doing the speaking at the at the ministers meeting on the Daniel 70 weeks right so that's a one preacher said that's a shin kick subject that's about right for a lot of people it's a shin kicking subject to me it's very simple can you write in a you know I was looking we need to find some darker colors maybe they got I've looked in here there's I'm surely there's got to be there's a what's the matter with blue and black some of these are about Brown I don't like brown but yeah that's better that okay all right for sister Freda alone we rid in brown nobody else who invited her to church that better can you see that I mean really if you can't see it let me know do I we've grown up now we don't stick tongues out at each other okay we've got Ryan and Gabby in here they're just children and they will pick up on that start sticking tongue out at their children all right fifth seal Grace Revelations chapter 6 now we've already been through the first four seals if you if you have any questions about those four since we have some new ones in here go back and look online because they're all online and you can pick up where we went from the first seal up to the fourth seal now we're in the fifth seal all right and I'll explain this a little more here and I'll I'll draw it up there again but uh I was looking the other day for some other colors we need to there there got to be some really bright like high defin colors now that we can use the ceiling so low I apologize but the glare off of that thing on here and hard to see so we just have to do what we can do one those neon colors neon colors yeah we'll we'll see what we can do all right let's go and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge I have that word underlined the bride does not anything so that could not be the bride anything to do with the bride that has nothing to do with the bride of Jesus Christ cuz it's that's not what we say we say forgive them Lord for they don't know what they do so this is a different group all right they CED with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not judge and avenge our blood see on them that dwell on the Earth and white Roes were given unto every one of them in their theophonic condition because they're under the altar see you and I get eternal life the white robe supposedly we supposedly we get it here I said supposedly if you're not born again you don't have it all right but we get white robes down here when you're born again you get a white robe all right which is the righteousness of the saints that will tell you in Revelations over 19 I believe it is the white Rob and white robes were given unto every one of of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were there's another clue as they were should be fulfilled all right so now let's go back just for a second and look at this and I'll I'll do it over here I guess you can can you see it better over there or over here over there over here yeah okay all right well we looked at the church ages here's the church ages just to go back through one more time but I'm going to take take my time because you're going to have to see I want everybody to understand something and I don't want to be real critical about anything but but it's just my job it's a gift like dve said it's a gift I have you see this thing right here m now technically technically get it when you can technically you can't bend over and hide your normal Hy when you do does everybody uh two three four if that's okay then we have what is this love right now we know we see we receive the Holy Ghost here is that correct we don't wait till brother brand put Holy Spirit here on the pyramid cuz all this goes together the seals the Daniel 7 weeks the the the plagues the bows the statue of a perfect man MH it it's all intertwined you can't just take one subject and say well this is one subject depart from another no they all intertwined together right all right so we receive the holy ghost at Faith is that correct amen all right virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness I'm missing one in there but right there it is behind you if you want to look at it right we have Holy Spirit and then the Capstone is love just to be real honest with you you got to be here before you can understand these right okay now the faith of the fathers is what everybody had in the first church age remember I said talk to about that this down here was Faith but this down here the foundation was the faith of the fathers all right everybody understand that say amen amen okay right faith of the fathers then we went through the church ages and about the fourth age like we were talking about here the the fourth Church AE went down right went down in the ground they took on father son Holy Ghost baptism they took on eternal hell they took on Trinity they took on all these false doctrines everybody got say Amen participation today we're going to participate cuz if you don't say oh me or I don't I don't understand that but the faith of the fathers was here now what happened was it got eroded it wasn't that the word was not as powerful but Satan had put a a wrapper around it or a buffer around it or a Doctrine around it right Doctrine is what kills you cancer doesn't kill you and heart attacks don't kill you doctrin kill you cancer kills this guy doctrin kills the ones inside that you know Jesus said don't be don't worry about the guy that killed this thing he said wor about the guy that can kill the soul God's the only one who can kill the soul Satan can't kill anything he can kill this thing because of putting things on you but he cannot kill the soul God's the only one who can do that he made it he can kill it right so that's his priority but now Faith of the fathers was right here correct right had the word the power of the word working well right here in this fourth Church age this is Fifth Sixth and seven here in this fourth Church age it went in the ground died all right we showed it in a parallel over here but what I'm trying to show you is we had to come up to this age here which was what the eagle correct right all right and then we had to come to Malachi 4 which is he will restore the faith of the fathers to the Pentecostal children right remember Malachi 4 the first part Malachi 3 actually was to restore the faith of the Old Testament to the new right then this got eat down and then let's just read M you say well we read 100 times word got eat down not 101 101 times we're going to read this all right behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Greatful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children all right the old Pentecostal fathers to the New Testament children all right then as we go on up through the church ages that was lost then we come up into the eagle age where brother rown said he that that messenger of M would tie those Lo loose ends together well we got loose ends down through the church ages correct yeah and the Heart of the children to their fathers so the heart of these Pentecostal babbling children is going to be restored back to the faith of the fathers everybody got that to say Amen so we're supposed to act like what the foundation was all right so if we don't act like the foundation was we can't understand the rest of what's going on because in time in time TimeWise the Rapture takes place right here you what I say in time in time the Rapture takes place at the end of the seventh Church age now we know as a fact that the that the Capstone is to come down on to the people yes all right but the Rapture takes place here and raptures all these Church ages together correct everybody guys say Amen do all right the Rapture takes place at the end of the seventh Church age now remember you got to remember though that that seventh Church age I said time because time goes on the seventh Church age actually goes on into the Millennium what the problem said we're still in time we're still in time we're still in we're still in Grace until the white Throne judgment so we got to go through marriage supper Battle of armagedon we don't go through but you understand the Earth does Thousand Years Millennium they have to be raised back up white Throne judgment that's when time stops the the Millennium is a is still you're still in the old you're still in the old seventh day Sabbath Church age right we are resurrected sitting in Heavenly place out of the church ages in the eth day the Millennium is not Eternal it's a thous years One Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 day 5 day the the Earth is going to continue to grow we're going to build houses oh okay usually when you raise hand you KNE something just raise both of them praise God but that's right I mean time is continued but not for the bride that's why I said in time the Rapture takes place after the seven Church AE ends down here you everybody understand is that not confusing that's confusing say it's confusing everything okay all right so the Rapture takes place here now I said in time cuz the headstone has to come down onto a group of people to take us in a Rapture right but TimeWise the Rapture takes place right here which is Seal number one 2 3 Rapture takes place on the what four seal right for us takes place on the four seal because remember we read the fifth seal there's no combat Beast there's no coming SE right everything's gone see then the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal and the seventh seal listen before I before we begin this is now set aside for you and I cuz the headstone could only come at the end time right there's a lot of people here's my point there's a lot of people going to go into Rapture let me put it this way 99% of the people that go into Rapture never is not going to have the headstone right 99% there's only going to be 1% of a BRI that go can you see me from there I want to I want to see me I want to see this this right here okay I don't care if they see me they see my finger but I don't care they see me I want to see this does everybody understand that though as a people only a small small group is going to have this Capstone come down on them to seal a group in cuz that's why people have a real bad problem and I know people even around here have preached that you don't get the Holy Ghost until right here because brother R he does make a St and he said you come all this way and you don't have the Holy Ghost yet well that's true that's not true you said oh you talking about a prophet no I know what he's talking about he's right in both places amen our mentality is wrong you got to get the holy ghost to have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience you got to have the Holy Ghost you don't understand the Bible says without the Holy Ghost you can't understand who Jesus is right and put his bodily figure in here that's right that's who he is we're his body you got to understand the body of God Amen all right cuz we are the body of God all right so you got to have the Holy Ghost first but this is a refilling right but if you'll watch where brother bandam gets up to the statute of a perfect man he says he said here Here Comes these waves and he draws waves down through here and what it's doing in it's sealing a group of people in right not giving them the Holy Ghost to take a Rapture but giving them the faith of the fathers and then adopting them into the family so that God seals it all together and that means you got all seven virtues working in your life everybody understand say Amen am okay so there's where we're at as far as we're looking at three things we're looking at the natural world all right CU when you get finished with the fourth seal Rapture takes place so you got to get in you got to put it into a bodily form and a spiritual form cuz we're not here when the fif F over but the fifth seal has to open to us down here right before we go there that's right right so there's only going to be a small group of people going to understand this because these people that are dead and gone on they can have a revelation of it but I'm talking about when it locks her together that's right okay when that thing comes down when The Headstone comes down onto a group of people they're going to be that's going to be the head which is who Christ that's going to be him coming to the body and it's only going to be a short period of time and we're going in a Rapture short period of time the only way we're going to take a Rapture is for that headstone to come down cuz the headstone has to come back only comes back in the end time when you said there's 90% 99 99 but was that all the seven the six Church ages 7 to seven Church AG is not going to understand seven Church ages not know where they were coming right no the only people that's well actually basically the only people that's going to make the change is the ones that are I mean make the physical change there's going to be aive everybody from today back they're dead right the race has run they finished their course they've done what God wanted them to do no shame involved at all that's what somebody asked me the other day about Sister Margaret uh atting about Gary you know Sister Margaret said well how do you explain that I the only way I can explain it's the way Dad explained it God was finished with it that's right right God's finished with you he's going to take you home you know what he gave a man 15 more years one time and that was the worst 15 years that man ever had right he should have went on when God wanted him to go on cuz what he done was he got into the permissive will of God and really messed his life up when you're ready to go when I'm ready to go if God wants to see me to the chains for the body chains I am heading toward that but if he wants to take me tomorrow then you know what my if I believe I'm a Child of God then then that's the perfect will of God my race is done I can't say no more when brother random was killed in 1965 his race was done he had already brought the message and it took a group of people then to be the voice the final voice to the final age in The Bride of Jesus Christ everybody got that so if if he's done with you then there's no shame you're going to come up in the resurrection actually you're going to come up before we get Ted so you're going to you're going to be you're going to be in a glorified condition before the ones that take the the body change that clock's not stopping today is it you know what even spiders come to church you're the Holy Ghost is that deep that a part of that Holy GH this is this is growing you up into this and that's the whole call that's the see the Deep call to the deep down here call you into the body then once you're in the body God doesn't quit talking to you that's right no he talks to you more yes and when you come to this right here see you've come you've come to what 99% of the people's not going to come to is a seiling in where God says hey if you're going to hear from this guy it's like Jesus as a type remember Jesus didn't need the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but on the River Jordan he received the Holy Ghost come down as a dove and the father says this is my beloved Son in whom I please to dwell right here when he does that to you he says the same identical thing the night or day or moment you receive the baptism of Holy Ghost God said I'm pleased to dwell in that vessel but let's go on to faith I mean let's go on to virt let's go on to knowledge that's go and if you do walk up through this and you see that God because remember the sister Shepherd's dream it was a pyramid right brother brandham pulled the top off of that pyramid well when he pulled the top off it had to kind of look like this John going we going to pray we're going to pray for the sick one let's just put it right here can everybody see that this is a pyramid in itself this is not a complete pyramid remember brother Bram said the pyramid is not complete right you even say Jesus said I he the Bible says he's the head of the corner he's Chief Cornerstone what does the corner look like midd pyramid right so there she found found you got your little pyramids all the way up through here you got little pyramids and there's your Cornerstone then you start working on these things and it's not that you get virtue peel that off and hand it away and say I'm done with that no this is just I've always said this is just in here for reference purposes there are no lines in the pyramid that's right right there are steps right there's no lines cuz you're going to receive virtue the time that this happen you're going to receive knowledge at the time this happen so it's not that you're going to get all at once and then you're not going to need it anymore right no that's not the way it works but what was I talking about a minute ago when I left my point oh the Holy Spirit when uh sister shepher had a her dream he said he whipped the top off right and then what happened now I'm not talking about the one where he looked down in it and saw White Stone he's talking about sister Shepherd's dream right remember and the water started flowing out of the top of the pyramid what did he say was coming out trash trash that's not down here that's right here so we still got trash that's what he said he said trash was coming out and that's what's that's what happened to that water washing into the water of the word puts the trash but there's one day that this thing right here is going to have to just like when you seal a jar once that thing sealed like Daddy's preaching now about the sealing of the people once that thing sealed you get sealed into the body down here Jesus on the River Jordan then in a TI God took him upon a mountain and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him in other words he come to a position not that he needed to he was doing it for me and you Jesus's life was an example for us he was the he was the New Birth he was the Holy Ghost he was God he was Emanuel he was Jehovah he was all these things he didn't need to gain he didn't gain any new attributes remember God don't gain new attributes you always watch you and I have to gain new attribute yes CU this is the attributes of God yes all right everybody got that so the Holy Spirit once that pushes it out that Holy Spirit sits down there and seals that right all right seals you this is who in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him everybody understand yes all right then this comes down a little bit closer there's a there's a spot I want to I want to get on Statue of a perfect man that if you'll notice and it's actually of a perfect man and this this this kind of correlates with and I know it's a little little B here's an adult we're the female and God's the male right all right brother Brown said it's a diamond shaped pyramid or a diamond shape headstone you watch it you want read it it like a diamond so was a diamond a diamond this is what he's doing he's not just sitting down on us flat like this what's a diamond like that's a diamond right right he's not going to just sit down on top of us he's going all the way through everybody understand that I mean you watching brother BR he said A diamond that's a diamond this ain't a diamond this is a diamond diamond shape he said there's a flange to keep the water out well how you do that you got that thing so perfectly fit water just going to what low right down to him but it he's moving down through us he's not just going to sit down on top of us he's moving through us right you can bring that point all the way down to here if you want to cuz he started right down here where he started bringing you The Headstone yes I mean that's kind of we're kind of off our point but still it's a good thought maybe we'll teach on that when we get finished with this but my point today is is remember TimeWise the Raptor takes place on the four sale right all the brides gone yes this is bride Church ages right here there's no church age up here right that's not a church age all right everybody got that this is not an extra Church age now this is the Eighth Day that's eternal life now that truly that's what comes to you at the new birth in a baby form little be be baby form brother said it's a spot a spot but when you come to the when you come to all virtues working in your life so what am I trying to say you can take a Rapture after you kill that spider no you don't have to kill him yeah yeah see a Rapture the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal there's got a group of people come to this diamond shaped pyramid because it's got to when God sets down down on top of us as bride he's going to feel brother Bown said he'll F every fiber of your being and we go into Rapture see he hasn't F this right here yet that's right I said yeah he purchased it purchased it at Calvary but this thing right here has not been redeemed yet as far as a physical moment of Redemption all right wish still leave a thing alone listen to what I'm saying I would try to well the thing ain't going to hurt nobody but not listening to this is going to hurt somebody all right fifth six and seven seal is for the Redemption of this guy nobody in this point of time I said of time there's nobody in this point of time is going to need that that's right cuz they're usually they're all dead right only the alive and remain okay right so we got to understand that fifth seal we're going to show the natural part we'll start next Sunday show the natural part of the seal which is the 144,000 you say all the hang on a minute that you read there where it says it says right here testimony which they held in cown with the loud voice said how long and white robes are given unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were 144,000 got to be killed right that's right as they were they're Jews right so the 144,000 is what Jews there's not going to be another killing of the Jews Like Ian and Hitler cuz that's where these people are coming from right these people under this altar in the fifth seal natural seal is going has been killed because they were Jews period they don't know nothing about Jesus Christ they don't know nothing about the Bible except that it exists see that's why it's going to be the you're going to see the greatest move of Grace because God give eternal life to a group of people that didn't even want right that's right they still don't want that's right but God said okay I blinded your eyes so I can take a bride that's right so to be just to be a just God I'm going to give you eternal life for the testimony you held not the testimony of Jesus Christ you're going to seize the 144,000 is going to be killed for the testimony of Jesus Christ we'll see that in the natural part of the seal so we're going to go through next Sunday and probably a couple Sundays on the natural opening of that seal what happens during the natural time of that seal then we're going to go into the spiritual part of that seal and give you the timeline of it but I just want you to see this but I want you to realize one thing if you don't have all these virtues working in your life then then you're not just going to automatically get elevated to the cap Stone that's right yes sir you got to have all this working in your life it's got to be prevalent in your life not just show up every once in a while that's right the devil shows up every once in a while I mean the devil's usually there all the time God shows up just every once in a while sorry I had it backwards sorry yeah brother Keith and I were talking about this morning talking about living as humans we live as humans 99% of the time that's right we do 99% of time we live as humans and then every little once in a while we get a glimpse of God but you know what God has took that little Glimpse and he's going to break back he's going to open up and it's not going to we still going to live human lives but we're not going to be and it's not sinless Perfection by no means but we're not going to be bothered if we're still bothered by things we were bothered before people come on we got to be we got to get this thing right here this thing will take care we talked about it last Sunday a lot of you are just divorced some of your problems not killed them that's right I told y'all 90% of the people in this message I don't believe born again or they wouldn't act the way they do they're just Sanctified which is a good condition to be in but it's not a good condition to stay there that's right but I'm going to be say one hard statement if you're still doing the same thing you were doing two years ago I'm going to give you Grace two years ago if you're doing the same identical thing you doing 10 years ago where you been that's right where you been you come to this church you say the word of God's being preached in this church you say that everything's doing wonderful in this church as far as the word goes and then you still act the same way you did two years you get the Holy Ghost that won't happen that won't happen so let's start back here remember brother Dale said he wished I could tell all of you you weren't born again some of you even prove it but but you know what growing grace and knowledge just keep growing that's right get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will change you amen it will not just divorce your feelings that's right it will change your way thinking just like we're talking about this course that we're taking this Dave Ramsey course I mean that that's a carnal expression but it's changing it'll change your life thank you some of you for the email that you sent about that course how it's really helping you but but but to a person I told you I'll tell you the ones that not going to it to a person if you'll understand if you'll ask some of the people who took this course it brings a husband and wife closer together least not bring bring it makes you discuss things and and if some of you worked on your budget this week you did get close together I don't see any black eyes we hav have to pray for any broke arms or legs so maybe somebody sat down and done something doesn't it doesn't it do didn't it do that it really did it bring it brings you together and that's what you know if you can't if you can't live with your wife how you going to live with others cuz she's part of you okay but we got to start somewhere we got let's started the foundation I'm going to go through the fifth sixth and seventh seal but let's just let's just keep it back down here though and say God I need to be born again I need this thing that I've been dealing with for 2 years I need it out of my life and I put it on a calendar just like I told them guys down there at the at the baptism man when I went down in the water down there in Gil Georgia in 1998 when I went in the water when I come up out of that water I was the most empty individual you ever seen in your life I felt empty we hugged each other and cried for when minutes but that was the most that when I come up out of that water I said God I want this stuff dead and I'm burying it right here I'm not coming back up with it it's staying right here that's what I told them guys I said you put a steak in it right here say Satan right here is where you died oh yeah you got you got an opportunity to come and talk to me but you died right here and of course I've grown from there in Grace and knowledge I hope everybody's seen it with the June and I together have grown in Grace and knowledge through those years but let's not go backwards this is not a going backward gospel that's right everything's going up right he's taking us up into the headstone so that's where the fifth six fifth sixth and seventh seal really works in a group of people and you really not going to see it with just a very short time everybody understand that you're going to see it a very short time you're not going to see a great 2-year manifestation or or or a long manifestation of of God changing your your your being right it's going to be very short brother Brown said a short quick powerful message will sweep out what is that that's somebody that God seals in and says hey I'm adopting that guy or that girl brother or sister both they don't just adopt men we're all feminist in the body but somebody's going to be adopted and this is going to work in their life you're going to see so much grace where you're not going to see anything else that's suppos to help me more than anything and and sure I'm hard on things but but your life always speaks louder than your word that's right always you can confess all you want to but your life is always going to speak louder than words so let's work on this guy down here let's work on this and and work our way up I'm going to teach on the fifth seal Sixth Seal and seventh seal but you know what it's going to take a mighty group of people to get to that spot I'm talking about a mighty group of people and it won't be you doing it I promise you CU remember you died right down here that's right you died a long time ago you have a on the number time you sawce in yeah did anybody did anybody to L up I had 16 16 times good girl none of you other you did it 16 times do your homework thank you sister the brag on my mate 16 let's go we got to we

Lord Jesus I believe we might have have a got faces here that wasn't here this morning I thought I seen one or two okay God bless you and U we're going to read the scripture and let you be seated just in a moment and um uh ask brother Dale and brother Wade uh if they trusted me and they yeah I said well I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to receive an offering tonight then how many would give if I us to receive an offering well what I'm going to what I'm suggest you we do is uh everybody put in your clocks your watches and your cell phones and we'll take this clock down right here you know put it the basket and if everybody pull if everybody pulls real good then I'll give your watches back after oh my I believe that we can just get in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen already passed from Life unto death into eternity and well um I'm kind of like the old circuit riding preacher I like to think I am sometimes he went into this store building and he swept it out cleaned it out he's going to have a Revival for the first time and so he hung up his shangle you know Revival and and he announced around and whenever they got ready to have service well there was just one old sheep herder came into town and came to the meeting and so uh the preacher stood around nobody else come you know he talked to that old farmer and Rancher and said well I guess we can't have a meeting ain't nobody coming and the Rancher said well my goodness you know he said you know if I go out to feed my sheep and there just one old sheep comes up I at least feed that one sheep and so the farmer he said well I mean the preacher thought maybe he's hting I better preach you know he want he wants to hear something he come for some sheep food so he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and finally he closed up and shook the man's hand said how'd you enjoy it he said oh man he said I'm full up said I I really did enjoy it you really fed me that was real sheep food said but you know what said when I go out to feed my sheep said if just one old sheep comes in I don't dump the whole load on one sheep so I'll try not to dump the whole load tonight amen all right I've got two place in the scripture I want to read first Luke Chapter 2 and this will kind of maybe tie it in with what we had this morning amen and uh just a little portion here of Luke 2 and then we want to go I believe it's 2 Corinthians 12:10 or uh 12:7 um I wondered who that was that sung is this the brother back here that sung the is that brother Tom my tell you what brother Tom is say brother Tom if you ever come over to South Carolina I sure want you to sing that song okay that was 83 years old my my I hope I'm perking like that that 8 don't let me forget that brother there you bring him and he said we want we sure want him to sing you know what singing a song when you're inspired of the Lord is kind of like delivering a message makes you feel like you're part of what's going on am and you know all of us in this together aren't we and it's wonderful to see a church where you want everybody to play their part brother it's not no big eyes and little you it's all pulling together amen now yes I'm not this but I told out there we come in I said I really do enjoy that preacher preaching I said he he you know we're on the same way like Brother Sam yes thank you brother God bless you I appreciate you saying that thank you brother Luke chap 2 and verse 41 now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days notice it didn't say the p Passover was fulfilled right right right when they had fulfilled the days see as they returned the child jesus carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a Day's Journey and they sought him among their kin folks and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him Y and it came to pass that after 3 days amen must have been in the fourth if he after 3 days after 3 days right they found him right in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee soring and he said unto them how unto them say Joseph and Mary both there probably and uh how is it that ye sought me wished ye not that I must be about my father's business they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all those these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man right now one more little portion of scripture I believe it's second Corinthians that I want and if I'm not mistaken it's verse 12 verse 7 may be First Corinthians let's see here 127 uh yes 2 Corinthians maybe 12:7 uh this verse of scripture starts in be uh uh 2 Corinthians 12:7 this is one of the few verses in the Bible that begins and ends the same way and God doesn't use vain repetition right so he's trying to emphasize something here to us right notice and lest I should be exalted above measure it's the great Apostle Paul writing through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure right and uh listen let's pray and uh just before we're seated Lord Jesus tonight we are asking once again that you will uh just add to Lord uh our understanding the eyes of our understanding might be enlightened and that we'd be able to come a little rung higher up Jacob's Ladder be drawn closer to thee climbing up the pyramid Mountain as it were Lord and God that when we leave the service this evening we would uh be able to say as they that walked with you on the road to amus did not our hearts burn within us as he spake to us along the way and opened unto us the scriptures help us Lord may you do the same because you are the same in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you may be seated tonight again we want to maybe just take another little part of what we had uh this morning uh up to the yes up to the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ staying with the word amen and bringing that word to full maturity now the prophet of God taught us uh that there's only one reason for God's displeasure right have I got your attention right only one reason for God's displeasure with you as an individual or a group or church there's only one reason for God's displeasure with any individual you or me or anybody else and that is for you or I to leave the word right and there's only one remedy to regain his favor right and that is for you and I to come back to the word we read this morning from the message how can I overcome and we learned that there was only six in the days of John the Baptist is that what the prophet Tau us only six others offered their offerings and so forth made their sacrifices kept the ores thousands of them perhaps millions of them but these were the elected right amen these overcame right exactly six Overcomers in the days of John the Baptist now you don't overcome when you're passing notes and chew and Bubblegum and all these things in church if you want to be an overcomer you got to come to the word and let the word come to you is that right and so if you will just uh help me now and the more you help me the faster you help me the faster I can preach and the faster we get done and not just we're not here just to get done but we want to get somewhere is that right get get uh you know and um uh find the expression of the word find the expression of the spirit what is needful as we said this morning it has to be a word in season that has never been in season before amen and so let's uh pray that the Lord would just speak to us I need him to speak to me amen right I unless he speaks to me I can't speak to you that's right and so if we have the right attitude and approach to the service I know you might be a little bit tired and so forth but we don't want to entertain that is that right we want to just uh just do our very best put our best foot forward and let the Lord speak to us right now remember every true and fresh Revival comes when men and women have gotten back to the word of God for their age Joseph and Mary left the word right Joseph and Mary were elected and ordained to bring the word to maturity but instead of bringing that word to maturity they left the word that's right when the word itself was coming right to maturity amen the most important time for them to stick with the word right and they had left the word right now listen you don't have to leave 100% of the word all you have to do is leave one word Mary uh uh Eve excuse me did not doubt or misbelieve a whole sentence right or paragraph yeah she only miss one word right amen and if God put Adam and Eve out of the garden for misbelieving or disobeying one word he is God and he won't let you and I go back in right exactly disobeying one word we must come by the way of the word amen amen God's God right he's no respect of persons and so I want to emphasize this tonight staying with every word and letting that word bring us to maturity see it's not you bringing the word to maturity so much as it is letting that word see bring you right and me to its maturity and so we see that uh I want to just read a little something here to you from the church book that comes to me I think I have it marked here somewhere yes page 251 and um then I want to say something uh very positive about the five-fold ministry because a lot of people take this quotation here and they say something negative about the five Ministry or try to do away with it but listen to this is it uh it is not enough that he is a son Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was sent seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough that we see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors for in each age the church goes astray and it's not just the leoty but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep right then God brings himself on the scene right as the chief Shepherd glory in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the Abundant power of that truth amen God is in his people all of his people for If any man had not the spirit of Christ he is none of his I just read a portion you get the the context of that if you'd like but now see uh God wants us to stay with the word and here myself as a shepherd and a minister God forbid that I'd ever say anything to reflect on that because that's uh you know it one of the most profound things that I ever thought of or could ever see and I seen it years ago is how that somebody claiming to be a preacher part of the fivefold ministry get up and suggest there is no such a thing talk about a self- disputing preacher self- condemning message yeah you know what I'm saying that that we don't need none anymore oh my and you know I I was reminded again what the prophet said in question answers on the seals brother Brenham he asked the question should the would the bride have a Ministry before the Rapture he said why sure that's what's taking place right now amen it consists of Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers is that right but it' be so simple he said amen now so as we see that uh this we want to acknowledge that shepherds are wrong as well as sheep right okay amen and th so we see that God brings himself on the scene through the ministry of these seven Messengers right right well if the seven Messengers have come and gone God must have come in uh as the chief Shepherd y right is that right as I said this morning and we were reminded of what taking place in 1933 when the pillar fire moved down and the Holy Spirit said as John the Baptist was sent to forun my first coming your ministry your message however you want to say it was sent to forerun the second coming then John the Baptist could not be taken off the scene until Christ was introduced right we are in a repeat of that same thing in this day and unless we see that and realize that we're not walking in the light of the Revelation that's right we've got to realize the full word has been birthed back into manifestation again today as it was 2,000 years ago and that it is coming to maturity right when this word begin to come to maturity then uh we see that Joseph and Mary got out of Step a little bit but they got back in life amen you know the church had left the word down through the Dark Ages and when it that's why it went into darkness right but after Luther after Wesley after Pentecost we found the word restored after 3 days and now we know the full word has been birthed back into full manifestation again and God has personified Jesus Christ has personified himself Among Us that's right amen amen right oh my see now brother Brenham said no man will ever reach the plane that Jesus reached I've got the quote right here if you want to read it no and he says it twice in the same paragraph in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily right he said you receive it by measure is that right and even himself he said I I receive it you and I receive it by measure but Christ without measure amen is that right amen but see we see the manifestation of the alpha and omega ministry and it was Jesus Christ manifesting through these seven Messengers re bringing himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd first to appear and then to come see the appearing of the Lord right amen and he appears uh and has appeared and uh we see then in the last few years this manifestation to bring the church to full maturity now we look at Paul Paul was an overcomer in his age you believe that had to be the first church Angel messenger amen but here the great Apostle Paul before he met Christ he had got exalted above mejor oh he was riding a high house and he was persecuting the true church amen and breathing out threatenings against the true church oh brother he'd kill everybody get in his hands on you know or having stoned or putting jail or something and he's seeking more power and more Authority CU he was religious and he was very zealous about his religion right and these a bunch of Cults Jesus name Cults and all these he was getting rid of them he's trying his best to scatter them is that right God was allowing Paul to do it true yeah that's right it was fulfilling the program of God right sure it was Amen Let and the more he scattered him the more the the word went out like like wart is that right right but while Paul was on his road down to Damascus you know what he ran into the pillar fire and U it's hard for thee to kick against the Pricks why persecutest thou me Saul Saul and he got a name change and God took the fight out of Paul right he blinded him for three days exactly y knocked him off his feet talk about humbling him and we're reminded how then concerning that brother bam said anytime you and I are you awake everybody awake rise above that Damascus dust you raise above God that's right amen the Latin word for uh humble the English word humble comes from the Latin word humus yeah which means dust dust y dust Thou Art Y and dust thou returnest amen and you should never forget that amen see and so we see that Paul even after he was converted by the abundance of these true Revelations he wasn't receiving false Revelations right Paul was receiving true Revelations but because he was receiving so many of them yeah abundance through the abundance of the revelations he was having a tendency to be exalted above measure yeah now Satan was perfect in the day was created how many knows that the angel CH that cover God's right-and man to fellowship with brother B said coequal with God in every respect except to be able to create God wouldn't let he was an archangel all Revelation went through him handed down to the angels y he trafficked trafficked in Revelation y he wasn't a drug trafficker he trafficked in Revelation amen but through the abundance of those Revelations God allowed him to get exalted above measure right y right Lord and he got a false Revelation that he wanted a false notion of is our and he said I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God listen brothers and sisters may we never try to exalt ourself above these Seven Stars this message come from God God has brought him on the scene through these Messengers see right and don't you ever think to exalt yourself above the prophet I want you to see something here this evening six Overcomers in the days of John the Baptist and you'll notice how the word had to correct Joseph and Mary yeah and the word had to correct Zachariah you ever stop thinking about that brother brandham said Zachariah was praying for a child yeah zachar Elizabeth was but she was old and Barren yeah and God heard his cry that that Gabriel said your prayer has been heard God heard his heard him and now remember he's one of the Overcomers when God calls a pastor he calls his wife with him so Elizabeth is identified in the ministry with him zachari and Elizabeth all right and uh Joseph and Mary a type of the leoty natural people Carpenter right zachari and Elizabeth a type of the ministry fivefold see but here's an and Sime Simeon and prophet and Prophet as brother R said is that right but it's Christ and the church Christ and the church but three categories of these six see uh three categories and all each one of those categories is a type of Christ in the church see me and Anna as you study that oh it's beautiful right am and uh but we see here that the word had to correct Joseph and Mary and here we see Zachariah you know what he was he was a message preacher yeah that's right he was a message preacher because he receiv received the message the same Angelic visit visitor the same messenger the same Angel messenger that went to Mary right 6 months earlier had going to Zechariah right that's right and by the time Mary got the word from the angel Zachariah was dumb Zachariah was D for at least nine months a minister in the House of God and he remained of course once he finished up his ministration there probably pretty quick after he spitten dumb he went home and Elizabeth conceived but you see he questioned the message of the hour that's right he he doubted it it looked kind of like Mary had questioned but Angel the Lord knows the heart she wasn't doubting she didn't say how can this be sing I don't know man but uh the Lord knew her heart and he just explained to her how it be the Holy Ghost but when it come to Zechariah now here he's been praying for it and God answers his prayer and hear the Angelic visitation tells him what he's going to do and still doubted it exactly how can this be I'm old and Elizabeth's old you know he was doubting a little bit that's okay to doubt if you doubt your doubts right it's okay down a little bit if you just doubt your doubts see that's what brother brand quoted brother bossworth it must be okay okay yeah and so but see he literally doubted and so Gabriel said I tell you what I I'm I'm Gabriel I come right from the presence of God you're doubting my word oh I'll just give you a sign in you want a sign you can't just take it like me saying I'm going to give you a sign you'll be smitten dumb you won't be able to to speak a word until my words have made fullfill cuz you doubted my word right right amen right a dumb message preacher right we got a lot of them thank you Lord I'm glad we got a few that's got their mouth open amen they might slobber like a horse eating tall Clover or something like that sometimes you know and if you sit on the front row you might get baptized or sprinkled but at least they got the mouth that can make some kind of noise but he couldn't make he couldn't speak a word right that's right all he could do is just write you know he just it all had to be in in symbol form letter form whatever he tried to get across is that right right he didn't have the spoken word right exactly he didn't right but amen when he no longer wanted to call the church after his name but the name that Gabriel gave him to call him right they wanted to call him Zachariah or something like that he said no sir his name's going to be John soon as he obeyed the message and acted on the word he the first case of Divine Healing in the New Testament that I know of right in the house of God right amen when they he'd come back see right when he was smitten dumb his administration was finished he went home and the word of the Lord was fulfilled y Elizabeth conceived did you ever stop to think Zachariah might have been there this morning we had a Mary going down to the house of Elizabeth her cousin and there's Zachariah and here's Jesus and here's John the Baptist yeah oh my Zachariah maybe couldn't enter into the Revival like them women could didn't hear him shout too much there no record of him saying a thing exactly he's dumb during that time remember right right oh my but we see when the word of the Lord was fulfilled and he obeyed the word wrote the word oh his tongue was loosed you talk about a shou and good time they had there oh my amen my at the naming of the Prophet M see but but see no where I just said that to say this I'm not suggesting that Simeon and Anna now didn't need a little correction in their life I'm sure the Holy Spirit corrected them but you don't find in the Bible where the word corrected the prophet right right brother Ram said when a major prophet comes on the scene nobody judges him right you don't have to correct him now five-fold Ministry Prophet or something like that you know gift of Prophecy supposed to be judged for it comes to the church to my understand standing a church amen not only the person who gives the message uh where it's tongues or prophecy whatever is supposed to be written down and then U the two or three judges they put their name on it too and then let the pastor read it he don't have to question it just read it but then if it don't come to pass not the pastor's fault right but that man who gave the message and the man who interpreted and the two or three that were supposed to have the wisdom to judge it they all got a lineing spirit on them let him repent before we get anything else from him is that what he taught sure as Church order but you don't judge the major prophet nobody he don't stand in front of nobody exactly and let me tell you something I just said that to say this God didn't send me to correct brother brandham that's right he didn't send the fivefold ministry to correct the major prophet but the other way around he sent the prophet to correct me do you believe that oh yes Moses had to wash and the priesthood before they could Minister Moses was that prophet he had to wash and clothe that priesthood and we have to come under the opes of this word that's been birthed into full manifestation through the ministry of Malachi 4 that which is perfect is come the perfect interpretation of the word of God with the vine of indication oh what an hour we're living in amen listen think about this folks who then would have the the power of infallibility brother Brenham did not claim to be infallible but let me tell you something about the power of infallibility he asked that question who then would have the power of infallibility which we know would be necessary because this last age goes back to receiving the perfect word of God as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of St Paul exactly and he goes on and says now I'll tell you he'll have it he'll be a prophet right he'll be more thoroughly vind than any of the prophets from anoch forward cuz he's got to bring that word to full maturity oh my let me ask you this what good would it do for God to send us a perfect message if he didn't also give you a perfect understanding so your Revelation would be perfect God don't give no per uh imperfect Revelations he don't give immature Revelations but the Holy Spirit see brings us to that see perfect now he that is true right full Revelation as contrasted with partial Revelation rapturing Revelation that's the our we must mature to this place right see we want to see this Bride come up here to the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ in full maturity this is what we're speaking on just for a little bit here now and then to being careful young or old man or woman lay person or Minister that we be not exalted above measure through the abundance of these Revelations because we're receiving the same Revelations that Paul received or something's wrong with us right and if he a great Apostle had a tendency to be exalted above measure what about you and I oh yeah right sure through the abundance of true Revelation right exactly Satan was exalted above measure is that right God allowed him you know to fall but he won't allow his elect to fall right that's why he has to Humble us that's why he has to crack the whip that's why he has to pull the rug out from under us some sometimes oh my my my my we don't want to be exalted above measure is that right that's right amen right brother just see how little you can be brother R said right don't see how big you can be right and if you can't say something good about somebody zip the lip you'd be better off like Zachariah is that right sure don't say anything at all right is that what we've been taught amen all right now so here in this now as we look at this we see how that the bride in this age has to come to a maturity right and um uh here in Sturgis Michigan in 56 they was talking about some Theologian jumping on brother B said why the all the apostles any case that was brought to them they never failed a case they never missed a lick said uh let me see you do this let me see you do that I said wait a minute brother we're just in our infancy we're Rising don't worry right when we get all these Fanatics and unbelievers out of the way we'll move on up into Perfection after a while and you'll see signs and wonders but we're just babes crawling just give us a little while right now that was 56 yeah all right and uh then here in spiritual inspiration uh he says it again in 56 uh and this man said well the disciples they always they never lost a case anybody they prayed for what about you and this that and the other brother B said well my eight-year-old daughter better not you better not ever ask her to tell her that she'll make you ashamed of yourself you don't know no more about the Bible than that that's a hard blow wasn't it talking to a theologian said why she knows better than that why what about the case when Jesus come down and the disciples one come to him with the um uh epilep epilepsy and and his disciples couldn't heal him and they had to bring him to Jesus I said what he said what about that and what about the time when Paul had to leave his buddy Luke 6ck right what about that you know and he said uh we're just in our infancy we're moving up and as quickly as we get you a bunch of formal Fanatics out of the way we'll be doing that see amen and but he was showing see that the bride was still somewhat in its infancy yeah and I want you to see this further in the message communion then 62 we see that the astronomers are predicting something in the early part of the first of the month now this is February of 1962 okay beginning on the 2 or the fifth or somewhere along this month the Indian astronomers predict that the world would blow to pieces and the American newspapers make fun of it I do not believe the world's going to blow to Pieces but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that and when the five planets Mars Jupiter and Venus and so forth comes into their uh they never did it oh they claim maybe 25,000 years ago but who was back there to know it see and I predict that this has a spiritual application right all right now watch this where was the first Bible written in the stars right that right now here's a prophet on Earth I don't suggest you try to do this because we got a greater Bible today and not so much that's greater but it's a different order so we don't want to go back into astrology but here's the prophet of God on Earth can inter what's taking place in the Heavens to us all right I predict that this has a spiritual application I believe it's the coming of the issue of God right now if you're going to have a a word to come to maturity first you've got to have the hemoglobin yeah right you got to have a conception you got to have a birth right you before you can have an infant is that right an infant so the issue of God is the hemoglobin of God and the hemoglobin of God is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the word is with God the Word was God now so we see then that he's saying I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God that the great revelation of the word will be open during this time Glory y then he goes on see and and remember that great message he preached uh s is this the time right right see before the seals was open he seen that and he he predicted it right actually later he calls it a prophecy and when he brought it he brought it in the form of a question right sir is this a time but later he called into prophecy for those who could catch it who had the answer they claim it was three stars back to this quote now in communion 62 uh remember they claim it was three stars came into the orbit when Jesus was born and this is five yeah right five is Grace the number of Grace Three is the number of perfection five is the number of Grace j s s g r a c e f a i t h and so forth number of Grace God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace amen It Won't Be The Obedience of the people exactly oh that's not to suggest you go out and disobey he's not saying that at all no and Isaiah said in the 40th chapter oh I was just reading that right praying and preparing here last week brother Dale for these Services right cry to my people and tell her her Warfare is accomplished her sins have been paid double for her she's pardoned that's what I Come To Tell You Folks it's finished it's finished it it you know the the actually the marriage license and the whole Plan of Redemption and the book The Abstract title lead is put back in your hand now and it's open to for you to see your name in it right it's finished see we just got to accept it and believe it amen Isaiah said to uh chapter 4 how to cry to Jerusalem that her Warfare was over yet she was guilty of ID idolatry but it was God's grace that was sending it right God sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not merits right right so it may mean something I predict that there will be a change I don't know what it will be but I believe it's fixing to happen we're on right on the eve of it now and if any man hungers let him come into me and thirst If any man thirsty let him come un to Christ he quenches The Thirst he is the satisfier of all our thirst and hunger now just in the next month then uh March of uh right of the same year 62 March the 19th third month 19 days now what happened end time seed sign now what happened we see a roar in the paper across the television across the Nations where five stars just fell into light he spoke of it before it happened and now right after it happens he reversed back to it five stars just fell into line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come in something happens on Earth what taken place five stars fell in what was it a introducing of what since then just look what taking place Germany almost washed off the map right some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every stressful things prophesied by them for the last days look what's taking place England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses in one day not seven houses not 700 7,000 houses in one day in England right am right right disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like the worst into the ocean what is it the beginning of Sorrows right that's Bible yeah Matthew 24 exactly what is the beginning right right he didn't say the tribulation is already here but I tell you what the atmosphere is being said the atmosphere is already being set did you know he also said the wrath of God is already in the land absolutely now it's still s with a little Mercy now but when the bride's taken brother I don't want to be here do you no sir it's listen it's going to get worse worse and worse and worse and worse what is it the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes is picked up everywhere why is it five stars just come into line Grace God's grace what happened an infant Church you listening y we're talking about bringing the word to maturity and bringing the bride to maturity an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her right she's taking form right of Bride for the bridegroom amen that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity coming into one on earth Among Us God's office becoming one office 2,000 years ago what happened now what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heavens Heaven is announcing her approach three stars announced his approach three becoming lined up they just saw one because he was in line with the earth now they just see one again when they really lined up but it's announcing her approach three for the bridegroom and five for the bride announcing her approach what is it it's the coming of the Lord right see the out Al and the Omega the bride and the bridegroom Christ the Creator the beginning of the creation creating himself a bride amen that's right amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir amen glory now what's happening um I I I might say this friends the church is coming forth God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated God said so he would have it that makes it right who's a member I don't know I'm trusting to be myself I'm trusting you are a member but he's going to have a body without spot and wrinkle and I believe that these latterday signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together like bouncy uh to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride it's God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so if God and His word coming again making himself manifested in a bride exact not will do like Eve did hi bre it to something else but the unadulterated word of God will be be born in into the church into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word amen I believe it's the announcement now right oh my Hallelujah isn't that wonderful to realize right amen skip on down here just a little bit now what is it now we see see that when Jesus rode into Jerusalem he was introducing himself as the king the Creator he didn't go out and steal a horse he didn't rent a horse and he wasn't no horse thief and he wasn't teaching his disciples to be a horse thief but he was obeying what the father showed him and he was presenting himself as the owner of the horse the cattle on a thousand hills belong to him all the donkeys belong to him and he just said go get him right he showing himself he's exercising his authority of as a king and he he gets his disciples and the Bible says see Zechariah 9:9 behold th King cometh riding on an ass The Cult of full of an ass and so forth and meek and lowely brother BR said tradition tells us it's a white donkey that he wrote on foreshadowing how he was going to come riding on a white charger in the end time amen amen oh my see Revelations see I ain't got no pet Doctrine or anything so don't don't anybody get scared but see it was foreshadowing something to us you understand what I'm saying foreshadowing something to us there amen and uh in that then see coming first as a lamb coming second as a lion is that right right EXA the second the first coming and the second coming first coming to be the sacrifice then coming see to be the judge the lion of the tribe of Judah bringing an indictment against the ungodly that reject the message of their day right exactly see they reject the blood right Mercy's extended y Mercy burn nothing left but judgment amen see right that's why he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion because the full word had been birthed into manifestation again and rejected once the seals was opened the full word right he's predicting it here and we see it coming see and um me just uh hit this a note here from the church age book said no for in every age the church has been governed by hierarchy a priesthood and Apostolic secession yeah closing the door of mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor Church fed on the husk of abuse yeah now then he goes on I'm skipping down a little bit here but um he shows how that every denomination has the same Spirit every denomination swears that it has the key to the government of Christ uh uh government of the church every denomination claims to open the door but that is not true it is Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endows them with their Ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her he guides her she is his sole property and he has no other one but her right amen if the denomination send you let him take care of you but if God sends you he'll provide for you he has no one but her God's whole purpose is the church he said in the message knoweth is not knoweth it not his whole purpose purpose now see this three-fold purpose of God revealed he preached the opening of the seals uh in March and then here he comes back in in in July the seventh month Christ the mystery it's just like a continuation of the seventh seal and he talks about that great secret amen it was once hid in the back part of God's mind he said but now in the heart of his believing children right down into the church oh made known see and he said uh it's in every type that's in the Bible what is it it's the coming of the Lord Glory see it's that great climax it's that thing that Jesus said no man knoweth y right save the father only not even the son at that time see right oh my now you all know the seventh seal uh any mystery has a element or any you know uh of uh mystery to it despite the Revelation thereof and so part of this uh seventh seal see the activity is taking place on Earth right that's why one of the reason why there's silence in heaven the activity is down here amen see now St John 3 here he is on Earth standing on the roof rooftop talking to to uh Nicodemus and said uh no man ascendeth up up into heaven save he who come down from heaven even the son of man who is now in heaven and here he is standing on Earth yeah brother BR said I put that riddle before my church yeah said showed that he was the omnipresent God Amen am that's right oh my amen how is he here then he's here in word form he's here in spirit form amen he was in body form then but today his body is the bride but we'll meet him in the body form in the air oh how wonderful see kind just changed back around a little bit today to hide yourself from the eyes of the wise and prent see morphia God masking himself in uh the second Eve way the prophet called us the second Eve the bride but this eve will not be deceived she will come to this maturity that she's ordained to come to oh my she'll stay with the word Now Eve see now just one word now I I had some other little quotes here but maybe the Lord uh is leading in another littleit different direction I'm just going to paraphrase some things here and then you search it out but in the message Harvest Time okay in the message Harvest Time brother Brenham said that you don't have to get this I'm just going to throw it back behind me here uh brother brandom said that man's Eternal destination is determined right there's where it's determined by one word right right am I have a little section of chain and I've got a weak Link in it you just cut it and then just have a link in the middle you know and then when you pull it it'll come apart and I'll being overseas and different places I'll use that chain and have my interpreter hold the other end of it I said now you brace yourself maybe sometimes the platform will be 3 4 foot high and I'll swing out over the platform holding that chain yeah I said now remember as the prophet said your soul is hanging over Hell by the chain of God's word and no chain is any stronger than its weakest link one word is all Eve missed right exactly amen what am I saying in order for you to come to full maturity you got to stay with the word and if you ever left the word you better come back to it is that right amen you got to Mary and Joseph did in order to bring that see he was just 12 years old he had some more maturing to do and they had a lot more maturing to do too we we heard Mary this morning said she had a lot more maturing to do is that right she had to she had to go to the cross with Jesus she had to go to Pentecost right amen with John right that Jesus put her under the headship of John then she had to go over to the church of Ephesus and help John get the word compiled oh my bringing that word SE to maturity but the emphasis on the word watering them camels you know it's going to carry her that's right oh my see are you still with [Music] me oh my what an hour to be living in amen see now I'm just going to refer to some of these things and you can search it maybe if nothing else I'll wh your appetite when I paraphrase something uh that means I'm not quoting it verbatim but you'll find the same truth you understand be saying the same thing maybe in a different way right okay but you go search it out now here Jesus coming in and uh uh he had the disciples get this little uh donkey that had never been rode on by man before right oh the bystanders might have said oh we're going to have Rodeo now we're going to see a rodeo yeah and but you know what they done they took the garments off the disciples Y and that anointing on them disciples was now on the donkey and the donkey becomes covered with God's dresswear brother brandham said God's dresswear is Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers exactly so God gets a straddle the Creator gets a straddle of his creation and he rides right into his creation right on the dresswear of the fold Ministry amen sure did sure brother BR said that's what's going on right now you know brother BR was part of the five-fold ministry oh yes he was oh he was more than that too but he was still part of it amen you're I'm right in here with you he said sure amen oh my now not to lower his elevation or anything you understand what I'm saying but see I'm identified right in there with you that's what's going on right now Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers amen sure so Christ now riding on this donkey what you're looking at here's a donkey just a donkey now what if that donkey you know what oh that donkey never been dressed like that before he was a donkey of the cloth now I'm talking about a man of the cloth and you know what you know who's riding on me my if that donkey had any Horse Sense he had donkey sense now he didn't have Horse Sense he he didn't try to elevate himself up to something higher horse a little bit higher than donkey he stayed humble donkey didn't have horse sits and he sure didn't have no human sense but if he had had natural human sense he thought oh my look at me you he'd throw them ears back you know and they're say hosanna in the highest hosanna in the highest they're talking about me and you know what they wouldn't even let that donkey's hoofs Hit the Dirt or the Cobblestone exactly they put the rest of the disciples garments up there for him to walk on right and then when he' walk on that section had run behind him and get put him in front again and Palm leaves was broke off for him to walk on boy don't you know he did I'm something else now i' I've been elevated yeah and all these glory and the highest and hosana he could have really if he had the human sense but no he just subjected himself right he didn't Buck he didn't snort right exactly he was bringing that word right wasn't he see he was bringing the word he was just you know try to get yourself out the way as he were the word right right see he wasn't exalted above measure right he stayed in his place abely amen amen but now the king riding in to his kingdom the Creator coming into his creation right amen what is the attraction that day in Jerusalem right oh who is this what's taking place brother BR say it's just a little bitty handful that recognized he was the Messiah right right rest of them was saying who is this what's going on just a little bit handful was saying hosana th son of David they recognize that history is being fulfilled Zechariah 9 and9 their King was coming right and all the rest of them just got infuriated and jealous is that right right and then the discip or the Pharisees and everything say tell them shut up don't you know that they're making too much noise here and they're calling you the king he said listen if I made them shut up the rocks and the mountains would start crying out why the rocks of the mountains would have to recognize their creator now we look at Joshua Joshua was a great man he had great faith and he made the sun stand still and the Moon Over the Valley agel but you know what blind barus off the beaten path brother B said Jesus did not hear the words of barus but he heard the noise barus did of Jesus and his disciples in the crowd coming yeah now it was a little different day not while he's on the donkey but Jesus one day was passing through there and z uh barus said who is that and they said why it's Jesus coming oh he begin to holler he's blind he's way off off the beaten path but he heard about it and he began to cry out in his heart and he began to cry out with his voice oh th son of David have mercy upon me oh th son of David have mercy upon me right nobody heard him Jesus somebody heard him but Jesus didn't brother man said but here they are all lot of noise way up on the road somewhere and all of a sudden Jesus Stood Still right everybody else is moving and but Jesus Stood Still amen only place in the Bible right Jesus Stood Still right exactly right now I want you to see something here Joshua stopped the creation by his faith right but barus by his faith stopped the Creator himself is that right am one stopped the Su in the other stop the here is the creator of the son himself and his faith stopped him and he got what he was wanting exactly is that right he got his healing got his Deliverance right oh my that was before the cross folks right if he could do that before the cross what can we do after the cross oh my before the atonement was even made what can we do with our little faith today amen see we need to see this word coming to full maturity that's right think about it what was the attraction down there in Jerusalem prophecy being fulfilled right and then brother Brandon preaching on this and he said what taking place what was the attraction on Mount Sunset right what was the attraction on Mount Sunset he said three years ago this was a prophecy but now it's history right right am hallelujah what happened on Mount Sunset right three years ago S as this the time he says that's what he's referring back to that message he preached serves is the time see that's where he proph predicted it prophesied it 3 years ago this was prophecy now it's history right what's history the prophecy has been fulfilled this day the scripture is fulfilled what was it Christ coming back into his church again hallelujah oh my yes coming back the full word birth in and manifestation right amen never a greater anointing he said all my Ministry than for the opening of this word the come on oh my right think about it something happened with God in Simplicity and humility opening those seals amen and they didn't even recognize what had happened right amen that's right think about it all my Ministry like uh Waters rivers of water singular Rivers plural different anointings one anointing for the healing of the sick first PLL second pull another anointing for the Discerning and the thoughts the in his heart great anointing but he said in all my Ministry I've never reached into a realm like this what's the third pull for the opening of the word the revealing of the word who is the word Christ is the word see oh bringing back the word see so you can have the word to overcome with letting that word bring you to maturity am amen see oh yes yes then he could say you know the bride has thus said the Lord that's right she has the word of the Lord she has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with that word amen amen see it takes the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word of Christ right now in that also he put it like this we have the answer to the devil's question now I don't want to sound like a show off up here but if the prophet said we have the answer to the devil's question I want to identify with that we I want to identify with that we so we might be a wee little bunch you know zachus was a we little man I still want to be identified with that little we right we see the bride she sh sh she has thus say the Lord and we have the answer to the devil's question and that's what the devil is howling about because his his tactics has been exposed and when the devil is exposed he's powerless talk about exposed those seals absolutely did you realize the first four seals was just exposing the devil in those the form of those first uh four horses and the Riders of the first four horses sure he just exposing what he had done and what he's going to do and so forth amen we see that's what the devil is howling about he said we have the answer to the devil's question and he goes on to say what is it in that sense it's the headship of the word back in the church once again am the headship of the word see back see this headship right see remember uh the cloud right see when those seven angels ascended it Formed that white wig right what was it showing the headship amen and in that same message Christ the mystery he said oh the headship and the body has become one unit right not did not will has right right amen that's right in other words Christ himself has come to take control see is it not written the government shall be upon her shoulders right his shoulders brother B said what is his shoulders it's the church on Earth God's Earthly strength the strongest part of the body on the earth is his church his shoulders amen and the government shall be upon his shoulders the church amen God's Earthly strength he has no no hands but yours right see no hands but mine and feet see oh my what is it again in morphia God hiding himself in a humble little group of people that Malachi for produced do you realize that we are the very manifestation of Malachi 4 the very fruit of the ministry of Malachi for we are his victory that's right oh oh this is the very proof that Malachi 4 didn't fall or fail right the word coming to maturity oh my I wish you all would preached me a little bit brother Dale said uh brother Wade said why don't you just turn loose tonight they sure make you feel free here and uh I I appreciate that but again I don't want to dump the whole Lo to one little sheep one time one [Music] second oh my is the Lord good to us word come to maturity God's not willing that You' be exalted above measure God's not willing see Power without character is what power without character that's what Lucifer has permitted to be exalted above measure and there and there's no Redemption for Angels no nowhere in the Bible you find any Redemption for Angels Fallen Angels No Redemption they can't sing Amazing Grace they don't do you realize you're made on a higher order than Angels what would God hear the quickest brother B ask the question uh uh Angels or a son of God with the word of God you said a son of course angels are only ministering Spirits sent forth to minister unto us who are heirs angels are not Hees come on we are the heirs that's right brother was singing this morning or last night maybe was I'm going to take a trip and a good old gospel if you're ashamed of me I'm still in eror see we need to recognize what we got who we are where we come from where we're going we got to be able to say just like Jesus did I come from God and I go back to God and we need to recognize that our origin is our destiny Y when you realize your roots where you come from you know where you're going oh my yes that's right oh my yes listen do you realize then as this Bride come to maturity and um then she recognizes that the abstract title deed has been placed back in her hands you know when he redeemed the book exactly he didn't redeem it for himself our kinsman redeemer redeemed it for his church right right amen and he didn't keep it for himself he handed it into the hands of his family he done it for his family put it in the hands and the five identifications of the third pull showed it was back in the hands of man again right just like it was 2,000 years ago nature was controlled the storm is that right the resurrection right all of these things was manifested showing the third pull is among us at the end of Christ the mystery said the end end of look at the clock 2:00 for those of you spiritual he said the end of the second poll well if that was the end of the second poll he said also the third PO is at hand seventh month of 65 uh 63 63 July 63 the third pull is at hand then later he showed how it was the third pole was identified Among Us and all these things see y amen now we just see a little bit of it you understand right as compared with what it will be amen when the squeeze begins to come I I don't know about you all but I seem like we're feeling a little bit of squeeze oh my but you know if the third pull is at hand it's still Among Us it's still here don't live at the Holy One of Israel amen that's right what is the third pull identify with the new ministry right which is Matthew or or Mark 1122 if you say under this mouth right amen well brother brandham spoke to a whole chain of mountains is that right and they're all going into the ocean be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it's got to happen folks it's got to happen it's going to happen thus sayth the Lord amen sure when I don't know but it's it's going to happen amen amen and uh whatever your Mountain might be if you'll just speak to it and believe a desire in your heart see when you pray believe it's already happening believe it's happening just soon as you pray your ass already happening that's right see perfect Faith the faith of God might just be one little grain of sand moving from that mountain don't you doubt don't you look at the circumstance perfect Faith looks at the promise never the circumstance that's right is that right that's right you'll have whatsoever thing you desire right amen all the Simplicity yes sir now what am I saying coming down to a close here tonight so be with me just a little bit longer give your undivided attention in my 20 years of uh talking with the angel of the Lord and uh the pillar fire uh that would have been 5 3 53 I believe 33 43 53 1953 in um Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever I believe it is but brother said in my 20 years of talking with the angel of the Lord yeah and and the and the pillar fire and so forth he said I've learned two things stands out he said that's faith and love Faith and love and when faith and love gets married you can ask what you will right right ain't that what we're looking at here right faith on the bottom love on the top when that becomes one unit amen ask what you will sir that's for every individual he ask what you will sure what's that with the third pull working SE sure heyen oh my marriage see but there has to be a marriage in the maturity see the maturity he wants me to come to maturity he wants you to become to when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man he wants us to put away childish things he wants us to put away these childish things you know amen why because that which is perfect is come that's right amen right it's a perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication isn't it wonderful to realize amen oh my brother my sister thank you Jes am in closing Jesus see was the Passover Lamb right and there they left him there the Overcomers the elected ones who had the responsibility of bringing the word of maturity left the word the Passover Lamb himself at the Feast of Passover where Jerusalem God's only provided place of worship in that day there they left him and only as they return to the word y amen but when we come back now every generation has opportunity for a fresh and new Revival and every fresh and true Rev Bible comes when men and women boys and girls have gotten back to the word of God their age if there's any portion I'm closeing my Bible if there's any portion of this word that you spurn or that you have left or you're not giv preeminence to right remember those that threefold purpose first to reveal your then to gain the preeminence and then to restore back one three-fold purpose and this is the great mystery yep that's it but we must let him have the preeminence it's got to be to the place like the little boy when he went into the blacksmith shop and his daddy had a an old cold horseshoe over there and he took the tongs and put it in the fire on those hot coals and you know that old black horseshoe turned white hot just like the coal all around it and the little boy said daddy where is the Horseshoe is the fire in the Horseshoe or is the Horseshoe in the fire and that's the way it's got to be with you and I we've got to be so in tune with God in such a Harmony and so fill of the spirit of God Amen to where he has the preeminence did you know one place here when brother BR was preaching on that he said the church has the preeminence right because he and the church is one oh oh my see it's okay for you to have the preeminence if you're surrendered to him and one man one woman one boy one girl one man fully surrendered into the hand of God is omnipotent right do you know what I was teaching that very same thing I said that to a an old veteran in Lithuania B news Lithuania one of the former Soviet Satellites and you know he he miss he he he couldn't believe it he couldn't accept that yeah I said do you know the prophet said that one man fully surrendered now fully surrendered don't forget that part one man fully surrendered in the hand of God is omnipotent right abolutely talk about full yes sir you know what that same man called me a communist he did hey D he call me a [Laughter] com I love him anyway I love you oh my glory that's true though man right do you believe that the we can be so mature in the word come on see sure we have to come on up come on up a little higher John come on up a little higher come on up a little higher come on up a little higher eat the book John eat the book amen not part of it all of it not the part you want you got to eat the whole book when you eat the whole book you got to eat everything between the cover and you got to eat the cover nobody has to cram it down your throat when you eat it it'll be bitter in your mouth sweet as honey in your mouth but bitter in your stomach when you go to live it right is that what he said right sure get out there and try to live oh sweet when in here you know oh yes yes amen amen amen but when you go obey it if there any now full obedience to every word spoken and written come on entitled you to the Token right amen did you know that I can stand right here and pronounce a blessing on you if you're a Believer right how many believe that amen yes sir well it's only for the Believers those of you that somewhat doubt it you might not get this blessing but I'm going to leave you with a blessing amen you might not uh think you got some of you might not well I I shouldn't say that I shouldn't even suggest that but see you might let me give you just a little bit more PL uh meat on your plate here yes sir listen to this verse three Revelation chapter 1 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy exactly and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen amen your Prophet my Prophet said that refers to whenever the Levites would read the scriptures everybody couldn't read you don't even have to be intelligent enough to read to get this blessing you hear me that's right I said you don't even have to know how to read this is for the most uh uh illiterate person can receive this blessing if you'll believe it amen and the Levites would stand and read and the blessing was there whether the whether they was reading it or hearing it read the the blessing was still there blessed is he that readeth and they that hear and let me tell you something this is the prophecy of this the words of the prophecy of the book do you believe that amen oh yes the the the spoken word amen is the prophecy of the written word we got to take it all together and when you get it all together it'll run from Genesis to Revelation not one quote and contradict the other not one scripture will contradict the other that's right oh my when you get to run into harmony like that yeah oh brother yes sir you're getting somewhere then you're getting somewhere getting tuned up then oh my brother my sister let's come to full maturity what you say if there's any portion of that word we've left let's come back to the word and God bless us right amen let's bow our heads maybe someone like to come to the piano and play it real softly or brother Maybe just strum the guitar a little bit and want you to just think about this now as we come to the last part of these Services don't want to take advantage of you in any way but I think the holy spirit is wooing us a holy spirit brooding over his bride like he did in the beginning he's planted a seed and he wants that seed not only to sprout but he's going to stay with it and woo till he sees that as the husbandman he's going to see that it comes to full maturity I want it to mature in my life don't you oh yes amen they just like to play Something Real softly let's just bow our heads down and let the Lord Jesus speak to our hearts you look inward amen say Lord uh is that word coming am I giving prance am I yielded am I under the Yoke am I under the headship of the word all you that labor and are heavy laden come unto me and I take my yoke what is it the headship of the word come and be in a a union with me take my yoke upon you learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and you shall find rest hallelujah oh rest little bride rest you shall find rest unto your souls oh my how me need a little more rest tonight Glory oh God bless you God bless you amen glory want you to be honest with the Lord [Music] tonight I believe it's important for you to respond to the word whether you just respond by the lifted hand or whatever you respond then that First Act will start something and then you can go out out and you can act on the word see it's not just hearing and believing it's acting on the word we must be doers and not hearers only if there's some portion of that word that you're not manifesting in your life it just shows a little lack of maturity but you believe you are an overcomer you've heard his word you are a Believer don't you let the devil tell you're not but you want to come back to that word let the Holy Spirit lead you back if he spoke to your heart I want you if there's any portion of that word now just one word one little thing maybe that you realize that you should be doing and you're not maybe neglect in some area lift your hand to the Lord Jesus right now lift your hand to him sure sure sure sure my all over the church sure oh God help me Father glory Lord Jesus look into the heart of your children now look at the sincerity of their hearts this is not a traditional thing Lord they are sincere and you look on the heart and you judge by the sincerity every of every individual heart yes Lord Lord Jesus forgive us of our neglect forgive us of our Disobedience forgive us for having left that responsibility of staying with the word oh as your servant and Prophet said Church lordy is wonderful your good living is wonderful but staying with the word is the main thing yes Lord oh God help us to come back thank you Lord to the word Lord let every word word be made manifest in our lives Grant it Lord is our prayer may this church Prosper greater Lord in the upcoming days than it ever has before and Lord may we remember that if we're not closer to God today than we ever have been before then we're backslid but the church could should constantly stay in Revival oh help us father sare us Lord keep us in Revival we want to stay in the life flow of the spirit we don't want to become old and doy and lay around and not do what we're

one more verse it just so sweet Isaiah 52 I believe it is an8 verse 7 says something about how beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of them carry the gospel but look at this verse eight oh look at this verse eight I got a new Bible somebody gave me and I had to get it brok in or break into it myself or something Isaiah Isaiah 52 you know Isaiah is a Bible in itself just by itself but 52 and8 y you all love this I know you've probably seen it before but just something stood out uh in this to me Isaiah 52 and eight here it is thy Watchman now he's talking about God's Watchman in the context not talking about the devil's sh Shepherd thy Watchman shall lift up the voice right with the voice together shall they sing right for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion right restoration any time you see the daughter Zion brother talk said it's talking about the bride right and bringing again Zion is the restoration of the Bride that's right and I could just preach another hour now real easy lift up the voice folks amen it's one thing to talk message something else to walk it and then you got to be in Harmony and in the lyrics to sing it right but we ought to be in such unity and such maturity and such Harmony where we can just sing it together sing in the voice right not just talking it not just walking it singing it talking see brother B said he's the great composer and we got to get in Rhythm get in Rhythm get in the harmony get in step is that right oh praise the Lord when the music beats low he said I'll go down with the music he prophesied his own death sure he did yeah he said when the music meets out the end of brother Ram's life here William bram's life I'll go down with the music but he said I'm an early riser I'm coming forth in the first resurrection it'll beat high again it'll beat high again if it beats out the life of old Gerald Hughes don't y'all get excited about that or or or uh brother uh Samuel Dale if it beats out the life of our precious brother who just sung for us here a while ago I'm 83 years old just go on down with the music just let it be don't worry about it ain't nothing out of order the composer knows what he's doing it's all right here in the book it's going to be high again the music is going to come to a higher note Hallelujah there's an occupier I'll come up brother with the music how about you you believe that why we got the seed planted already even death cannot control us why would you argue with an enemy that's been conquered and captured and and prisoned and harnessed and be foolish argue with something like that but you know death belongs to us it's been harnessed already brother R said God Christ at Calvary took the stinger out of death he harnessed him up Hooked him to a carriage makes him pull us across Jordan into the presence of God why would I Fe that it's already been abolished amen that's old timers that makes you throw your shoulders back a little bit oh my I see a few gray whiskers and and gray heads around here they say when you hit 40 you know you don't start you don't exactly lose your hair it just starts coming out your nose and ears and it makes you look pretty pretty crude and unusual but oh we don't have anything to worry about we haven't lost to one of them have we they're all right there waiting for us and God by his own faith has already seen you in a glorified body if you doubt your own faith that's okay but don't doubt God's faith he already said it he only gives one faith is that right oh those he has for new predestinated also and then he called him then he justified him and he hath already glorified it's a finished work in the mind of god let's just appropriate now step into it God rich ly bless you you all just have uh just made us

and speak lip to air with a pillow fire drop down lord may you speak from that fire you speak from the glory lord me may the angels descend back and forth lord bringing revelation bringing inspiration changing and transforming hearts and lives in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you everybody bibles i get into luke 8 reading from verse 11 to 15 and romans chapter 8 luke 8 and romans chapter 8 scripture reading tonight i know we took the scripture from matthew 13 and the camp but i want to take it from luke chapter 8. i'm doing that on purpose we read from verse 11 no the parable is this the seed is the word of god those that by the way side are they that hear then commit the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts at least they should believe and be saved they on the rock a day which when they hear receive word with joy these have no root which i believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among tones the day which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but on good ground are they which are in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it i bring it forth fruit with patience i want you to note the word patience did bringing forth fruit with patience we want to turn to romans chapter eight i want to read from verse 28 it reads and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are decalled according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren so that's what jesus supposed to be the first born among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called demi also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to charge of god's elect it is god justified who is he that condemned it is christ that dying he rather that is risen again who is deemed at the right hand of god who also make it intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword for it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter name in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord let's pray father are we thank you for your word tonight and we are so blessed lord to hear these powerful scriptures i pray father god that your presence will just have the preeminences and may your word come to light and life tonight in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated oh praise god blessed be the name of the lord praise god and uh i will take a little inspiration from uh equally as yes shriva swan to everything there's a season and time to every purpose on the heaven and i'll connect that to romans 8 28 and i'll have a title the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose amen who praise god so don't be too uh anxious you have to have patience that that seed going to come ripe and mature in the camp i wanted to emphasize 34 64 100 full to show that once the seed strike good growing it will bring forth it might bring to the measure of you know of a hundred percent but it's to be 30 it'll be sexy you'll get your measure you will get your harvest but tonight i want to kind of emphasize that patience because the bible talk about the husband man waited for the fruit of the earth and he had long patience you see when you plant something you can't be so excited to try to pull the fruit out of the tree the fruit have to unfold the life have to unfold and the fruit will come into course now if you don't plant you don't reap if you don't plant you have no house but if you plant you have to wait can somebody say amen you have to wait as we set the sow and forth to sow and as he keeps sowing the birds take some we say don't stop at the birds don't let the birds throw you off track that bird is just that's what they do they take some they cut all some fall among rocks not all will fall among the rocks just some will fall among rocks isn't that right some will get tied up with torns just some not all but some will fall on good ground so your duty is to keep on sowing keep on believing keep on planting keep on pressing all might not hold tonight but some going to hold some day someday something going to strike you something going to open up something gonna break up on you revelation gonna break up on you you don't know when tonight maybe your night tonight maybe a special night you could make this a special night if you declare it to be so you can have to speak at first like that man who was half blind and they wanted to know what room to take him in he said this room would be perfect they described they said oh you know he said i make it so praise god and you could make this night your night because you choose it to be so you declare it to be so that's what our father did he said let there be he didn't argue with the darkness he didn't say don't kill us and he said let there be and he just waited until it beat praise god he waited for the season on time because once god said let there be have a season in time for that seed to come to life but every seed must bring forth after its kind it's a law built in built in just like summer is built in an autumn is built in and winter is built in and spring is built in and nobody could stop the season and time because god said that in the heavens and man is on earth and they can't change what god set in the heavens and thy word of lord is settle forever in the heavens and once that word is settled man and it can't change it so once god predestinated you unto his purpose and as all things work together for good to them not love god to them who would be called according to his purpose and if you were called according to his purpose i don't care what road you have to pass you through i don't care what we have to pass you through you're gonna come true nothing's gonna separate you from the purpose that god elected you and predestinated you nothing will separate you from the love of god in christ jesus not tribulation not nakedness not poverty not depression not frustration not family issues not mind that not even sin praise god because he called and we call he justify what more shall we say the night of these things if god before us who can be against us it's time you recognize god is for you because somebody's saying can somebody give a shout out prayers you see all the holy spirit tied all together to everything there's a season and time to every purpose give god a shout out pray oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen it's a powerful thing to plant and watch the life unfold hallelujah so if god want to show down the devil's kingdom he just have to put in a seed a virgin shall conceive you didn't hear me tonight when he wanted to destroy and erect the devil's kingdom he had to put a seed so he said a virgin shall conceive and be a child his name shall be called wonderful counselor may be lasting father prince mighty god prince of peace what god did he put a seed into in mary's womb hallelujah hallelujah to bruise that devil hallelujah to knock that sip on his head isn't that right he put the seed among child christ jesus and when he warned the sinner a message in this day to bring a revival in this day all you have to do is to put the seed he said the bride had no revival is here it will take them seven thunders and he will send it he promised it he just had to book a seed or come on same as somebody and when god took the prophet off the devil thought it was cut off but he sent an apostle behind the prophet to keep putting on that speed some fell on i feel tonight that that spoken word which is the original seed has found some good wrong in trinidad oh hallelujah i believe tonight we are ready for the rain i believe tonight you are ready for your season and your time to manifest your purpose give the lord some praise as people you want to be seated hallelujah hallelujah so i trust that when you raise your hands up to god to worship you understand what you're doing when you raise up your hands to god to worship you are rarely watering your seed you have no excuse right now tonight you are breaking into revelation the same camel that rebecca water was the same camel that took her to isaac and the same word we are watering tonight it's the same power not going to take us to where we're supposed to go so you better start worshiping you better forget your problems and forget in your situation i'm trying to figure it out and we're going to praise god and join them in the revelation chapter 5 when they say worthy is the lamb for those redeemed us from now that night blood and we shall reign on the earth god don't care about your problems this morning he care about your praises because your praises will bring the water to water they see in you and that will solve your problem come on same as somebody stop studying the problem study the seed come on say him and somebody oh get the lord some glory hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah and as we grow in god and grow in grace it will become simpler and simpler not more complex it's become very simple but i'm saying this way from jesus to revelation could be described as wood made flesh full word made flesh god wants to get something done he have to put a seed he can't help it because his word is taught express his thinking have to be expressed by word and once his word is seed so but the branham preacher messages spoken word is original seed it have contrary seed have you seen how i'm calling america all i could do is eat it you can't sweat back because this man that man tamper with that and once a man tamper with that it corrupt i will say once you're born of a woman you're subjected to death you want to promise or anything else but death unless it comes to the rapture time when you're going to be changed in a moment and that's what we're all looking forward for and if it's not us it's somebody else but for the meantime we're under the law of debt isn't that right but we have life within us by the word now you can only overcome by the word you can't overcome my ethics by education by degrees you can only overcome by the word not by philosophy not by tv only overcome by the word so the devil his job is to keep you away from the word is not right but to be bright you have to accept the atonement in his fullness which is the fullness of the word and once you accept the fullness of the word it means that you are to be born his image you have to come into the fullness of his image which is his image and likeness he's not only predecimate to you but unto a purpose who he formerly called who he called it justified who justified he had already glorified isn't that right isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord watch he predestinated what to be conformed to the image of his son so in reality you are to be my you have to manifest the word image you have to come into the world image in other words you have to become the word to be bride hallelujah all else is just church members glory oh this is good this is very good all else is jewish members you understand abraham ishmael too not only isaac you understand that ishmael have a great generation nation and so all the arabs and all them all what is abraham c2 but you ishmael hallelujah is still fighting today isaac versus ishmael the battle is on so it will be bright versus church members so you can study the church members you have to want to be born into manifestation to be bright hello hallelujah hallelujah are you with me glory do you understand that the hundred and forty four thousands are elected seeds that are the generation coming from abraham that god recognized out of different tribes that's god seeing the generation after generation he know them by name he said ten thousand from this tribe ten thousand from that tribe ten thousand a hundred and forty four thousand by name oh hallelujah notice when people are called they are called by name who inform you he called he called you by name but not your literal name is the mystery of the book being unfolded to you that reveals your name to you and when you see your name your husband can't keep you your bride can't keep it children can't keep your mama brother you have nothing to do with them it's not a family business going running it's an individual affair i just love it i just love it hallelujah hallelujah somebody tell a family boo and they hold by all them revelation nice people echoing back the boo i see him back what somebody said who family talked to the same talk same here when when you go family wrong when one person wrong let's get a wrong message you will finally have a wrong message because there's no revelation there but when you understand that you as an individual have to get revelation and revelation is to rock that the ability to use upon then you can't bother what your brothers say what your mother say what your father say what your sister say what nobody say because you are individual and i have to have revelation and that's the fate that you have to approach god to get your breakthrough hallelujah too many people looking for uncle and tanty and somebody to do for them praise god look at the entitlement and all you haven't had to do is to work and every place you put your foot you're entitled to fight i like how god set it up and he put some giants in the land hallelujah goliath and his four brothers put them in the land put the sun's at top the mountain let keleb say i'll cut your head off i'm coming to get you know them fellas wasn't easy you know they hinted the things that were 14 inches praise god big fellas you know scary boy there were giants in those days genesis 12 genesis 6 giants in those days they were in those days they are wrong now physically they are wrong now spiritually intellectual giants they're real big you know real mash up with the knowledge they're real big you can't just go with your head to deal with them no they're bigger than you don't mess with them keep walking keep on walking you don't defeat them fellas messing with the head they're too big you are humble you'll be going to the children of israel come on now kill your lamb sacrifice let the blood splash all over you praise god you are nobody hallelujah your ordinary folk but that's the kind that god called hallelujah destitute and afflicted of whom the world is not worthy you may not have all the education but you have christ you have the word you have faith you believe you're holding on you have a prayer come on same and somebody you're a prayer you have a prayer you still have a prayer keep on praying hallelujah keep on praying maybe your face had a prayer kind of weak nobody embodied with that maybe some birds take that prayer maybe a second said a prayer maybe you'd fall on rock and here i feel like god not gonna answer you but keep on praying maybe a second to taste it a prayer it got all tied up but keep on praying when you hit that spot her angel is there to collect it i can see the angel descending with his file to collect your prayer take it up to the goal in order feel like preaching tonight oh hallelujah keep on praying praise god god want to screw up your prayer and at the appointed time your prayer i have heard the cries of my people i heard them crying i heard them saying i heard them on the expectation for a real manifestation the god of israel he's alive tonight you may be seated oh hallelujah hallelujah this message needs a good shot in the arm to shake people out to the intellectual condition they have sat down on their knowledge for too long so they don't even know what to do they don't even know how to command a real expectation i begin to worship and get an expectation atmosphere they come down looking for some priests they're looking for some man they'll give us somebody dude for them and yet the words say a man can't bring the revive but hallelujah praise god is back to the world it take the people to catch something that's why when you come you come to catch something you like come here just to come i understand how you don't understand the message you mean i play inspiration so deep no i'll check on us i want to preach in praise god what kind of foolishness is that homie they don't understand what i'm preaching homie you don't understand what i'm getting at i'm getting that to your purpose but you have a time and you can't vex with god and angry with god you have to be worshipping on the patience because impatience you come to perfection which is waiting on god and written for god that is why i read that scripture tonight we ain't talking about that 34 and 54 tonight we're talking about turning up a room until come on come on not when you want it until i let the bible surrender day of pentecost was fully come come on preach back to me somebody that they have to fully come it have to fully come when everyone came into the fullness of believing at the same time at the appointed time i will return unto thee why because for every purpose under heaven there is a time and a season oh same as somebody give the lord some praises you can't manufacture it you can make it happen before it's time caught up in a point of time to send this bombing trinidad come on same as somebody that comes in coming we're going to blow up the devil they're going to blow their walls and practitioners they're going to pull the ball with discord a lot of things about the breakfall are people not even expecting it will be the mighty hand of god hallelujah they're going to lose their flesh and blood flesh and blood hack not reveal this unto you hallelujah but my father had revealed this unto you you have to understand we were talking a couple of sundays or two months or so ago about the throne the gardens of the throne and they may wonder what an earthquake we're talking about the gases of the throne and talking about god will not let no scallywag just partake of that presence because he already demonstrated that in the garden of eden when adam fell he put the guardians to god the tree of life listen adam's condition he partake of it but abandoned call it in the season the unrighteous partaking of the holy ghost oh yes contrary life trying to access power see so god wouldn't allow that he has to make sure life is right it's not even gift because gift and calling is without repentance these brothers these apostles and people in the old new testament they had the virtues in them they had d7 rainbow inside the damn those sarahs was flying all back and forth around them the judgment throne was in peter's heart that's why when anas and sapphira taught his brother peter that they know all these years only to find out somebody else was sitting on that man's throne that throne went from heaven to christ and that children from christ into peter and nobody could see him touch him but angels brought back and forth where he walked angels walking you understand why the angels walk with these men you understand when they went to prison the angel was with them wherever they went the lord himself went with them wherever wherever wherever it doesn't matter if they go in the grocery it doesn't matter if they go in the supermarket wherever they go god is going with them you understand that we are going back to another book of acts you understand we are going back to the word made flesh living gospel hallelujah living gospel not talking gospel living living gospel living gospel what we mean just as thousands of live voices what we need in trinidad live voices where people talking message talking to understalking all kind of thing but where is the voice where is the lies hallelujah hallelujah people walking around with hate chains of hate chains of anger chains of gratitude not even seeing the lord they see in flesh and blood they're fighting with flesh and blood they want to confront flesh and blood they want to question flesh and blood they're not questioning god hallelujah look at joe when he begin to restrict strip strip and joe begin to question stuff i'm beginning to talk to god and god say answer me like a man where was thou when i read the foundation of the uh talk to me man hallelujah talk to me something am i where was that when i laid the foundation of the earth what are you talking about hallelujah i invite the devil to check you out because i know what's inside of you is greater than what the devil could put around you what the devil could send to you what's inside of you son is a seed of the original what inside of your son is the attribute of who i am hallelujah i never fail yet i never lost a battle yet come on say email somebody that's who you are son and you come from god you're going back to god the devil could hit your body but you gotta hit your soul because there's a gene inside of there there's a germ inside of there there's a seed inside of here and if god put inside of you what god bless no man can curse there's a blessing upon your seed i say tonight you only looking for rain the devil is a liar your flesh can be squealing calling second party that have nothing to do but that thundering seed that's in your soul and the seed of all the potential the seed of all the life the seed of all the ability the seed of all the fruit in it you may be seated we got some fruit trees and plant around the church and they start the flower already listen well guys but i've shown you i have life in mima like a flower here like a flower there the flower is a prophecy you know what the flower is saying fruit coming come on give the lord i shout you you should get that you should get that give the lord shouts of praise the flower is the spirit of prophecy the flower saying fruit coming now if you're playing a tree in the wrong season you see plenty green leaf you know i hear somebody plant the street you plan to see one of them trees in the wrong season they the only scene leave leave leave leave big big big and you see nothing why they have a seasonal time missing seeds and misty time and you put them in the wrong season at the wrong time only you spread them big looking like gulad family big and tall no fruit but when you're planted right my goodness it brings forth its leaves it's bring forth its fruit in the season and in time that's how god wants your life jesus was hungry one time he come out of a victory he could do some good ball fig cook fig it had no faith he cursed it it wasn't the seasonal things he was showing that when that power to curse the tree from the roots up then he went on in a deeper problem i love him i love him i love how he teaches i love how we unfold things he talked about in john 15. if you're bad in me and my words are bad in you you can ask what you will it shall be done unto you and every tree that brings forth fruit my father gonna prune to bring forth more fruit and if you don't bring forth he will cut you off and whatnot and if you bring forth fruit you want more fruit and then much fruit and hearing is my father glorified so he is that content for you to be like a tree no anybody could be a tree he want fruit and when he see you coming up with fruit he comes to prune you know you know what putin is right it's not a big cut in chairs don't cut me leave me to bear one fruit two fruit pruning is to get more buds out you have to get buds first your life has started bud your dry life is not a bird no fruit yet just blood but with grace but with mercy but with compassion hallelujah birds of loves have to just break out upon your life my god is that they get sweet now and yet thunder yeah come on now not even live voices yet they're just bothering something's had to break out if that big is at the breakout you can't explain it you're budding oh i believe some of you go but tonight then if you're a nightmare hallelujah we could shout sunday hallelujah i believe some of you could but tonight why because when aaron put that dry rod in the presence of jehovah in the presence of the shekinah glory when iran went back the next year that was an implanted rod that was all dead red but in the presence of shekinah glory that rug blossom that red body that red port fought fruit and i could say you could be born try like in the valley of dry bones tonight but if your rod could be placed in this kind of glory that god promised to be upon the pride cross darkness cover the people but your light gonna shine upon you your she kind of gonna come to you i said you are the word the glory is following the word come on give god some praises i will give you a dark time tonight and your work 24 hours and you know come here give god praises oh glory hallelujah hallelujah oh glory hallelujah hallelujah do you understand the spirit writes the word do you understand the spirit follows the blood do you understand the water is what the disciples was waiting on in the upper room do you understand the seed was already in them they didn't have more teachings to get jesus already unfold the old testament to them you already unlocked the understanding isn't that right so now all they want is word or is it all they want was water and i'm saying that the bride have to come to a spot where all they want is water now when you see the fruit come forth the fruit could only grow so much and no more the manga could only reach so much and i was after a while it had no more growth it don't grow after that is only ripening time i wonder if all the food value already in then is only ripening time then you need hot july sun yeah ready for rain yet if god said marine and you'll see that right your seagull rotten when your seed mature they come like the corn the corn is growing you have the husk isn't that right if the corn is young you pull it out you can't bury that you can't dry that the corn have to be mature i want it mature you know long time farmers they hung it up them young people wouldn't know about a tight up hung it up on a string and you dry everything dry you see dry corn a drying drying trying looking like a dead no you ain't going to make that boiled corn you will break your teeth you've got to get false seat after that so you're not touching that that is not for boiling that person bowling stage students you can't boil it so one time it's boiled corn next time is rose corn when it passed that stage is dry corn to plant hallelujah so you're gone drying up there and my goodness that is what you want you want to plant a holy corn this is what god did so you come to a spot where you have to get dry big oh something let me wipe it be cold everybody's bowling my brother want to see you sometimes your children have been killed sometimes your husband will be killed but the problem is the thing is god wants to break out sometimes the balls have been killed co-workers have been killed childs have been killed fire burn you could be killed all kinds of troubles they'll bake you out so you get out your human spirit you have to trust god my trust is in you why because you're trusting yourself all the time listen to this i'm professional perfect with this this is brother branham he's praying he said there may be some here this morning lord that has emptied themselves up okay let me back up a little bit he said now and there may be others out into the land where these tapes will go where little humble women and men will take them into their homes and into the tribes out in the other lands may they hear lord and understand empty themselves up so that the holy spirit can fill them and there may be some even here this morning lord that has emptied himself up since we started speaking and has listened and has realized that they have trusted too much in their own thoughts of their own ability trusting in the shootness of their own simple human mind which is nothing but filthiness before god oh god miller just empty themselves out now humbly submitting themselves and come for the filling of the spirit granted lord amen you see the thing about it a long life's journey along the way what had happened is that people leave the holy spirit and they begin to use the cunning of their own mind and that bring on spiritual man church politics so then people begin to be manipulative and controlling because they want influence but it ended up being man's influence and not god's influence so then what end up happening is that the influence of the holy spirit become placed upon man and then now that man become a pope eventually then all of god's presence that's supposed to be among the people end up upon iman that become antichrist spirit isn't that right but god is a god of the orient so he want to release his spirit among the people because he want to manifest himself as the god of his people now remember ministers supposed to be servants hallelujah not paramount people supposed to be servants be supposed to put on the apron and bring the victory to serve you it's not we are the important people you are we are the messengers to bring message to you hallelujah praise god maybe even get that anybody could be a minister with subject scriptures and read scripture but very few gonna be servants and god show me that since in cairo it take a certain quality to be a servant a servant comes to serve not to be served and jesus said the son of man come to serve not to be served and that's why in feet washing you have washed one on his feet to show that you're humbling one towards the other and jesus the one that washed your feet first and when peter declined he busted peter he said if you're david don't let me do this you know part of me praise god because his son might not come to be saved but to serve you understand that so you are very important to god why would a king die for you why would a king die for you and send messengers to give you love letters hallelujah every service is a love letter praise god every service is a word from god if you could stick me out of the way and recognize wait a minute what is that man saying to me no what is god saying to you god after you somebody he has to use a man hallelujah could i find a man that i can pull out of the way that i can influence my people then you are influenced by the word then you are influenced by god then you're no longer governed by human spirit that trap you into your own thing but you break out you break out where all things are possible when you begin to believe all things and and hope all things and hallelujah you're not trying to interpret somebody have a different motive and objective no you believe in all things and you're hoping all things and you're enjoying all things charity never fail it oh the devil don't want us to get organized i told you no oh yeah we could slam on another and talk we have forgiveness and probably kindness only just talk mo just yapping up and yapping we have to even go beyond that jesus blessed the carbon pharisees he said but you love your own he said them fellas all they love their own too so there is no big thing there is no big improvement then you love your own you and them love their own you love your family other people love their family too you think you love your family more than others love their family hey where are their family but that's not what you're talking about you talking about could you love your enemies could you do good to them that hate you could you extend yourself and stretch a lot of people don't want to stretch they want them come right in front of the face hallelujah when they want to go in the grocery they want to drive in front of the grocery they don't even want to pack the car don't walk a little bit again they want to drive inside the pharmacy that's how people are the ones that come right upon the lap and that's what i love god how god is he saw moses bringing him up to the land he saw joshua crossing them into the land hallelujah never nothing out to the elders never tell y'all there's anything you talk to just right there just right take these people over meditate on the word day and night because i want you to be successful there is no success if you're not in the world i want you to have good success god describe how we want it you know some people like to say well i try my best god and nothing try the best hallelujah that's why i said there's no excuse in this pulpit no excuse if the church feels i have failed i fail to leave you i feel to dictate or fail to share the vision that will bring you into the channel of your expectation for you to get where it's supposed to no excuses god spoke to joshua take these people over no excuse come on same as somebody at the end of time god don't want an excuse we have a short time to fulfill what we have to fulfill because there's a time and season for everything or what time is running out praise god you could lose money and get back money but if you lose time you can't get it back come on same as somebody praise god and the angel said time shall be no more so we have a limited amount of time to accomplish this purpose oh glory to god the prime minister of israel said iran iran raised god america all the sanctions and working are given iran some time to cut out the nuclear business we will not allow a nuclear iran no iran have a powerful history called as persia and if you read about persia they were powerful are powerful people they are aware of the history syria king of syria pharaoh syria he is a way of history also and everything just getting into place israel preparing for war you have to prepare you think for one minute we just going in the rapture you've got to be kidding me praise god you've got to be kidding me you just go on in the rapture what you think is for your cannibal or something you've got to understand they have to come to perfection that means you come into the fullness of patience waiting for your fruit you may be seasoned what was it problem she couldn't wait the word tell them we multiply and replenish but god didn't tell him how that was a further revelation to unfold to them the devil coming to show evil and it wasn't by god's divine plan sex wasn't original in other words the spoken word supposed to come to speak to eve to bring forth another seed another spoken word son the devil bring it at the flesh level oh hallelujah that wasn't even original hallelujah that was not the original so when jesus came he said you must be born again of the word and the spirit in other words you have to come back to spoken word so he hide the seed in the gospel and he said we preach the gospel is foolishness to them who perish but to us who believe it is life oh give the lord some praises my god terry but until i'm enjoying myself tonight do you understand the power of the word was put in the gospel and when the gospel is preached the devil get hurt because the son of man sowing the seed in your heart and every seed by the night's gonna bring forth after kind give the lord some praises when god wanted to you think god couldn't let fear get a heart attack and let them run over them egyptians and beat them up understand this there were millions there were thousands and thousands of they were multiplying like like the sun on the pharaoh but fear you had the whip fear had the power you think god couldn't utilize it but when he wants to deliver he's gonna put a seed you see you see god have to get the right one what if you are the right one tonight help me preach i want you to i want you to ride with me now what what if you are the one god waiting on all this time one moses bringing out two million people moses is the right one one abraham shall i hide from abraham what uh what i'm about to do seeing his ear of the earth you you you underestimate who you are you you don't know who you are yet but at that day you shall know you don't understand you just struggling in your mortality and your emotions and your sad face or your angry face or your surprise face or your joy face and you have all these faces you make all these different emotions and you're acting up and whatnot and that has nothing to do with the mystery below that let me just pick you know see the woman at the well now she was depressed it's not a nice thing to be living yeah kind of concerning life everybody know everybody's seeing you on your contrary and what is not a nice thing for any woman to go through that and so on she's in that mode that same emotion she's depressed jesus come and say woman water please he has no bucket he know you're not a bucket you can't go by no well but no bucket who says go by with that bucket you have to have a well you know what i said a pipe you open like that as well it's bucket is somebody to pull it up pull it down but jesus told his cypher and needs past troops samaria that sounds like he needs to find you so then then he began to talk to the woman he was sent there because her name was in the book and she didn't know so the mystery have to unfold to her which is living mystery not not paper mystery so what are some of your family and loved ones waiting for you to become a living mystery god don't ordain them to hear no paper ministry you have to be christ the mystery being revealed to them when them want to see god god say look me there in you come on you should be screaming and shouting what a privileged people we are to be chosen of god elected jacob had to become israel it was only 12 tribes of jacob come on now it wasn't the twelve tribes of jacob it was the twelfth tribe of israel but jacob at the turn right man doing contrary things hallelujah right woman doing contrary things but you have to have a turn there's a season time to get that turn maybe tonight is that night to get that turn hallelujah killing a life not supposed to be in your life but maybe tonight is that pen you have to believe it now you have to receive it you have to believe it now that tonight is a turning point in your life glory to god hallelujah a cut-off point god god told them the egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we got to believe in god give me season i think about the george and barter was telling me i think during the six day war i think it was that some some of the supernatural things happened on the battlefield and then my enemy dropped the tank and dropped the guns and run in general running they just run they seen supernatural things they drop things and run because god was with israel getting their people back to their homeland and so forth getting them back into possessed to overcome the syrians and overcome all them arabs and different kind of things like that could you imagine god say if you stay with my word i'll let your enemy free from you could you imagine you believers coming back to the point that you could expect god to run your enemies i'll be your enemy to your enemy i'll fight for you no weapon form against you will prosper you're not walking life here follow god this will happen forget about it if god before us come on now who can be against us hallelujah if god before you who can be against you you may be seated praise god when you start to connect to a reality of the omnipotence of god and feel into these brothers here it is it wasn't car time in that time it was donkey and camille so so moses and abraham cafes lord senate senator atc that can't be their prayer lord lord lord you can send a bends for me or a long maxi taxi to help next taught these people out the journey too long that prayer is not going to be answered god can say the maxi taxi there you know but that is not the edge according to my script quite down here so you have to ask good that your soul a way out that your shoe will help that your sandals are way out that's the prayer because that seasonal maxi season on a plane season that is shoes sanders donkey planting land songs tamarind you name it that's where we go here so if you want to church in this day see you yeah and whatnot and you're waving your palm and you're heading to egypt praise god you're going to the promised land amen now i know determining korea keeping you you know you are the ones that follow the nankura they just encourage the two by themselves just leave them alone forget this in angora you know what i'm saying then because i'm saying let's go back to egypt because they had position but you saying you're going to a place you never went before where god taken us we never went before this omnipotence this glory we talk about it we preach about it but we haven't tasted of it we know about the taste this thing this is a good land you know it's tilted plus we waiting to taste this thing you know we only hear prophecies about it but abraham had it he demonstrated it he had living gospel he said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on the angel of the lord he is here i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god and the angel is there to manifest the gospel oh hallelujah he prophesied that what you see temporarily will be manifested in his fullness hallelujah as we come down to this spot as we come into the headstone as we come into the caption anointing oh hallelujah super church a super race omnipotent speaking the miraculous taking place you know what's awakened us missing limbs being restored oh hallelujah could you imagine somebody with no foot and you said foot come forward no we don't caught somebody without eyes and you could say i comfort help me jesus you're gonna be seated what problem you have what problem you have the only problem is a lack of faith i trust that god help you and begin to trust god you pray for the pastor you pray for the minister and really begin to trust god look how god teaches prophets and so only bring ezekiel down to the valley of dry bones he said look at them bones and jesus looked as very dry there's one thing to have dry bones on the bone he said very dry it was really dry but then bro look like silver bones white bones dry bones he said can these bones live he's always trying to do teach him teach him don't doubt teach him don't watch the situation don't look to your eyes ask god to look through the eyes of god hallelujah people only seen flesh and blood this one do me and that one do me and this will hinder me and like that's what keeping you away your blessing that's foolishness that is you and your horrid spirit messed up chains around your life hallelujah you're not seeing god paul said i come among you in fear and trembling to see jesus christ and him crucified i reject this flesh i'm not foolishness hallelujah now i say somebody drop dead i walk over them i'll walk to the side of them you think i hold them and no look all look at one there's one backslide this one go on and see this one forget about it i have nothing to do with that all the father giving me will come all how quarterly for me to preach to you they will come that's all will always be nine cents and none of you praise god you choose this way it's the hard way it's the now stop complaining deal with it deal with it you say brother i don't like who you are that's not your problem that's not my problem of god's problem god met the man for the hour he met the man for the the hour hallelujah i am built to be here now i have built myself god built me and he put something in me to handle things are taken away to get a second result to have a certain effect we gonna have a revival i don't care what the devil say nothing gonna separate us from the love of god in christ jesus you wanna be seated watch watch how paul say it who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god not justified she did so and so that's his one so peter deny christ this one do this this one do that oh yeah but hear the scriptures it's not you that justify it it's not your thoughts that justified it is god that justified if you hear and read what uh jacob did you want to know how he called my principle he wasn't easy what noah did what david did what solomon did what all them did they were flesh and blessed they killed him but it is god the justifier i love it that's why i know god don't have to ask nobody permission to bless me god will have to ask about the permission shall i bless this brother shall i press this is your think no nobody are holding your ticking papers nobody don't let nobody correct your papers that's what they want to do they want to judge you they want to correct your papers don't let them correct your papers let god correct the papers because when they brought the woman to jesus he said listen we have plenty points against her she failed this exam she failed his moral life we caught an adultery look she a complete earth just say okay why only bring all the exam people let me test all you and see if i'll go past it bring me paper from the inside not the outside paper you're looking good on the outside but bring the inside paper let me check your paper then fellas say you know what i can't wait for this examiner i go on nobody will jesus correct the people nobody want to bring the inside paper which one of you without sin cast the full stone you see a car seagull but you could see somebody fail here and fall there they cast the hypocrisy you can't see somebody smiling for your face and stabbing on your back you can see somebody lying and twisting things you can't see that but unclean objective you can't see somebody cravage us uncomfortably arrogant excessive pride you can't see that but these are things in the spirit realm you can't see somebody filthy spirit but these are things in the spirit well so jesus and his spirit i'm seeing him hypocrisy the naked before him understand this in your clothes right now you anthony said something these adam and eve were so veiled with the holy ghost they didn't even know they were naked and they were but it was withheld from them because of the veil over them that same thing has come upon us we never had a veil before glory my god i'm in heavenly places tonight you know what is to be failed from your past and when you go in your pasture go back to eden oh jesus you know what it is to be chosen and to be seen as if you never did it you never sinned never failed god see you as if you never did it he sink it so low in a sea called the sea of forgetfulness he himself can't remember it he can't even bring it up you didn't hear me tonight this place should be exploding tonight when god dropped it in the sea of forgetfulness he himself can remember you ain't getting your mother i see or what like that some beats you know make your one find some bottle and pick it up you know that the sea of forgetfulness when it drop it drop so when jesus told that woman woman where are dying accusers she said none my lord he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more in other words woman you are free and who the son of man set free preach back to me let me let me wrap up here oh lord whoa i'm i'm gonna close this oh i'm trying to get you listen i'm not getting anywhere i want to read something that was to introduce what i want to preach tonight and service is over it's already done oh my my my my but god is good he wants you to understand the mystery is that you are the seed itself the pentecostal was shocked so therefore when fire and dynamics tried to penetrate all they could do is manifest tongues and so forth when you're dynamic strike you're the manifest seven living voices in other words you have to bring on the war that the devil started in heaven that fell on the earth in genesis you're taking on that empath in the last days when let's how close to this when the devil realizes the bride has escaped the bible said he will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that is church members who haven't come into a manifestation all they have is intellectual they haven't come into the oil you see so one part is the water spirit another part spirit oil wise virgin they have the same altars they have this sacrifice but no oil the strange thing about this oil and we're going to call this oil charity the oil of charity to get charity it needs faith and that faith is based on forgiveness so therefore to access the skylight you have to come true by the kindness watch not people barely kindness no spirit apparently kind of so god has to allow people to do you wrong that's the only way for that to come forward god has to let people push you around and if you fight it yeah i don't want to push me wrong but yeah i want people to i want to push wrong i want to see how much push you could take because only the person who got to push around god could use you saying some powerful things tonight yeah could god push you around or are you like a bulldozer i am moving well goku move around you because you were moving and god wanted to move you to do the job you see you see you see when david was on the backside and dealing with the beer and the lion that's david experience god wants to move him from the back side to the front side give it right now on the back of the book because send me back all the time you're that's why you take from the back and put it on the seventh fold on the in the seventh seal so you put the thumbnails on the back you put it in front but hide it from the devil so then move david now from the back and bring him to the front to save him his father said take them roti take them sandwiches and carry it for your brother save them if david had that attitude i asked you i ain't going to see them brothers now yesterday but i already always have that brethren brethren brothers whoever it is joseph brothers this brothers that brothers always somebody have somebody against somebody and they like somebody and they could see the war among them when david reaches their way wait we're doing here who's singing about the sheep they say a bunch of frightened men you got doulas i just had to read about these giants it was scary you know 14 inch finger you could imagine he's a big guy boy are you even letting it seem unreal no i'm killing it i'm telling you it's not a big hand man you know his hand matching his hygiene he's you see you know if we are giants you never shake your head like that it's just because we don't have any physical rim that you you know you're saying i don't know but you see a giant boy 12 feet high 14 feet high there's that quite a fella face right i'm saying yeah i mean when you think clarence told him what i'm gonna do so we say whoa look at about the prince and say but prince is a big man what we see two other princes he said whoa giants so david had to have a certain god consciousness know what something he have no support for his family his brothers finally should be home to begin with now if david allah had that atmosphere of roughing up the true holy spirit oh i feel good so david had to stay in the atmosphere that's a poor house that's a bomb tonight that's a bomb that's a that's an explosion stay in the atmosphere his brothers rough him up he's still in the atmosphere then goliath come and make his boats after you come in even service morning service by the way you have no even service sunday one service although i'll have his morning service 40 days that's like terrorism you know they're like al qaeda anything else they're like senator mother fight me more on evening and you hear him every day he's coming out and every day you're getting weaker because he's getting stronger because nobody coming out you see at least if they stand up somebody and make a little show and run back nobody running nobody here coming forward to run back like that kind of embarrassing you're going at all they say who is an uncircumcision he nailed him by the word he's uncircumcised what is he doing here he don't belong to us what is he doing here he nailed him that's a seed that's a seed he was saying the right thing uncircumcised for this time challenging not saul's army david i even see in this run you see when you're seeing soul army you see you know god how long do you need me again over 20 years okay right right i like you i

laughing look at them the boy they're arguing about code they're arguing about days they're comparing this the vex with this wonder word coughing one of the playing cards and all glass saying send me a man to fight me send me your man to fight me david said isn't there a cause a cause means there's a reason and purpose for being that's purpose a reason for being isn't there a cause i'll fight him so i'll get so excited he said listen the latest this one come fresh this comes this morning put it on they david put it on not you see he's a nice guy he's not disrespectful he's just a soul let me

they're not alive they're not alive no deceased and just as just being already sees that guy that's untold so he'll be just like them so saul had no choice but to allow this young man to demonstrate faith in god which is the original faith which is turtle which is what this is this is the original fit now so then go live now i like that i like that god blew goliath mine by selling odd being into

Joseph Coleman\nNovember 2, 2006\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\ngreetings to the New York PA church and to my internet friends uh I greet you from my home uh today Friday November 3rd 2006 and the purpose of this I'm making an audio tape and the purpose of this tape is to give you a testimony of my three phases hidden in the second coming of the Lord and revealed to me May 1974 uh I uh like to invite your attention to the scriptures could you please stand Amos 3 verse 3 6 7 and 8 and Revelation 19 uh verse 10 7 through1 Amos 3:3 can two walk together except they be agreed verse six verse six shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets his secret unto his servant servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who can but [Applause] prophesy Revelation uh 19:10 of verse seven rather let us be glad and rejoice and give on unto to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which you call unto the mar of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true saints of God and I fell at his feet to worship him he said and may see thou do it not uh I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy may the Lord had a blessing the reading of his word just a word of prayer Father in heaven we thank you Lord for this day to be able to have a little fellowship with with my church and our friends on the internet I pray Lord you would strengthen my body to give this testimony of my Ministry and may you bless the reading of the word bless it to the hearers ears and heart and strengthen me and anoint me to do what you told me to do receive of our thanks we pray and ask the blessing in Jesus name he say amen and amen you may be seated our brother Norman I'd like to title this uh the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now um there has been much confusion uh over concerning my Ministry since 1974 and especially this this past year 2006 I've heard many odd things about my Ministry the past 32 years I don't know what the confusion is or only anything I know it could be if I'm speaking by revelation people are in the humanistic realm then they're trying to reason out uh from the imagination memory affection conscious and reasoning uh from the five senses and I'm speaking from the six sense Faith so it's totally impossible ministers Brethren Church for you to understand what I'm talking about if you're not uh understanding it by the six sense and not your five senses so I just hope that uh helps you and to all the critics my critics that have had much to say I just in brotherly kindness want to uh say the things that the Lord put on my heart to say and concerning my Ministry and I trust and pray on this third phase that the Lord open the word to you and you'll understand what I've been doing and why I've been doing it so that's the so therefore I I would say discern my motive what am I trying to achieve so therefore my testimony should uh when I'm finish should really uh reveal to you and explain to you what I've been trying to achieve since November 10 1964 on Wednesday November 1st this year the Holy Spirit told me to give a testimony of of my three phases which you know it it as brotherly love the first phase holy decency the second phase plac in Christ the third phase uh this Prophecy from Malachi 4 uh came to pass uh June uh the the place in Christ actually the third phase uh June 7 27-30 2006 at Pin Harris then the young people's Retreat October 5th through the 8th it came to pass brother Brandon always said that there are three elements that make up the church and the Bible says so also water blood and spirit if you check closer you'll see that that uh types out to uh uh the word Seven Seals seven Thunder that's the water or what is the word and the blood which is the revelation of Malachi 4's message seven Thunder inspiration and the spirit itself uh which uh needs no explanation because the spirit is there and you feel it and you know it's there so Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets and Deuteronomy 29:29 declares the secret things belong unto the Lord our God God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law and you could see right here by by inspiration this is where acts 238 would come from and to uh repent every one of you for the promise is unto you and to your children you see so what it is church the prophet makes the word real which was secret things of God hidden in the word Mysteries he shows the people the hour we're living in because if they only see it in the hour past then there's no hope for the church one the church must see it in present tense two so God sends his Prophet to manifest the present tense of it then after is over and then is history so now we come to Amos 3:8 the Lord the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy in Revelation 19:10 the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of Prophecy so um this whole testimony of Jesus which came from Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 this is the testimony of Jesus Through Malachi 4 and number one it reveal every mystery hidden Mystery written mystery everyone two it introduce the Messiah son of man and three it restored back the faith which is Jesus Christ so therefore um then in doing this he made the word present tense and it and then the Lord took him home and left present tense shout of the King on the earth in the form of books and tapes and that's here now you're going to need a revelation because St Matthew 16 whom the men say I the son of Son of Man am Peter and then uh he said Thou Art the Christ he said flesh and blood has not revealed us to you but my father El him which in heaven so that's the only way you going to understand brother R's message that's the only way you going to understand me is to have a revelation so then we won't have all this confusion so according to Deuteronomy 29:29 those things which are revealed belong to us and our children why that we might come to perfection in this agean now and and make ourselves ready as the bride and then put on the wedding G commment which came from the Prophet come to Perfection we have a commission and not only St Mark 16 and St John 14:12 but we have to come to Perfection Hebrews 11:39 and 40 to bring up the dead we have to catch the headstone and only way you can do that is to uh is to have the ministry of Jesus Christ so therefore whoever follows the prophet the ministry you must uh let your church see it in the present tense and that can only come through prophecy so that's where my message my my Ministry is solely has been solely based on Prophecy since November 10th 1964 to make New York see it in the present tense of it and once you see it in the present tense other words hit that third phase SL third pull then it's over the first and second phase is over and then it's history so that's where we are now so um my testimony starts as follows June 14 I've been through it before I'll just go through it quickly as you know uh 1964 brother BR preached uh the unveiling of God and that night he preached on the Oddball I got I've given a testimony and I was out between two Park cars in a dark moment and the Lord sent the prophet over to me and as a matter of fact walked him over to me outside that night and he came over to me I was in my Dark Hour critics were criticizing and so forth he said brother Coleman I was looking for you and brother Hunt inside to call you out to identify with you he says then he said other things and he said three words to me the greatest three words you could hear God bless you on November 10th 1964 5 months later uh in New York here we had people com out of the Pentecostal church and coming into the message and I had just come out in ' 61 here and the ministry here was there was a lot of Pentecost mixed in the ministry cuz nobody knew what brother Brandon was doing 63 4 and 5 he was just bringing a word and there was no clear Revelation as to what what was what so that's when I was confused uh I mean not confused but perplexed trying to understand are we in Pentecost or are we the prophet or what is going on and on November 10th 1964 the Holy Spirit knowing what's in my heart he spoke to my heart and I heard four audible words Jacob Grace Joseph perfection then I knew that that the Malachi 4 was preaching Perfection because he said the Holy Spirit told me when I went up in prayer on 35th Street there to our little place he says when you go home hear the Masterpiece and check your Revelation with the Masterpiece and of course I did and of course you know what it was Abraham was uh faith and Isaac was love Jacob was Grace and Joseph was Perfection so there was no confusion friends between 1964 and uh December 26 1965 no confusion at all all what was needed was a revelation and subsequently there has been no confusion since December 26 1965 to this present day today dece uh no uh November 3rd of 2006 no confusion in my Ministry at all so anyway um so then I realized Joseph Perfection when I read the Masterpiece and I seen that the Fulfillment of my of my inspiration of Joseph Perfection would have to come to adoption and the pillow five would have to be Veil and I would would be wearing a seven color rainbow coat of Joseph and that would be adoption so then that's what I begin to strive for and forgetting about everything else I look forward to that seven color rainbow coat and of course the lord gave me the scripture Psalm 105 ver 19 concerning Joseph until his word came the word of the Lord tried him and then this Joseph Perfection bride until our word comes the seven color rainbow coat we will be trying by the word so then um so I must prophesy until I can wear Joseph's seven color rainbow coat which is the bride's wedding garment Revelation 19 7-8 so now prophesy I've been through it before but I'll do it for the tape why are we not a denomination jeffson bille Indiana 927 58 page 33 paragraph 168 now the Bible did say your sons and your daughters shall prophesy Joel 2 now what does the word prophecy mean look it up is to tell something on the inspiration or for tell something and to give you a sign of that all through my second phase I was foretelling about the third phase adoption Perfection Etc the Rapture the resurrection that's what I was prophesying on the second phase I was foretelling and meanwhile on inspiration I was telling my experiences going on during the 32 years of the second phase so it was two things going on I was telling inspiration after inspiration that would come to me and I was foretelling of the third phase place in Christ adoption time seven Living Voices and so on and adoption and coming to a perfect man and then on paragraph uh page 34 paragraph 178 he says now the word prophecy does not mean to teach the prophecy means to either tell an experience under inspiration and that's what I started doing since November 10th 1964 or foretell something is fixing to take place and that's what I did under the second phase no confusion nothing to make clear of this ministry all you need is a revelation it's got to say the same thing all the time or isn't the word of God your sons and daughters shall prophesy means that they should either foretell or testify now you look that up and you get the Bible dictionary and see if that isn't right your sons and daughters shall prophesy so of course I prophesied according to Joseph Perfection coming to Perfection plus the three phases uh which was brotherly love brotherly kindness holy decency prophecy rebuking Spirits place in Christ adoption and on page 13 brother Bram said page paragraph 58 same same tape same message now how many knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit here's a mind that has wisdom and brother ran speaking about gifts paragraph 59 pardon me now you stop find that all through these Church ages here pulling out the Holy Spirit speaking out how those gifts would be working in the last days now we got Gifts of healing working it's going good well brother there's other gifts that's just one of them that's just a little minor thing why here's a far greater gift right here which would be the best the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of God together and to show the Church where we are standing than to get than just get somebody healed and I believe that this ministry has done this has rightly divided the word and put the word of God together and on his third phase connecting to the third pole to show the church where we are standing right here on the third phase with the with the inspiration of the call to the Resurrection on the third phase that's very clear so that's what this gift has done for wisdom I'm not a prophet but it's it's a ninefold gift so now we understand that prophecy means to tell an experience under inspiration or foretell something that's fixing to take place and also to bring the word bring the message into present tense and many walk away when you do that because they're looking for for it then not understanding at you prophesying their promises to for nourishment it's for nourishment to keep you alive for 40 years look around the message and where there wasn't a present tense Revelation an echo well the people are dead so that's what this ministry was the second phase of it the ministry of the word but revealed by a gift of wisdom to rightly divide the word so August uh 11 through 17 1974 you know I've testified about being in St Thomas and had a mighty visitation it was there was a mighty visitation in the sky I've been through it the rainbows appeared on August 11th and appeared on August 13th and there is a witness of it brother Ronald Nanton from Trinidad he saw it on Tuesday the 13th and I saw it on both days and then when I saw it on the 13th a voice told me to go to the angel of Revelation 10 8-11 he told me to go and take the little book open in the Angel's hand and take it and eat it up and you know brother Ram taught you I think seal of God or uh mark of the beast uh he said uh the hand uh and and then the sealing the forehead and the hand is what you do with what you what you receive so go to the hand the little books in the hand and take it from the hand take it eat it up he said unto me thou must prophesy before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings now you don't have to go before Kings but you can stand in New York and prophesy from Malachi for's message concerning the Kings concerning many peoples concerning Nations and tongues and Kings you can prophesy by an echo what the prophet said said about the whole world system and every nation every King every everybody so that's what I've done for 30 32 years so then uh uh leading up to August 11 through 17 1974 the Holy Spirit spoke many things to me and I'd like to share a few of these Revelations or Inspirations as part of my testimony today on December 7th 1971 between 5 and 5:30 a.m. I was doing my devotion I was working in the post office and I in the morning I'd get up early and then before I had to go to work and I was reading perfect strength by Perfect weakness on 1961 Jeffersonville and while reading it a revelation came page 31 paragraph 210 that's what's the matter today God's got a lot of sheep that's gone astray the organizations and things has stole them out brought them out into psychology God give us Davids with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go meet these intellectual Giants right with all the pH lldd qus or whatever it might be give me the word of God in the power of the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can slay every Giant on the field right we need men that can do this and if you remember brother Brandon when he went out in 1946 he went out uh preaching on David to go out and that's how he went out and here's Revelation that's why he's using it here 1961 in paragraph 2113 and today we know we need a Revival we know we need a stirring amongst the people it'll not take a doct of divinity uh it take a a weakling it'll take uh the word of God and the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and slay this thing it'll bring Christ to the country let them see that he still can open the eyes of the blind heal the sick rais the dead he's God conqueror we need a David on train in the theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy something some little guy with his stoop shoulders not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power God and then uh reading this off of these two quotes excuse me uh 5 to 5:30 a.m. December 7th 1971 heads with the the Holy Spirit inspiration struck me and I called it the rock of Revelation and talking about David stones and I said Stones word of God with the power of the resurrection of God talking about David's five stones to direct a stone to the intellectual Giants The Rock confession Revelation revelation of Christ is directed to the intellectual giant Stone in the forehead so here right here shows you David uh with with with one of his five Stones the a rock Revelation confession the revelation of Jesus Christ is the six sense and it is directed to the intellectual Giants of the five senses and the stone goes to the forehead to conqu it out knock it out and that's what's been going on for 40 years in the message people with the five senses humanistic realm and and brother brandham said page 81 Christ The Mystery of God reveal there's Lucifer at work again limiting the word of God to their reasoning and he told us on page 44 and 45 Christ The Mystery of God revealed it is totally hid from the senses of uh of man you can never understand it 1 Corinthians 2 uh Bears this out verse 9-14 the natural man comprehend not the things of the spirit so friends it's impossible for these ministers to be in the inspiration last 32 years and try to figure out my Revelation then tell me I'm wrong it's impossible because I'm speaking with the six sense and they're trying to take five human senses and understand what I'm speaking by faith so it's totally impossible there's nothing to make clear it is clear as a bell yes sir so the rock confession Revelation revelation of Christ is directed to the intellectual Giant ston in the forehead and The Rock revelation will slay every one of them slay the church intellectual conception of the message now this is 1971 I don't know anything about anything yet I'm just in the message uh preaching from the shout message that's all and meanwhile I'm prophesying when will this come to pass I don't know but this is what he told me and I wrote it down but then uh June 20th 1973 on Mage title ask what you will uh on Wednesday night I Was preparing the people to pray for my for my wife's uh Blind Eye and inspiration fell and I began to prophesy on that particular tape and the prophecy inspiration came from what he had revealed to me uh 5:00 in the morning December 7 1971 one year and a half later here comes the revelation of what I was talking about about David this is how this is how my Ministry is so how can some man a minister being in here understand what I'm talking about unless he gets the same thing so he can't say that he going to make something clear is already clear so while preparing the people's hearts to pray with faith this is what happened here quote there's nothing not another place on the face of the Earth that this Revelation there was a church tied down and they are just that way tonight here's a trouble tonight and all over the world there's a five-fold Ministry yet now here's a here's a here's inspiration for a coming five-fold Ministry that was not around nowhere cuz first of all almost the entire message was against mines in the 60s and the 70s I can tell you that right now so there was no fivefold Ministry and a fire Ministry has got to be called by the Dynamics it's got to be Dynamics and mechanics together and we were only under the ministry of the word you could do a work for the Lord if you felt like teaching you teach or evangelize you evangelize you want to do some missionary work you went ahead and do it I mean could you go ahead and do it but that didn't mean that you was a five-fold minister yet cuz he hadn't even called them and then some say uh it's like watered down they say um I'm a fivefold minister according to Ephesians 4: 111-113 well that's fine but you got to add to that as interpreted by the prophet Malachi 47 sealed seven Thunder message in the adoption season now that's a little different now now you find out according to adoption time well now you got to be called aside called out and you got to be you have to go through a place of trying and you got to have Revelation come forth and the people going to try your inspiration and you got to go through a place of trying Behavior sanctification Etc and then when you proven to have these Seven Virtues in you that God can see faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and and and godliness and brotherly kindness then he calls you out and vindicates you visit you with an Angel positionally place you then you become a fivefold minister so all this going around I'm this I'm that no uh not according to the prophet not me but not according to the prophet his message there's not another place on the face of the Earth that this Revelation there was a church tied down and they are just that way tonight here a trouble tonight and all over the world there's a five for Minister yet four head David see is future David's Ministry is finally going to come on the scene that stone is being wound tonight Goliath where did that rock go at you know where it went it went straight to the forehead this is being spoken under inspiration what is that intellectual Powers David's Ministry is going to come on the scene and slay Goliath in the forehead seven Thunders uh when the revelation of Jesus Christ goes to Connecticut now here's the prophecy this is 1973 June 20th and speaking about Connecticut Indiana Tucson and Georgia in South America and all the different places it will slay Goliath and lay them out flat prophesying June 20th 1973 about future in 7 1975 to go out in 7 before this is Prophet this is is my Ministry to speak it and go let it go now watch in this here I never caught this until a few years later and conjunction you'll see the Sheep of God come screaming forth praise God when now just now just a manifestation here when the real David Jesus Christ veiled on the third phase adopted when the real David takes that stone of that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ when that David stands out there with that confession of what the seventh seal is and what the power of God is so he can prove it on the spot and smash it into Goliath's forehead and all the intellectual forces tense White Horse uh intellectual powers of the message will be scattered and the true message shall go forth prophesying about the Third phase direct and of course during the second phase uh all the seeds would be found by Revelation to sow them there will be one more run oh praise God I feel good tonight it's going to happen starting right here in New York tonight blessed be the name of the Lord and this is what came forth and this is what we've been under all these years so the inspiration fell and my wife's testimony in December 1972 uh her eye went completely blind her left eye and then [Music] um on the ministry of the Morning Star something else uh 73 oh yeah and the ministry of the Morning Star no that came after then um in May 73 uh I took her to a park avenue specialist he examined her and said of course uh for cosmetic purposes she could he could take the eye out and have a new eye a a plastic eye and he said but of course this is a Park Avenue specialist he said of course the Lord could work could perform a miracle for you so I was totally shocked to hear him say that so we grabbed that from the doctor when he said the Lord can work a miracle and we took it as as from God and this is May 73 and then I begin to prepare myself and the people for June 20th 1973 which I just told you about ask what you will for prayer and that's when the inspiration struck then on November 25th 1973 sister Coleman had her own dream and woke up and she had seen herself looking into the mirror in her dream and both eyes were totally healed now that particular morning uh I played I preached the ministry of the Morning Star November 25th and you have the book 1973 and then uh 19 in December 25th no December 10th 1973 uh I preached it again a little different the Mery of the Morning Star fars Hills and on you have the book and on page 36 and this is 1973 and I uh just finished praying for my wife in June and this is December and we had a visitation from ministers from Tucson South America India and different places then on then in June I'm speaking here June 14th he said come to the unveiling of the Mighty God identified to the shout praise God and just humbly and sweetly he went on and just brought the word out to my brother Brandon laid it out there now we have that word we have that sword what are we waiting for for it to be ident ify to the coming of the Lord and I see another phase in there the voice of the Resurrection now now there's somewhere we have got to ident to be identified in the voice I'm talking about the voice of the Archangel which is the voice of the Resurrection we can't move now until he does it 1973 and I'm looking for this voice of the Archangel now he will interpret it we can't do it we can talk about it and it makes me get real happy and thinking about it but it's got to be scripture and I see it's scripture I see it's in the word and I see this is me it's my time and my season I'm not Luther ad dip I'm not Wesley a dip I'm not the Pentecostal the baptism and his fullness in the soul with the gifts therefore you can't grow on that but I am with the Holy Ghost which is the faith then I receive the life which is the message and we have grown and now this is my own testimony and now I have grown out here and I can't go no further I I have turned from green to Golden Brown I am mature now I'm ready for the word this is my testimony not knowing that I had a faith was birth November 10th 64 virtue was birth sh of the king and in November 68th was uh uh uh knowledge and then over in Puerto Rico uh no Temperance was uh 1979 the dead was raised then come knowledge up in Elon in Puerto Rico and uh then the godliness brotherly kindness the church almost burnt down I didn't know this in 72 and now here I'm in 1973 saying I'm turn I have turned from green to Golden Brown I'm mature now I'm ready for the word this is December 73 not knowing I'm getting ready to go into 74 well I will get a final birth of Brotherly kindness and in June 1974 and then the Seven Virtues will have been birthed in me but I'm declaring it here on godliness so on the same meage you have the message page 42 we're saying there's a river closing out here's what I said November 17 1963 in the mark Auditorium in a meeting where the prophet of God stood out there and began to discern the thoughts of the heart and he spoke to a woman and he says do you believe do you believe me to be God's prophet he said wait a minute do you believe me to be God's Prophet according to Malachi 4 I've never said it in public that way God identified himself in New York City amen Malachi 4 was the shout and this is what I declare it here I believe with all my heart I'm speaking for New York City that God will identify himself as the voice in New York City also and when he does oh that river is going to flow so I'm prophesying don't even know it about the voice of the Archangel which will come down to me in Georgia 1974 June 29th so this is what happens you speak and you don't know so this is 1973 and then um just to tie together here on a message which you have come to me and drink June 20th 1981 on page 12 uh so when my wife had the dream with the ey being heal and I preached on the ministry of the Morning Star I always personally believe that her eye would be healed under the ministry of the Morning Star so on page 12 I have another tape 1015 minutes where the Holy Spirit placed my wife's eye healing under the ministry of the Morning Star but I had to walk out and speak it for 8 years knowing is going to come to pass I had to express it like Abraham and also Noah Etc knowing will come to pass God said so knowing that God said so so it's only been waiting for the second part which I already read it to you now of David's prophecy so I read it over to you again what is it intellectual Powers David's minist is finally going to come on the scene and slay Goliath in the forehead when the revelation of Jesus Christ goes to Connecticut Indiana Tucson Georgia and South America and all the different places it will slay Goliath and lay them out flat and they laid out flat right now all over the world it's laying out flat and after and about 3 years ago the holy spirit said that's an an or a conjunction and then he revealed it to me at a later time you will see the Sheep of God many of the sheep are still pinned down but and a conjunction at a later time he's going to slay Goliath he's going to call a special group out and they're going to believe the Thunders across the world and they're going to gather in pen Harris to bring down the power now I was always prophesying about pen Harris now the special group has been called out and they did the work preaching the word and preaching what they understand their measure of the Thunders and so forth and I'm speaking to you right now on the internet and it's right here I'm prophesying it right here that he's going to call a special group out and you right there on the internet and they're going to believe the Thunders across the world and they're going to gather in pin haris see my Ministry is to prophesy to bring down the power and then the rested the Sheep amen and you'll see the Sheep of God come screaming forth a time element when the real David talking about Jesus Christ Christ Veil on the third phase adoption first first take his David's plural the Shepherds this is going on for 32 years 40 years now and send them out for about 7 years with the Revelation in Fort Wayne and around the world and then in 1981 charity the real David when the real David takes that stone of that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ when that David stands out there with that confession what the seven seal is and what the power of God is so he can prove it on his spot and smash it into Goliath head Hallelujah and all intellectual forces tents white Hors they they're still flourishing tonight but the real David is here praise God see prophecy you see the sheep in the bride set free praise God so that's all part of my prophecy friends and um so we see the prophecy June 20th 73 and I have prophesied since 1973 that my that my wife's Blind Eye would be healed under the ministry of the Morning Star which is on the third phase and here we are now on the third phase still waiting for her eye to be healed under the ministry of the Morning Star so the morning the third phase place in Christ adoption time even the ministry of Jesus J Christ so in May 1974 the three phases the Lord revealed it to me that that by Audible Voice that these three phases are hidden in my second coming and they must come to pass first so then that's in May then June of course you know this story June 9th and 29th some have compassion June 15 1974 time is short uh Malachi 4 call the bride call and the call at a little later date to the resurrection then August 11 I just been through it through the 1774 down in St Thomas and September 8th through November 17th 1974 the seven Thunder Revelation and February 23rd 1975 for this saying so now I have a little testimony here for this saying here and it kind of ties in to Sister IET and sister Yolanda Lawson and the pray for sister Rebecca here on the 15th of October and what happened as you know I preached on the Thunders I went to St Martin and there St Martin the Holy Spirit blessed me and told me that the spirit of knowledge would come upon me as it was there with St Martin and then I came on back then I went out Faith to Faith and um I started February 2nd then went to Bowmont and down in Bowmont I preached four messages there and Sunday night I went in brother Jack Bell's office and there he was speaking in the Pulpit closing out he mentioned a s phenician woman and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and told me take this inspiration for this sin back to New York I have I have never said this before and then with that I knew the quote uh this quote here question and answer on the Holy Ghost 1959 uh Jesus said say to the mountain said when the power of this church brings the Brethren the power of that church and that church he said and then bring the Brethren then there'll be a general Resurrection I used that for years because I hard anybody believed in the message that there was be to be any power at all on until brother Brandon preached the rising of the Sun in 1965 excuse me so I came back to New York and he showed me the the in the morning they had the message and he showed me about the wine and the oil and uh new skins so then I begin to preach that and I and I have an excerpt from there so what I'm saying are for this saint this is where this is how it came to me and then on October 15th you know sister uh Evette and then sister Yolanda lost and the Lord spoke to her and told sister evet that um uh you said the right word like had he like like had he WR and then you remember me praying as I was praying I used the San woman and how brother brandom tied it in to had he right then uh if you if you see it again you'll see then on paragraph 21 Jesus said say to this mountain and you've heard about what's taking place that's the ministry we're entering into and right here on the tape I said the third pull we and an anointing Dro that's when the anointing fell when I said the third pull we weigh up the road now soon to come the Lord Jesus and we got to have rapt in faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go to go out or will not go and right here the Holy Spirit had me tie this the the uh the inspiration of the three phases from hidden in the second coming of the Lord I put it in right here as I was reading this so the Holy Spirit was tying in the three phases right into this quote and um but don't worry it'll be there and uh we got to have rapt in faith in a church that can be changed in a moment drinking over an eye or to go out or we not go but don't worry here's the promise it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring its Brethren and right here the holy spirit is anointing my words as I'm praying for sister Rebecca right here they bring his Brethren and that church of power that church will bring the other Brethren and then there will be a general resurrection and of course a Rapture and here the three phases hidden and the second coming of the Lord right there in the prayer with the sister event and sister Rebecca being prayed for it all tied together so now I want to say something this was a sign to me that virtue power for service is here on the third phase because when I brought it back to New York on February 23rd virtue powerful service fell and which I'll prove to you I have the tapes and everything so trust and pray you understand this uh I connected the second coming of the Lord three phases into the third poll so I feel that according to my prophecy of May 6 uh 1992 when I was speaking about the third pull the faith I said the third pull was here's original Faith the faith we had to content earnestly for the faith once delivered and restored back by Malachi 4 through our first phase second phase and now as we reach our third phase watch what's going on here today we actually connect with Malachi 4 third pole which is original Apostolic Faith the faith so as you come up out of that mess you've been in all these years can't understand can't understand nothing and get up on that third phase and all your question about who is Mich and who is this and who is that will be answered but you way out of season if I'm speaking Revelation and you trying to to understand it in humanistic realm you're way out of season if you're not called for it you shouldn't even do it should be satisfied to be nourished can't understand can't understand nothing till you get up on that third phase you connect with the third pull the opening of The Seven Seals it locks right in see it Nathaniel do you see it Church it locks in we actually connect with Malachi for's third pole which everybody don't know what it is and we connect with it we raise up on that third phase and connect with it and then of course I go on and and then I come on down and we connect with Malachi 4's third poll the opening of The Seven Seals as the true word of God the faith okay let's nail it down the faith restored back by Malachi 4 and repr preached in New York City since 1966 back there friends this has been 40 years there is no misunderstanding of what I'm preaching because it is a pure Echo that come down from heaven so there's no minister in this church or any church can come forward and say that uh maybe they want to correct what I'm saying you can't correct anything cuz there's nothing to correct and it's at this time that the seven Thunders from page 304 at this time when you connect you connect into Malachi for his third pool there's a promise laying there for you page 304 the fourth seal other seven Thunder voices to reveal the faith you see it now it will utter its voices to you be no more questioning and that day at that day you shall know and but now wait don't get all nervous frustrated sit down and wait and you know saying things and I don't understand this and who do you think he is and all kind of nonsense you see so I went to Europe uh at the end here my Father in Heaven has revealed this to you not flesh and blood so I can't reveal nothing to you so I can't sit down and have a dialogue with you and try to explain Faith try to explain Michael and all these things here I canot set it back here I cannot do that because uh brother brandham said on I read it to you one in a million he said you you you you have to accept Faith you accept it and in your response in his response and you accepting it he he he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I'm saying here I can't reveal nothing to you I'm free I cannot reveal anything to you no matter where I went you may be seated I went to Europe South Africa South America why did I go there to contend for the faith that's what I went four and seven Thunders gives Faith a Rapture in Grace and then it says it gives Faith well you accept it and you wait and you'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I trust and pray that this is cleared up to all this nonsense about they don't understand what I'm saying and so forth so um I feel that according to my prophecy of May 6 which I just read to you 19 um 92 as of pen Harris 2006 uh youth retreat 2006 and the prayer I just read to you October 15th 2006 and since the events of healing which is assigned to us the third phase slash third pole is connected together then this means to me that according to brother Lloyd Gonzalez's dream of 627 I have finished marking your Bibles New York and Pa and now it's time for Isaiah 4:5 the pillow of fire on the third phase as you remember the dream that uh brother Lloyd and brother arll went to this church and they had the new message and they asked for the pastor and the pastor came out with a big Bible brother brother V would read and the and the pastor would look he' open the Bible it was like a template he open the Bible to the number of the scripture that was called out of the pamphlet from the revealed word and the pastor would look in his Bible the spoken word and when he put the pamphlet down it was like a template it'll form tongues of fire like the pillow fire and he'll call another scripture out and he'll turn to another page in in the big Bible and there was some marks on it see and when he put the Pamper down on top of that page he'll form the diagram of a tongue of fire this is the dream so he kept on calling some scriptures out as he went through the message and putting it down on the Bible and every time he did then the pillar of fire showed up in a diagram like so finally the last one that he called out that I could really make out of the dream was Isaiah 4:5 and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion upon her assemblies a cloud Smoke by day shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory uh for upon all the glory shall be a defense and when he finished with that brother V looked at me kind of surprised he said how come he knows about this message already so I looked at brother V and I said this is Lloyd by the way I forgot to tell you brother colan came through here before and he marked that Bible for them friends I have marked your Bibles for 32 years and we're on the third phase now and we're ready for Isaiah 45 the Capstone of Love uh with the the pillow fire from Joseph Perfection which will produce a Joseph seven color rainbow coat the revelation of the dream showed the message in the Bible showed the revealed word by revelation of the son of man in the spoken word bible now on the third phase when the adopted son goes out it becomes the spoken word and the word and and the water and the word are together so I trust and pray that you understand that and uh the revelation of the dream show the revealed word by the revelation of the son of man in the spoken word now becomes the spoken word the word in the spirit to go forth together because the revealed word by Malachi 4 takes you back to the Bible the spoken word is the Original Seed so I'm doing this so you understand what my Ministry has been so I believe I believe that now on his stirred face the matured sons of God will begin to come forth for adoption there's my spirit flowing freely get another one over here and place him adoption placing manifesting and uh on um a message of perfect faith for perfect Rapture which I mentioned last Sunday over Leon FRS August 10th 1986 the Europe the European Brothers Brothers in Europe should have it it was in brother Freddy paru meeting and um anyway I want I want to read some quotes from there now to go back and to give you understanding of February 23rd um I want to read this here February 23rd uh there was a manifestation down in Georgia of course you know that then the seven Thunders then February 23rd now we're on the second phase and on February 23rd 1975 I just gave you the testimony concerning sister Evette and also praying for sister Rebecca Smith okay here's what happened and the Lord told me take this back for this saying from bont I preach the Thunders so following the preaching of the seven thunders in Bulman here comes the Holy Spirit as I walked out charity fell disguised as virtue powerful service to form the word image according to 2 Peter 1 4-8 and that's when my second phase Ministry began by a by a manifestation so did you get that February 23rd 1975 uh charity fell disguised as virtue powerful service to form the word image according to 2 Peter 1: 14-8 now that happened there and um I want to read to you and then in the very next week March 2nd 1975 charity fell as Charity now that's where many of the Brethren don't understand what I'm talking about and they get all mixed up so I'll read to you from a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture August 10th 1986 cuz uh charity disguised as virtue powerful service was with this ministry in New York City since February 23rd 1975 that's where all the revelations come from that's where the anointing come from came from virtue powerful service to form in my place of trying the word image According to second Peter 1 so have what I said on the tape now there's a hidden Mystery laying in the Holy Spirit itself not Luther Wesley Pentecostal now itself to perfect this last day Briant see now this the holy spirit is it's in two phases phase one is virtue and phase two is Charity but it's still the holy spirit it's still the Dynamics now virtue power is here in Phase One to form or hone the word in you into the character into the image of Jesus Christ that's the purpose for the power not to get all excited and try to run around and do this and do that no to form the power and perhaps uh that's why I couldn't go nowhere since 198 89 not to run around but form power to form the power get the character first and then the signs will follow it'll be just like that understand now watch here's here's what I had to go through for 32 years trying to preach with anointing and they don't understand it now when you go to say now I'm preaching promises foretelling charity is here foretelling the angels are here foretelling then the critics they here you say third phase foretelling on the second phase charity is here they question you I've been through 32 years of his friends but not your friends who believe Brotherly Love holy decency placed in Christ who received you years ago brother Hunt brother fiori brother bomo and the and and and Sylvia colon and and the different ones that was here with me and all those people that they don't question me cuz they've been with me for years and they say a amen didn't you see brother Hunt I think Wednesday night I was speaking there he said he jumped up and said amen to the word amen see uh these are your friends and who received you years ago they don't have no questions they know I'm preaching the truth they stay with you till the end if they have a question about what you're saying they come to your face say brother Coleman you know I'm your friend I don't understand this third phase I don't understand the headstone I don't understand what you mean about charity now your friend will come to your face and tell your soul to your face then they challenge you it's what I've been through for 32 years uh looking for charity part of it I just told you it's disguised as virtue February 23rd not not not charity charity that came on uh March 2nd but that is to come I'm going to read it to you if you say Charities here they say speak to the Rock and I was told this I was told in 86 to go to the zoo and speak to the Bulls and the bees speak the word to the B right here for the bees and the Bulls but they don't understand the holy spirit is he has virtue to form the word in you that time is coming brother it's coming when you'll speak to The Rock when you'll speak to the squirrels But first you come like Jesus your brethren they don't understand virtue dunamis is to form the word so virtue is a hidden Mystery of the holy spirit is here right now what is it is here as the seal an angel to give us virtue to form the word image in you and after the word image Christ characters form in you on the message of Grace crying Grace Grace To The Headstone He he'll come again and restore back and rebuild the church in the power of the spirit in The Virtue on the Holy Spirit which is here now to rebuild the church you see then the Holy Spirit and that's phase one and that's what I've been under for 32 years but it's still charity but it's disguise is virtue now we on the third phase what are we looking for now charity as Charity now comes go to the zoo to the bulls and bees if he sends you then the holy spirit in phase two seals up your Seven Virtues for service changes your ministry and adopts you and places and vindicates you with Saint Mark 5:30 virtue leaving your body St Luke 619 680 and 8:46 like it did the prophet through three pulls the ministry of Jesus Christ manifested God gave brother brandham the ministry of Jesus Christ in three PS to bring the headpone The Headstone and he went West he met The Headstone and seven angels and was picked up into the headstone and a voice spoke from them and said return back to Jeffersonville and open the Seven Seals he was adopted he already had the life because he had the ministry of Jesus Christ see now brother Brandon because Jesus was given the ministry of Jesus Christ himself St Luke 4 and he did that and he went for three years of hard trial trying trials for three and a half years there at least three years of hard ear trials and then he was taken up on a mountain and he was adopted but he but virtue came out of him the ministry of Jesus Christ in three polls he had it now brother brandom was given the ministry of Jesus Christ May 7th 1946 in three pulls and then he was adopt an angel came and seven angels came on the end and he was adopted so I hope you understand it but that's difference there's a difference between the prophet and the bride now here his the bride we don't get the ministry of Jesus Christ like that brother Ram was giving it but the Holy Spirit has to be here for us to be molded into this image and then we are given the Min of Jesus Christ to catch the headstone when we are adopted not before ministers so power without character is satanic so the Revelation laying up here is that on the third phase is that virtue is the outlet for the guide to begin the born again son spiritual experience and he will take you into a place of trying I've been telling you this for 30 some years trying tutor child train and the Holy Spirit himself is a tutor coming in as a guide with virtue and lead you all the way to charity and that would be charity as Charity the tremendous victory in love divine the Dynamics to our mechanics when charity is Charity but when charity is disguise as virtue is forming you into the word image and you pray for the sick and they get healed sometimes but when you are adopted you command the Devils to come out that's the difference so I've been trying to get this over to the church and the Holy Spirit him himself is a tutor coming as a guide with virtue and lead you all the way to charity the tremendous victory and the love divine the Dynamics to our mechanics Malachi for restored the prophetic Vision The Living Word in the bride to bring to pass the bride's Ministry in the love divine the bride's ministry will be an extension of the ministry of Jesus Christ the first Ministry was an extension was an extension an extension and the last Ministry would be an extension of the ministry of Jesus Christ as it was in the early bride and in Malachi 4 and so will it be in you so I hope that kind of gives you some understanding of uh the difference between the prophet and and giving the three pulls and then meeting seven angels and here we have to have virtue power come to us first then begin to give us the Holy Ghost and a refilling and then we got to add Seven Virtues and we got to be tested and and proven and when God can see the virtues being operated by the spirit which is on the third phase then he calls you out and then gives you something gives you a gift to shake the Nations so church I pray that you understand what I'm talking about amen so anyway to back this up on um the manifestation of the seven Liv voices uh um page 24 on page 24 you got your there I'll just quickly read it then the form me of the word image and there entered into the place of trying and you heard me keep telling you about part A I kept looking forward to it how could it be any worse than this December 31st 2003 he revealed to me I've already been in it for 20 years and then I was greatly relieved and then I didn't know that I had to go another year and of course another year which was up to 2005 and then it was 21 years and then when he told me he said now you're finished so go in there and bring this inspiration and I'm going to close off the second phase that's what I'm doing so when it begins to come forth you'll say Where's that guy doing all the hollering you know the second phase prophesying and so forth oh he gave that message for 21 years plus a couple of more or it to be so humble and simple if you don't have the token to examine it you won't know what it is I thought you were supposed to do this and that or that well they thought the same thing about brother brandom jeffson Ville and Tucson they thought the same thing and they didn't see what they thought was supposed to be uh supposed to see and meanwhile what they saw was what God Said So now you got it so it had to be birthed I explain that to you tested from 1975 to 1983 it was tested and then it come out of the Wilderness and then uh the breaking of the seventh seal uh July 1983 the seal broke under there and outpoured the Holy Spirit for birth in Fort Wayne and came back to New York and spread all the way over to South Africa and it finished up for a birth in 1984 I started into my harder trials so now you got it now so it had to be birthed tested and then had to be proven the last 21 plus years to be in there all and to to be in there I got to have these virtues in here proven by all kinds of tests trials everything else that's what I've been through especially this year you may be seated so there for three in one I had three uh now I had three birth tested proven now you're going to get three and one now you get three in one now I'm no more a signed because I've been through that and I thank God he told me he said you're just on the third phase and whoever comes to maturity first they will be adopted so we all at the starting point as of today and this is 2004 that's that's right so I'm just kind of talking to you by the wayside so we're all here together and I finished my signs he said you're on the third phase there's no part A no Part B third phase place in Christ adoption time go to the angel of the Lord I told you that that the um that the voice Angel was leaving Revelation 10 8-11 and he was coming over to Ephesians 4: 11-13 and that took six years from uh September 6 of 2000 all the way to June of 2006 took six years so go to the angel of the Lord because he wants to put a liquor fire in there you got it birth testing then proven that it's in there before he can come upon you he cannot unless you see in he see it in there and that's got to be through the place of trying and now that finishes off all these ministers talking about uh I'm a five-fold minister according to Ephesians 4:11 through 13 no you're not neither you be a five-fold minister according with the prophet said that's how you'll be now on page 31 uh here's a secret I just finished showing you I just finished showing you the secret the word is in the bride logos and the mind of Christ Elohim to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayeth the Lord that is the secret the logos and Elohim together by the grace of God by the revelation of seven Thunders the Holy Spirit got the logos the word into New York and Pa and all our friends on the internet and whoever else that's the secret and now Elohim is here the Locos is in you Elohim the seven spirits is here now you got it the word logos is in the bride and the mind of Elohim intelligence of Christ uh to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayth the Lord and I have something about intelligence now and ask what you will March 2nd 1975 I told you that the spirit of knowledge Came Upon Me in St Martin 19 in January 75 and on that tape that message page 22 I said these words let the mind that was in Christ being in you the intelligence that will come down at a little later date and I'm speaking about it right here on the third phase as the voice of the Archangel but is here now quickened as knowledge to New York City on St Martin and that's when it come and and was charity disguised as virtue and that's what happened the church so I couldn't have that then understand now why why I had to go why go to St John why go to St Thomas didn't go to St cro I thought I had to go to St Croy which would be the cross Ministry God sent St cro here this morning I know what it means Mrs Munos Jesus Christ brought you here this morning Mrs Muno you were down in St Croy I was wanting to go my wife will tell you I said I should go to St Croy that's the third step the cross Ministry that's the cross Ministry of Jesus Christ said no you go to St Martin get some knowledge first and I got it and it came and that was manifested during the 32 years then I'll send to rightly divide the word then I'll send St Croy in here our healer our Savor to prove to New York City I'm the same yesterday today and forever so there we are so there's your acts 5:12 through 16 heal and Peter Shadow St John 14:12 other words knowledge now will come over to intelligence because knowledge has found all the promises the quotes that that was my that's my ministry that's finished with now and and now Michael is here as the intelligence and I will just explain to you on time is short um heel and Peter Shadow St John 14:12 St Mark 16 Bride In Action as an adopted spoken word bride Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride said come Christ the voice of the Archangel veiled in her flesh 1 Thessalonians 4:16 three things shout appearing voice appearing Trump coming Christ Ministry Ephesians 4: 11-13 will bring the bride to Perfection a perfect man Elohim and seven spirits back into the bride will be the manifestation of the seven Living Voices a reflection of the seven spirits of Elohim as seven Living Voices and Omega bride the reflection will be the perfection even the ministry of the Morning Star which is given to the Overcomer on the third phase in their place of trying overcome then they adopted and position place so I hope it's clear to you church about this third phases whole thing here so anyway so the third phase is connected to the third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed third phase now in the third phase charity can now fall as Charity for adoption and on adoption book page [Applause] 89 you heard it before paragraph 159 is that right waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work here get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting take him out here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth now if he's just making some making up some old interpretation or something it won't work no no no that won't work so friends my revelation will not work on the third phase if it's not the truth if it's the truth well then it will work on the third phase so therefore nobody needs to come behind me and try to clear it up there is nothing to clear up it's been spoken as an echo so therefore and if it if it's not the echo then God will not adopt me and will not bless me in nothing but if I told the truth well then I I I'll get blessed take him out here and put a cemon on him and visit with an angel tell him something okay um because that won't work making up something we had a lot of that but I I mean manifestations plural of sons of God when God manifests himself and sends them out then he goes forth and what he says is truth what he does is the truth truth what he does he manifests Christ that's how in Ephesians 4:1 through uh 16 uh that the adopted son comes forth speaking the truth in love how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word now either I have rightly divided the word for the first and second phase all the way for 40 years since the Joseph Perfection or I have not rightly divide the word and if I have rightly divide the word there's no Minister there's nobody can come behind me and say that they want to make clear what I'm saying that's I mean that's Insanity because the word was rightly divided so how do you judge him uh what he says is truth what he does he manifests Christ by the way he stays with the word right with the word that's how you know all man is by the way stay with the word they speak not according to the word there's no life in them says the Bible so now we see the seventh Thunder inspiration is in two parts if by Revelation number one and then second phase and third phase manifestation and if I sold the right seeds by Revelation in the second phase well then there will be a manifestation of the seven Thunder Revival in New York city so praise God so there we are so now I would like to share with you the manifestations of the three phases as a sign and I'm going to uh I'm finishing up here and I'm going have a have another part of the tape where um I'm going to put on the following uh inspiration December 7 1971 June 20th 1973 that'll be the order June uh 29 1974 making Georgia February 23rd 197 5 March 2nd 1975 the young people in excerpt uh perhaps from 42702 in three phases and August 10th 1982 time is short which is the excerpt that I played last week so I'm going to bring it back and make one tape of it so today's words plus what I put together will be uh uh my testimony and and the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so friends I'm finished and uh a a young man over here in France brother elain I think I don't know him really but he's a precious brother and he's been uh faing me and he really has a revelation and he he he described my Ministry it totally was mindblowing so uh uh I'd like to uh read the inspiration of my I mentioned it before I'd like to read it to you what he sent me March 20th 2006 I'll take excerpts from there thank you brother Coleman to have kept for the last 40 years the true word seed pure and unadulterated thank you my brother you took the true revelation of the seven Thunders from the shout message of Malachi 4 and you open the Hidden Mysteries are already opened in the shout message but veil in the word see there the prophet opened the Mysteries he brought the Mysteries Revelation 10 3 and 4 and all I did was by Revelation go in there it's right on the tape Bowmont anointed and commission 1976 right there and I named all the Hidden Mysteries and which brother Braham had veil in the word and he this Brothers got in right here the hidden Mystery is already open it's open book and I went to the angel and 74 and asked for that book and I preached it back to you it was it was sweet in my mouth the revelation of it but very bitter to stand up here with a whole lot ABR menaces that don't don't understand nothing already opening the shouting message but veil in the word to give to the bride the possibility to manifest the Seven Virtues now that we can see the latter rain Fallen you preach the revelation of the son of man after the prophet left uh and this Revelation set the bride free because it's the truth and the truth uh set us free no more confusion when we hear the word be preached in its full light by a Ministry anointed and commission by the Holy Spirit himself thank you brother thank you cuz there is no confusion in what I preached amen never was any confusion so I don't these people saying confusion and this and that uh the prophet now here's what he said the Prophet Ministry made a way for your Apostolic Ministry and your Apostolic Ministry made a way for the five-fold ministry now on this third phase the five-fold ministry is going to make a way for the whole bride by a short quick message once more Lord once more send the Dynamics once more Lord Lord send your Holy Spirit once more Lord give us healings signs Miracles and wonders I know it's already started and I'm in the expectation for always more and more well thank you brother Elaine Beyond expectation like Simeon that's the way I was on September 18 1974 and Friday morning it thundered so stay under that and God will certainly bless you and I certainly appreciate your inspir ation has been a real blessing to me in all these times of doubt and all kind of things being spoken so I read his inspiration and God bless you brother Elaine so may the fivefold ministry come forth on this third phase I just read to you that there's no more a sign we're all on the third phase together so whoever can mature and come and let God prove that you got the virtues in you well then you will come come forth and he will send for you and visit you with an angel and there in your church wherever it's at you will they'll be able to say there's my spirit flowing freely so I thank God I'm free in New York now I rightly divided the word there's no confusion there's no nothing and I myself I'm waiting to be healed and adopted and that's in New York and Pa and anybody who wants to uh because be a part of the ministry through the inter that well you Well you certainly can be a because it can certainly be possible so uh so may the 5-f ministry come forth on his third phase and bring up the Hidden Mysteries to perfect the bride according to Ephesians 4 11-13 and bring the bride's Earthly gold unto a perfect man making the bride ready for Hebrews 1139 and 40 to bring up up the dead by catching the Capstone catching The Headstone so to all my special friends and England how I appreciate you there and France and Italy down in the boot and my special friends in Germany and Czech Republic my friend over there uh Henry John hus uh Andrews that's my friend over there and Poland brother VC and them over there in Romania and Chile and Argentina and Africa the Nigeria and all the different places in Ghana South Africa all India everywhere all of my friends that stood with me and you believe in these phases has been a real blessing to me and is what helped take me through these trials and tribulations and all the unbelief I had to endure so whoever felt that they to had to make clear the teachings of the pastor of the local church well I say to you why uh what do you have to make clear it's already made clear I gave my witness because my friends they know that it was an echo prophecy finding the quotes promises from Malachi for's message adoption three phases Perfection Etc a direct voice from God for 40 years and they they never my friends my special friends they know there was never any confusion in New York City concerning any Doctrine like man Angel there was no cloudiness between the man Angel and the Heavenly Angel my friends know that that's very very clear and there was no doubt about the who is the voice of the Archangel uh-uh and who is Michael uh-uh That Never Was and as far as I'm concerned never will be by God's grace so therefore I salute you my friends for staying with the true inspiration and his Apostolic Ministry following the prophet has rightly divided the word since 1966 for 40 years and now Michael will give his witness I gave mine and I'm finished now Michael will give his witness by veiling himself in the FF Ministry on the third phase and then he will come forth for deliverance may the Lord richly bless you and all is well so now there's another part to the tape that that you will hear God richly bless you remember he walks in on his promised word he's here today in the ppit he's also displayed over my head he's all in the congregation the basement all over he's between Leia and the cap one up there as the rainbow colors that's Joseph's coat dripping with blood seven blood seven Mercy seats seven eyes seven lamps seven angels Messengers oh my 777 what's he here for

preached for Faith to to pray for my wife her Blind Eye amen and when I was preaching this message and ask what you will a prophetic utterance broken on my message by the Holy Spirit I want to read it to you now remember now in uh December the 7th 19 71 I was in prayer getting ready to go to work about 5:00 in the morning and I was reading the perfect strength perfect weakness on page 31 reading about David and paragraph 210 that's what the holy that's what the matter today God got a lot of sheep that's gone astray the organization and things has stole them out brought them out into psychology God give us Davids with the word of God and the power of God to to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual GI sence think with all the pH lld DS qu SS and or whatever it might be give me the word of God in the power of the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can slay every Giant on the field this is when that first begin to come to me I wrote it down and on the other side and today we know we we need a Revival we know we need a stirring amongst the people it'll not take a doctor of divinity it'll take a weakling Hallelujah that'll take the word of got in the power of the resurrection of Christ ens slave this thing it'll bring Christ to the country did it amen Malachi 4 brought him down and The Heroes of Faith pressed away for 9 years and brought him right back

Lord you see is this simple and normal human being speaking through women speaking through why other words why was it in the Pentecostal days here and in the 30s and 40s and 50s here when a man or a woman even Hypocrites would stand up and speak out in tongu they know it's God and give interpretation they know it's God but they can't know it's God when you're preaching the word I don't understand

whatnot their interpretations man-made ideas when the real David takes a stone of that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ when that David stands out there with that confession of what the seven seal is when did that happen here is when God come down from heaven and thundered out the Revelation down in Georgia Holy Spirit play it back for you this morning every promise belongs to the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight for Jesus died for every blood redeemed promise and is for you the Bride of Jesus Christ we have a charge man to preach the word in season out of season oh what a charge to preach the word praise God I believe this is the season when the people will stop running from the word and they'll fall upon the sword and you put it in with love speak the truth in love not speak lovely the truth hallelujah just speak the truth in love amen praise the Lord you know the Ten Commandments the first four is our attitude toward God and the next six is our attitude toward our neighbor amen amen if you love your neighbor you will tell your neighbor about God first am and as a men if I love my neighbor that's you I'll tell you God don't want no Idols before him amen because I love you I speak the truth about him first but I speak it in love for you so you know that amen praise God so now we are exalting one another to good works and provoking unto love and I'm here to exort here praise God the people to enjoy their blood wash redeem rights unto love and unity of the faith but now watch here there are many weak ones and those who don't understand God's Will and so therefore there's a scripture here and some have compassion oh what a revelation Brothers there are weak ones there ignorant ones who don't don't have the same Revelation that you have and here is now we in the word now back to the word every word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded forth from the mouth of God therefore I'm not interested in what that brother believes as to believe in Malachi 4 that's the the beginning there do he believe that well it may be all uh this way and that way that's all right see uh Temperance amen long suffering long suffering stretch it way out amen praise God see and I'm persuaded God able to take care of his own now see therefore the I feel that there's coming forth a true Revelation on brotherly kindness that'll just sweep sweep Over Us and something will happen to us brother Brown said on the throne of mercy and judgment oh what jville Indiana needs tonight what the world needs tonight is thousands of lived voices did you hear what I said a lived voice then the voice of God come down through Malachi for as a shout and we were we just supposed to walk around Jericho as it was he and he said when I B you to shout shout May tonight we can begin to shout amen the Holy Spirit anoint our miles to shout the real message out not from interpretation but what he said shout it out but it takes a live voice first you must live the word first and and and and and and oh my and the devil's getting M and M as you am and when you hit that brotherly kindness oh brother I see him going out the door tonight he said don't let them add that please Philistines please demons don't let them add brotherly kinds for we are gone we are finished if they ever get the Revelation to forgive their brothers we are finished prise God so they they getting CL they're getting close they're laying worried worried worried wor they going to find the secret it's lay in forgiveness that's a condition that men's sins are forgiven on forgiveness of man praise God When you stand praying before you can receive the spoken word promises forgive you brother oh my if you don't forgive him if you have an A you got a griev if you right he did something to you you forgive him otherwise your heavenly father cannot forgive you in the bright age in the word age and the devil want to keep that away from you now so you won't let because nobody preach that now SC all around it but I feel maybe tonight the secet is out you talking about healings a faint bank will sweep all over this place here it'll blow off the camp up there amen praise God what a revelation and of some have compassion but you don't understand brother he did the terriblest thing to me talked about me in a dirty way told lies on me and of some have compassion understand I mean he uh did this he did that shi kicked dirt on David should I cut that dog's head off let him alone God has B him to do it amen amen what about David he had fall Des twice down there had his sword to worry upon him could have chopped him in pieace he was God's anointed but here was another man that was God's anointed also he didn't have the same Revelation therefore David had him brother what a Pentecostal beit is I got a witness to chop your head off devil come on David had compassion touch not God's anointed do his profit no harm praise God oh I feel good tonight amen praise the Lord wow I'm persuaded that God has sent forth that Revelation like a thunder there it was Thunder all down through brother then it'll take a live boy that's the Thunder that shakes the devil can you imagine brothers seven thunders in the bride living the word and long out your minds now praise the Lord amen it swept down I knew nothing about it I don't remember even saying those words didn't even hear the tape again like that until January I heard it going up to Canada and just heard it just to hear it but I never knew it and then he revealed it to me on September the 20th and said the seven THS of the seven voices of the seven Church agents still didn't hear it again yet until I getting ready to go to Bulman here to take when I heard he says now you shouldn't be afraid to go to Bulman you

[Music] [Music] [Music] amen may the lord bless you this evening and it's good to be in the house of the lord we're happy for the visitors amen and like we heard extremely happy to see my brother know david with his wife which is my baby sister and her daughter go baby yeah baby and we're just happy to have you here we have um we have a good group tonight but there's a lot of people missing and somewhere in the doctor somewhere going on a trip and others are on a trip and we'll just pray for each and every one of them also before we get into the message i'd like for us not to forget to pray that we're having a hard time getting the ticket to brother charles and boy in ghana africa and the reason for it all the lines are out of commission there in ghana and the whole country i that's what i hear and i don't know when they're gonna repair them or when they're gonna have them ready but as long as they don't have a mouth facts and whatever we're not gonna be able to to get the ticket to him but just pray that god's will will be done amen amen i have a little rebound brother roger here or anything so we want to open our bibles and i hope i pronounce this book right sometimes i have a hard time pronouncing some of these words but after the book of titus and simply going to read the first verse amen how many love the lord amen amen i'd like to touch a little bit tonight on paul a prisoner of christ and it reads this way exactly what i said paul a prisoner of jesus christ would you all read it with me paul a prisoner of jesus christ what what a thing to be a prisoner he's he's not a prisoner of just anybody but he's a prisoner of jesus christ let us pray our heavenly father we are indeed thankful this evening lord for the opportunity once more to be able to be assembled together we calling it a privilege we know the times will come when this privilege will be taken away from us but as long as we have this privilege it is an honor or to come together and worship you together may this be a revelation to your people that someday they'll look for fellowship and they won't be able to find it they'll look for somebody that just believes the word they they won't be able to find it all you can hear is somebody stepping by your side and shaking their feet stomping their feet a little bit you know that their believers holding on the battle is getting harder every day it's waxing hot hotter it seems like it's getting to degrees of when those hebrew children were in the fiery furnace it just keeps getting hotter and hotter the lord in in spite of all this we hang on because we have a promise and it's really not us holding on more but it's you holding on to us we pray heavenly father this evening that you will be with us and just let your spirit flow through each one of us lord and may we understand that we're not here in church just to pass a few hours and we're here because we're concerned we've been convinced now we're concerned about our welfare of the welfare of the people lord we're here to try lord with everything we have in our power lord to make it it takes you lord we understand that man can do it alone man is not able to do it it takes the holy spirit and i pray dear father that you will quicken this to us and be with us lord and help us father along the way heal the sick of the afflicted in jesus name and you may be seated as you're saying turn your bibles over to the third chapter of the book of the ephesians and it also speaks about paul being a prisoner and he says this in verse 1 for this cause i call the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles now in uh the have uh earphones been handed out to spanish yeah yes yes all right i want to make sure that everybody gets to eat but you know it's it's quite a word a pr a prisoner of christ now in some of the letters of paul it says paul an apostle of jesus christ in other letters it says paul a servant of jesus christ but when he writes this letter to filament he addresses it as paul a prisoner of christ and when he wrote this letter paul was in jail he was in jail and and he could well understand by his position what the word man that when he was surrounded by mars you know what how jail looks but he could only be free if someone made him free or let him free we have incidents in the bible where uh man of god and mostly all men of god have either served in jail at one time or the other john the baptist paul silas and peter and what have you and john take him to the isle of patmos and uh they were all there under in what we would call today federal prisons but here is a man put in jail because of what he believed and uh it go very well with a regular trend on what he delivered the regular trend there was the orthodox religion and it was the turning of the corner of the dispensation but it was very hard for them to see it and the high priest they they thought that this group of people called christians were a cult so paul being one of them was very a very persecuted man very persecuted by religion and federal government under roman rule we understand that but here we find paul in such a such a predicament in iran in a prison and he's saying a prisoner of christ now i don't believe and you know you know why i say that that i don't believe that paul was addressing this letter to philemon about his present condition his present condition was that he was in jail he wasn't referring to that but i believe he was referring to his being his spirit his will being a prisoner to the lord jesus christ and uh let me just before i get started how many of you would love like to be a prisoner of jesus christ don't be so hasty in raising your hands it's not easy to be a prisoner to be behind bars but like i said i don't i do not believe that here when he said a prisoner of jesus christ he is referring to his physical being but he is referring to his will first of all to get started we understand that as men and women we are under a free moral agency and it has to be that way for you to choose whether you want to serve or you don't want to serve whether you want to follow death or you want to follow life and it has to be upon the same basis that he placed adam and eve and if it isn't under those bases well then god isn't just but god being just he places you and i understand i want you to hold that word because later this passage of scripture might confuse you a little bit it confuses and dumbfounds theologians such as such as to femoral agency well in criminal agency you have a choice but we'll find out later what choice paul had when he became a prisoner amen and it gets quite tremendous when you when you read this now right and wrong is set before us just like i said adam and eve and the whole human race was under what we call the penalty of death we we were we were condemned to die we had no way out but god came down in the form of a man to take away that sting of death and place under free moral agency he placed on a free knowledge agency for you and i to make a decision now decision uh is decisions are hard to make we we we stand like in the valley of decisions and man we get up in the morning we have to decide whether we're going to put on our socks or we're not that's why you see a lot of people that don't wear socks they don't want to put them on hey you gotta you gotta decide whether you're gonna wash your face and comb your hairs while you find other people never comb their hair they decided to come their hair and you're gonna decide whether you're to eat breakfast or you're not then you've got every minute that passes by there are decisions to be made it's time for church we have to decide whether we want to go to church or we don't want to go to church right you have you have a right to choose yes you don't have to come to church people say you should be in church you don't have to go to church you're a female agent you can stay home and watch i love lucy but we choose to be here we we are i believe we're all here because we wanted to be here right well that's either a free moral agency and you choose to serve god you choose to serve god you you know the the church world knows no matter what church they go to the anyone that is called christian knows that jesus christ died on the cross is that right or is that wrong anyone that is called a christian knows that jesus christ died on the cross now they have to decide if they're going to follow him they have to decide what church they're going to go to they have to make a decision what they're going to believe amen and you have to decide it's a decision and nobody can make for you you got to make it by yourself you can bring your children to church but when they grow old or get older they'll go if they want to and usually they don't have a new birthday in the church they're going to go out into the world no matter how much you bring them to church they got to get that new birthday amen but we find out that each one of us must choose we must choose death or life do you know that life or and death in our lives our lives are just a shadow and you know what brings a shadow is a certain degree of darkness and a certain degree of light man that's what creates a shadow so we walk in the valley of the shadow of death but the real light we see what is called cosmo life this this cosmo we we have access to the cosmoline but but that there's another light which is god's life that is not that's not cosmo that's zoe and we've heard that over and over now when that light is present darkness cleans there's no there's no darkness that can stand there there's no darkness can stand there when it in cosmo you can bring a shadow it creates a shadow through different things and a certain degree of darkness with light creates the shadow but you can be soundlessly and you can wake up in the middle of the night and if you happen to see the light of god you see zoe it it has no boundaries as far as darkness it makes darkness go away and that's something great have you ever seen a light i have many people have some never seen life but i've seen i've seen a light and the greatest light i've seen is the light that has struck my heart now your life my life your life will prove what side you're on your proof outside you're on now reason i i make this statement is to maybe amplify a little bit on the condition of the apostle paul now paul [Music] as far as being a christian he was not a christian paul was a jew but hadn't come into christianity he hadn't seen this thing about christianity yet paul believed there was a god he he he served god his way [Music] you understand catch all this he served god his way he was a very trained man he was a scholar but the life that he had proved what side he was on paul had never come in contact with the light paul had gone to to school from the age of eight years old to the age of 35 he had studied under a great man like he manial [Music] he was a great man he was a god-fearing man but he hadn't seen the light he didn't know anything about jesus all he knew that there was a set called christians that followed a man that was here on earth called jesus that's all he knew so the light that is that he had showed what side he was on he was on the side of the manual and the sanhedrin that was paul on the road most of the new testament the letters but in in seeing this you think i'm stuttering but there's a reason for it reserving a little bit here but in studying this life of paul and how he was a prisoner is something to behold as christians we we sometimes judge our lives by how much power we seem to possess or by how many miracles can be done in our ministry [Music] or by how much knowledge we have of the word so you you find you find theologians throughout the country the bible bookstores are full of books on commentaries by different men in their viewpoint of how they think things should be run they have their school they have their thought they have their ideas they have their theology on how things should be run gives you their opinion on how things should be run paul was trained under that on how things should be run paul was a very ambitious man aside from being very smart and in intelligent person trained under gamil paul was a man that had ambitions and one of the ambitions that he had was to someday be a priest and someday maybe be the high priest that was his ambition so paul had favor with the sanhedrin he found favor with the clergy of his day but his life proved what side he was on and at that age when he had studied and he was under this clergy he was a very well trusted man that's the reason that they gave paul the power and documents to go to damascus and you read it in the bible how he went to damascus and he went to damascus he went because he was given authority to bind to bring back to jerusalem these little groups called christians bring them back so paul went to damascus and not only that but he was also given the authority to heal anyone that resisted him he had authority to kill so paul he thought he was doing god a service he was trained he believed in god he chose to follow god but there's one thing that paul had never encountered he had never encountered that purifier he knew nothing about christianity he knew about god as far as the hebrew law as far as the hebrew he said i am a hebrew of hebrews born of the tribal benjamin circumcised the eighth day he knew the law he was a zealous man but the time came when paul going and thinking he was doing kind of service he takes he gets on his on his horse and he goes with his man and he goes toward damascus but he's to his surprise that as he was nearing damascus finally not not a shadow not a cosmic light amen but a light from heaven a bitter fire persecuted by me and he said lord pour thou he said i am jesus my whom thou persecuted you know what jesus did to him you want to be a prisoner of jesus christ you know what jesus did to him he blinded him yes he put his eyes out yeah jesus we served put his eyes out and said paul we're solved he said you are to go to a street whole street i got a straight job you've got to let a prophet come and note your eyes paul when he was there how the holy spirit came upon in an eye of the prophet he came and anointed him and we find it as he had anointed paul that paul's paul's eyes were open to something that he had never seen before he knew about god to a degree to a certain degree you couldn't touch him concerning the law you you look at his books and read his books on to the romans the corinthians thessalonians hebrew and i said hebrew because there are some theologians don't think that he wrote the book of hebrews but i believe he wrote the secret hebrews and so on so how he wrote letters most of them dictated by a man well he would dictate they would write for him but he would write these letters and paul how he expounds her the the the hebrew law and he he says zealous concerning the law he said no one was more zealous than i was so paul was a tremendous tremendous man and i i find an interesting thing here that that uh and i could attribute to my life as far as religion we we're all born with religion one form or the other we all come from different backgrounds whether catholic presbyterian protestant whatever and we come and we we know what our fathers taught us we we love god because we we we've learned there is a god and we learn to love him to a certain degree but as far as really being apprehended a lot of people haven't been apprehended by this thing so they remain religious but paul was apprehended and when he his eyes were open i believe that that paul attended a lot of the services of a man called peter and he would sit there and hear him and he said this is tremendous the way he places this why gamaliel never placed it like this well there may not be nothing about this because this was the start of christianity yes and the other orthodox ways the religion didn't show this it pointed as a type to a deliverer but when the deliverer came israel never knew him israel never accepted him just a handful bible says about 120 but they began to grow they began to grow and that's what frightened the jewish people the sanhedrin the priests and everything that they had to put a stop to all of this but here we find paul he said this is tremendous until one day paul wouldn't take it no more and he says i've got to find out for myself all these things why why he intercepted why god did not permit me to fulfill my ambition you know what ambition is it means a desire to have honor or power or position such as in a career it's a desire that's from webster's and in this he went to the desert we believe he went to the desert of arabia man he studied for three and a half years and one day he said i come to the visions and the revelations of the lord jesus christ and how the lord comes to him in such a way that the ambition that was in him and let's face it we all have ambition to do things somebody had an ambition because there's people without ambition some people have demolished no objective in life why they're alive why they're here i'm a christian i'm i'm supposed to go to church and warm a bench all i know about god is more adventurous amen can say amen that's the truth no ambition but this man had a bishop that's why he went to damascus but when that light hit him it changed paul or saul which his name was given then from saul to paul and the lord says i'll show you how much you have to suffer you will suffer for my name it's easy i tell people it's easy to go to church i don't want to go to church it's easy to pick times it's easy to give your offering it's hard when [Music] you come across this line and something more is demanded of you you have you you hear young people especially especially well i'm going to go to school i'm going to be a teacher i'm going to be i'm going to be a musician i'm going to be a great salesman i'm going to be this or that well that's their ambition that's what their ambitions drive into and our ambitions i had ambitions there was things i wanted to do you know there are many many times to be a pastor is not easy there's many many times you you feel like going away from it you feel you feel like getting away from it all because it's hard very hard to minister and not just minister but mainly to be a pastor i've been a pastor almost 27 years and it ain't getting no easier but there's one thing experience and with the lord it helps us along the way to be able to cope with the situation so it's not easy so then would it be easy for for a man like me just to forget about it and go get my barber tunes working hours like you know and go home and take it easy it would be easy very easy people work eight hours and they go oh i'm so tired i'm trying to hit it for 24 see how tired you are for you can't sleep for the whole burn of the church and people is upon you and it gets hard but how can a man do that is the question how can a man do that except he be a prisoner amen and and here is where i begin to see this portion of scripture that i look at it and uh i see paul being a prisoner he's not talking about being in a in a little jail which he was but he's not speaking about that he was a prisoner to his will he had a will he had ambition he had in him something that he wanted to excel he wanted to be a priest and maybe a high priest when jesus comes across him you understand me jesus comes and the light comes yes ask you a question was he a free roll agent when jesus called in right wow think about it before you answer was he a free moral agent could he choose no god knew that he had already chosen to serve god and point number one man point number two is that god knew that paul even though he was intelligent didn't know how to serve god so god apprehended him he arrested him man that's why he says in the book of philippians for which i have been apprehended or arrested it wasn't free moral agency no more my my mind it was god showing mercy to a man called paul and in his mercy he places a yoke on him and fatters and he was chained where paul could not no more do his will but it was the will of god that he had to do god led paul he led him with a harness and folding so that he could go to the gentiles do you think that a jew would go to a gentile paul he didn't want to go to the gentiles he said i've never eaten anything that's that's that's uh filthy common nothing of this i'm never in these things but what did the lord tell you what god has cleaned let no man call unclean man jews didn't associate with gentiles they're called dogs and here peter had to be given a vision and then the same vision was given that was given to the the tenor it was the same thing that peter understood that god had opened the way for the gentiles but the gentiles still was left without knowledge of the lord jesus christ so god had to arrest every hand of them that loved god but didn't know how to serve him and let's get ahold of him because let me tell you one thing you think it's man seeking for god never does a man seek for god he's got seeking men adam adam where are they as far as choosing to go to church and serving god sure a man under that free moral agency does that but when you're apprehended by the lord jesus christ where you're taken from your comfort zone you have a comfort zone and you don't want to move from this comfort zone because it's easy to go with a trend and be in a comfort zone but when god ruffles those feathers of that nest makes you move and why do you do it because he's got chains on you chains of love you love him so much that you just want to keep on keeping on when things get higher in the church when things get unbearable in the church when you see man and woman pretending to be christians living the life they leave and whatever and it gets so hard sure you feel like running away but a true shepherd won't run the hiding will run but what makes you stand because you have so much knowledge no sir because you are a prisoner you are becoming prisoner of the lord jesus christ amen and he places a yoke upon you and he says my yoke is easy and my bird is light sometimes i wonder because the load sometimes it ain't light but i know the word is right so i have to go back and put this carnal man to the side and say it's not you son it's jesus notice another point there was [Music] paul persecuting jesus literally when i say literally i mean this was jesus christ in corporal form then who was all persecuted he was persecuting his church the body of believers and jesus said that's enough don't you touch them that's enough you're not supposed to persecute this people my name is in this you're persecuting me paul when you touch these people it is i it is i nobody else and when we see see that and we see the road and the troubles that we have on the road and everything else we know it's got to be jesus and how many of you would love to just have those chains of love placed upon your heart but here's what's going to happen here's what's going to happen you got to go or you don't want to go did you hear me you've got to go where you don't want to go you've got to do something but you don't want to do it you gotta say things sometimes that you don't want to say and when the people throw at you it's not you looking for that it's jesus it hasn't changed since the day it remains the same man amen what what a tremendous thing that that he just addresses this paul a prisoner of christ i am a prisoner a prisoner that is bound in chains of love he loved jesus so much when he got the revelation of what it was that his chains didn't mean nothing why did god change him what if god took his chains away from you don't you think that you would go back to your ambition fulfill your ambition right so it becomes not no more will the decisions come short just a little thought what would it be tremendous to know that he loves us how much do you love him how much do you find against him would you stand to your feet how much did we find all right how much do we do if he told you right now [Music] go to a certain place or i have a word for you to do would you go all [Music] people ask me at times why do you go to different places i have to why do you do this i have to do it do you have to do it yes i have to do it no you're a free moral agent brother oh no i used to be a formal agent i'm not no more informal agency my will is his will whatever he says there we do [Music] less than that and until we get to that place yes we have chosen to serve god god we love god but our knowledge and the revelation of jesus christ still hasn't come out all right we can do be like the rich young ruler know the commandments that's fine he said but one thing i liked [Music] pick up your cross [Music] he could do it he could do anything else sell the goods give it to the poor take out your cross follow me no sir his ambition was too great in his possessions [Music] let us not fall into that let us be willing to give god what is god and to serve him and he know that we love him choose to love him [Music] i want you to serve mexico [Music] because your ambition leads you do other things but if you haven't you say yes before you let me i will follow why because i am [Music] get up get away and get by just playing church coming to church and saying we love god by all people most old people love god but one day you say you said why do you say you love me but yet you don't do what i tell you to do how can you say that that you love me the lord is i look to the scriptures i find myself sometimes one people lay in the balance and i say lord it's not my will lord but let your will be done be lord in my heart not just a savior but lord come into my heart lord and lead me wherever you need there i will follow and as we grow more along the road knowing that you're always there with us a lot what a revelation that this my brother paul god has as he wrote to philip he said paul i paul a prisoner of jesus christ i am found by feathers of love i have a hardness upon me where he leads me towards the gentiles for long the jews refused to hear the gospel so i turned to the gentiles seeing that they find themselves not worthy to receive such greater message lord in this end time it has been no different we've seen the evening lights come seen a prophet visit our generation people say there ain't no more problems there ain't no more of this but as i look to your word you say people on the side keep on the world knows nothing about this they fight there's so much fighting on the world point of our church is falling apart there's one thing that remains your word shall never fail because in the beginning it was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and he dropped among us lord what a thing when you say the world see us be no more but you shall see me for i personal pronoun i will be with you even in you unto the end lord nurse nothing can take the place of your presence lord and when you come over our way and we see that lives shine about us more and the people look to that they say foolishness the world calls foolish and what the people call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers i thank you dear lord and i love you and i bless you bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless bless each one here tonight we are in your presence your presence ever with us lord what a thing that it to not our will and we can understand that become that prisoner fall in prison [Music] it was your good will and pleasure bless your children bless each heart lord as we surrender now to you lord we raise our hands to you more and we say come lord jesus yes so do come quickly father we just pray bless you and we honor you and we worship you thank you father for the revelation of the hour paul a prisoner of jesus christ to do the will god the father thank you lord be with us now as we raise our hands to you're worthy of all worship you are worthy to receive worship you are worthy to receive honor you're worthy to receive glory for the honor and the glory pertains to you you made us you've come our way you have informed us you have done this in your own place and i love you all because we're bound by these chains of love where we can no more say i'm afraid to know

your note this evening of jesus christ we are hoping that we can finish chapter four tonight is open your bibles vivid and i want to say hello to everybody that's online whatever you are god bless you via internet hebrews 4 verse 7. he again picks a certain day today saying through david after so long a time just as has been said before today if you hear his voice do not harm your heart hebrews 3 7. therefore justice the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harm your heart is when they provoke me provocation said today if you hear his voice do not harm so you might say why do they keep repeating the same scripture we read it three times here first god spoken this wise then he spoke of the law and the third time she says again he limited a day so something happened here i don't think they have the definition of limit limit because he said he limited a certain day limit means a border limit a point [Music] in other words something that is forbidden to go any further so the third time that he said he limited another day if you don't mind it doesn't i passed through something let me say something to relax you silly when i was stationed in alaska in fort wayne right on fort wayne in alaska in uh is in banks alaska and fairbanks alaska so we went on maneuvers we went for about 10 days the weather was between 40 and 50 below zero era after we were through with the maneuver exploracion they told us take down your arctic tent because they're sending the two and a half trucks ton trucks to to pick you up that's that's the army hurry up and wait so we stayed almost close to two hours waiting for the trucks right in the open and it was so cold oh i mean you would just walk back and forth waiting for the truck from a that here a key here i was a kiss about you you won't believe it in their instant instant my bodyguard warmed up i felt a worm coming [Music] what you did yesterday and one of them started talking bad about jesus but the other one we are paying for the sins that we did [Music] jesus didn't say tomorrow jesus today because you will be with me we're always looking back [Music] you might be killed by a heart attack or a car crash out there accidentally the automobile he lived [Music] he forbaded to go any further so today i already took the kid glass away from because paul was an authority of the law of the old testament i'm used to hearing my scripture here but something happened so there it is brother he doesn't have it here but it's up there okay thank you for he is our god and we are the people of his pastor and the shift of his hand today if you will hear his voice therefore the people did child with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them i child may we wherefore do you tempt the lord and the people thirsted therefore for water and later the people murmured against moses and said therefore is this that thou hast take us brought us out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall we do unto these people they all almost told me this and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with you the elders of israel and thy rod for with those motives of the river take it in thine hands behold i will stand before thee upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it and the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel yesterday and meribah because of the childing of the children of israel and because they attempted the lord saying the lord is among us or not foreign ocho for if jesus had given them rest then would he and not afterwards has spoken of another day report wait a minute here esperanza momento this is how my bible reads he didn't say jesus doesn't say jesus jesus joshua in spanish 22 4. and now the lord your god has given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return and get you into your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the serpent of the lord had gave you on the other side of jordan reporters to do the commandments and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to live with him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your souls [Music] even the sienna lost this video so then we read here in the first verse in joshua that we read so it was not judgement when it gave them the rest judge was said to the land that moses gave you and another thing the word joshua in in the hebrew means jesus jesus the dispensations change with jesus christ does this penis something that god did you see remember that god was the taking them to the land of promise but he let satan tempt you along we know that the what called the commandment said that and then they went to the pocket and got the law for that commandment even allah now he can say so then in terms of how did the temp the devil tell moses one of the commandments all shall have no other gods before them so then the weak point of moses and when he came down from the mountains go so did jesus have a weak point after he tested for 40 days you if you are the son of god make these stones turn to breath [Music] alone [Music] don't think just because i i i can teach that i know everything no principle i always wondered maybe that my channels are [Music] the same thing that happened in the book of isaiah i have been anointed to bring good news and to proclaim the acceptable day of the lord that was on verse 2 of chapter 61 is [Music] is so why did he it wasn't time to to preach about the fourth commandment he couldn't do it because he was going to be the rest in genesis the rest of israeli acceptance and kinesis there was no rest yes why did god rest rested on the seventh day of personal a commandment [Music] through when i need you hallelujah [Music] [Music] hebrews 4 verse 8 and 9. for if jesus had given them rest then would he afterwards have spoken up another day first night blessed anointing there remained there for a rest to the people of god if there was to be a sabbath if the seventh was to be a sandy keeping guard domingo he has spoken of come unto me all year that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me or i am making lonely hebrews 4 9 to 11. say he also has ceased from his own works as god did from here let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief sounds [Music] he entered somewhere elentro in algon lugar he said come unto me all year that labor bengal and our heavy laden i will give you rest that is concerned what is the rest it is the holy spirit is in the spirit that is [Music] and he for a certain amount of time so god gave israel the seventh day for their seventh yes in commemoration in commemoration of his own work the supreme and when he finished creating a conde el [Music] so they all could keep a certain day about this sabbath rest what good will he do if you enter into his rest he enters in but you don't remain when you [Music] and the world is more appealing than the word of god and like i've said before [Music] [Music] that's why we we see why god could not give to us any certain day to give it to us it's a sabbath rest is which we enjoy now listen here's the commandment if he no matter the age like that i don't care if you're 10 20 40 60 70 years old no matter the age no important like that physically physically said he [Music] genesis 6. 3. and the lord said my spirit can always strive with men for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually versus and he repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and he grabbed him in his heart is something for right right there in genesis 6 3. he was not resting physically anymore he says my spirit he said give me spirit we will not strive with the human race anymore he had no place to rest him that he had made man there was no place for him to rest genesis 1 1. enes uno uno in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth verse 2 and the earth was without form and void in darkness when upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water we heard our founding pastor picked wednesday on the light yes in the beginning the spirit of god moved upon the waters but in chapter six of genesis it was not the beginning it is the end of the beginning and the spirit of god moved upon the waters again upon the people [Music] principio genesis 8 6 and this is also says it came to pass at the end of 40 days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made sick and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters dried up from the earth used to be related to they're waiting for a car or somebody to kill a rabbit or get dead meat and they sit on the wire they sit on their smartphones and their tablets television blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness so when noah led the raven out of the earth well he got tired of the catholic church so he went to the lutheran church so then he saw another dead body he went into the methodist important to save the water heater baited from off the face of the ground [Music] found no rest for the soul of her food and she returned unto him into [Music] [Music] god took it out of your hands and gave it to the nazarenes what happened to you you once had the light um but god took it out of your hands and gave it to the pentecostals so god moved all [Music] and until he found some people that would follow him so what is the sabbath what is the rest he needed to rest physically saying mark chapter 1 verse 9 san marcos it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in the jordan versus and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my the power my beloved son in whom i am well pleased so that knew where to land he left him in the garden of gethsemane so where was he going to rest physically now hora dondiba repose let us go a little further isaiah 28 9. oh starting with verse 8 i'm sorry for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean so where was he gonna go if all these dead bodies denominations are full of vomit brother venom said this is that in the last days there would be a predicament so if spanish situation is a conditional situation one that is difficult unpleasant no placentero or embarrassing situation ii peter chapter two verse 21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment deliver them to them but it is happening unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the south that was washed to her wallowing in the mire no when you leave the word of god and go to the taste in all the kind of things in the world can be said on there so where did he find rest donda here is the rest of the apostle isaiah 28 starting with verse 10 isaiah's must be upon precept precept or order upon order line up online they're here a little and they're a little verse 11 lips and another tongue will he speak to these people that's verse 11 okay to whom he said this is the rest for which he may cause the worry to rest and this is the refreshing yet they will not here must not away when did the stammering uh lips come dead was on the day of peninsula that's when the rest came on the day of pentecost [Music] god received it from his work the second rest in secular israel received it in the law israel and the third dress is you have never entered into god's rest case the rest is only for the one that has ceased from their labors over us if you say you have the holy ghost they're still like things of the world you have never entered into the rest of you still haven't finished your worldly work that's when god rested on the seventh day person when he finished his work terminology revelation apocalypses and i heard a voice from heaven heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which died in the lord from henceforth yes the spirit that they may rest from their neighbors and their works to follow him so there is my wife isa caleb your mother calipso mama and our loved ones and all the saints santos will be resting together one of these days and i'll finish with this for tonight there is something there's another [Music] do you know that you're motivated by a spirit so the spirit that when all of you because it is [Music] you're here every [Music] an evangelist said once hell will be full of good people you and i'm giving it to you this evening so the spirit comes and touches and you think you're so holy [Music] the religious spirit brethren said is be careful that he does not fall so the spirit is the house oh he's all he likes what he sees because by nature and now you just made yourself a real target for the devil um foreign notice that when you go to a cemetery you it says r i p he said rest in peace this cancer in past days ever had prayers i cannot rest no playing reposse i'm speaking about this church and in my 50 years in missing puente anos said i've been in

serve under our pastor that is the condensation of god that's why we're where we are right now and if you don't have the rest it's because you don't want it here it bless is and every one of you here

sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things [Music] also acknowledge our brother rudy that was california happy to have you back and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor reign these years but according to my words and joseph i want to say that friday we have we had a very very nice service and uh brother tommy donaldson just hit a grand slam [Music] and before i say this i want to say that i want to thank brother charlie and brother jody charlie because very touching and the lord is he spoke to me yes they claim but they claim like a bunch of sissies they say well it's mine they they just stop there listen he said son when you claim something take a hold of it he said because you're you're not going to get it remember one thing i gave it to you and that's the reason that this morning my message is all things are mine [Music] i want all of you to repeat that all things all things my mind everybody attributes that to himself again all things are mine very sorrowful yes [Music] one thing i want you to notice in the in uh first kings that we were where we read elijah said there will be no rain except i call foreign and they say well this pertain to the apostles and the apostles oh everything a very part or bit a totality holy entirely now that should make you feel good you know it's trying to find that some people say wait you you can't do this in the church your ministers can't do certain things well it's like the husband telling the wife you can do certain things but you can't do other things it is true remember when we praise certain [Applause] i i signed the name ray matthews he said but that's not right he said it's ray matthew naomi and philly [Music] [Music] he's [Music] pages well that's enough and maybe you would like to read when you're at home but i'm starting from page 89 because because and it says here this is but it's spelled this way gold and and he says here this yaki they all must be able to do it um that someone that [Applause] his name is the lord jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] okay [Applause] [Applause] [Music] he hasn't [Music] you let the devil tell you that it's not yours [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] hold works now in the book of philippians if you would like to turn with me equivalent a little little philly pencil and it's a very familiar scripture in chapter two we defend this capital let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now if you say well that's the mind of jesus christ well this mind of jesus christ has to be in you it has to be in you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] certain things [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything that he has now here's a very tremendous part here in page 86 it says this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in the hands of god enough in other words he's waiting it's in his hands [Music] [Applause] from his hands [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] waiting [Music] pretty long i ever thought because i had not heard from my friend i was nervous but as i began to think about him because i was talking to brother chris and his wife and brother tommy his wife and my family yeah as i was sleeping the phone rang so no [Applause] and truthfully speaking i feel as bad as for two weeks like if my wife hadn't talked to me such was the love that was between david and johnson more than the love of a man for a woman and why is that love because of [Music] sometimes you don't know from one day to another who will be standing or who will fall [Music] and it's very tremendous thing that prophet said we live in the golden age a lot of times in in our midst we find we find people there and ministers that still preach the dark ages which is there are times in me like for example friday night [Applause] you know i i sympathize with people where they have no patience [Applause] we see people sincere people that are trying to serve god i'm [Applause] [Music] garbage is because when you say something that is i've made many many many many many mistakes in my walk with [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and probably many will not receive that statement [Music] so then we don't live in dark ages we live in the most glorious age of possession we live in a time when god has opened [Music] amen rejoice but let me insert a little thing here what was the name of that fellow from waco texas david corsin [Music] i am not defending david [Music] the ones that came against the jews [Music] was the government wherein wasn't it the german army the german government [Applause] now what was david koresh doing different than a lot of people loose why did they pick on david corres [Music] that even the government went and had to literally destroy him with the woman and the children in that place why don't you say yesterday [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] stop and think [Music] you what are [Music] [Applause] they don't speak to the original [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and clinton will give you what we find when you call the rebels but you go through the jungle oh no and they ask you what are you doing here it is too you you tell a [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] thank [Applause] that people mistooking for the lord jesus christ they weren't far from it the mind of christians [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] can you imagine god watch the people in this message the majority and in their condition the price is going to bring hold up outside the price going to bring what the variation of tight faces watch yeah we'll find in a minute where he's at it's a mystery that's in the seven-seal book when we stayed up in the little little stadium he's waiting in the hands of the original owners abraham had a right to the promise [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] but people say well it's mine then he says yet even though it's yours you have to fight for it okay well if god gave it to me why do i have to fight for it because satan is a squad [Music] [Applause] but i don't have it [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] then [Music] they're claiming that that man belongs to them why do they put slogans out that says the united states tries to play the friend and the policemen all over the world and the africans say it's not yours because you say that that's ours well we're going to get the restful that is coming against us [Music] go and capture adidas [Music] they it [Music] [Applause] russia then they call us crazy [Music] in charge of the united states and then he told [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] on [Applause] and he said you churches you have cheese he said you won us and you traded terrorism you're fine [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's my revelations [Applause] yes do you claim to save the people [Applause] [Music] i'm only offering them divine healings not just any

death course we understand that he was speaking about the honey Beach God bless you Bobby that's good amen I I I'd like to make it public I know I've said it before but I just like to do this I I want you to see my wife a woman that came within one day of dying I would like for my wife to stand please brother Bob said it last night he said you you want to give credit to anything give it to my wife some people ask me how is your wife doing well picture it this way what if Sarah had become a young woman and and Abraham stayed an old man I'm G tell you something about my wife before she got sick she she was such a cold natured woman she was always cold when we go to bed now she uncovers herself cuz she has so much heat in her body and I pull the blankets to my side and she takes them off do you know that our bodies is a hidden unit he talk about life she has so much life in her I am deeply thankful to God this morning I love love the Lord and I know you love the Lord and I I want to know him in the power of the Resurrection I'd like for you if you would now to not take any more time because I have a problem with time you see God is not in time time is in God so when we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's no time amen but we have a limit here amen if you would be so kind as to stand with us to honor God's word this morning and I'd like for you to open your Bibles to to the Book of Daniel chapter 7 verses 9 through 14 want to entitle this uh teaching whatever the Lord will give us this morning just one word transfer transfer it wrs this way in Daniel 7:9 I watched till Thrones were put in place and the Ancient of Days was seated His Garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool his throne was a fiery flame its Wheels a burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him a thousand thousands ministered to him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the court was seated and the books were opened I watched then because of the sound of The pompus Words which the horn was speaking I watched till the till the Beast was slain and its body destroyed and given to the Burning [Music] Flame as for the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a Time I was watching in the night visions and behold one like the son of man coming with a Clouds Of Heaven he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him then to him I want you to watch closely here then to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting [Music] Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom the one which shall will not be destroyed amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word let us pray father we have read a portion of thy holy word we report for service at this time we pray that your holy spirit will come upon your children I Surrender myself to thee this morning Lord take me Lord and use me as you would have bless your children heal the sick bind the Brokenhearted set at Liberty the captives for we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless us now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen you may be seated in the Book of Genesis 128 it's showing us here how God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the Earth how many here believe and understand that Jesus Paid the price at Calvary I guess not everybody let's raise your hands if believe that amen we we must confess this I I believe that but even though he paid the price we still have a lot of problems is that right even though he paid the price the devil is still the devil he is the Bible calls him a roaring lion you ever heard a roaring lion amen and he is seeking whom he can devour and he will devour anything that is not inside the kingdom that's why it says that his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion that shall not be destroyed today we look at the Middle East and everybody is in expectation of whether we are going to war or we're not going to go to war but what we are seeing and being Witnesses of is nothing else but what is written in the Bible it's coming to what is called the Judgment of the Nations we don't look to these kingdoms we look to another kingdom now when the Lord told his disciples he said when they asked him teach us how to pray he said he said pray in this manner he said thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so then the will of God is to be accomplished here on the earth when we receive the Lord as our our personal Savior and we receive the Holy Spirit we're receiving a shadow of a shadow of a shadow we receive what is called the earnest of it amen we receive that amen but as long as we don't hold the abstract title deed in our hands amen we don't have full possession of it we know that Adam lost he forfeited his his title did we all have read this and understand this I am I am moving into a cycle this morning because we're going from a shadow to a shadow to a shadow but we want to come into that Perfect Light Of God Amen so then when we receive the Lord amen we receive him as our savior the Bible says and the the the prophet tells us Satan's dirty hands could not keep this book in his hands and he says it went back to the original owner but it it won't do you a bit of good if it stays in the hands of the owner but the owner had given this to somebody and it had been lost and he had to bring it back the Original Seed had to be restored and in order for him to do it he had to come as a near Kinsman Redeemer but let me take the word near and just put Kinsman before it amen how many understand this so then I don't want to take too much time on this because you've heard all these things but we understand that in 1963 what body repeat after me 1963 amen God confirmed the contract he confirmed it and gave it to the seventh angel we know we know that the angel comes at the end of the age and at the end of the age was when this angel came and he came to rebuke lady because they thought they had everything but he said they were naked they they they needed oil they needed to be dressed to see that God was bringing the kingdom down to the Earth that's why the kingdom that God was given was an everlasting Kingdom amen how many understand that now the Bible tells us if you would turn in your Bibles I'm not going to read it I'm just going to be quoting these scriptures in in Revelations 31 now if you notice in Daniel 7 it says till Thrones were cast down now the Bible says here to him that overcometh will I grant him to sit in my throne and the prophet interprets that and says in my domain not everybody can sit in that Kingdom it says to the Overcomer now when it says Overcomer the Bible tells us the prophet shows us it says to overcome you must keep life inside of you not the light out here the light has to come inside of you that's the only way that you and I can overcome you cannot overcome by being a religious person you cannot overcome by memorizing the Bible the only way that you and I are going to make it out of here keep life inside of us and that life is the light of the man that's the life that he gave us amen now according to the word I'm going to turn it a little bit there's three Bibles but in actuality there's four Bibles that's right there's three steps in the journey but there are actually Four amen amen I I I remember when brother brandham was went amongst the Pentecostal people and and they put that old colored man to preach and he said why why do they put such an old man they should have put a young guy said he was about 90 some years old he said but you you you've heard all these preachers preach about these things down here on Earth he says but I'm going to take you before he said he went up to the heavenlies and he said he brought down that horizontal rainbow he said after a while Bob Willard was ching to him there ain't enough room for me up here brother Bram says if if if that made that old man do that what will it do a young man think about it when he brought him down we see the Bible and and it was written first in the skies it was called the zodiac then he brought down to the pyramid and then the word was put in book form it's called the Bible everybody reads the Bible everybody that goes to church reads the Bible that calls himself a Christian these words were written by the Holy Spirit but actually they were they were men of all wrote this Bible they were inspired by the Holy Spirit now we find also another thing if we want to break these Bibles the Zodiac the pyramid and the book which which we called the Bible how many have a Bible let's erase your bibl beautiful beautiful don't forget we're raising the Bible we're raising the standard let's see you raise the Zodiac you can't stop there raise the pyramid you can't it's in Egypt raise this everybody raise this we have this in book form we have another thing with us which is called tapes they didn't have magnetic tap but they had scripes and they would they would write everything that Paul was saying when the prophet was here it came on Magnetic Tape amen amen all right now I want you to notice carefully I don't want to stay too long and explain all these little details because I want to get to something I want you to be in expectation of something the prophet of God had three pools in his ministry amen the first pool the second Po and the third pole we could call him three stages amen we also notice that the that that seventh seal that third P had three parts to it he said something happened today or yesterday he said and another one today the other one came in an unknown language now this is what I want to get to when we saw these pictures that were placed here by brother we find six six of those ages now he said the seventh one had not been completely covered with Darkness he said there was a little light left in it we find that when the prophet came he preached to us six seals and those six seals was the book of redemption that Redemption was to show us the plan he said in the first seal this is the plan of God how many how many want to know God's plan you should be be very enthused about this plan this is what he has for you this is what he has for me I believe today that if we had not known his plan my wife would not be here with us according to his plan it let us see something that the human mind cannot comprehend beyond that when the churches preach when the churches preach when they continue to preach it it's easy to preach Jesus Christ of yesterday it's easy to it's easy to preach that now when when John was commissioned in the aisle of pedmas this were the instructions given to him write write all the things that you have seen the things which are and the things that shall be Hereafter it is easy when you have a mind and you can study to give history and explain everything in detail but toing bring him to the scene it takes something else it doesn't take your mind but it takes your surrendering and a recognition that he is the same yesterday today and forever I am not preaching a Christ of yesterday but a Christ of today and if he is with us then we must manifest it because if we don't manifest we are being Liars we really don't believe him today not yesterday I know what he did yesterday but I want to know what he is today in my life in your life that's the resurrected Christ in every detail except the Corporal body that's the expectation I want to get you to this we have seen teachers explain to you how a man can blow away this that's good that's good teaching we can see how balloons can go up but we want to see more than that this morning we want to see a Deliverance bringing it from a shadow to a shadow to a shadow until the perfect light with us but we must recognize it in our midst read your Bible and bring him out of here I say again read your Bible and bring him out of here bring him out of this take him out of here come and pray and I'm not saying for you not to pray because you must be prayed up come and pray and bring him out of [Applause] there fast until you ain't got no W left and I'm not saying you shouldn't fast CU some of you go out here saying you don't believe in praying and fasting I pray more and we pray more and fast more than people that are on their knes sometimes we're on trips I fast from my wife my children my friends I pray whether I'm driving I don't have to be kneeling down today Bible says we pray all the time pray without chasing I don't know how many hours at night you sleep I only sleep about two hours a night if you don't believe me as my wife always thinking always praying I'm not like this on these things because a great word has been prised in our hands we don't have just any chaffa things in our hands we have Jesus what am I going to do I have to do something because it's in my hand I have to give it to somebody but who's going to receive it not everybody receive it because they'll read their Bible but they won't read he said I know some of you and some of your preachers don't like for us to holler don't blame me I'm that way forgive me I was that way when I was 27 years old I'm 50 years old then I'm still that way if I get to be 90 years old I want to be like the colored man I want to do the same thing yes I was there till the Thrones were cast down and the books the book was open which book there was only one man here that opened up his heart to you and I one man one man opened up what was inside of him amen he cried when he went amongst the Pentecostals and he couldn't find he got his scripture he said I didn't know what I was going to preach but then he said he lifted up his eyes in hell I wonder what he saw in Hell well brother hell is down there no sir hell is here he lifted up his eyes in hell what did he see in hell terrible things he said then he began to cry and everybody began to cry why did he cry because of what he saw in heav amen now the book of redemption was opened so we could understand the Plan of Redemption amen now I want to I want to read a scripture in Revelations 10 I'm going to hurry as much as I can to save time because I I know I know myself amen Revelations 10 and it says that he saw an angel Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was on his head his face was like the sun his feet like pillars of fire he had a little book open in his hand he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land cried with a loud voice when a lion roars when he cried out seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write he had to write because the commission was for him to write everything as he was about to write all of a sudden the angel said don't write this this takes my own personal touch I will write this no one else will write this I will write this in their hearts it won't be in this paper it will be in heart hearts of Flesh where he was going to write and let me tell you one thing no one can write it John is a type of the Bride the bride cannot write this finger the things that are for his people his will and your will you must find out his will for you to do what has commissioned what has been commissioned for you to do here let me tell you something about this light God told Moses build me a tabernacle according to the fashion that you have seen it now this Tabernacle we call it the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the desert of Si amen now the Tabernacle was fashioned in such a way that you would see the outer cord out here amen and that got what is called Cosmic light inside the that was a little room that was separated into two one was the Holy place that did not have Cosmic light but it had candle lamp Candlestick or he says lampstand that still wasn't the True Light but there was another Veil you know I knew this since I was in denomination but really I didn't know it I knew how to read it I I used to enjoy it but there was a veil and it's called the veil of self will can everybody say self will self will is you don't look to nobody self go like this self you th this behind this other veil was where the sh or Shina glory of God would come down only in this place no one was permitted in there only the high priest only once a year Moses was called by the pillar of fire amen and who went with Moses was J for six days the P fire the cloud was there but on the seventh day God Called Moses inside this cloud Joshua couldn't go in only Moses could go in anybody went in there it was death because it was a type of what was coming since the Garden of Eden when the sherim were placed there to guard the entrance amen poor interpreter I I'll Tire them out you tired my voice amen now we find that Moses was taken to this place but I want to read a scripture found in second Corinthians chapter three amen don't you love the Lord this is his word amen second Corinthians 3 praise God give my interpreter a breather here 36 remember that Tabernacle in the wilderness remember the seven Church ages Israel had seven Church ages amen who also made us sufficient as Ministers of the New Covenant go ahead not of the letter but of the spirit you have to watch it here because God when he expresses his thought then it is written want you to notice that let me say that again when God expresses his thought then it is written but then he hides it behind his word it has to be in the word because God is the word and he's in the word but as long as you see it written and you don't take this and eat it you'll always see it written in the Bible but it has to be written some place else to be made manifest to bring the original seed to his restoration Redemption you cannot have Redemption without restoration they go together redeem is to send back and to restore to place it in its original position that's why God said Adam Where Art Thou he knew where Adam was but Adam had left his position and as long as you are not in position he will say Jacob Jacob where thou Tony Tony where thou William Williams where thou but when you find your position he ain't looking no more he's there he's there are this is hard for the people to understand for the letter kills read the Bible all you want read these books all you want brother it'll kill you I want to say that again you read this it'll kill you but you got to die before you can live yes sir it'll kill you you do something wrong you're doing something wrong and this letter will kill you and some of you come to church you give your heart to the lord it's everything's okay but you begin to hear the word begins to kill you before you know it you don't want to come to church anymore why because the kill body doesn't stop right there it says that the spirit gives you life and if you want life to be in the Kingdom you let that letter kill you cuz you got to read the letter everybody has to read this letter this was a letter sent from God and it'll kill so many Desires in brother pis till the letter kill and the Bible says when when the worshiper is once cleansed he has no more desire of sin why because the spirit gives life not it's his spirit I know that he has changed my heart and my spirit it's my Same Spirit it hasn't changed in a sense but in another sense my spirit has been transferred has been changed it has been shown something it has nature the nature of the world nature of the holy spirit in my life that's what changes and the spirit makes you free that's Spirit not just because you you you you spoke in tongues and that's all right if you speak in tongues not because you prophesied not because you preached not because you're a good J no but until this letter kills the sacrifice must be killed we must die but we shouldn't stay dead that's why a lot of people read the message and they're dead they never get the life but when we are buried with him so resurrect we must come up we must resurrect with him for he is our savior he is our lord of every tongue of every nation of every language all right amen s in the ministry of death written and engraved on Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance which Glory was passing away you think that Ministry was glorious watch this one how will the ministry of the spirit not be more glorious how many can see a glorious Ministry amen now remember Moses veiled his and and uh the things of God are still veiled maybe not out here let me tell you something even though the Revelation has been given there Still Remains a supernatural thing there there's a little Supernatural right there we we we preach here fine we got to preach here we also got to preach here but there's a supernatural thing here amen it's called Supernatural gospel let me quote to you what brother Brenham said he said witches and warlocks again brasas no more about the supernatural than most preachers they know more about it the supernatural frightens hear me ex me this ministry more glorious glor amen than that of Moses that's what the B that's what Paul wrote here how will the ministry of the spirit not be more glorious for in the ministry of condemnation had Glory the ministry of righteousness exceeds M more much more in glory much for even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect because of the glory that excels amen now watch this when the son of man came and I understand the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he came how many believe he came I believe he came he planted the Original Seed and he was going to use the voice because brother Bram says I am the voice of God to you but then we read it's the voice of many Waters and we heard brother Fabio bring to us the message whener came he was not by himself but the servants were with him let me let me tell you something when Elijah was commanded to go to the Widow's home the Bible says that God had already commanded the Widow had G his Commandments to the Widow but the Widow didn't know nothing about it yet we don't know that God had given the Commandments when God said let there be light the light has to come it might not come right away has to come because God gave the Commandment the woman God said there's a widow that shall sustain the like the Widow didn't know nothing about but when the prophet Drew near there was something about the prophet that got the attention of the Widow poor man I'll give him a drink of water but how selfish was that man how selfish that woman had enough food for one meal and for her son and then they were going to die right sometimes our wallets have money and we're asked for a little bit of money to help the kingdom said I ain't going to give no money that's right but if you were like the Widow that Elijah came to she would give him I want you to notice what these men said to her make me some bread make I mean the man was looking out for hisas but what was he really looking for that what what made the woman recognize that that man was God's anointed what made you recognize who your pastor is who made you recognize that brother Bram was the prophet I gave them the Revelation oh no you might have Spen to him but the revelation has to be commanded by God and that woman will receive that and when she receives them it's not a chffa revelation that's the problem today second hand Revelation amen but this woman when she got that this was the word of Elijah he says you bake me that cake and I I'll guarantee you that as long as there is famine in the land you will always have that Cru of oil you'll always have that meal offering I'm G say that again as long as long as you do as long as you give me first is that the way it works with you me first and then them no no no it's God first then your family you don't put your family over God God first God says give me God says give me a woman she has been commanded she didn't know it but in her heart a seed had been planted who put it there the almighty God Elijah I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee no that she was widow she had not divorced her husband brother Bram says that her husband was waiting for her in glory where are those Ravens that will keep the voice of Elijah alive well I know what he'll do with that money you buy him a new car it's funny that you can drive a new car but the pastor can I drive a new car let me tell you a little story one day brother Bram got on this train and and uh no he didn't stay at the chafa easy8 or if you guys stay the at the e chaaa no brother didn't get on the train and how many know what the is he went pman and boy this preacher was there and he was burning up brother Larry Larry he was hot he wanted to preach the prophet of message and he says uh you know me yo yo I don't ride in pulman know pman no I sit down in a seat and and I take care of God's money brother Brenham goes that's fine brother I'm taking care of God's men you you you you yeah you won't clap to then let me cl for it that's right well isn't that right I can see but don't I got to stop here because I won't finish I got to finish right now that's fine that's fine I know come on that's fine you know we understand but I I also understand that there was many widows in in the time of Elijah but Elijah only came to one of cuz God had commanded her and she recognized God's Prophet first the prophet and then you and you won't run out let me tell you I am a witness of won't run out but you got to meet God's requir you think it was easy when God told me to give him my son and he went to Colorado he's been there two and a half years he started out with two people right now he's got Bible studies in Denver he's got Bible studies in Kenyon cityy City he goes into the prison he baptized for Les Sunday in the prison and in his church he baptized for more B he has meetings in Colorado Springs and he works days in a barber shop and the man at first the man says daddy take me home today he tells me Daddy everything's all right everything's all right d but you know what he takes he takes sacrifice you want something from God don't let them give it to you in a golden play sacrifice to God meet the requirement that God requires I guarantee you that there will always be oil and they'll get that meal offering there always be forgive me that I holler and sometimes it's hard to understand but I can help it on that way you can catch a little bit he's having a hard time hearing me with that fan up back here let me read a quote I'm finishing I'm going to read a quote from the unveiling of God how many believe that the Mighty God has been unveiled the mystery of God should be finished there shouldn't be no mystery left but why is there so much confusion among because the teachers like this Revelation amen not the people no the leaders they like this Revelation why do they say that in that church and who do they think they are it's not who we think we are who we are what we think I don't play with the devil no more I used to say well I'm nobody well you're nobody what are you doing here we are somebody we are a peuli people we are God's chosen people we are his chosen people we are his generation we are the kingdom because we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of his dear son and if you don't believe me and believe God but Jesus Christ says you believe in God believe also in me and where is he there's the problem look for him in the desert look for him in the secret chamber he's not there or is he he's veiled again amen When you pray pray like this likeing come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven these Thunders they thundered from the earth not from the not from heaven from the earth that old man he brought it back amen the horizontal rainbow brought it all the way down amen job where were you jod where were you brother Larry where were you Larry when he laid the foundations where were you I know where I was at when he placed the foundation I was in Egypt but he had already commanded the Widow to sustain him where were you can you declare to me where you were in Egypt yes in the world yes but he had already commanded Elijah said I am left alone said no no no no no no there's some others that I have commanded to feed thee there's others there we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him I don't care if it's a Mexican Veil it's a black veil it's a yellow Veil it's a red Veil it's the veil that keeps the people from seeing him amen amen as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ that's the anointing amen amen I want you to keep that that's the anointing he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also let me repeat that again he that believeth in me works that I do shall he do also brother B said you can do No Greater Works than Jesus but it will be more there is more in the Kingdom amen watch this you become part of Christ as long as Christ is here in you let's the anointing then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you I'm G say that again you know he in you you know he is in you do you know that that he is in you or or haven't you let him come in if he is in you you become the veil God is God isling Behind the Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever Christ in you Christ in you portion of God in you amen amen amen if you recognize this then this is a glorious Ministry and I'm going to finish with that why it's glorious how many want something from God this morning you want it from God I'm going to ask you I'm going to ask you a question have you received a prophet that's the first requirement how did you receive this prophet in whose name in a Blasphemous name in a Baptist name in the Apostolic Church name name in the name of a prophet that's the only way to receive it that's why they call us bramit we are not we are Christians but we have a leader amen amen I received a prophet in the name of a prophet and what do we receive a prophet's reward all that L you all that that you ever loved it shall be given to you brother says about he said Paul will answer for himself and what about irus he'll answer for his and he said this bite no they're not Brites what about Paul said Paul will answer for his he said I preach what Paul preach multitude and the wiow the wiow said we are resting amen amen but don't stop there he that receives a righteous [Music] man in the name oh to me this the sanctuary it ain't smoking brother it's bur name amen he that receives a righteous man in the name of the Baptist Church there's some people that would rather bring in Preachers out of there in here to preach to us no sir let them pass through a process then they can be then they can do it to be righteous he has to have on the breastplate he has to be array in fine linen amen he has to be consecrated to the service of the Lord you notice how the Levites were consecrated well this ministry is more glorious it's consecrated because the Throne of God has moved where is where is the say in heaven The Lord's Prayer is not right let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heav the will of God must be done on this Earth who's going to do it a righteous man and you receive a righteous man you'll also receive that righteous man's reward to finish I'm not going to finish this but to finish to finish this when ever when was ever in the history of the world world was the sons of God to be made manifest if not in this time manifestation is the same as Revelation they're going to be revealed he's going to reveal who is who amen who is who who do men say that I am well he says he's a preach some say he's an evangelist some say he's an apostle some say he's a teacher some say he's a pastor but whom do you say that I [Applause] am well we don't want to know who you are we want to know who Jesus is well you have to know where he's at brother B where is he he's hid behind flesh this is the veil that you want something from God let me quote to you what the prophet said he said I am so tired of hearing the voice of healing and all these crying out he said it says pray pray pray fast fast fast and brother Brenham says they holler for Jesus and they don't get anything why he said it's to be revealed in the Thunders you want something Jesus it's all right if you do if you met the requirement you'll know then you can say brother my house is falling apart listen I don't know what to do with my children anymore let me show you what happened to that seventh age according to the Bible it says that the sun shall turn into darkness and the Moon in Blood Brother Brenham says this he says the world is passing over the church passing over the church and brother Bram says this he say Bram Tabernacle he says the world is upon you and I can say today I don't care what church you're in the world is upon you because the world is passing over the church and how houses are falling apart churches are falling apart the nations are falling apart everything my crops are burning my children are burning my wife is burning my wife is burning my family is burning where is the manifestation there has to be somebody that will give them rain there has to be a place aan a place of Refuge people can come and be obedient to a righteous man so that they can receive what God has given them and they said like Peter and John when they went to the temple called Beautiful there was a lame man Silver and Gold Have I not but what I have I give unto you now I couldn't say this if I didn't have something you're bragging brother Pettis very much I'm bragging on Jesus if that's all you're going to get me for you got plenty to get me for I'm really going to brag on him now I'm break on him how he does people break on the devil what he does I'm sick my heart my my children are in the world the devil is inside my home the the the things are going bad in my house I don't like what's going on in the church always bragging about the devil let's pray about Jesus let's see what Jesus can do in my heart there is peace that's why brother bam says shalom shom good morning good morning morning Stars arise and shine for the glory of the Lord is Ren me and I'm going to tell you something I have seen his glory I'm going to prak about him my wife was going to die amen the doctor said she's going to die but the light came and said she's not going to I will give unto you I have smitten I will also B you I will restore you says the Lord you shall be my witness you go you shall tell them theous words tell them that what I give to you I will give to them they can only believe what you stand with me amen how many believe how many have a need wherever you're at you got to believe it amen amen if you don't believe it it's not for you this is for believers this is for believers and you must meet the requirements of God want to receive something from God sometimes you got to be broken up again and be formed again that's why he told Jeremiah speak to the P's house take me to The Potter's House how many want to go The Potter's House break it he will break it he'll break it but he'll bind it up again that's a promise he gave maybe you were you were deformed because the devil deforms but God will conform you to this world and the world to come by the renewing of your mind what your problem is you got a battle going on you know where your battle is it's in your mind some of you can notot forget the past the prophet of God says the devil puts a rear view mirror so that you can look back don't look back that's why wi woman wait for to light [Applause] the create anter amen just close your eyes and say Lord

Qu\u00e9 significa pr\u00edncipe con Dios ahora Dios de Israel nacieron 12 hijos estos 12 hijos es lo que hace en la naci\u00f3n lo que llamamos hoy Israel y la Biblia dice los que bendicen a Israel Dios va a bendecir a ellos ellos que maldicen a Israel Dios va a maldecir a ellos porque son una un pueblo bendecido ahora el pueblo de Israel sufrieron mucho en realidad usted y yo no sabemos Qu\u00e9 es el sufrimiento como los jud\u00edos han sido perseguidos han sido matados han sido torturados a\u00fan este d\u00eda est\u00e1n peleando en Israel todo el tiempo est\u00e1n peleando todos est\u00e1n queriendo pelear con Israel pero sabe Israel era una naci\u00f3n pero perdieron Perdieron su lugar con Dios fueron echados De su tierra nativa y fueron esparcidos por los cuatro cavos de la tierra Pero sabemos despu\u00e9s de la Guerra Mundial n\u00famero dos Israel comenz\u00f3 a regresar vinieron a su tierra nativa y en 1946 se hicieron una naci\u00f3n 1948 reconocido por la carta Panamericana como una naci\u00f3n con su propio dinero con su propio gobierno y la estrella de se puntos de David fue levant otra vez Dios misteriosamente hab\u00eda llamado a Israel de Los Cuatro cavos de la tierra vinieron del Norte vinieron del sur vinieron del oriente vinieron del Poniente porque Israel es La redenci\u00f3n de Dios amo escuchar de Israel ahora entendemos y abrimos nuestras Biblias otra vez porque este se pone m\u00e1s rico y m\u00e1s rico y leemos en Mateo 27 que cuando vino Jes\u00fas Jes\u00fas era La redenci\u00f3n de Dios o de Israel vino para reclamar a su suyo a lo suyo pero los suyos no lo recibieron y encontramos o leemos aqu\u00ed que cuando \u00e9l vino Y fue crucificado cuando eso aconteci\u00f3 hab\u00eda un terremoto hab\u00eda un velo que separaba el lugar Santo lugar sant\u00edsimo y cuando este lugar m\u00e1s sant\u00edsimo para entender esto tienes que ir al viejo testamento y encontrar c\u00f3mo fue hecho el tabern\u00e1culo tabulo fue hecho por el patr\u00f3n que Dios hab\u00eda dado ais\u00e9s por esto y c\u00f3mo en ese lugar santo Lo que separa lo que separaba el lugar santo del lugar m\u00e1s sant\u00edsimo era un velo que fue hecho de pieles de de tejones y este velo nadie pod\u00eda entrar atr\u00e1s de este velo era muerte y entrabas no m\u00e1s Solamente el sumo sacerdote y no m\u00e1s Solamente una vez por a\u00f1o cuando \u00e9l entraba a este lugar \u00e9l entr\u00f3 por los pecados del pueblo para hacer propiciaci\u00f3n para el pueblo y cuando \u00e9l estaba dentro estaba bien la gloria de Dios descend\u00eda no al campo afuera pero directamente arriba del lugar m\u00e1s sant\u00edsimo hab\u00eda una nube y la gloria de Dios llenaba a ese lugar adentro de ese lugar hab\u00eda una arca esta arca conten\u00eda tres cosas y en esta [Aplausos] arca es lo que llamamos la s\u00eda de misericordia y cuando el sumo sacerdote entraba la gloria chequina entraba a este lugar pero no m\u00e1s estaba mostrando un tipo que algo que iba a venir algo que iba a venir en el futuro cuando Jes\u00fas vino que era la misericordia o redenci\u00f3n de [M\u00fasica] Israel actualmente hab\u00eda dos que fueron rompidos en dos uno de ellos era el velo que separaba el lugar sant\u00edsimo y otro era el velo llamado Jes\u00fas de carne adentro de Jes\u00fas Jes\u00fas era un hombre afuera pero adentro de \u00e9l moraba la plenitud de La Piedad de Dios la la plenitud de la divinidad corporalmente es lo que estaba dentro de Jes\u00fas era la plenitud de Dios Estaba en \u00e9l los jud\u00edos cuando miraron esto no m\u00e1s lo que la \u00fanica cosa que dec\u00eda o lo que hizo Jes\u00fas cuando vino estaba reclamando a lo suyo era el due\u00f1o era el que cambi\u00f3 el nombre de Jacobo a Israel era el que lo trajo de de la tierra de Cana\u00e1n pusieron a ellos en Egipto trajo para lo trajo para Egipto lo lo sac\u00f3 de Egipto y lo llev\u00f3 para atr\u00e1s a la tierra de Cana\u00e1n abajo de una una mano fuerte un brazo fuerte llamado Mois\u00e9s Mois\u00e9s mientras que \u00e9l andaba era el l\u00edder era era el l\u00edder de ese grupo pero en realidad el l\u00edder era la nube la nube el pilar de fuego estaba con ellos d\u00eda y noche la Biblia dice era un Pilar de fuego por noche y una nube por d\u00eda constantemente estaba con ellos los guiaba por el desierto los llev\u00f3 a la tierra los los coloc\u00f3 en el lugar donde \u00e9l ellos deber\u00edan de estar y luego \u00e9l envi\u00f3 a Jes\u00fas para reclamar a su posici\u00f3n y su posesi\u00f3n no lo quer\u00edan no lo quer\u00edan lo rechazaron no estaba tomando la posesi\u00f3n de alguien otro \u00e9l vino a lo suyo y lo suyo no lo quer\u00edan abre su [Aplausos] entendimiento para saber d\u00f3nde estamos d\u00f3nde estamos parados voyo preguntarles A qui\u00e9n perteneces usted algunos pertenecen a Iglesias hablan a ciertos Cristian hombres eres cristiano o no m\u00e1s dicen yo soy Bautista no le preguntamos qu\u00e9 club pertenec\u00eda es un cristiano eres un cristiano eres un cristiano si eres un cristiano eso significa que sido comprado por la sangre del cordero si eres de \u00e9l A qui\u00e9n perteneces usted tu conciencia no se duerma despierte esta es tu vida Esta es vida ahora aqu\u00ed el va va a tratar de poner algo en usted porque antes que termine voy a mostrarles d\u00f3nde tienes que ir d\u00f3nde tienes que ir para agarrar su salvaci\u00f3n todo el camino aceptan a Jes\u00fas aqu\u00ed pero es eres de \u00e9l al fin lo vas a dejar al fin de la jornada para que \u00e9l pueda reclamar su posesi\u00f3n Israel nunca lo hizo no m\u00e1s vino para reclamar lo que era de \u00e9l va a venir otra vez para reclamar lo que es de \u00e9l de las naciones iremos con \u00e9l vamos a encontrar si vamos a ir o no que Dios nos ayude 40 a\u00f1os en su tierra nativa es tanto tiempo que Israel ha estado en su tierra nativa cuentas de 48 a 88 es 40 a\u00f1os 40 a\u00f1os este a\u00f1o la Biblia dice que Esta generaci\u00f3n no pasar\u00e1 n m\u00e1s estoy citando escritura No quiero que nadie salga de aqu\u00ed y diga que 88 es el fin quiz\u00e1 y si no es en 9 lo espero en 90 pero no m\u00e1s estoy citando escritura Esta generaci\u00f3n no pasar\u00e1 eso es escritura no soy responsable por la escritura este a\u00f1o es cumplido la generaci\u00f3n ahora Quiero leer romanos otra vez est\u00e1s conmigo me voy a ir en mi\u00e9rcoles voy a ir a Los \u00c1ngeles voy a estar en servicio en Los \u00c1ngeles mi\u00e9rcoles el jueves en Fresno viernes en Sacramento y el domingo para atr\u00e1s a Los \u00c1ngeles no m\u00e1s soportan conmigo por una hora dos TR horas no me voy a quedar tanto para mostrarles aqu\u00ed eso no era una promesa lo que dije ahora mire aqu\u00ed 19 pues las ramas dir\u00e1s pues las ramas dir\u00e1s fueron quebradas las ramas fueron quebradas Este era un \u00e1rbol \u00e1rbol gar\u00f3 su vida de la ra\u00ed es donde viene la vida pero las ramas fueron quebradas y cuando ferbras las ramas algo para tomar el lugar de esas ramas para reemplazar esas ramas ten\u00eda que poner algo en ese \u00e1rbol Entonces comenz\u00f3 a llamar a un pueblo que no lo no lo conoc\u00eda un pueblo desobediente que no lo conoc\u00eda comenz\u00f3 a llamar ahora miren aqu\u00ed Israel fue cortado los gentiles ingeridos donde las ramas fueron cortados ahora los gentiles est\u00e1n Ya van a ser cortados fueron ingeridos hacen una y lo inyectan este bot\u00f3n para dentro adentro y lo amarr para que esta rama no importa lo que era esta rama la ra\u00edz comienza a poner a esta rama es una espina profeta de Dios dice toma una espina y lo cortas en Mitad y yo inyecto esa ese esa germen de trigo adentro va a producir trigo nosotros gentiles pod\u00edamos producir lo que Israel ten\u00eda no lo pod\u00edan producir porque Israel es La redenci\u00f3n de Dios pero Dios en su en su soberan en su bondad cuando lo lo cortaron comenz\u00f3 a ingerir de las Naciones un pueblo que no era pueblo de \u00e9l un pueblo que no lo conoc\u00eda no lo conoc\u00eda pero comenz\u00f3 a ingerirlo adentro de ese \u00e1rbol no en cualquier otro \u00e1rbol no lo pod\u00eda poner en otro \u00e1rbol porque este \u00e1rbol era la oliva el \u00fanico \u00e1rbol que tiene redenci\u00f3n afuera de este \u00e1rbol no hay redenci\u00f3n no hay redenci\u00f3n es porque lo llamamos Israel La redenci\u00f3n de Dios Ahora encontramos que esta naci\u00f3n todas las naciones han recibido una se\u00f1al ahora la Biblia habla que Esta generaci\u00f3n adulterina Esta generaci\u00f3n en cual estamos viviendo ellos buscan se\u00f1al pero dice ninguna se\u00f1al ser\u00e1 dada a ellos pero solamente la se\u00f1al el profeta Jon\u00e1s para entender estoes entrar historia J el profeta Jon era un jud\u00edo que fue enviado a una naci\u00f3n gentil el pueblo o la gente de n no eran cristianos eran id\u00f3latras ellos adoraban el mar y el Dios de os era unz sabiendo que la \u00fanica manera que algunos de ellos iban [M\u00fasica] recibirlo a ser abajo del nombre del Padre Hijo y del Esp\u00edritu Santo iba a ser de su Dios pero el Dios de ellos ten\u00eda que echar fuera el profeta de Dios Dios trajo un profeta de los trinos mismo como el profeta Jon\u00e1s ahora la gente de n nunca hab\u00eda escuchado a Jon\u00e1s era un jud\u00edo Dios prepar\u00f3 unaen en su Biblia un gran pez pero vas al libro de San Mateo y dice una ballena dice el vientre de una ballena ahora los cient\u00edficos dicen que la ballena no tiene garganta la garganta no est\u00e1 suficiente grande para tragarse a un hombre pero os no saben que esta ballena fue preparado por Dios y Dios prepar\u00f3 a esta ballena estag a Jon\u00e1s cuando era el tiempo para que Jon el mensaje Jon oraba hacia el templo pued imaginar Jon\u00e1s coma v\u00f3mito y esto todo esto adentro hay todo pegados Pero \u00e9l buscaba D\u00f3nde estaba el Oriente \u00e9l volteaba al Oriente es donde viene Jes\u00fas y \u00e9l oraba en el tercer d\u00eda la ballena hizo una un viaje a la playa y la gente de ninib estaba teniendo una ceremonia en la playa y de repente la ballena abri\u00f3 su boca y de la boca vino sali\u00f3 un hombre y cuando el pueblo de ninib miraron este profeta saliendo dijeron Oh vay va es nuestro Dios un hombre anda afuera de tenemos que escuchar lo que dice este hombre y voy a mostrarles me fui mucho pero voy a ir a ense\u00f1anza ahora para que pueden aprender ahora predicaci\u00f3n es muy f\u00e1cil es muy f\u00e1cil para predicar es m\u00e1s duro para ense\u00f1ar como Jon\u00e1s mientr que estaba en el vientre de la ballena d\u00edas y TR noches Tambi\u00e9n el hijo del hombre tiene que estar en el coraz\u00f3n de la tierra en otras palabras en otr palabr sepultado por tres etapas quiero que detengan esto tres etapas ellos dec\u00edan que Jes\u00fas hab\u00eda un rumor que \u00e9l estaba vivo No m\u00e1s un rumor vas a iglesi ellos celebran todo estos h y todo estos es un grito muy lejos de cristianidad en la Pascua en vez de siendo la resurrecci\u00f3n eso es verdad o estampas el sello el estampa no es un sello o el sello No es una estampa todo est\u00e1 h\u00edbrido pervertido no viene del \u00e1rbol original tiene que ir para atr\u00e1s a Israel La redenci\u00f3n de Dios afuera de esto no hay redenci\u00f3n hab\u00eda un rumor pero ahora no es un rumor y voy a mostrarles por qu\u00e9 ahora la misma se\u00f1al dado a los jud\u00edos ahora dado a las naciones este profeta fue alrededor del mundo siete veces trayendo una se\u00f1al el trono estaba en ruedas sabe una rueda entre una rueda en medio de una rueda mira cu\u00e1nto \u00e9l viaj\u00f3 en este carro era el trono movi\u00e9ndose estoy \u00f1oles algo aqu\u00ed quiero que noten algo aqu\u00ed en Lucas 1728 aqu\u00ed es donde el va tratar de robar esto de usted no pierden esto oa de [Aplausos] Israel Asimismo tambi\u00e9n como fue en los d\u00edas de lot com\u00edan beb\u00edan compraban vend\u00edan plantaban edificaban que Sodoma y\u00f3 del cielo fuego y azufre y destruy\u00f3 a todos quiero que noten que nadie de estos eran jud\u00edos Alguien me puede decir si Abraham era jud\u00edo la naci\u00f3n de Israel para que pueden entender todav\u00eda no era formado Abraham sali\u00f3 de \u00e9l sali\u00f3 Abraham sali\u00f3 de El Ur de los caldeos sali\u00f3 de una naci\u00f3n de idolatr\u00eda y lot era su su sobrino y como la escrituras Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 tipificando atr\u00e1s hasta el d\u00eda de No\u00e9 antes que fue fundado la naci\u00f3n jud\u00eda Qui\u00e9n fund\u00f3 la naci\u00f3n jud\u00eda Dios era lo suyo ahora noten verso 30 como Esto ser\u00e1 en el d\u00eda que el hijo del hombre sea manifestado en otra palabra es conocido revelado es para conocer Este era la se\u00f1al quiero que not tienes que seguirme cuidadosamente Esta generaci\u00f3n pidieron por una se\u00f1al pero ninguna se\u00f1al ser\u00e1 dada a ellos solamente la se\u00f1al del profeta Jon\u00e1s ahora miren cuidadosamente laab de la \u00fanica se\u00f1al era que Jes\u00fas a estar en la de la tierra por tres etapas pero despu\u00e9s de Pentecost\u00e9s la se\u00f1al El Mes\u00edas iba a ser revelado cuando miran la se\u00f1al del profeta Jonas era la se\u00f1al otra vez estaba en el vientre de la ballena por TR D\u00edas y noches y de esta [M\u00fasica] ballena sali\u00f3 un hombre es lo que Israel no pod\u00eda tragar o no pod\u00eda tragar esto no pod\u00eda mirar esto no pod\u00ed no pod\u00edan ver que un hombre llamado Jes\u00fas un hombre Dios estaba dentro del hombre la misma cosa iba a contecer a los gentiles donde Dios o Jes\u00fas estando en el coraz\u00f3n de la tierra iba a resucitar en un hombre no fue resucitado fue resucitado 2000 a\u00f1os pasad pero las iglesias lo ten\u00edan en la sepultura Ten\u00edan un sello se fue quebrado cuando se levant\u00f3 pero los romanos fueron y tomaron cimento y lo cementar otra vez lo sellaron otra vez eso es cierto eso cierto lo sellaron otra vez hab\u00eda un rumor que \u00e9l estaba vivo pero iba a ser conocido pero c\u00f3mo hermano la \u00fanica manera que pod\u00eda ser conocido es \u00e9l es revelado en su palabra o\u00edmos esta ma\u00f1ana en el principio era el verbo el verbo era con Dios y el verbo era Dios y el verbo fue hecho carne fue hecho carne es la gente no puede pasar por esto no lo pueden tragar es muy duro para tragar esto lo cen otra vez y lo pone en un seo otra vez lo mir\u00e9 pero no quiero no quiero ver esto no creo eso buscan a Dios en un lugar otro Mateo 24 me est\u00e1n entendiendo 2430 Y entonces se mostrar\u00e1 la se\u00f1al del hijo del de Dios lo le\u00ed correcto cuando hablas de hijo de Dios eso es esp\u00edritu cuando hablas de hijo del hombre es profeta la se\u00f1al ser\u00e1 se mostrar\u00e1 en el cielo yo pod\u00eda mostrarles un El retrato de la nube sali\u00f3 en el magaz\u00edn Live vino en el magaz\u00edn mirar lo todo el mundo ha mirado esto han mirado la se\u00f1al pero no sabe el significado de esto pelean la se\u00f1al cuando la Biblia dice que la se\u00f1al del hijo del hombre ser\u00e1 mostrar\u00e1 se mostrar\u00e1 en el cielo todos lo van a ver eso se cumple la escritura donde dice y todo ojo le ver\u00e1 en esa se\u00f1al un poco todo ojo si no lo han mirado Perm\u00edteme ense\u00f1arles no visto Perm\u00edteme ense\u00f1arles despu\u00e9s del servicio la nube nadie No nadie puede escapar no pueden escapar los las Naciones Unidas cualquier naci\u00f3n cualquier programa que tienen la guerra at\u00f3mica ah\u00ed en Oklahoma ellos edifican subterr\u00e1neos por los tornados no hace nada bien por esto lo que viene va a explotar no hay ning\u00fan lugar para esconderte la iglesia no te puede salvar madre no te puede salvar padre no te puede salvar esposo no te puede salvar esposa no te puede salvar cada rama tiene que ser ingerido en ese \u00e1rbol y voy a mostrarles por qu\u00e9 ahora en todo lo que he dich todo lo que dije voy a comenzar de ense\u00f1arles esto por unos momentos C\u00f3mo va para atr\u00e1s a Israel para entender esto quisiera tener un retrato si lo tengo pero no no est\u00e1 suficiente grande pero muestra el tabern\u00e1culo y como este tabern\u00e1culo era una r\u00e9plica de algo que Dios ten\u00eda en el cielo ahora para entender esto a el Oriente hab\u00eda tres tribos pusimos el tabern\u00e1culo aqu\u00ed ahora no lo tengo aqu\u00ed tengo el jard\u00edn del Ed\u00e9n al norte al sur y el poniente el Oriente tenemos tres tribos a cada uno de ellos cada uno de estos tres tribos ellos guardaban esto tabern\u00e1culo eso este fue puesto ah\u00ed cada vez que se asentaban un poco Israel acampaban pero cuando se mov\u00edan tomaban este tabern\u00e1culo y los lo llevaba con ellos cuando se paraban otra vez pon\u00edan el tabern\u00e1culo otra vez por qu\u00e9 todo esto hay mucho significado en esto Esto es algo precioso algo hermoso algo dulce encontramos que este tabern\u00e1culo como los sacerdotes entraban y ofrec\u00edan sus sacrificios tambi\u00e9n sabemos que Jes\u00fas sufri\u00f3 afuera del campo como las cenizas fuer fueron echados afuera del campo y como la sangre fue llevado para dentro Pero sabemos que nadie pod\u00eda entrar a la congregaci\u00f3n sino primeramente estaban limpio ten\u00edan que ser limpiados ten\u00edan que confesar sus pecados si lo hallaron con un un pecado que no fue confesado y no hac\u00edan propiciaci\u00f3n por esto iban ser matados o piedrad a muerte lo mataban a esa persona no lo dejaba que esa persona entraba dentro hab\u00eda muchas ley muchos leyes en el viejo testamento que no no no no no hurtas comite adulterio no vas a hacer esto o el otro y si lo hac\u00edan ten\u00edan que venir a confesarlo ten\u00edan que venir a ofrecer un sacrificio porque el sacrificio todav\u00eda no fue ofrecido encontramos como ellos entraban a ese lugar y como ellos hablaban a los al sacerdote pero solamente los levitas pod\u00eda ministrar adentro de este lugar santo y no m\u00e1s Solamente el sumo sacerdote pod\u00eda administrar a el lugar m\u00e1s sant\u00edsimo ahora encontramos tambi\u00e9n que la gloria de Dios descend\u00eda ah\u00ed a ese tabern\u00e1culo ahora todo alrededor del Tabern\u00e1culo estaban los 12 tribus de Israel tres a cada lado tres y multiplicado por cuat es 12 Esos son los 12 hijos de Jacobo que hacen o compuesta la la naci\u00f3n de Israel pero el tabern\u00e1culo muy importante para notar fue puesto en el medio en el mero medio ahora meroo medio en el centro ah\u00ed donde estaba el el el ombligo ah\u00ed estaba es donde daba nutrimiento al cuerpo a los 12 tribos al norte al sur al Oriente y al Poniente en estudiando esto no lo podemos estudiar sino primeramente yendo a la ra\u00edz eso no es la ra\u00edz no tees en contra de la ra\u00edz o de las ramas no conoc\u00e9is que es las ra\u00edces que te sostiene y usted no a las ra\u00edces no piensa que eres muy inteligente es porque hayan muchos que son hinchados o yo tengo mucho educaci\u00f3n eso no es nada cacahuates eso no no es que te sostiene es algo otro adentro del huerto hab\u00eda dos \u00e1rboles el \u00e1rbol de vida y el \u00e1rbol de ciencia de bien y del mal estos \u00e1rboles cuando el hombre cay\u00f3 y fueron echados fuera de El huerto el \u00e1rbol de vida se qued\u00f3 en el huerto pero el \u00e1rbol de El ciencia fue arrancado de las ra\u00edces y fue puesto afuera del huerto y dijo al hombre el \u00fanico algo que el hombre puede comer es es porque la raz\u00f3n es que moremos heroso para 14 de Job el hombre nacido de mujer de usted nacieron de un hombre puedo repetir esto nacio de mujer puede vivir No no es corto de d\u00edas y harto de sinsabores corto de d\u00edas y harto de sinsabores lleno de sinsabores porque encuentra gente mui\u00e9 no saben lo que est\u00e1n haciendo se mueven al Oriente al norte al sur al poniente van alredor del mundo est\u00e1n quieren encontrar una ciudad perfecta en que pueden vivir olvid de eso encuentre D\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el \u00e1rbol y lo vas a estar contento el hombre nacido de mujer corto de d\u00edas y harto de sin Sabores \u00e9l viene como una flor y es cortado es muy muy triste perd\u00ed mi pap\u00e1 un a\u00f1o y medio pasado pero en realidad no no lo perd\u00ed \u00e9l no m\u00e1s fue a casa antes de m\u00ed pero mientras como \u00e9l fue \u00e9l naci\u00f3 de mujer \u00e9l era un hombre muy bendecido porque \u00e9l vivi\u00f3 m\u00e1s que la Biblia da al hombre los d\u00edas del hombre son 70 y 10 lo m\u00e1s robusto o m\u00e1s fuerte 80 vivi\u00f3 a tener 99 a\u00f1os aos no m\u00e1s es la Biblia dice como aer que pas el d\u00eda de ayer que pas\u00f3 y como una de las vigilias viene el hombre hasta ser quebrantado es corto como una flor y es cortado ahora m \u00e9l sale como una flor todos vamos a morir salemos como una flor estamos llenos de sinsabores somos de corto d\u00edas salimos de un \u00e1rbol h\u00edbrido como una flor como un bot\u00f3n en una rama no hay vida sino algo acontece si no somos llevad y enidos en ese \u00e1rbol de vida El \u00c1rbol de vida el \u00fanico \u00e1rbol que da vida este otro \u00e1rbol es una

voy a parar tengo mucho aqu\u00ed pero nos voy a parar ahora mire antes que Leo esto tres cosas y voy a par quas ustedes saben eso cuando Salom\u00f3n edific\u00f3 el templo estaban dedicando el templo ahora este templo este templo fue edificado por Salom\u00f3n que era el hijo de David cuos saben esto Cu\u00e1ntos saben esto David quer\u00eda edificar este templo Dios nunca le permiti\u00f3 \u00e9l hab\u00eda derramado mucho sangre pero de de tus lomos tu hijo \u00e9l va a edificar el templo cuando Salom\u00f3n edific\u00f3 el templo el templo era un edificio muy muy hermoso luego el sacerdote vino eron el arca del testamento trayeron todas las cosas en el templo pero de repente cuando los sacerdotes estaban ah\u00ed comenzaron a escuchar un ruido un ruido que nunca jam\u00e1s hab\u00edan escuchado era un sonido del [M\u00fasica] cielo y comenz\u00f3 a llenar la casa y el sacerdote estendo era tan grande que los sacerdotes no pod\u00edan ministrar era cuando Dios llen\u00f3 el templo hab\u00eda un hombre de Kentucky un ranchero no parec\u00eda como mucho pero un d\u00eda Dios vino a \u00e9l y llen\u00f3 el templo cuando este hombre andaba en los auditorios todos los levitas La gloria de Dios hab\u00eda descendido la revelaci\u00f3n saliendo de la boca de un hombre peque\u00f1o era tan grande que los sacerdotes los predicadores no pod\u00edan administrar porque no ten\u00edan la revelaci\u00f3n la revelaci\u00f3n de Dios Estaba viniendo del oriente al Trono de un trono que iba a moverse alrededor del mundo llevando el mensaje el reino al pueblo era tan grande que cuando \u00e9l andaba para dentro ning\u00fan levita ad ministraba la revelaci\u00f3n estaba tan grande pero \u00e9l vino para traer un mensaje \u00e9l comenz\u00f3 a predicar un mensaje comenz\u00f3 a proclamar libertad ahora vamos a encontrar si lo que dije es verdad Juan 7o por la Biblia Ju vamos a ir verso 37 m\u00e1s en el postrer d\u00eda el \u00faltimo d\u00eda o el \u00faltimo d\u00eda en el poster [Aplausos] D\u00eda grande de la de la fiesta el \u00faltimo d\u00eda en el d\u00eda del hijo del hombre en los d\u00edas del hijo del hombre pero en el postrer d\u00eda de la fiesta para que pueda entender es fiesta hab\u00eda siete fiestas un espacio entre las \u00faltimas dos fiestas que era la fiesta de Pentecost\u00e9s que llevaba a las fiestas de los tabern\u00e1culos pero durante la \u00faltima fiesta Jes\u00fas se pon\u00eda en pie y clamaba diciendo si alguno tiene sed est\u00e1 llamando por un hombre hombre hombre no hombres un hombre si lo dije mal ustedes que son profesores de ingl\u00e9s levante su mano a ver si le dije mal D\u00f3nde est\u00e1 linda hombre es singular hombres es plural ahora c\u00f3mo lees su Biblia has tenido colegio es hombre singular si alguno vas al libro de revelaci\u00f3n Apocalipsis y dice si alguno hombre Oye mi voz cuos oyeron su voz No m\u00e1s uno escuch\u00f3 su voz uno la generaci\u00f3n adulterina buscan otra cosa no van a encontrar otra cosa porque Dios no m\u00e1s Solamente le da una se\u00f1al de El Profeta hijo del hombre si alg\u00fan hombre est\u00e1 hablando de es hijo del hombre si alguno tiene sed no deja que ellos deja que \u00e9l singular que \u00e9 ustedes van a tratar de sacarte de esto yo miro el juegando con la mente \u00e9 no significa esto significa esto o el otro si alguno tiene sed venga a m\u00ed y beba de d\u00f3nde iba a beber voy a apuntar otra vez de este r\u00edo que vino del oriente estaba fluyendo al coraz\u00f3n si alguno tiene sed venga a m\u00ed y beba ahora mire Por qu\u00e9

mujer de ese hombre r\u00edos de aguas vivas iba a fluir de \u00e9l de su vientre de su vientre fluir\u00e1 R\u00edos no un r\u00edo r\u00edos de su vientre iba a enviar agua a Canad\u00e1 iba a enviar agua al norte iba a enviar aguas a Nicaragua Brasil a M\u00e9xico de su vientre iba a enviar agua hasta el poiente y de su vientre iba a enviar agua para atr\u00e1s a Israel pero no era tiempo

a\u00fan ahora en la presencia para alcanzar ese lugar que nosotros ha sido prometido hay muchos que est\u00e1n enfermos y necesitados en la tierra ellos no han completado su jornada en nuestro gran enemigo no solamente nuestro enemigo sino tu enemigo ha venido a asediarlos y a detener sus vidas enviarlos a una a una sepultura prematura estamos pidiendo por ellos hoy que t\u00fa y tu misericordia y gracias se\u00f1or prolongue sus d\u00edas hasta el tiempo asignado puesto sobre la plataforma o el p\u00falpito hay aqu\u00ed pa\u00f1uelos y prendas y afuera en los pasillos alrededor del lugar est\u00e1n aquellos en cada tres camillas enfermos y afligidos de pie en la audiencia con apenas suficiente fortaleza para estar de pie oh Dios eterno bendito que t\u00fa escuches nuestra oraci\u00f3n esta ma\u00f1ana a trav\u00e9s de la sangre del Se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas mirando nuestra iniquidad y no sabiendo que \u00e9l se par\u00f3 en nuestro lugar y \u00e9l es el que nos est\u00e1 representando

agradecidos por el aire acondicionado pero un grupo de este tama\u00f1o no habr\u00eda aire acondicionado que pudiera ocuparse de \u00e9l ven porque el propio cuerpo de uno es una gran una unidad generadora cerca de 90 ocho grados y constantemente est\u00e1 produciendo calor y sentados muy juntos Pero yo conf\u00edo que Dios har\u00e1 que est\u00e1n tan c\u00f3modos como \u00e9l pueda que est\u00e9n que lo est\u00e9n y cuando estamos aqu\u00ed hacemos reuniones como esta Yo no har\u00eda que vinieran aqu\u00ed de ninguna manera sino pensara que les ayudara que les estuviera haciendo un bien y que saldr\u00edan beneficiados por ello al venir y adem\u00e1s Sabiendo tambi\u00e9n que no tenemos mucho tiempo m\u00e1s para hacer esto que estamos estamos llegando a las mism\u00edsimas horas finales y yo Yo quiero hacer que cuente cada momento que pueda para su reino y ahora estoy confiando que el se\u00f1or Dios nos bendiga Mientras nos reunimos y quiero comentarles que ayer estuve

privilegio de predicarle a gente que a Un pecador es y persona yo no digo que esas personas son pecadores pero quiero decir personas que de negocios y dem\u00e1s que pueden decir que ustedes son gente agradable y ellos los aprecian en sus negocios alrededor de sus lugares saben eso es ser salados el precio eso el comportamiento de usted la forma en que ustedes tienen cuidado las cosas Yo siempre he

en la corona de ministerio cuando se ha Coronado ustedes ser\u00e1n esa Joya les he estado diciendo en tiempos pasados sobre los siete sellos Las edades de la iglesia y las cosas que que han estado sucediendo pero esta ma\u00f1ana tengo un tema muy importante para m\u00ed es uno de mucha bendici\u00f3n Espero que los impresione la misma manera y Si tan solo pudiera yo traer una Inspiraci\u00f3n en la que lo recib\u00ed ser\u00eda maravillosa pero hacer eso depender\u00e1 de Dios ese estado diciendo acerca de d\u00f3nde y qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo y vemos todas estas cosas teniendo lugar ahora voy a hablar esta ma\u00f1ana sobre el futuro hogar del novio celestial y la novia Terrenal d\u00f3nde van a vivir y porque conf\u00edo que por la gracia de Dios todos formamos parte de esa gran econom\u00eda de Dios Y ahora yo yo conf\u00edo que ustedes tendr\u00e1n paciencia conmigo tengan sus Biblias sus l\u00e1pices o lo que sea que ustedes hagan para leer conmigo porque me voy a referir a muchas escrituras tratando de terminar con suficiente tiempo para orar por los enfermos yo promet\u00ed eso Ustedes han estado orando Durante los \u00faltimos momentos en las salas y alrededor por aquellos que est\u00e1n casi imposibilitados y desahuciados Y si el se\u00f1or quiere probablemente tendr\u00e9 otro servicio el 16 quiz\u00e1s solo oraci\u00f3n por los enfermos comienzo mis vacaciones ahora desde el pasado enero estado viajando y voy a regresar aqu\u00ed llevar\u00e9 a mi familia Tucson en la ma\u00f1ana luego regresar\u00e9 para pasar el tiempo aqu\u00ed en Kentucky con alguno de mis amigos cazando y cazando ardillas por un par de semanas quiz\u00e1s siete u ocho o diez d\u00edas sea lo que sea a menos que el Se\u00f1or me gu\u00ede a otra parte yo nunca s\u00e9 exactamente d\u00f3nde va a estar uno nunca sabemos eso porque eso est\u00e1 en las manos de Dios de Dios nada m\u00e1s ahora para este gran tema nosotros Yo supongo que si me tomara mi tiempo en esto porque uno tiene que introducir muchas cosas y tomar\u00eda semanas Pero ha notado algunas escrituras algunas notas solo para verlo sobresaliente de ello de manera que les permita estudiar luego pronto quiz\u00e1s si el se\u00f1or quiere En octubre no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ndo pero cuando \u00e9l provea me gustar\u00eda tener unos unos cuantos d\u00edas de constante reuniones sobre el cap\u00edtulo 12 de Apocalipsis para relacionarlo con esto aqu\u00ed yo creo que ser\u00eda estupendo simplemente lo ser\u00eda ser\u00eda estupendo ver c\u00f3mo hizo \u00e9l Entonces reuni\u00e9ndonos nosotros ahora yo dije anoche yo dije ustedes saben cuando yo en la ma\u00f1ana Como cada ma\u00f1ana yo pienso cuando yo venga aqu\u00ed voy a reconocer ac\u00e1 una de mis amigos que est\u00e9 all\u00ed ahora c\u00f3mo voy a hacerlo el tener aqu\u00ed conmigo como a mi buen amigo el doctor lee el sentado aqu\u00ed atr\u00e1s su encantadora esposa e hija y al hermano Roy borders y me parece al hermano raro al hermano Billy y al hermano y al hermano Jackson hermanos los esos amados hermanos de todas y diferentes partes el hermano Anthony Milano y donde quiera que uno ve uno ve a alguien otro hermano de all\u00e1 de Arkansas no puedo pensar en sus nombres el hermano John el hermano y el hermano blaire o simplemente hay uno es interminable ven ustedes estoy tan contento de tener un grupo como ese reunido a mi alrededor cuando estoy ense\u00f1ando sobre la palabra de Dios hombres que pienso que son hombres valerosos verdaderos hombres de Dios estoy agradecido por este peque\u00f1o tabern\u00e1culo estoy agradecido por sus cinco puertas abiertas al p\u00fablico cada puerta tenemos cuatro di\u00e1conos aqu\u00ed hombres llenos del esp\u00edritu cuatro s\u00edndicos hombres llenos del esp\u00edritu son dos en cada puerta tiene una puerta doble enfrente para los dos pastores los pastores Estamos contentos de tenerlos estamos agradecidos con Dios por esto que \u00e9l siempre los bendiga ahora queremos ponernos de pie un momento mientras leemos de segunda de Pedro el cap\u00edtulo tres y tambi\u00e9n del libro de Apocalipsis 21 mientras estamos de pie Oh Se\u00f1or llena nuestros corazones y alegr\u00eda debido a la lectura de tu palabra sabiendo que Jes\u00fas ha dicho que los cielos y la tierra pasar\u00e1n pero mi palabra nunca fallar\u00e1 sabemos adem\u00e1s que \u00e9l dijo toda escritura debe ser cumplida medida leemos estas cosas que podamos tener entendimiento de ti el ahora en la cual vivimos en el nombre de Jes\u00fas el autor del libro am\u00e9n segunda de Pedro 3 amados Esta es la segunda carta que os escribo y en ambas despierto con exhortaci\u00f3n vuestro limpio entendimiento para que teng\u00e1is memoria de las palabras que antes han sido dichas por los santos profetas y de los mandamientos del Se\u00f1or y Salvador dado por nuestros pap\u00e1s Ap\u00f3stoles Sabiendo primero esto en los postreros d\u00edas vendr\u00e1n burladores andando seg\u00fan sus propias concupiscencias y diciendo d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la promesa de su advenimiento Si eso no cuadra con esta mujer incr\u00e9dula y desde el d\u00eda en que los padres durmieron todas las cosas permanecen as\u00ed como desde el principio de la creaci\u00f3n estos ignoran voluntariamente que en el tiempo antiguo fueron hechos por la palabra de Dios los cielos y tambi\u00e9n la tierra que proviene del agua y por el agua subsiste Por lo cual el mundo de entonces pereci\u00f3 anegado en agua pero los cielos y la tierra que ahora existen est\u00e1n reservados por la misma palabra guardados para el fuego en el d\u00eda del juicio y de la perdici\u00f3n de los hombres imp\u00edos eso amados no ignor\u00e9is esto para con el se\u00f1or un d\u00eda es como mil a\u00f1os mil a\u00f1os como un d\u00eda Ahora el Se\u00f1or no retarda su promesa seg\u00fan algunos la tienen por tardanza sino que es paciente para con nosotros no queriendo que ninguno perezca sino que todos procedieran al arrepentimiento Pero el d\u00eda del se\u00f1or vendr\u00e1 como ladr\u00f3n en la noche el cual los cielos y la tierra con grandes estruendo pasar\u00e1n con pasar\u00e1n con grandes trueno y los elementos Ardiendo ser\u00e1n deshechos y la Tierra y las obras que en ella hay se quemar\u00e1n puesto que todas estas cosas han de ser deshechas como no debemos nosotros andar en Santa y piadosa manera de vivir esperando la apresur\u00e1ndonos para la venida del d\u00eda de Dios en el cual los cielos encendi\u00e9ndose ser\u00e1n desechos y los elementos siendo quemados se fundir\u00e1n pero nosotros esper\u00e1bamos seg\u00fan sus promesas cielos nuevos y tierra nueva en los cuales Mora la justicia Por lo cual lo amados estando en espera de estas cosas procurar con diligencia no ser hallados ser hallados por \u00e9l sin mancha y sin tacha en paz teniendo entendido que la paciencia del se\u00f1or es para salvaci\u00f3n como nuestro amado Pablo seg\u00fan la sabidur\u00eda que le ha sido dada o se ha escrito casi todas sus ep\u00edstolas hablando en ellas de las cosas las cuales son algunas veces dif\u00edciles de entender las cuales los indoctos en constantes tu\u00e9rzalos como como tambi\u00e9n las otras escrituras para su propia perdici\u00f3n As\u00ed que vosotros o amados sabi\u00e9ndolo de antemano guardaos no sea que arrastrados por error de los inicuos caigas de vuestra firmeza antes bien crecer en la gloria el conocimiento del Se\u00f1or y Salvador Jesucristo a \u00e9l sea Gloria hora y hasta el d\u00eda de la eternidad Am\u00e9n ahora en la la revelaci\u00f3n de Cristo en el cap\u00edtulo 21 Leo estas palabras vi un cielo nuevo y una tierra nueva Porque el primer cielo y la primera tierra pasaron el mar ya no exist\u00eda m\u00e1s y yo Juan Vila Santa Ciudad La nueva Jerusal\u00e9n descender del cielo de Dios dispuesta como una esposa ataviada para su marido y o\u00ed una gran voz del cielo que dec\u00eda he aqu\u00ed el tabern\u00e1culo de Dios con los hombres el morar\u00e1 con ellos y ellos ser\u00e1n su pueblo y Dios mismo estar\u00e1 con ellos como su Dios juzgar\u00e1 Dios toda l\u00e1grima de los ojos de ellos ya no habr\u00e1 muerte ni Habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s llantos ni clamor ni dolor que las primeras cosas pasaron y el que estaba sentado en el trono dijo He aqu\u00ed yo hago todas las cosas nuevas me dijo escribe porque estas palabras son fieles y verdaderas y me dijo hecho est\u00e1 Yo soy el Alfa y la Omega el principio y el fin y al que tuviera sed Yo le dar\u00e9 gratuitamente de las fuentes del agua de la vida el que venciere heredar\u00e1 todas las cosas y yo ser\u00e9 su Dios y \u00e9l ser\u00e1 mi hijo oremos de nuevo Se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas con semejante promesa y tan severas palabras como Jes\u00fas mismo y el ap\u00f3stol nos ha hablado concernientes a la hora en la a la cual nos estamos acercando danos Oh Se\u00f1or de tu direcci\u00f3n para que sepamos C\u00f3mo acercarnos a ella en la forma correcta porque viene lo sabemos las escrituras deben ser cumplidas y as\u00ed ser\u00e1 ahora se\u00f1or pedimos tu misericordia de nuevo sobre todos nosotros mientras estudiamos tu palabra s\u00e9 con nosotros y revenosla Rev\u00e9lanos la se\u00f1or pues lo pedimos en el nombre de Jes\u00fas am\u00e9n pueden sentarse ahora me pregunto si pudiera haber una forma de X de que quiz\u00e1s tal vez pudieran Apagar las luces del Auditorio principal y solo dejarlas aqu\u00ed en la plataforma cual probablemente ser\u00eda mejor y disminuir un poco la corriente casi quemamos un transformador la otra noche si El guardi\u00e1n hiciera eso por nosotros agradecer\u00edamos que apagaran las luces de abajo las luces del Auditorio principal Entonces pienso que ustedes van a tener suficiente espacio para ver para escribir Ahora un tema de nuevo para anunciarlo estamos abordando el tema de el futuro hogar del novio celestial y la novia Terrenal ahora c\u00f3mo ha sido simplemente voy a tener que hacer esto est\u00e1 demasiado caliente aqu\u00ed arriba S\u00ed se\u00f1or mientras nosotros s\u00e9 que a mi esposa no le gusta que yo haga eso pero de quitarme el saco simplemente est\u00e1 demasiado caliente aqu\u00ed arriba ven ustedes tienen aire all\u00ed simplemente est\u00e1 aislado de una peque\u00f1a \u00e1rea que aqu\u00ed Ven ahora en el futuro o en el pasado m\u00e1s bien hemos estudiado los siete sellos las siete iglesias hermano belie y dem\u00e1s est\u00e1n trabajando en esos ahora fielmente para ponerlos en forma libro y viendo todas estas cosas misteriosas que hemos visto suceder Entonces pienso despu\u00e9s de entender eso en la hora en la que estamos viviendo y la posici\u00f3n no hay nadie que quisiera sentarse muy sensatamente y examinar aquello de lo cual se ha hablado y que sea prometido que suceder\u00e1 y que ha sucedido sin que dijera que esas cosas se han cumplido exactamente lo que Dios dijo que la har\u00eda lo hizo exactamente al pie de la letra Ven ahora pienso en esto que no Sabiendo En qu\u00e9 tiempo el Se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas podr\u00eda aparecer s\u00e9 que ser\u00eda bueno le pareci\u00f3 grato al esp\u00edritu santo que habl\u00e1ramos sobre esto entonces Y quiz\u00e1s volver a esto de nuevo dos o tres veces porque no voy a tener bastante tiempo de sobra para sacar todo esto como cuando uno toca un tema que pudiera ser un poquito tropezante para alguien uno no puedes ponerlo totalmente para que quede claro entonces uno vuelve otra vez para tomar el siguiente tema luego m\u00e1s adelante en la si el se\u00f1or quiere encontrar entraremos en los doce sellos No perd\u00f3neme el cap\u00edtulo 12 de Apocalipsis que se encuentra entre la avenida del se\u00f1or y el final de las trompetas y dem\u00e1s trataremos de traer eso de nuevo para mostrar qui\u00e9n es Satan\u00e1s Qu\u00e9 hizo el de d\u00f3nde vino Cu\u00e1l es su prop\u00f3sito y c\u00f3mo fue que su gran belleza que se le dio caus\u00f3 su ca\u00edda su enga\u00f1o caus\u00f3 que cayera belleza luego c\u00f3mo es que la imposibilidad para cualquier hombre que quiere ver eso bien esa Simiente la serpiente yo har\u00eda un reto sobre eso a cualquiera ven que quisiera ver lo con con solo absolutamente entendimiento com\u00fan ni\u00f1o puede verlo ahora llegaremos a eso m\u00e1s tarde ahora entendemos aqu\u00ed que estas dos escrituras la raz\u00f3n de que le\u00ed el cap\u00edtulo 3 de segunda de Pedro y lo compar\u00e9 con Apocalipsis 21 es que ambos aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n hablando sobre el mismo tema pero Juan nunca nunca lo escribi\u00f3 como lo hizo Pedro entendemos que este gran hogar de la novia Ah de estar aqu\u00ed en la tierra y ahora si ustedes leen simplemente como el cap\u00edtulo 21 el cap\u00edtulo 21 de Apocalipsis el ap\u00f3stol dijo aqu\u00ed o el profeta dijo que vio un cielo nuevo y una Tierra Nueva suena como que viene una aniquilaci\u00f3n ahora la forma en que siempre encuentro mis mensajes es por medio de oraci\u00f3n estoy en oraci\u00f3n y algo me es revelado yo espero al respecto unos minutos y vos si est\u00e1 correcto Entonces lo siento m\u00e1s cercano y luego algunas veces sigo esperando hasta que entra una visi\u00f3n pero cuando comienza a venir y yo estoy satisfecho de que viene de Dios Entonces voy a las escrituras esa deber\u00edas de ser la confirmaci\u00f3n de toda cosa espiritual que se hace porque la Biblia es la completa revelaci\u00f3n de Jesucristo es su cuerpo y ahora en eso quiz\u00e1s encuentro un lugar en las escrituras que no son exactamente bien y me preguntar\u00eda al respecto nuevamente regreso a estar en oraci\u00f3n viene de nuevo entonces yo entonces comienzo a examinar mi escritura ahora nuestra Biblia est\u00e1 escrita en ingl\u00e9s por las palabras en ingl\u00e9s cambian todo el tiempo por ejemplo como dice San Juan 14 en la casa de mi Padre muchas moradas hay una morada en una casa pues entonces uno lo que uno hace con eso Entonces es llevarlo al al original y ver qu\u00e9 quer\u00eda decir Santiago regresar al hebreo o al griego de la primera traducci\u00f3n y all\u00ed dice en el reino de mi padre hay muchos Palacios pues entonces uno regresa al tiempo en que los traductores tradujeron para el rey James el reino era llamado en ingl\u00e9s una casa y el rey era el padre sobre sus delegados ah\u00ed est\u00e1 la raz\u00f3n de que tradujeron en la casa de mi Padre muchas moradas hay y luego uno toma esas palabras y uno tiene que investigarlas luego ven ustedes de esa inspiraci\u00f3n este p\u00falpito esta ma\u00f1ana yo digo ni una sola vez ha sido otra cosa sino pura la escritura As\u00ed es como la Simiente la serpiente y todas estas otras cosas vinieron Ven por medio de Yes y en realidad si un hombre tan solo leyera dijera en la casa de mi padre mucha morada sabes si uno no se detuviera para estudiar orar no estar\u00eda todo confundido pero tan solo sigan orando Dios siempre lo endereza si viene de Dios Ahora Juan Explica el cambio y la en C\u00f3mo sucede no lo explica Mejor dicho pero Pedro s\u00ed Juan solamente dijo mi cielo nuevo y tierra nueva los primeros ciegos y la primera tierra pasaron el mar ya no exist\u00eda m\u00e1s yo Juan vi la Santa Ciudad descender del cielo de Dios dispuesta como una esposa ataviada para su marido pero regresamos ahora segunda de Pedro para averiguar Pedro Explica c\u00f3mo este proceso va a llevarse a cabo ahora si ustedes vieran lo que Juan dijo suena como que porque los primeros cielos y la primera tierra pasaron aniquilados entonces Eso suena muy extra\u00f1o as\u00ed que eso fue lo que me impact\u00f3 y comenc\u00e9 a buscar la palabra pasaron y ahora pero est\u00e1 claro que estos dos Ap\u00f3stoles y Profetas estaban hablando de la misma cosa ahora tambi\u00e9n en el libro de Isa\u00edas por ustedes que quieran notar estas escrituras en Isa\u00edas 65 17\u00edas hablando del milenio aquellos mil a\u00f1os de reposo para para el pueblo de Dios Isa\u00edas habl\u00f3 de \u00e9l y \u00e9l dijo yo hubo todas las cosas primeras hab\u00edan pasado y c\u00f3mo edificar\u00edan casas morar\u00e1n en ellas si tuvi\u00e9ramos tiempo quiz\u00e1s simplemente tomemos el tiempo y leamos estos momentos Isa\u00edas 65 s\u00f3lo leamos por unos minutos aqu\u00ed y aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 correcto para nosotros ahora para comenzar Isa\u00edas 65 17 Y he aqu\u00ed que yo crear\u00e9 nuevos cielos y nueva tierra la Isa\u00edas el profeta era uno de los Profetas que escribi\u00f3 exactamente toda la Biblia en su profec\u00eda \u00e9l comienza con la creaci\u00f3n en el centro de su libro como en el cap\u00edtulo 40 aparece Juan El Bautista el Nuevo Testamento y termina aqu\u00ed en su libro en el Apocalipsis en El Milenio hay 66 libros en la Biblia y hay 66 cap\u00edtulos en Isa\u00edas \u00e9l escribi\u00f3 un comentario completo Ahora nos damos cuenta que ahora \u00e9l est\u00e1 en el cap\u00edtulo 65 un cap\u00edtulo m\u00e1s y \u00e9l habla del milenio f\u00edjense cu\u00e1n hermoso He aqu\u00ed yo crear\u00e9 nuevos cielos y nueva tierra y de la primera cosa no habr\u00e1 memoria ni m\u00e1s vendr\u00e1 al pensamiento ha de pasar m\u00e1s os gozar\u00e9is que os alegr\u00e1is a\u00fan en las cosas que yo he creado porque aqu\u00ed que el que yo traigo que yo traigo a Jerusal\u00e9n regocijo y a su pueblo gozo y me alegrar\u00e9 con Jerusal\u00e9n y me gozar\u00e9 con mi pueblo y nunca m\u00e1s se oir\u00e1 en ella a voz de lloro por mi voz de clamor no habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s all\u00ed ni\u00f1o que muera de pocos d\u00edas y viejo que sus d\u00edas no ha cumplido Porque un ni\u00f1o morir\u00e1 de Cien a\u00f1os y Un pecador de 100 a\u00f1os ser\u00e1 acusado entonces van a edificar\u00e1n casas y morar\u00e1n en ellas plantar\u00e1n vi\u00f1as y van a comer el fruto de ellas y no edificar\u00e1n Para que otro habite esto es su granja su hijo quede como heredero de ella o alguno de sus Herederos ni plantar\u00e1n para que otro coma all\u00ed ellos mismos siembran y permanecen all\u00ed pues tienen vida eterna porque seg\u00fan los d\u00edas de los \u00e1rboles seg\u00fan los d\u00edas de mi pueblo y los m\u00edos mis Escogidos disfrutar\u00e1n las obras de sus manos no trabajar\u00e1n en vano ni dar\u00e1n a luz para maldici\u00f3n porque son linaje de los benditos de Jehov\u00e1 y sus descendientes con ellos Ahora f\u00edjense aqu\u00ed aqu\u00ed es donde va a llegar despu\u00e9s de un rato y antes que clamen Y antes que clamen responder\u00e9 yo y mientras a\u00fan hablan yo habr\u00e9 o\u00eddo y El lobo y el cordero ser\u00e1n apacentados juntos y el le\u00f3n comer\u00e1 paja como un buey el polvo ser\u00e1 el alimento de la serpiente y no afligir\u00e1n O har\u00e1n mal en todo mi Santo monte dijo Jehov\u00e1 que Promesa de estos profetas y grandes sabios maestros de la Biblia muy atr\u00e1s en tiempos antiguos viendo este gran d\u00eda glorioso venir por medio de estos pasajes uno pudiera pensar o ser guiado m\u00e1s bien a creer que todo el planeta de esta tierra ser\u00e1 destruido Yo har\u00e9 un nuevo cielo y una nueva tierra ven que los cielos habr\u00e1n desaparecido y la tierra habr\u00e1 desaparecido aniquilados totalmente pero un estudio cuidadoso hoy con la ayuda del Esp\u00edritu Santo podemos ver la verdad de esto y en eso vamos a entrar solo son las atm\u00f3sferas que est\u00e1n alrededor de ella y el pecado que hay sobre la Tierra los que ser\u00e1n destruidos Ven ahora nos damos cuenta que los cielos significa las atm\u00f3sferas de encima ven qu\u00e9 hace eso Entonces estos cardos y enfermedad y muerte y pol\u00edtica y hombres pecaminosos y mujeres pecaminosas y esp\u00edritus malos todos habr\u00e1n desaparecido y habr\u00e1n sido aniquilados tiene que ser hecho de esa manera porque vamos a vivir aqu\u00ed mismo aqu\u00ed mismo probaremos eso por medio de la Biblia aqu\u00ed mismo es donde viviremos Pero f\u00edjense cardos g\u00e9rmenes todas las enfermedades y cosas ser\u00e1n quitadas completamente todo esto su existencia que est\u00e1 sobre la Tierra ahora sistemas hechos por el hombre pol\u00edtica pecado la clase de esp\u00edritus malos con los cuales el mundo est\u00e1 contaminado y todos los cielos aqu\u00ed sobre nosotros est\u00e1n contaminados con esp\u00edritus malos ahora vamos a entrar profundamente y por bastante tiempo en esto ven todo esto Existen los cielos atm\u00f3sferas y la tierra que existe ahora esta tierra tiene esas cosas pero no fue hecha con ese prop\u00f3sito el pecado caus\u00f3 que fuera as\u00ed fue hecha por Dios el creador pero todo y todos nuestros cuerpos en los que vivimos ahora fueron puestos en la tierra cuando Dios la cre\u00f3 porque uno sali\u00f3 del polvo de la tierra todo fue trazado aqu\u00ed cuando Dios mismo la cre\u00f3 ustedes estaban en su pensamiento y en \u00e9l el gran eterno estaba el pensamiento el cual es su atributo era el pecado caus\u00f3 que todo esto sucediera y Dios a trav\u00e9s de esta edad est\u00e1 juntando su material Satan\u00e1s todav\u00eda est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed esa es la raz\u00f3n de que todas estas cosas suceden \u00e9l todav\u00eda est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed y todas sus fuerzas malignas Todav\u00eda est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed f\u00edjense por eso es que la tierra est\u00e1 inmunda ahora por eso es la suciedad y las cosas rid\u00edculas que ocurren derramamiento de sangre guerra pol\u00edtica pecado adulterio toda clase de inmundicias ocurren es porque Satan\u00e1s es el gobernante de esta tierra y esta atm\u00f3sfera ustedes dir\u00e1n la atmos S\u00ed se\u00f1or tanto los cielos y la tierra ahora est\u00e1n contaminados con diablos que pueden acusarnos ante Dios Jes\u00fas est\u00e1 all\u00ed para interceder por nosotros ven mientras los acusadores siguen se\u00f1alando con un dedo ellos hicieron esto hicieron esto hicieron esto pero en la sangre todav\u00eda cubre el vino para redimir aquellos elegidos que \u00e9l vio De antemano por eso es que est\u00e1 tan inmunda hoy aqu\u00ed el ap\u00f3stol aqu\u00ed en segunda de Pedro el cap\u00edtulo 2 y el quinto y el quinto y el sexto vers\u00edculo s\u00ed lo tengo \u00e9l se refiere a tres etapas de la tierra ven El saca tres etapas de ella 15 como las trae el Antiguo mundo que proviene del agua ahora Ese fue el mundo antidiluviano ahora el que es el mundo presente en el que vivimos ahora lo llam\u00f3 un mundo el Antiguo mundo que proviene del agua G\u00e9nesis 1:1 ahora y el mundo que est\u00e1 ahora presente y luego Adem\u00e1s \u00e9l se refiere a otro el mundo que ha de venir el nuevo mundo tres mundos tres etapas del mundo y f\u00edjense como Dios nos pone de manifiesto su plan de redenci\u00f3n esto simplemente estremeci\u00f3 de emoci\u00f3n mi alma cuando lo vi como \u00e9l nos pone de manifiesto aqu\u00ed ahora su plan de redenci\u00f3n ahora comparen lo que vemos con nuestros propios ojos lo que Dios ha hecho para redimir a su mundo \u00e9l ha hecho el mismo plan para redimir a su pueblo Pues el incambiable Dios no cambia ninguno de sus planes ni en nada Qu\u00e9 cosa m\u00e1s gloriosa C\u00f3mo \u00e9l nos dio a s\u00ed mismo para tabernaculizar en nosotros por medio de tres etapas de Gracia exactamente como \u00e9l ha guiado al mundo en tres etapas para venir al mundo as\u00ed como Dios va a venir al mundo despu\u00e9s de que haya pasado por tres etapas diferentes de purificaci\u00f3n exactamente as\u00ed es como el viene a nosotros a trav\u00e9s de tres etapas de la gracia Yo ense\u00f1\u00e9 eso al principio nunca he cambiado desde entonces es la palabra de Dios uno debe de mantener junto sus tres sus siete sus doce la num\u00e9rica de la Biblia debe correr perfectamente ustedes tendr\u00e1n su cuadro todo enredado si ustedes no la pueden entender solo sigan orando ustedes observen caer\u00e1n su lugar exactamente Dios es perfeccionado en tres f\u00edjense el Antiguo mundo el antidiluviano el mundo que est\u00e1 presente ahora y el que ya ha de venir ahora la primera etapa a la que \u00e9l nos trae ven su plan de redenci\u00f3n es exactamente el mismo en todo \u00e9l utiliza el mismo m\u00e9todo \u00e9l nunca cambia digo es malaqu\u00edas 3 yo soy Dios Y no cambio de la manera en que \u00e9l lo hace por tanto si \u00e9l salv\u00f3 al primer hombre que \u00e9l haya salvado por medio de la sangre derramada de un inocente tendr\u00e1 que salvar al siguiente y todo el que \u00e9l salve tendr\u00e1 que ser la misma manera si el sano a un hombre en cualquier momento durante la jornada de la vida ya fueran los d\u00edas de Jes\u00fas de los Ap\u00f3stoles de los Profetas cuando haya sido cuando se encuentran las mismas condiciones \u00e9l tiene que hacerlo de nuevo es correcto \u00e9l no cambia el hombre cambia los tiempos cambian la edad cambia la dispensaci\u00f3n cambia pero Dios permanece igual \u00e9l es perfecto Esperanza deber\u00eda de darle eso a la gente enferma si \u00e9l alguna vez san\u00f3 una persona \u00e9l tiene que hacerlo de nuevo cuando se encuentran las mismas condiciones y alguna vez alguna vez salv\u00f3 a un hombre tiene que hacerlo en base a las mismas razones en que lo hizo la primera vez si \u00e9l lleno alguna vez a un hombre con el esp\u00edritu santo \u00e9l tiene que hacerlo en base a las mismas razones en que la hizo la primera vez si \u00e9l resucit\u00f3 alguna vez a un hombre de la sepultura \u00e9l tiene que hacerlo la segunda vez y toda otra ocasi\u00f3n sobre el mismo principio \u00e9l no cambia Jo Jo qu\u00e9 Esperanza me da eso qu\u00e9 es no en alguna teor\u00eda hecha por el hombre algo en que los grupos de hombres se han puesto de acuerdo sino su palabra incambiable ustedes dir\u00e1n es la verdad \u00c9l dijo sea la palabra de todo hombre mentira y la m\u00eda ver\u00e1s porque los cielos y la tierra pasar\u00e1n pero mi palabra Nunca fallar\u00e1 toda la escritura es inspirada por tanto es buena y \u00datil para ense\u00f1ar y Recuerden que toda escritura ser\u00e1 cumplida todita f\u00edjense como Dios nos lo pone de manifiesto Y si esa no fuera una una gran confirmaci\u00f3n una buena una gran bendici\u00f3n amorosa de parte de Dios cuando veo esto y veo eso desde que era un muchacho la primera vez en que Cristo haya aliviado conmigo yo a\u00fan he ense\u00f1ado siempre esas tres etapas de la gracia f\u00edjense si no es verdad Ahora el primer paso es arrepentimiento para con Dios y luego sigue despu\u00e9s de eso es el bautismo en agua bautismo en agua arrepentidos y bautizados en el nombre de Jesucristo Am\u00e9n sigue el bautismo en agua mostrando que el arrepentimiento fue Genuino o para perdonar nuestros pecados pasados eso no tiene nada que ver con pecados futuros solo Perdona arrepentidos y bautizados en el nombre de Jesucristo para qu\u00e9 perd\u00f3n el quitar el pecado pasado no tiene nada que ver con el futuro solamente que su pecado ha sido cortado lo que ustedes hicieron ustedes no se pueden arrepentir por lo que hizo Ad\u00e1n \u00e9l nunca lo hicieron Ad\u00e1n lo hizo ustedes solo reciben Perd\u00f3n por lo que ustedes hicieron la vieja naturaleza todav\u00eda est\u00e1 all\u00ed Perm\u00edtame tomar esta pizarra momento ahora aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 un coraz\u00f3n humano Ahora yo no estoy muy lejos de ser un artista aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 un coraz\u00f3n humano y aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 un coraz\u00f3n humano ahora este de aqu\u00ed tiene una serpiente en \u00e9l eso es pecado aqu\u00ed \u00c9l tiene su vida este de aqu\u00ed tiene una paloma en el cual es el esp\u00edritu santo aqu\u00ed \u00c9l tiene una vida Bueno este de aqu\u00ed tiene malicia odio envidia eso es lo que lo est\u00e1 causando es este tipo aqu\u00ed pues este de aqu\u00ed tiene amor y gozo y paciencia y eso es lo que lo hace aqu\u00ed abajo ahora cuando ustedes se les pido se les Perdona a ustedes sus pecados ustedes Solo han hecho esto han quitado eso pero la cosa que los hizo hacerlo todav\u00eda est\u00e1 all\u00ed Esa es la vieja ra\u00edz del Mal todav\u00eda est\u00e1 all\u00ed f\u00edjense entonces ustedes se arrepienten y son bautizados en el nombre de Jesucristo que \u00e9l les perdon\u00f3 sus pecados f\u00edjense luego en segundo lugar viene la santificaci\u00f3n la cual pone en orden nuestras Mentes para la santidad para pensar correctamente quito santificaci\u00f3n es una palabra griega compuesta que quiere decir limpiado y apartado para servir luego lo siguiente viene el bautismo de fuego y Esp\u00edritu Santo de manera que Dios pueda habitar en nosotros y el fuego de Dios limpia nuestros corazones de pecado y pone al Esp\u00edritu Santo adentro entonces producimos la misma vida que esto produjo porque eso est\u00e1 en nosotros f\u00edjense el nacimiento natural cuando una mujer da luz a un beb\u00e9 la Vida Natural tipifica la vida espiritual cuando una mujer da luz a un beb\u00e9 en lo natural lo primero que sucede es la ruptura del agua luego sangre luego el esp\u00edritu la vida toman al peque\u00f1ito y le pegan y all\u00ed empieza gritando agua sangre esp\u00edritu y ahora cuando un beb\u00e9 nace en el reino de Dios \u00e9l viene de la misma manera agua sangre esp\u00edritu para f\u00edjense santificaci\u00f3n la tercera etapa la segunda etapa de \u00e9l limpia la mente pone el coraz\u00f3n la mente del coraz\u00f3n en orden de santidad un hombre puede arrepentirse de pecados y \u00e9l todav\u00eda est\u00e1 pensando en bueno quiz\u00e1s \u00e9l es un hombre inmoral la mujer de apariencia y moral que \u00e9l encuentra eso todav\u00eda est\u00e1 all\u00ed y sales un borracho cada vez que huele el trago y est\u00e1 all\u00ed pero luego cuando \u00e9l es santificado eso limpia ese deseo sac\u00e1ndolo de \u00e9l quita el deseo de ello todav\u00eda puede ser tentado pero \u00e9l quita el deseo de ellos sin embargo \u00e9l todav\u00eda no est\u00e1 bien hueles bautizado con el esp\u00edritu santo y fuego limpiado quemado limpiado y luego en el servicio de Dios la santificaci\u00f3n solo los aparta para servicio f\u00edjense exactamente como vino eso los mensajes viniendo Mart\u00edn Lutero justificaci\u00f3n Juan Wesley santificaci\u00f3n el Pentecostal el bautismo del Esp\u00edritu Santo los mensajes ah\u00ed es donde no pueden haber m\u00e1s edad de ellos ven estamos en el tiempo del fin tres etapas el bautismo limpia el coraz\u00f3n con el esp\u00edritu santo que es sorprendente ahora el toma el lugar donde hemos de habitar a trav\u00e9s del mismo proceso ahora llamado a la iglesia a trav\u00e9s de justificaci\u00f3n la llam\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de santificaci\u00f3n luego la llen\u00f3 con el esp\u00edritu santo y fuego y \u00e9l la llev\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de un proceso para que \u00e9l mismo el esp\u00edritu santo mismo el hijo de Dios pudiera habitar en el coraz\u00f3n humano ahora ya tiene que pasar a trav\u00e9s de eso antes de que \u00e9l pueda entrar en ella f\u00edjense \u00e9l hizo con el mundo donde esa novia va a vivir de la misma manera su mismo plan de de salvaci\u00f3n f\u00edjense en el mundo antediluviano \u00e9l despu\u00e9s de que se hab\u00eda arrepentido a trav\u00e9s de la novia de ese d\u00eda No\u00e9 \u00e9l le dio un bautismo en agua lo cubri\u00f3 con agua luego justificaci\u00f3n mostrando que \u00e9l est\u00e1 en camino para llamar a este mundo ca\u00eddo a partir del Ed\u00e9n de nuevo su restauraci\u00f3n luego cristo vino y derram\u00f3 su sangre sobre \u00e9l limpi\u00e1ndolo y reclam\u00e1ndolo Ese es el mundo en el cual vivimos Ahora ven como Satan\u00e1s aqu\u00ed en las escrituras trat\u00f3 de hacerlo a \u00e9l romper el plan de Dios para recibirlo para d\u00e1rselo a \u00e9l cuando lo llev\u00f3 a \u00e9l arriba a la monta\u00f1a y trat\u00f3 de d\u00e1rselo a \u00e9l sin la compra de la sangre se fijaron C\u00f3mo Abraham cuando ellos trataron de darle el terreno \u00e9l lo compr\u00f3 con cierta cantidad de ciclos de plata ante el pueblo como una se\u00f1al como testimonio o sea hoy manifiesto que he comprado esta sepultura la compr\u00f3 y Satan\u00e1s trat\u00f3 de de darle a \u00e9l el reino que le pertenece a la hora \u00e9l trat\u00f3 de d\u00e1rselo a \u00e9l como un obsequio pero \u00e9l no lo acept\u00f3 porque es que ven entonces Satan\u00e1s podr\u00eda a\u00fan tener derecho sobre \u00e9l pero ten\u00eda que ser comprado \u00e9l era la palabra en su plenitud no lo pod\u00edan enga\u00f1ar a \u00e9l en eso luego ahora ha de recibir un bautismo de fuego ahora Qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 cristo vino y llam\u00f3 a la iglesia el arrepentimiento al bautismo en el nombre de Jesucristo para perd\u00f3n santificar a la iglesia con el fuego de Dios desciende y quema toda la inmundicia y viene y habita en el coraz\u00f3n humano ahora el mundo para ser redimido para esta persona redimida \u00e9l utiliza su mismo m\u00e9todo \u00e9l lo bautiz\u00f3 en agua despu\u00e9s de la destrucci\u00f3n antidiluviana derram\u00f3 su sangre sobre el para santificarlo y reclamarlo el suyo Satan\u00e1s tanto decir yo te la dar\u00e9 a ti \u00e9l dijo No se\u00f1or Yo la voy a comprar que sea como testimonio \u00e9l fue levantado como se\u00f1al de que lo compr\u00f3 \u00e9l lo compr\u00f3 pero ahora tiene que pasar por un bautismo de fuego fuego santo de Dios que limpia la tierra y los cielos alrededor de ella Entonces es comprada para que los Redimidos puedan vivir en ella vivir en ella en paz f\u00edjense el bautismo de fuego es para limpiarla de pecado de enfermedad de g\u00e9rmenes de enfermedades de pecadores del y todo su grupo El ha de ser echado fuera el lago de fuego fuego santo de dios desciende de Dios del cielo y la quema f\u00edjense para prepararla para que Dios more en ella porque Dios en el nuevo mundo que ha de venir a demorar en la tierra Porque ustedes dicen Dios el Mora en el coraz\u00f3n humano Pero \u00e9l y la novia se vuelven uno y ellos van a su hogar en el nuevo mundo y el mismo plan de redenci\u00f3n es usado para redimir a ambos al mundo y a las personas que viven en \u00e9l el coraz\u00f3n tiene que ser limpiado de esa manera antes de que Dios pueda descender en la persona el esp\u00edritu santo el cual es Cristo descendiendo y a morar en el coraz\u00f3n humano primero tiene que haberse arrepentido tiene que ser bautizado en agua en su nombre para mostrar a quien pertenece luego tiene que ser limpiado por la sangre de Jes\u00fas y entonces el fuego Santo y el esp\u00edritu santo de Dios desciende y queman todo el deseo de pecado toda la naturaleza del mundo y por tanto el que pecare voluntariamente despu\u00e9s de recibir el conocimiento de la verdad luego adem\u00e1s la Biblia dice es imposible porque un hombre que es nacido de Dios no puede pecar \u00e9l no peca no hay manera de que el Peque c\u00f3mo puede ser Un pecador y un redimido al mismo tiempo C\u00f3mo puedo yo estar en la casa de empe\u00f1o y fuera de la casa de empe\u00f1o al mismo tiempo am\u00e9n \u00e9l nos redimi\u00f3 por medio de su sangre por medio de su esp\u00edritu \u00e9l nos limpi\u00f3 entonces viene a morar en nosotros la iglesia ahora no la denominaci\u00f3n la iglesia f\u00edjese Atentamente ahora mientras vemos esto los lugares donde hemos de demorar ahora ahora el arrepentimiento antediluviano entonces trajo el bautismo en agua luego cristo vino derram\u00f3 su sangre sobre ella para limpiarla y para reclamarla y luego viene lo siguiente la destrucci\u00f3n del mundo como est\u00e1 ahora todo el pecado que est\u00e1 arriba en los cielos \u00e9l es el pr\u00edncipe de la potestad del aire \u00e9l mantiene alejadas aleja peleando las bendiciones de Dios all\u00ed llegan Rayos de Rel\u00e1mpagos y caen en la tierra y todo desde los cielos capas de lluvia cortante y tifones tormentas y de todo vienen de arriba el cual es Satan\u00e1s El pr\u00edncipe de la potestad del aire f\u00edjense vean como Satan\u00e1s trat\u00f3 de tomarla como dije hace unos minutos por medio de d\u00e1rsela a Jes\u00fas sin comprarla entonces Satan\u00e1s todav\u00eda tiene un derecho porque est\u00e1 marcada Pero Jes\u00fas la compra por medio de su sangre derramada y la trae de nuevo a su due\u00f1o Leg\u00edtimo As\u00ed es como \u00e9l nos compr\u00f3 por medio su sangre como compr\u00f3 \u00e9l la de la iglesia y ahora su bautismo de fuego la limpia de todos los g\u00e9rmenes todas sus enfermedades todas las enfermedades incluso de todas las cosas espirituales las cuales son por medio de nosotros tambi\u00e9n lo hace la misma manera para prepararla para que Dios more en ella en esta gran edad que ha de venir la nueva tierra es la redime de la misma manera en que el redime a su pueblo y lo hace todo igual su plan de redenci\u00f3n Pues \u00e9l es el incambiable Dios siempre lo mismo en sus planes Cu\u00e1nto les he dicho antes y les he dado a conocer y por todas las edades que Dios no puede cambiar lo da a conocer en toda forma por medio lo mismo \u00e9l lo dio a conocer su primer mensaje en el mundo antidiluviano por medio de No\u00e9 El Profeta yo estaba hablando con un Amado hermano que est\u00e1 sentado presente conmigo Ahora ayer \u00e9l dijo una cosa que usted dijo hermano Brand que siempre me estremeci\u00f3 yo dije Qu\u00e9 es hermano y \u00e9l dijo Esto es lo que usted dijo y es verdad La minor\u00eda como un grupito va a ser salvado en los d\u00edas de la avenida y hablamos de como Jes\u00fas dijo estrecha es la puerta y angosto el camino y pocos ser\u00e1n los que la hayan ahora f\u00edjense la Biblia dice como fue en los d\u00edas de No\u00e9 en los cuales ocho personas fueron salvas salvadas por agua As\u00ed ser\u00e1 la avenida yo dije hermano usted solo capt\u00f3 \u00e9l dijo recuerde S\u00f3lo hay ocho personas all\u00ed dije usted solo capt\u00f3 la mitad del cuadro sin embargo no era un tipo del remanente que es llevado al otro lado no el grupo que fue trasladado no un solo hombre se fue en el rapto antes de que el diluvio llegara mostrando que la iglesia no entra en la tribulaci\u00f3n o ninguna cosa alrededor de ella Enoc fue trasladado un solo hombre o la iglesia puede ser una cantidad pero la novia Va a ser un grupo muy peque\u00f1o que constituir\u00e1 a la novia ahora la iglesia puede ser una gran cantidad pero la novia ven ustedes comparen ocho con uno ocho veces menos ser\u00e1 la novia que la iglesia y si el justo con dificultad se salva en donde aparecer\u00e1 el pecador y el imp\u00edo aquellos que saben que no lo deben hacer y siguen adelante y lo hacen de todas maneras aquellos que siguen las reglas de la denominaci\u00f3n en vez de la palabra d\u00f3nde van a aparecer sin embargo llamados cristianos tomando el nombre de Cristo ahora perfectamente No\u00e9 era un tipo de aquellos llevados al otro lado recuerden cuando no es sali\u00f3 estaba con \u00e9l el pecado todav\u00eda estaba all\u00e1 adentro el pecado pas\u00f3 al otro lado a trav\u00e9s del arca incredulidad duda pasaron al otro lado en el arca llevadas por encima del juicio pero no fue m\u00e1s alto que el arca el siglo adelante entrando la presencia de Dios pero No\u00e9 pas\u00f3 y sali\u00f3 y todav\u00eda hab\u00eda pecado tipo del Milenio de la condici\u00f3n del mundo El Milenio no es el fin de \u00e9l todav\u00eda habr\u00e1 tiempo despu\u00e9s del milenio El Milenio es un espacio de tiempo pero no la nueva tierra Claro que no f\u00edjense en eso llegaremos a eso despu\u00e9s de un rato vean la tierra redimida regresa a su due\u00f1o original de nuevo quit\u00f3 \u00e9l se la quit\u00f3 a Satan\u00e1s el jal\u00f3 quit\u00e1ndole la tierra a Satan\u00e1s as\u00ed como en los apart\u00f3 a ustedes de Satan\u00e1s as\u00ed como \u00e9l le quit\u00f3 la peque\u00f1a mujer junto al pozo a Satan\u00e1s estaba en pie el sacerdote pensaba que \u00e9l estaba con Dios \u00e9l no ten\u00eda nada ahora queremos tener esto bien claro As\u00ed que ahora observen Atentamente esta ense\u00f1anza hermano branhan dibuja en el tablero hace un dibujo ahora este aqu\u00ed aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 Dios Dios el cual es el eterno no hay otro sino \u00e9l pero en Dios ten\u00eda atributos ahora esto aqu\u00ed representa la palabra la palabra de Dios la cual se hizo carne y muri\u00f3 entre nosotros en la persona de Jes\u00fas ahora est\u00e9 aqu\u00ed este hombre Aqu\u00ed vamos a hacer as\u00ed ahora Esta es llamada la mujer junto al pozo Este es el sacerdote fariseo y donde ustedes ven esto el pizarr\u00f3n libre quiere decir gracias y salvaci\u00f3n para en el principio era el verbo ya que el verbo fue hecho carne y habit\u00f3 entre nosotros las tres etapas era un atributo primero estaba en Dios que \u00e9l pens\u00f3 acerca de s\u00ed mismo como ser humano y eso lo transmiti\u00f3 a \u00e9l abajo para ser Jes\u00fas y ahora si ustedes van a estar all\u00ed alguna vez ustedes estaban con \u00e9l Entonces en ese entonces porque solo hay una forma de vida eterna esa es Dios y ustedes ten\u00edan que formar parte de Dios en el principio no no que ustedes simplemente lo escogieron aqu\u00ed abajo \u00e9l los escogi\u00f3 a ustedes todo lo que el padre me ha dado vendr\u00e1 para Miren a este sacerdote aqu\u00ed encontramos su parte inferior aqu\u00ed su vida atr\u00e1s Detr\u00e1s de \u00e9l su predestinaci\u00f3n aqu\u00ed atr\u00e1s es pecaminosa Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el infierno aqu\u00ed abajo ahora esta peque\u00f1a parte aqu\u00ed que se parece al pizarr\u00f3n eso representa su pureza \u00e9l era un sacerdote era un hombre honorable eso represent\u00f3 esto \u00e9l era tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda que ser un buen hombre o no pod\u00eda ser sacerdote pero ustedes ven como lo obten\u00eda era un aprendizaje intelectual ahora esta peque\u00f1a mujer su primera vida aqu\u00ed arriba Ella era una prostituta estaba toda manchada pero muy adentro de ella aqu\u00ed hab\u00eda solo un poquito de entendimiento s\u00e9 que cuando El Mes\u00edas venga eso estaba all\u00ed f\u00edjense cuando Jes\u00fas vino y manifest\u00f3 la palabra porque la palabra discerni\u00f3 los pensamientos que estaban en el coraz\u00f3n como hebreos dice que lo va a hacer 4 12 que lo har\u00e1 lo har\u00eda la palabra discerni\u00f3 los pensamientos del coraz\u00f3n y \u00e9l vino como el hijo del hombre el profeta Qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 este sacerdote con solo aprendizaje intelectual dijo Es un demonio porque eso es lo que su denominaci\u00f3n lo llam\u00f3 Qu\u00e9 hizo eso \u00e9l no ten\u00eda representaci\u00f3n As\u00ed que lo entenebreci\u00f3 pero esta mujercita no ten\u00eda nada que presentar ella estaba tan inmunda y sucia m\u00e1s no poder pero f\u00edjense muy dentro de ella Ella ten\u00eda representaci\u00f3n Ven y adem\u00e1s ella estaba esperando que esto se hiciera carne y cuando \u00e9l dijo voy a traer a tu marido y ven ac\u00e1 \u00e9l dijo se\u00f1or no tengo hijos dicho la verdad porque tiene cinco y el que tienes ahora no es tuyo has tenido cinco con esto es un seis que has tenido Ella dijo se\u00f1or No t\u00fa eres t\u00fa no eres Nobel seg\u00fan me parece que t\u00fa eres profeta ahora sabemos que El Mes\u00edas llamado el Cristo vendr\u00e1 y cuando \u00e9l venga \u00e9l va a hacer esto \u00e9l dijo Yo soy ya no tuvo vida uno no tuvo que explicarlo ya lo vio y ya lo crey\u00f3 y se fue por qu\u00e9 Qu\u00e9 le hizo a ella la redimi\u00f3 ahora f\u00edjense el vino para hacer un Redentor es correcto eso qu\u00e9 quiere decir redimir traer del regreso porque no tom\u00f3 al sacerdote \u00e9l nunca estuvo all\u00e1 arriba ven \u00e9l no ten\u00eda representaci\u00f3n \u00e9l vino a redimir lo que hab\u00eda ca\u00eddo en la ca\u00edda esto se enred\u00f3 con aquella muchacha pero Dios la ten\u00eda en su pensamiento antes de la fundaci\u00f3n del mundo y el vino para limpiarla Entonces ella ten\u00eda vida eterna Am\u00e9n donde al sacerdote Qu\u00e9 le hizo a \u00e9l lo envi\u00f3 directamente regreso a su destino para comenzar \u00e9l no ten\u00eda nada solo un aprendizaje intelectual ahora escuche amigo si lo \u00fanico que usted tiene solo es un aprendizaje intelectual tenga algo diferente a eso y usted nunca va a poder obtenerlo A menos que usted tenga representaci\u00f3n por esa raz\u00f3n Creo que ustedes vienen del este y del oeste del norte y del sur la palabra viviente manifestada f\u00edjense ahora como el da a conocer su camino por medio de sus profetas en el principio nunca lo ha cambiado su salvaci\u00f3n el justific\u00f3 un hombre lo santific\u00f3 dio el esp\u00edritu santo y fuego y a fuego hizo salir de \u00e9l el pecado y habit\u00f3 en \u00e9l mismo \u00e9l hace con la tierra la cual va a usar en el plan de redenci\u00f3n de la misma manera se arrepinti\u00f3 y fue bautizada en agua en por No\u00e9 Jes\u00fas vino y la santific\u00f3 al derram\u00f3 derramar su sangre sobre ella y la reclam\u00f3 y en la nueva tierra que ha de venir ha de tener un bautismo de fuego Santo para limpiarla de todo demonio todo germen toda enfermedad todo lo que hay y hacerla de nuevo vi un cielo nuevo y una tierra nueva no llega a ser una nueva persona Am\u00e9n no solo una vieja persona parchada por medio de unirse a una iglesia o tratar de voltear una nueva p\u00e1gina sino que uno es una unidad completamente nueva Dios toma el viejo hombre y lo quema totalmente con el esp\u00edritu santo y fuego y viene el mismo env\u00eda la representaci\u00f3n de uno ninguno puede venir a m\u00ed si mi padre no lo ha tra\u00eddo todo lo que el padre me ha dado vendr\u00e1 a m\u00ed mismo plan la misma manera Satan\u00e1s fue ser\u00e1 quitado de la tierra exactamente como Satan\u00e1s fue quitado de ustedes no puede molestar o \u00e9l puede tentar pero \u00e9l no puede tomar a un cristiano nacido de nuevo pues Dios desde la fundaci\u00f3n del mundo lo vio De antemano y envi\u00f3 a Jes\u00fas a redimirlo y la sangre Habla por \u00e9l C\u00f3mo puede pecar \u00e9l cuando ni siquiera puede ser visto por Dios ni siquiera lo \u00fanico que \u00e9l oye es la voz de ustedes el vela
