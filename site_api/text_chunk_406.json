the message of the hour it has saved our lives brought us out of darkness into a marvelous light do you appreciate it this morning with all your heart certainly we should a man I listened to a tape just a little bit ago brother Branham talked about a young man that had never got to see the ocean in his life and he was so excited so just overwhelmed the fact that he was gonna get to visit the ocean and he was walking along the shore getting ready to go down to the ocean he met an old man and the old man said son where are you going he said I'm gonna get to see the ocean for the first time in my whole life I'm so excited the old man he said I've sailed the seas I've seen this ocean my whole life I don't see nothing to get excited about brother Branham said the reason he didn't is because he had got used to it now I want to say that just to say this you and me as Christians as individual servants of the Lord we don't want to never just get too used to it his presence and his his Spirit coming in our midst that is a treasure that is a treasure don't let us none of us ever and I'm not saying we will and pray to God we won't but don't let us never just get used to use to it because it is so sweet and so precious it ought to be sweet to us every time we enter these walls we're gonna get to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to get to sit together in heavenly places with God's people this is an opportunity a lot of people would die for today let's give our Lord Jesus a real good hand type of praise if you this morning everybody that lives around us very

God is so good to us I'm gonna let you be CD for just a bit while we look at her prayer requests this morning brother West you've done a great job for us last night I want to say thank you daddy thank you for being obedient to the Lord and well God is just so so good to his church he is so good to us this is from brother Joel Moyer the family there in Ohio the rescue that we would continue remember them in prayer concerning court dates that the Lord would just intervene the state don't get custody of their children the attorneys they're asking that we would just pray on that behalf that the Lord would intervene and let everything work out according to his divine purpose we believe he's able to do that don't we amen when continue to remember brother Donnie in prayer this morning he's about the same this morning and believing God for complete healing also brother Don and sister Carol want to thank everyone for their prayers so let's pray for our pastor and his wife this morning that the Lord would just touch him let him let him be alright I know God God is able to do that and Satan likes nothing better than to throw a servant of God on the shelf and put him out of commission but I'm gonna tell you he don't have enough sense to know that while he's out of commission there's golden nuggets dropping into his heart that's gonna bless the children of God so we we know that we know that something good will come out of something bad don't we man but the key straighter is having an echocardiogram on Tuesdays wearing a heart monitor and they're asking that we would remember him in prayer as we pray today one remember sister Christine Baker in prayer having severe pain in her neck this morning so let's just remember her as we pray want to want to pray for brother Frank Williams this morning also his daughter daily both are very sickening the healing touch so let's remember those folks as we pray and I believe that's all of our our written request all the in spoken prayer requests if you have a need something you'd like for this group to pray about we're serving a prayer answering God and we know that we continue to believe that I told you last night the Lord has touched my body and I want to and thank him for it he just he pestered us to death but he's knows he's got a little time to work on us and the old burger man he likes to take his shots at God's people but I'm gonna tell you something we get we guess the Fargo that and we just eventually go on out of this world look what's waiting on us look what's waiting now it's brother gene good to see you in the service today praying for sister Jane gonna continue to pray for they may give him a nice hand this morning and we continue to pray for her brother Daniel no knees still I guess in the hospital not for sure but want to pray for a brother the day you know how to some complications different things so let's remember that brother Keith Phillips brother Eugene Kennedy won't remember those folks in prayer as we pray today let's stand if you will let me let me make these announcements as we get ready to pray over the needs today by the West if you just come get ready to pray this morning but the West wanted me to make this announcement please be here no later than 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday for the bus to the Louisiana camp we will go over bus and camp rules at that time so remember if you're going to Louisiana can't be here Wednesday no later than 5:00 p.m. so can can you remember that we would certainly appreciate you also there'll be no service here Wednesday night because of the youth that's gonna be leaving going to camp so we want to we want just as we pray we want to pray for the success of the camp the success of our young people and all those other young people that will be joining the ministers and just pray that God will give them a great great reviving in their spirits and in their hearts when welcome to the service today the Duke family from Indiana would you just raise your hand wherever you're at somebody help me find them give them a good hand this morning god bless you so glad to have you here this morning also brother Brian Taylor a longtime streamer from the state of Alabama he's visited with us again this morning going to be giving us the song just a little bit and looking forward to that so we're just we've got a lot going on here this morning brother West come this morning take us to the Lord in prayer as we pray appreciate our brother don't leave Amen we love you buddy real quick before before we go to the Lord in prayer there's one rule for the camp that I need to go over really quick in case somebody hasn't prepared properly in years past you know there's dress code rules and everything we want to we want to look out for the safety and the modesty of our of our sisters and brothers when they go to camp and and there's always a few who go down there you know that the Lord hasn't really dealt with yet and he usually deals with them when they're down there though but there's a you know always somebody that just kind of wants to push the envelope a little bit and because of that sometimes the rules have to seem a little bit too the stricter side and some of the sisters had been going in in Tom's Paston and maybe wearing leggings to account for a skirt that was a little too short and wasn't quite modest enough so they they have had to make a rule that there's no leggings in order to ensure that the skirts would be long enough because they're looking out for the holiness of the of our sisters and and their and you know trying to protect them and they're also you know trying to look out for the the Spirit that we bring in among us when we're when we're worshiping there at the camp we wanted to be the Holy Ghost we don't want it to be a religious spirit or something like that we want to be the Holy Ghost and so this is a protection and holiness is is something you know that the people of God are known for so we you know a lot of people may be concerned you know about about not using the leggings or like well that you know as an extra layer of protection you know if they were to fall down or or something like that well that they're just wanting to ensure that the skirts are long enough to protect our sisters without having the need for leggings so that's why they're outlawed completely and I wouldn't want somebody to get down there and they brought a bunch and and they're not prepared and then they get embarrassed we just wouldn't want that you know so that's why I have to make this announcement but other than that the rules are all the same and we'll go over them we have several visitors coming with us and riding on the bus so we'll go over the rules and stuff that's that's not changed all those are about the same and we never have an issue with that anyway we always have the the best and young people in the world by far and I'm so proud of them and I don't want it to seem when we talk about rules and stuff I don't want to seem like we have young people that are rebellious or hard-hearted or anything these are the finest in the world and that adds the truth I'm not to say that cuz I love them okay let's let's go to the Lord in prayer father I thank you so much for the body of believers across the whole world Lord I can feel us growing closer together in your in your love Lord and in your presence daily I can feel us just getting closer and closer to you Lord there's there several prayer requests here our pastor is still laying in his sickbed Lord and Lord we know that he is already healed we know that everyone who submitted a prayer request to appear today in faith Lord is already healed father we're speaking to the the lying symptoms that are coming against him and we're rebuking them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're believing together as the body of Christ as the the broad of the Lord Jesus here on the earth we're believing Lord as we lay these at your feet that we can fully trust you to do away with these symptoms and to restore each one to health and to raise them up Lord you said you would do it and we believe it and that's something that we're not going to back down from we're not going to turn and run Lord but we're going to stand boldly in the face of Satan and we're going to say you don't have a chance you don't have a chance when you come against this broad because our groom is our protector and he is the greatest of all the hast of all and there is no name higher than that of the Lord Jesus Christ we worship You Lord we love you Lord we feel the dearness of your spirit as it draws in we feel the heat of your conviction Lord in our hearts and we thank you for it because that's love too and Lord Jesus we just thank you for your word we thank you for the servant who's back there and who's prepared and studied to bring the word to us today Lord and we're looking forward to how you're going to speak through that man and talk to our hearts today and and take us one step closer to the rapture father that's what we want we want to this place one step closer we don't want to leave here the same as we came in or worse than we came in but we want to leave here Lord closer to you father we love you with all of our heart I ask that you you have the freedom to walk in among this Lord as we open our hearts to you today Lord we're going to trust that you you have got something special we're never going to walk into this this service not expecting Lord we're expecting great things we're looking forward to them we know that it's going to happen we don't wonder or hope but we know that it's going to happen when you're on the scene Lord when you come in among us we invite you Father and want to make you welcome and Lord for those who are suffering and pain with these symptoms we ask you now father as we agree Lord we ask you to lift those symptoms and set them free in Jesus name we pray amen an offering you give us unto the Lord you're visiting with us today in the service we want to welcome you glad to have all of you here those that are streaming we pray this service will be a great blessing to those folks

[Music] I kind of like that don't I make you want to go home there's just something about the Lord Jesus that he has a pool that he wants us to be with him when you think about in Jesus prayer as I've said so many times but I like that he always you know not my will but dime be doing he came to do the will of the Father but he asked one thing the only thing in his prayer John's 1724 think it is he said I will that where I am there you may be also he only asked one thing that's all they ever asked a father for one thing and that's your fellowship that's that's wonderful that's wonderful I appreciate him well praise the Lord we're get to go back to church amen and I'm really thankful that I get to go back to church I mean you know I could be in a pine box somewhere you know but the Lord just been real good to me and appreciate again all the prayers and the cards and and and it's just been in the hand of the Lord you know I haven't had any really roadblocks setbacks no flu no pneumonia just it's just been really hard to just you know you just can't use your arms you just can't you know for the first six eight weeks you know I also had to kind of tie me down just don't do nothing you know but I'm getting a little bit of freedom now I can do a little bit Jim but as Jim Babb called me this morning he said brother Terry said I don't want you to be jumping off a platform just just go up there and just teach real quietly and you'll be okay I said I'm not making no promises but brotherwe actually did real good last night we appreciate that thank you I've had several people to ask me when you're gonna preach again on Israel I've got some more good things on this show but I've got to go as the Lord leads so what we have this morning is more important in Israel this is you that's you amen if you want to go home we want to go get ready to go home so actually I'm gonna preach this morning a little titled and we'll call it rapture ready but so well if you say I have wonderful rapture ready I mean he's going to preach he's going to teach us he's going to give us some deep revelation about the mystery of the seals of the thunders of the pools or some deep mysterious dark something other we've never heard before now I'm not going to tell you anything like that what I'm going to teach you this morning tell you this morning is why you don't have the Holy Ghost why you don't have the Holy Ghost those that who you don't have it they said well is anybody oh you know oh yeah yeah and why why is it so hard for people that struggle to get the Holy Ghost we're going to we're going to uncover the the issue by the grace of God okay because it's got it needs to be exposed and listen I'm I'm not a real smart man I've been a Christian about 44 years I've been in a message about 35 years I'm not a pro not an expert I'm not a theologian but I have been around the block a few times I know a little bit about what I'm talking about and I have actually been studying on this thought for for some time and just for the proper time to bring and what to say and trying to bring a composite of a lot of different things dealing with the Holy Ghost you can go if you have it listen you preach to message of what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for December 1959 whew the second one especially of what does the Holy Ghost given for if you haven't listed that one a long time go back and listen to it especially if there's any question your mind or anybody anybody it's very good young people it's very good turn with me to acts 19 verse 1 and 2 and this is that this scripture here is course a very familiar scripture but I want to try to even the scripture 7 bring out something that would provoke a little fault if we could x19 verse 1 and verse 2 now you ready to have church alright okay if you pull I'll try not to behave I won't be responsive acts 19 verse 1 now acts 19 was written of course about Luke and it was written about ad 58 okay so that's about 25 28 29 years since John the Baptist so listen and it came to pass that koala Paulus was at Corinth Paul of course you know during Paul's time Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples now they're not sinners they're disciples and he says certain disciples so that mean they were just that wasn't every disciple is up there but just certain ones and so it probably wasn't a great big group with just certain disciples as I said this was probably maybe 25 to 28 years after John the Baptist and he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and he said unto them we've been in the message for 10 years and don't even know if we got the Holy Ghost [Applause] did I read that right oh I did I did have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed or you say well I that was just for those in the upper coasts of Ephesus back that no no no no have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed actually this question is actually more needed today and I think it was back then I mean you know there were just certain disciples I mean look look I mean look at the young people that was that are raised in the message raising the message you know it's a real it's a it's a real struggle for young people because the race had a message now like my wife and I and many of you older people we actually were revelations 18:4 come out of her we were kicked out denomination we we heard the Eagle scream we was literally forced kicked out those raised in the message to them this is until they get a revelation this is just religion that's all it is I mean well we God sent a prophet wait you know it's a special but until you get a revelation it's just religion I don't care it doesn't you have to understand it's just religion it's no more than Methodists Baptists or nobody else unless you get a revelation because you're not going to go in old mom and daddy so it's it's really more needful today have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed and what about people playing I'm playing Church I'm just gonna I'm not gonna pull any punches today okay I'm just gonna this is what the Lord laid on my heart and I'm gonna deliver it what about people leaving the message thought that that had to hold a ghost you you can't leave the message and how the Holy Ghost now they thought they had it I don't care if he's raised in this whatever have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we're thankful for the reading of the word well thankful Lord that this scripture was put in here Lord they're just so abundance amount of thoughts and revelations it'll take eternity for you to to really reveal yourself to us that we might further know you and we'll never would never learn at all but Lord while we're here give us a little bit more understanding today hide me behind the cross Lord may you speak I've got some note scriptures and quotes here but I pray that you'll bring out the understanding give sense to the reading of the word may you know what the people to receive Lord and I thank you for healing my body so many times thank you so many times for healing my body and you've healed it many times but I really have thanked you so much and I appreciate it watch over us today bless our pastors strengthen him sister Carol give them grace today maybe when we leave the service for sake we can say it's been good to be in the house of God grant these things Lord we asking the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen you can be seated well the greatest experience a human being can have is receive a new birth not only says the greatest but it's the most important and it will absolutely absolutely will change a person's nature and it's actually a miracle if you could take a any kind of an animal you know a whole you and actually could change him to be a sheep which obviously we can't do that but if you could how can you take the nature of an end of that animal and make it a completely different nature but that's what God has done for us we were actually just animal beat groupies you know with it with a snake nature of follow nature and God changed that nature and make a totally different nature a christ-like nature I mean he changed our whole nature our focus our attitude our desires our speech our behavior outlook our disposition oh everything's been changed by numerous that's a miracle that's miraculous that God could do that for me and you and change our nature to make us wrap to really and to go in the rapture you must have the holy no option about it all the way those who have the Holy Ghost goes in a rapture and somebody said if you if if you not beat on the pulpit you probably will save your sternum bone there you probably won't break it if you just try not to beat the pulpit - I'm making no promises we must have the Holy Ghost without the holy goat listen without the Holy go where we are today so close to the rapture without the Holy Ghost you're headed for either the tribulation are you lost I mean what are the option you got those virgins remember the foolish virgins brother may have said they all thought they was under the blood but they weren't under the blood but they thought that they were so unless you're a sinner today and you know everybody in this building some have the Holy Ghost some don't have those goals it goes but unless you're sinner everybody thinks they have the Holy Ghost is this an important important subject and yet still I hear it often how do I know when I get it or how what will I do how will I act how how will I know I still hear that you know I'm still not sure that I have it so let's by God's grace try to at least settle that part of it this morning okay and worse than that worse than that there's some people that actually think that they have the Holy Ghost and don't have the Holy Ghost I say old brothers Harry don't don't tell me that mean that there's been at least a one preacher standing right here in this pulpit left the message we thought he had the Holy Ghost but probably been others people leave the message they don't have the Holy Ghost been around the message for years how many people who assumed they had to hold a ghost and left a message here's let's look at this first quote what the holy ghost what is the holy ghost upon this upon this place we wish you approach the subject now think is the outstanding subject of today what is the Holy Ghost what is it and now the reason I have taken these subject like this and you cannot and you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you know what you've got it got when you get it and that would settle it okay in the token message now we read that acts 19 one and two have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now in the token 147 now the Spirit is a token you should be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a rushing mighty wind now listen to this next part that was the theme of every apostle that was have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed many I'm was baptized by John or under John's ministry 25 or 28 years before that but the question was many of the disciples have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed on the Lord Jesus amen now brother man preach what is the Holy Ghost 1959 and what is it given for but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you just about a two minute synopsis on what it is but then we want to go more into what I did how do you know what defects does that have and so forth and so on okay now and Luke 24:49 Jesus told them go to you up the city of Jerusalem and and tarry until they receive power he didn't explain it he didn't hit tell him how long he would be there he said you just go there and wait and tail now that's very important wait and tail well you say after I come to the altar or wherever I give my heart to Lord how long will it be I don't know but you just wait until it's just got to be on tail there's no set amount of time it's just a tail but there's some reasons why it has to go until a further until and he says what is the Holy Ghost we found that what the Holy Ghost is it's a sign the chillness will we're given a seal of circumcision a sign it's a seal piece of 430 grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you're sealed it's the Spirit of Christ in you that I'll be with you even in you it's a comforter I pray that followed he'll give you another comforter it's an advocate any man sin we have an advocate with the father it's our rest coming to me all your heavy and are heavy laden and I will give you a rest and then it's power you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost will come upon you and now I just preaching the sermon or what is the Holy Ghost all those things that's what it that's what it is but you know it's also it's kind of like you know what it is these five or six things and it's more than that also but also one place brother Branham he talks about Holy Ghost it's kind of like electricity he said nobody knows yet what electricity is we can harness it we can see the fix a light bulb we can see the effects of a motor we can see the effects of your stove in your house whatever you conceive the effects of electricity but you tell me what it is what you say well it's current below what is current well it runs through the wire well I can't see what is electricity well I'll tell you one thing you might not can tell me what it is but when you get a hole in wires you know you got it [Applause] so it's good that you know what the Holy Ghost is but you better know if you got it that's the main thing so don't forget about that maybe maybe it's like electricity but maybe I can teach that to what it is but when you when it bites you you know it when it bites you you know it I mean they're being bit by electricity most of you mmm yeah yeah if you do it too didn't you amen you know we know what it is but now I want to ask here's the big question for those who don't have it for those who not sure that they have it and maybe for those that think they got it and really don't have it maybe you ought to think about that and then for those who do have it maybe it would be a confirmation my big question is if you don't have the Holy Ghost you want the Holy Ghost how bad do you want it how badly do you want the Holy Ghost well they say all brother Terry more than anything in the world really really how bad did the rich young ruler won't eternal life how bad did he want eternal life well to a point to a point but really that's your answer there there is rub Donna just preached here recently price and value you may think you mourn it more than anything but really how much do you really really want it leadership and he refused to be called the son of speaking of Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed their approach to Christ greater treasure than all the riches of the world he esteemed that watch what he done he followed up quickly he was cuss out stood out by his people the people that once loved him it might cost you everything you got it might cost you your home it might cost you your friendship it might cost you your stitching so party it might cost you your place in the kiwanis it might I don't know what it'll cost you but it'll cost you everything that's worldly or pertains to the world I can tell you that I don't know what it'll cost you but it's going to cost everybody something you say well it's a free gift it's true it it's a free gift you cannot purchase with a price of works that gift it is a free gift you can't buy it but you have to surrender to get it it'll cost you everything that's worldly or pertains to the world you'll have to separate yourself from everything that's worldly you have to do it now that's really that's one of the key things right there while many people don't receive the Holy Ghost you're not you have it really and then we're going to get into that a little bit more but as we just lay a foundation thing about this yeah I'm willing to get everything up really really if you don't have it and you're thirsting for it and it's for you it shows you there's something wrong somewhere it's not God Moses laid aside everything Moses laid everything aside and went to the desert with a stick in his hand amen days after days passed and wonder if he thought he made a mistake not many times people start out and say oh I'll do it glory to God I see it let somebody laughing you make fun of it well maybe probably I was wrong how badly do you want it well it's kind of like the little story of the chicken in the hall no no if you've ever heard a little story but the chicken in the hall was kind of going along one day and they saw that sign a sign out there and it said ham and egg breakfast and so you know ham and egg breakfast you don't ham an egg the chicken and the hog to help the war effort and the Hogs head to the chicken you know for you it's only a sacrifice but for me it's a total commitment you're gonna have ham that's a total commitment the chicken laying egg that's just how bad do you want it that's the quiz how bad do you want it your salvation is a free gift that's true but it costs you everything that's worldly to get it I'd like to think about this for a minute the and I'm just going to read this white quickly think about this the the guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier what he's his life and his discipline what he's willing to give up just for that position all they get is a wreath and they're part of an elite group being the guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier but this is what he has to his discipline his sacrifice he must be between 510 and 62 tall and weigh sighs cannot exceed thirty inches of the requirements of the guard he must commit two years of life to guard tomb living the barracks underneath the tomb cannot drink any alcohol or owner off duty for the rest of the lives they cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives cannot disgrace the uniform or the tomb in any way after two years the guard has given a wreath pen that is worn on the lapel signifying they served as the guard of the tomb there are only four hundred presently worn the guard must obey these rules for the rest of the lives will give up the wreath pen the shoes are specially made for very thick with very thick thick soles to keep the heat and cold from their feet remember this is 360 24/7 they guard the tomb there are no wrinkles folks lint on the uniformed guards dressed for duty in front of a full-length mirror first six months of duty guard cannot talk to anyone to watch TV all off-duty Thomas Pitt studying 175 notable people laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery the guard must memorize who they are and where they're interred every guard must spend five hours a day getting his uniform ready for guard duty he's willing to do that just to be a 2-year assignment to be a guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier what are you willing to give up and what would be discipline of your life just to receive eternal life how much is it worth to you is that where separation is a worth giving up everything is it worth that kind of a separation from the world is it worth that kind of a life to be able to to be different to be not like the world to be an oddball to the world is it worth like that you remember this is we're a royal priesthood we're a different people to procure you people did it we're talking about Bryden we're talking about bride members we're talking about a bride condition word bride and still we wonder why so many people struggle with even the Holy Ghost and why many even for weeks or months or years Wow my Wow Wow listen I don't want to hurt you but I want to tell you the truth brother I'm sitting in trial Tucson he said sometimes he lingers as he did in the night to Noah as he did in the days of Moses he did in all days but he never told the Pentecostal people go you up in the city of Jerusalem Jerusalem in 24 hours I give you the Holy Ghost he never said that they didn't have any idea they didn't even know what it was going to get they just said I'm on you until you be endued with power that's all they told him and he said tarry there until you've been in dude with power from on high he never said one day to day ten days he said stay until your endued with power Lord they stayed there until the evidence spoke back through them that was the Holy Ghost of God they stayed there until so that's the key on tale but that's not all the key I want you to understand something about acts 2:38 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Mists of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I don't know if you've ever seen this quote before but I want you to think about this patmans vision I was in the spirit it isn't it just beautiful my love that could you just you could just call those words a hold of the Christian life if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in his his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these fishes it had to be in the Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of God with us too all of our efforts are in vain Paul said our pray in the spirit i'll seen the sphere i'll live in the sphere if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the words made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit holy spirit to receive these tremendous revelations from jesus fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for the same spirit remember even faith is a revelation you got to have faith to be saved and even that's the revelation paragraph 44 look at it this way Oh too many read the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on think about I want you to think about this quote they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then God will be duty-bound to fill his word fulfilled his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost they never get in his spirit the Holy Spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says they never get into his spirit pray to God for revelation by his Spirit that's the first step why is it and I baptizing many young people and that's all good and I will continue to do that but why is it I'm just playing okay I'm just playing why is it a lot of young people to baptize young why is it - 15 20 years later go back out in the world whatever to come back and then they want to get rebaptised and then later on then to get the Holy Ghost why I mean there's a reason why when we read the scripture repent be baptized the name of Jesus Christ from it and you see it's like we we want to thank well you're going to get it and within 5 minutes it doesn't say that it doesn't say that don't read that into it you could you could but most time they don't come that way and especially in Laodicea and there's reasons why and Laodicea there's so much pull of the world how badly do you want it it's for you and if your seed you're going to get in some time but why wait till you're 90 years old he told him to tarry Jerusalem but just wait Intel and first you know now he told that whole group and you know he didn't tell him how long he didn't tell him how long the way but he told that whole group was at 500 whoever it was to go up the city of Jerusalem but only 120 obeyed what happened to the others only 120 obeyed not everybody obeys which brings us to another subject about this did the rich young ruler obey no no said go sell if you had don't label Warren it quite that bad did the Pharisees obey no did Judas obey no do the foolish over to foolish virgins obey they thought they were but no acts 5:29 then Peter and the other apostles answer said we ought to obey God rather than man the God of my father's raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be Prince and to be Savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins verse 32 and we are his witnesses of these sayings and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey so there's something you got to do has nothing to do with the purchase price of salvation that's a free gift but remember the Lambs wife hath made herself ready you've got to do something you got to do something rest your life you've got it you have you've got to stay surrender to the ones you see you got the soul is burst into the New Kingdom you got ten outlets that's against you they're not born again see taste feel smell hear constant reason it matters a memory affection they're all against you they're not born again they're not redeemed they are against you so your souls got to tell the spirit what to do the spirits got to tell the flesh what to do and they all are rebelling against the soul because they're not redeemed so you it's one against ten which one's gonna win he gives the Holy Ghost it was given to them that obey know what about that wonder why you haven't received the Holy Ghost it's certainly not God's fault so it has to be your fault somewhere because if you have that thirst in your seat you're going to get some time the token jeffersonville all little people my brother's sister get under that token quickly see don't take no substitute don't don't don't don't don't do that see don't just imagine you stay there and tell you know that the token is applied until you're a whole the mind that was in crisis in you until all the nonsense of the world is gone see until the whole hearts desire is him see there then then you know then you know something is happening there's got to be a death [Music] [Applause] you say well you know too many people that fall short they never truly fully sincerely repent that's the most critical thing I want to touch on that again remember I brought it out here several months ago but I want to touch on just a little short part of it John come preach and repent us for the kingdom of heaven his hand Jesus preached repentance for the kingdom of heaven his hand Peter preached for repentance repentance it's a it's a prepares is a process of death repent means to turn around about-face you're going this way now you going this way you're going this way now you turn around go this way it's a process of if you must be born again progressed 67 yes to be born again you must go through a process of death you mean you you actually have to die what part of you dies that old snake nature that's inside of years old that snake Nature has got to die you just can't put it on herself that nature must die go back and listen invincible using again one of the most beautiful message listened to invisible Union one more time he said you just can't divorce that you just can't put it on yourself that first husband must die absolutely die you to be born again you must go through a process of death everything does from a grain of see a whole nature dance burial resurrection core never expects to live again it's got to die first if a grain of we never expect to live again it's totally impossible that corn that sweet that flower that tree that grass that virtually everything that expects to live again must first die then how you how are you going to escape it you've got to die first you've got to die die out to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can never again I know most all the young people over here and probably on the internet and wherever it doesn't matter it's got to be a death oh I'm willing to do that know you if you know if you've been seeking for months and months and months and months it's something if something's not dead yet something's not dead yet what kind of life do you live I brotherwe said we got that we got the that the cream of the cobble Eve that you come to church but we're talking about we're talking about receiving the Holy Ghost that's the Lambs wife that's those that he has chosen that's going to live in this city be in the millennium reign with him that's that's his sweetheart he ain't gonna pick no further he ain't gonna take no harlot he's not going to take no ill Fame he's not going to take just somebody today dating he's going to be is going to marry a real real woman a real mature lady the Lambs wife that's why you got to die first he said it three times and that you must die well you say well I just changed my mind that's why you got to change your mind but you've got to die and God will change not only your mind but it's changed your nature but they just don't want to die you know listen Jesus died for you now you must die for him you got to die to your first nature into your worldly desires and all that stuff Jesus died to make away now you've got to you got to die to receive that way as we said all I follow that same pattern death burial resurrection all life all nature death burial resurrection everywhere John 12:24 verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit all nature we're the same way long as that seed stays in a in a seed package somewhere you can have a little seed package of daffodils or whatever you know marigolds they might stay in that package 500 years if they don't get wet if their German bow ties but they gonna bring they're not gonna produce no life they got to be put in the right kind of better ground and they got a dying right then it can bring forth life amen that's right entail this place in the good ground it cannot and die and rot it can never bring forth life and you must be born again Jeff paragraph 73 you see what I mean now you are dead our souls are placed upon the divine judgment that's brass when our souls is placed upon an altar divine judgment what was the penalty death now even what I'm covering right now this is so important well I I have died really why is you had wise some of you - some of you live a questionable life you shouldn't say things like that it's it's it is what it is you're you are dead our souls are placed upon His divine judgment that's brass when our souls are placed upon the altar demands of what was the penalty death and when you lay yourself upon the altar of God which is pronounced death upon the sinner how can you raise from there alive in sin if God hasn't accepted the sacrifice is that clear now you die you actually are consumed and you're petrified there's no more left to you but just this form that you're standing in like the brass serpent like Christ was when he took his took him dead and cold off the clothes you're dead cause why your own God's altar of judgment what was his judgment when the judge surpasses the sentence what the sentence of this penalty was death you say well you're really laboring on death it's got to be that way you've got to die to receive life you've got to die you've got to run you've got to be willing to give up everything it's unlike Christ I don't care if you're 40 years old I don't give you 50 years old I don't care if you've been in the message 30 years as I say it there's many of middle aged and older people this fell away from the message they didn't have the Holy Ghost so don't tell me just because you're old everybody's got and everybody ain't got it they shouldn't you shouldn't preach today I want to preach I want I want you to make it we are so close brother sister listen there's no need to be playing Church you must be born again paragraph 76 now your soul is laid upon the altar of God's breast judgment then God receives it now it shows that you haven't received it it if you're still alive in the world God never took it now you people talking about getting the Holy Ghost and how you have to wait so long here you are until God receives that sacrifice you have to wait so long here it is until God receives that sacrifice until it's late on his judgments there until his judgment has actually killed her senses killed your senses did you hear what I said killed your senses your five senses your 10 senses you might say well I'm going to turn a new page that ain't it well I know I used to smoke I'm going to quit that still isn't in and tell God Racine's that sacrifice on his brass altar the altar of judgment what is this judgment death that's the penalty the soul that sinneth that remaineth in that shield I don't care what you've done like Abraham until he had fully separated from light and unbelief and all doubt then God gave him the seal of circumcision that he had received his faith he had to separate he had to separate God receive Abraham's faith then he give him to the seal of circumcision brother man said in future home who said you don't accept God God accepts you because it's his attributes God's got to accept you what the parties got to accept is your faith because you have to have faith your faith has got to be a revelation that I am willing to die and surrender and dream transformed that's why maybe Jesus said to his disciples do you now believe after all this time do you now believe the seeds helpers instigated the enemy paragraph 31 now when we received Christ our Savior then if we're sincere in that then oh oh yeah it's up there then if we're sincere in that then if he put it if they're in sincerity Then There is obviously a possibility the person cannot be sincere there is a possibility then if we're sincere that then God gives us a sign that heareth has received our faith in Christ by giving us the seal of circumcision which is a Holy Ghost it was a natural back their spiritual today that's the seal of circumcision grieve not the host fear of God whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption not to the next meeting but to the day of your Redemption that's right feasting for 30 now that's how we receive the Holy Ghost 32 and now you say oh I'm a believer and gods never give you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognized it I told you it's not God's fault it's your fault he's never recognized your faith yet maybe your faith is not to that point maybe your revelation not to that point you say well I just can't live it no you can't but when you make up you well you got to really choose your words correctly because we're talking about election here God broods and God puts that desire in there and you you know if you if you're God's seed he's going to put that thirst is going to be there but you still have to do your part what and what how well at what point are you willing to say okay I'm ready God knows that what you point you ready well maybe you get baptized you know and you say I'm ready to die I want the Holy goes well what maybe even maybe maybe maybe you go back in for a couple of years you still kind of worldly well you see did that cult God catch God by surprise God already knew so it's gonna be two years he's going back into the world he knew you wasn't ready but see when God recognizes your faith and he knows you're ready then that's what it comes because he knows down the road he knows that you're going to be two years of five years or six months or twenty years he knows that but he's not going to he's not going to see all that and tell him until the point which he knows what point you're going to be ready he says which is okay we just skip on down to paragraph 32 and now oh you say you never give you the Holy Ghost yet he's just he's never recognized you're just confessing that you believe but when all the daily I'm not saying you're not a believer now in a certain portion you are believer but when God has found favor you have Fedor found favor with him rather and he recognizes you to be his child and he knows your heart and sees your sincerity sees your sincerity he knows all things are cut away from you then then he seals you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proving to the world that he accepted what faith you profess to have it have in him get it now so there's got to be the part that you've got to play you've got you have to have that sincerity he knows well not you're ready really ready to die he knows well maybe it's going to take two years three years five years hope it don't but he knows at what point is okay he's ready why didn't God give Abraham the seal of circumcision the first year that he called him he had to because he wasn't ready yet he goes down he goes down to career I'm not to career goes down to Egypt the first time fate Road lies about his wife and so forth it's on like that and we'll give it I'm gonna give you a little grace in just a minute I won't give you a little grace in just a minute brother we're talking about bride material I don't want to miss it I don't even want to be foolish virgin I believe I'm called to be bride now God never sent me no special delivery letter you know certified letter but I believe by my faith and by my testimony your brother Bev said by the word of your testimony he said your testimony is your Holy Ghost by your testimony it's a sign to the world that you've really got something I believe that I have the Holy Ghost a word birth on my soul I believe I've been transformed sealed into the Keen I don't want to miss it that's what it means to me we're talking about the Lambs wife his sweetheart not flirt his wife we're talking about a word bride we're talking about those who separated from the world and unbelief we're talking about those that are chosen and if you are chosen and you have a thirst for God and that thirst is in there which you know what a thirst is it's a painful desire for God a painful desire a thirst is a painful desire a real thirst if you've got a painful desire you're going to wait until until until whatever it don't matter how long until like the story it did whichever preacher that was he said I'm going to stay in this cornfield you'll find my bones in this cornfield if you don't were filled me with the Holy I'm staying here a tail it's got to be on tail there's no other way has got to be a tail if you really desire you'll give up everything this carnal that's not godly paragraph 27 once the Holy Ghost now there's a vast difference between just the Christians and the Holy Ghost field Christian now you're going to get this from the scripture and place it exactly in the scripture the first lay there is a Christian I profess to be Christian but if this this mission has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in the process of being a Christian see he is professed to believe it and he's working to it but God has not yet given him his spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God hasn't recognized yet this is not new material this is just the message have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed we've been in message 50 years have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed if not there's many people's been in the message for years that don't have the Holy Ghost we used to believe it if you could see the revelation of the seals and thunders and pools and this and that we used to believe that 30 years ago you got it you got the Holy Ghost and we found out that wasn't true brother it's the same thing brother man said well you said the the the Methodist we shouted they got up he said many didn't didn't have it well the Holy Ghost we spoke in tongues they said well we got it and many of you spoke in tongues it didn't have it you say I'm in the message the dependent me a lot of people say that in the message don't have it same thing bring it up to date remember the Holy Ghost is a sign it's a seal that's a comforter it's an advocate it is rest but remember when you talk about the seal let's talk about that just for a moment remember what brother been said about the boxcar oh the boxcar how many boxcars we got out here nobody won't raise it we got one to raise the Henry oh hi he sealed the boxcar are you a type of the boxcar he says that's what the matter we don't get sealed too much now what's this I didn't write it I'm just reading it per graphic that's what's the matter we don't get seals so much where's Toulouse about things when the inspector Oh who's inspector Holy Ghost when the inspector goes through and expects your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose in your prayer life a little loose about that temper a little loose about that tongue to talk on Facebook about others he'll never seal the car I didn't write that I'm just reading it how many believe it 73% how many believe it how many believe it the the inspectors going to expect the car before he seals the car right he'll never seal the car some dirty habits some vile things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car I'm telling you I'm teaching you I'm preaching you trying to show you why some people haven't received the Holy Ghost yet say I don't want to hear that what he gonna hear it anyway but when he's found everything in his place inspector then he seals it you say is that going to make you flawless absolutely not it's not going to make you flawless be ye therefore perfect this flesh will never be flawless if you don't believe it you just ask any wife they'll tell you about your husband and maybe vice versa he'll never seal the car he can't seal the car but when he's found everything is in place inspected any seals dare any dare anybody open that seal until the cars reached its destination where he'll steal - there it is Peter had believed on / 121 Peter had believed on the Lord had been baptized and been getting power to heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead Jesus told him that night before the crucifixion after after after you are converted strengthen your brethren that's why been both saved and sanctified and yet hadn't been converted that's the scripture or you say all sanctified yes Sir John 17:17 sanctify them by the truth thy Word is true they had the the word sanctifies them they had the word which they're sanctified by the word it is truth you think he put that spirit in a vessel that wasn't fit whoa whoa that's heavy duty the inspector finds the car it's got to be you don't want anything that broken he don't want to fall when it gets you know all the going around the curves of the Train and you know it's got to be tied down strapped down it's got to be it's got to be right not flawless it's got to be packed right set right it's got to be set right you're not your own you're a boat with a price your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost don't defile it you might as I said you're not flawless you make mistakes you'll still make mistakes no sir but you have to be sanctified the mob won't give you a little grace now I told you give a little grace okay yeah glad about that Abraham first time he went down into Egypt lied about his wife said this is my sister and then you know in favor oh I'll take it from my wife you okay well then after after after Abraham gets a body change made by young again which is that his body changes the type of us receiving the Holy Ghost after he gets a body change Danny goes down to Greer and the King down there by the name of amulets and the same thing happens and you know he falls in love with this grandma that's now 18 and he said that's that's the one I've been looking for all of my life and says I'm gonna take her he said sure it's all right it's my sister go ahead take her because you know he was he was a little bit coward because he know it's gonna kill his hide if you know if he said anything otherwise say yeah go ahead they see see he and Sarah had coveted years and years ago if we ever get in trouble I'll say you're my sister because it was his half-sister they had made that covenant many many years ago when L started out but Abraham he's already been changed by yunk again signified as a type rather of receiving the hold and he still lied he lied about his life after he had received the Holy Ghost can you imagine a man lying purposely after even the Holy Ghost I can't imagine that well I did think about one instabuilder Brownlie at one time he said now a telephone rang and it was a tax case he said now he went out the door said to me today you tell him not here I'm not here he went outside he had the Holy Ghost brother Ram actually said I lied and he said you know I'm not trying to put words I mean he said I lied I told some wasn't true and he had the Holy Ghost now I'm not advocating lying but I'm going to tell you you probably going to lie if you've been born again you're probably going to lie you probably lied this year oh my but aren't you glad God to judge as a man according to the desire of his heart I'm so glad about that according to what this true hearts is true hearts desire in the was the Holy Ghost given four paragraph 56 and Jesus said they'd be so close together in the last days that would deceive the very elect impossible remember it's just the elected that will see it God calls election calls by election aren't you happy that you're one of them aren't you people here tonight knowing that something in your heart is tugging tugging something in you young people's hearts tugging tugging I want the Holy Spirit I want you Lord in my heart that's because God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said that no man can come to me except said Jesus except my father has drawled him first and all that comes to me I'll give him/her to eternal life what is he turn what is eternal life the Holy Ghost and what is that thirst it's a painful dis I hear you've been around this message all this law in and you don't have no thirst for God you've been around a message for years and you don't have no thirst for God you probably ain't seed been around a message these years that no thirst for guard something wrong somewhere but I tell you what group does have it so you've been real playing Isis I told you I was gonna be real plain summer do church aids there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the Spirit says in each age it is one special group that receives a revelation for each age hello hello this is a special group of people receive the word for age I mean it is a separated a special they chosen a royal you didn't make yourself that he did you just ought to be so thankful to God I'm willing to do whatever it's one special group that receives a revelation three days that group is of God that means you're forgotten of God because that group cannot hear that group because the group that cannot hear is not of God John 8:44 1444 the group that can and does hear what the Spirit is saying and receives the revelation there is that group described 1st Corinthians 2 they are the ones who have the Spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ biosphere they are baptized with the Holy Ghost thank god there's somebody is going to continue his work they don't care what the world thinks they don't care what the their peer pressure is they don't care what the teacher thinks they just want a new birth whatever it cause I want it whatever the price is I want it whatever I have to do to get it I want it yeah I've got to have it it's it's paramount I can't go in the rapture without I must have it what good has been a popular in school and you stay here in the tribulation what good is that what good will that be if you've gained the whole world and lose your soul what good is it look I'm I'm 66 years old if the world if time carries I don't have but a few more years so let's say I'd know I'm happy about it you want to leave this world not today but I'm ready but I tell you what I wouldn't trade place within the 18 to 20 year old and go through it again no sir I've lived my life I'm ready to go on I'd rather be there this stay here however better be up there and stay down here I've seen all this world I want to see no desire ain't looking back and going back and concerned about what's back there I'm pressing forth brother-sister use young people you need that same desire say well I'm young you might be young but somebody somebody is going to be 16 when the rapture takes place somebody's going to be 18 when the rapture takes place somebody's going to be in school when the rapture takes place you be one that's got the Holy Ghost hey man and he brother BAM says and try but I want to get down a few more things he said ever birth is a mess I don't care if it's a top peak decorated hospital room ever births a mess remember the theme of ever apostle was have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed it's very simple receiving a Holy Ghost which is receiving Christ as self same spirit that's the whole purpose of the New Testament which you'll notice this quote paragraph 19 what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 19 this is tremendous this whole purpose all that God was they poured into Christ all the Christ was he poured into the church why why now the purpose what was what was God's purpose in sending the holy spirit marked that down John 14 beginning the fourteenth verse in reading through the chapter of the bathe God's purpose we find here and send in the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continues work through the church it's very simple all that God was you know above us in the children of Israel illness in the pillow fire with us in Jesus now he wants to be in us above us with this in us well for him to continue his work because he said I've got to go away I'll send you another comforter he's got to leave he can't stay here with us he's got to go away what is it what is another comforter it's the Holy Spirit's the same spirit of Christ but it's not Jesus in flesh anymore it's that same spirit that he had coming back into the church so he so you you you could continue the work of the church as brother Donna's been preaching on the church yours continuation he is the beginning of the creation of God you are the continuation of the creation of God you have to have the Holy Ghost of being a but be to be qualified to continue the work of God in His Church you have to have the Holy Ghost he's not gonna he's not going to continue he's not he's not even gonna feel unclean vessel you have because you can't do it on your own you can't do it without the Holy Ghost there's one purpose God himself might dwell in the church and continue its plans through the church and you can only do it you think about the Lord about Apostle Peter when he went up into the Upper Room he was scared to death of the Jews they was persecuting his killing killing people he was scared of the Jews he was scared of the he was actually afraid of them why did it why did he deny the Lord Jesus you think he he denied because he was afraid he was afraid when he went up in the upper room he was afraid but when he came out of the upper ooh but that's afraid of him that's the difference before you get the Holy Ghost you might be afraid but well after you get the Holy Ghost the devil is afraid of you well that was good wasn't it then the brother man said when the weakest Christian gets on an easy frame makes a devil tremble that's the weak that's what about the strongest you're Abraham's role your face is your strong in faith I'm just almost getting where I can preach a little bit now on it's time to quit oh don't you just love him oh listen friends if you've got the Holy Ghost and you know I mean your life better listen your life bears record you listen I just can't stress of it it's not works don't miss read me it's not works but it but if if your if your passion is not Christ then there's something wrong and if your passion is Christ it's going to show in your life whatever you're passionate I mean some worldly things but you're not sinful I mean you know you enjoy those things you you do it and you'll want to do it again you want to do it again you know because you know you enjoy that you know but if your passion is Christ you want to serve the Lord you want to come to church you want to read you want to pray you want to do more wanna

like that well you have this morning maybe I needed a heart bypass maybe I didn't think I could take it before I don't know listen to this quote this next quote I don't have a written down words come now as the light has been the shine right look at this listen happy valley you're in the message you've been under this ministry sitting this church tremendous ministry here tremendous message we have the greatest message ever struck the earth complete revelation of Jesus Christ you think you're going to get by with being a Mossback church member you're see buddy as the line has begin to shine in the last days he's expecting us a great thing from us because where there's much given there's much required so he's going to require much more of us than he did other Lutheran's or the Methodists because we walk in a greater life with a greater power with a greater a greater witness than they had now we have a greater witness of the resurrection we have things more firmer more sure than they have to him much is given much is required I will say it out front to him much is given much is required you've been given the greatest message in every structure sir you've been invited into the kingdom of the secret kingdom of Almighty God you've been invited to be at the wedding suffered to being the millennium to reign and judging that you've been invited to live in the new city you've been invited to be the wife the Lambs wife you've been invited to be the cream of the crop why wouldn't you want to love him why wouldn't you want to give God your best why wouldn't you want to come to church and serve him with all your heart why would do you want to do that he'd give you the very best why would you want to give him your best Oh hallelujah he gave you the very best he had why would you want to give him the very best you have he saved the best for last he say the very best for last he said it's a prophet the greatest vindicated prophet that we've ever had on the face of the earth outside of the Lord Jesus brother Graham said he didn't he had more success in my ministry that he did in his own Jesus now not brother round me Jesus giving Jesus a credit more vindicated any other messenger the greatest message the seals and opens the revelation of truth all the wonderful things we are understanding and believe the very best and you want to play around with God not me brother not me for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord I'm not playing games we're not playing you that's over with you know the rapture may happen next week I don't know but we're that close and remembering I die I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to get into souls are now in prison but but he's expecting more of us we'll just leave it at that he's going to require much more of us than he did Lutheran's or the methods because we walk in a greater light greater power we have a greater witness of the resurrection more for more sure than a ham oh brother we are privileged people musicians why don't you come while I finish up live holy lifts Len live separated don't live a loose life give up the things the world it's not worth it it's not worth it I heard a person tell me I didn't go on path by come on musicians had a person tell me said well I'm gonna let my children grow up and let them make their own decision don't try it don't take them Church don't train them you know just let them grow up that's insanity if you think about it they don't even have a chance because they're born with a snake nature they're born already whipped you might say they're born come as rural speaking lies and if they've never told about God what chance do they have I mean outside of election maybe what chance did to have if you take him if you train train up a child away she go if you train him up right take him to church teach him have a godly home then he's still only got let's just say you know you told him right he's born wrong he has at least a fighting chance but if you know trying to put always to go what chance does he have no wonder brother Ram sent him outside of election now he said a child that's been taking his to church so just paraphrase now child has been raised up in the Lord got a 95% better chance to become a Christian than Wanda don't why because he's been right you take a baby that's born in America he's brand-new let's say I've used the example before you take him to Russia and then he says stays in Russia six years then you bring him back to America he went over Russia when he's six months old he says they're six years he comes back to America what language does he speak Russian duh why does he speak Russian because he was tall Russian well he was born in America I don't care

When the mists are rolled away, we will understand it better by and by. Wo by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story oh how we've overcome for we'll understand it better by and by. There's a message in the evening that the world can't recognize, but it's calling out a people for a rapture in the sky. And we've heard the prophets cry, and we know the reason why. We will understand it better by and by. Wo! By and by, when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home, and we will tell the story, oh, how we've overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by. Now the bride is making ready in the garments he designed. Not with creeds or man's ideas. Just the word that's pure in line. Every promise she believes and she's longing now to leave. For the trumpet soon shall call us to go home. Go by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story. Oh, how we've overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by. Wo by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story oh how we've overcome for we'll understand it better by and I [Music] [Applause] I want to say just a little bit about this song. This song that we're going to sing, you've sung it here many, many, many times. The chorus uh the song does have verses to it and the chorus of this song has probably been sung uh along with sister Gerald Deian songs, brother Lo songs just to name a few other people that have written songs around the world. There was an assembly in South Africa that kind of adopted this song and because they didn't have verses to it, they wrote verses. So, we're going to fulfill a promise that was made to some folks that visited here a long long time ago that uh we would sing this song and we'll include the verses so that they can learn it in in their own assembly. So, uh Sister Betty wrote this song how many years ago? &gt;&gt; 40. Should be 50. So, we want we want to sing this song. Can't you see why I'm happy? Are you happy tonight? Are you glad you're happy? Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise this this evening. Amen. I know that the end is nearing and time is growing so sure that God he promised a and promise his word to restore [Music] the reserve [Music] in progress. The bride is believing his word. Her heart has been turned to her father. The voice of God she has heard. Sing this chorus with us. Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy? I accepted the word of the Lord. I reveal a word that was so done by the prophet of God. This world is fighting his promise. The word they've already denied. But God has favored his choice. be elected. This message will find we're waiting for the rapture [Music] to be changed in we call it. will be called up to be our savior will be in this whole world goodbye. Sing with all your heart as you stand. Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy I accepted the word of the Lord that was by the prophet of Mel. Sing that verse again in the chorus. Sing it. Can't you see why I'm so happy? Hallelujah. I accepted the word of the Lord. Oh, the real word that was sp by the prophet of God. The reveal word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi Lord. [Applause] [Applause] They done good to be old people, didn't they? Except for brother Eric. He's not that old yet. Praise the Lord. I don't know about you, I appreciate having folks that have given their life for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Stable, strong, they do something for me. &gt;&gt; You think, Brother Donnie, you're old yourself. Yeah, I know. But there's people around me that's even older. I mean, look at Brother D, Brother Harvey, and Sister Shirley was in Brother Bram's meetings. That does something for me. &gt;&gt; We've got all these people attacking the message and trying to make the prophet false and make him this and that and the other. Try to convince them. &gt;&gt; Try to convince them of what they saw. &gt;&gt; Get some eyewitnesses of it. You think you'd ever be able to convince Peter, but Jesus wasn't real? One of the brothers here had sent me a little clip the other day of the world's smartest man as far as smart with the highest IQ in the world and scientifically he was taking and proving why the Jesus was still alive. So he took a lot of different things and he was talking about the apostles and how that they gave their life for him and all the different things that that happened. And the end of the equation was that Jesus still had to be alive. After he got into it for just a few minutes, it done lost me, which is apparent mine's pretty low anyway. But I thought, I'm so glad I don't have to have Jesus scientifically proven. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's been proven to you how? By faith. you yourself, hopefully you can see yourself a little plainer uh tonight. Let's read together. Genesis chapter 24 verse 54. And they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tried all night. They rose up in the morning and he said, \"Send me away unto my master.\" And her brother and her mother. Her brother and her mother. Maybe some of you've got a brother like this and a mother like this. her brother and her mother said, \"Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at least at the least, at the least 10, and after that she shall go.\" So they're saying one thing, Elis are saying something else. And he said unto them, \"Hinder me not. Seeing the Lord hath prospered my way, send me away that I may go to my master.\" Now, there's no way that they would have done this in verse 57 if they would have known the conclusion because the conclusion did not give them what they wanted. So, they did not believe Rebecca would ever do what she's fixing to do. And they said, \"Fine, we'll call her. We'll call the damsel.\" And inquired her mouth. And they just knew. Brother JD beyond a shadow of a doubt. To them, there was no question about it. She said going to say, \"Well, this is a cult. I ain't following that man.\" Can you imagine one 16-year-old girl and her nurse Deborah and a few more women whistle and the rest of them men on a journey between 450 and 500 miles which would take them a month night after night. You're encompassed by men you don't even know. They were convinced. They were totally convinced. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, \"Wilt thou go with this man?\" &gt;&gt; And you said, &gt;&gt; \"Praise the Lord.\" We could dismiss and say, \"It's been good to be in church already.\" &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad there was something in you that responded the same way? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Heather Potter's asking for prayer. Got laded and dizzy and they had to leave the service. Let's uh let's remember them in prayer. And I'm sure others have needs tonight in your body, in your home, whatever it is. Let's just take him before the Lord now. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful for your word and we thank you, Lord Jesus, for all the mighty things that you've done for us. We thank you for the absoluteness of your word and the absoluteness of your character. And it gives us such confidence for us to see how you have dealt with our predecessors and what you've done through them and their lives. And it gives us faith to know that you will do your will in our lives as well. Father, as we endeavor to look further into this beautiful story of the scripture tonight, I pray that you would help us, Lord. You saw the uplifted hands signifying needs, desires, request. Lord, this request of Sister Heather having to take her daughter home tonight. And we pray in the name of Jesus that you just moved for Lord this dizziness may it leave her father we pray. Father, we pray for our sister Clipper tonight, also our brother Steve Newsome, others, Lord, with different needs and things that they're going through in life. And we're just believing you, Father, that you're going to move. And we know the word tells us if God be for us, who can be against us. Speak to us tonight from your word. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. You know, I find delay can be such a dangerous thing. But what's amazing about delay is that Satan will try to impersonate us waiting on God for a season and for a time. and he will mimic that. But it's actually him delaying us from something the Lord wants us to do. Now, this girl, I I I hope that the Lord will will let me break it down, maybe take a couple of services and show you that every move she is making, every word he said, every response, all of it is being brought in to show who Rebecca really is. Now, I find it amazing because what they're asking here is something that is out of broken continuity of everything that she has done thus far. What I like to see about people is their repetitive character. Now, every one of us have hiccups in our life and we have breaks in the pattern of our soul. By that I mean that we will go through spots in our life and maybe we're kind of low and we're just going through a spot sometimes you don't even know what it is. Anybody ever been there besides me and you don't even know why you're feeling the way you're feeling and you're just feeling kind of low and sometimes kind of sad and sometimes kind of weary and you can't really put your finger on this or that or the other. You can't really put your hand on nothing that you've done in your life. And yet somehow it just seems kind of odd to you. And during those times, you know, we we may not have the amount of joy that we normally would. And we may not have that smile quite on our face like would normally be there. But I'm so grateful that the Lord doesn't hold those low times against us. Aren't you? I'm glad that he looks at us during those times and and realizes, but that's not really who you are. You will rebound out of that place and you will be exactly what you are continuously over and over again. I imagine it would surprise us if we could have been around the Lord Jesus and saw him as a man that we would have seen sadness in his life. We would have seen oppression and sorrow. As a matter of fact, the Bible says about him in the prophetic utterance of Isaiah that he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. So grief was an acquaintance. It wasn't somebody or something that he saw once every 3 years or once every six months, but it was one that was around him just like constantly there, acquainted with grief, a man of sorrow. Now you're talking about the Lord Jesus. Well, why didn't Isaiah call him a man of joy? a a man of bubbling, a static just rapture all the time. You mean to tell me the Lord Jesus was called a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief? Yeah, he sure was. And no doubt it would have been quite surprising for the people that had in their mind what the Messiah would be. Now, David, you know, we know that David himself was a man of great ecstatic joy. He was a shouter. He was a jumper. He was a dancer, no doubt. He had all types of emotion. He was a songwriter. A lot of times songwriters can be that way. They can be up and down just like this. So there's no medium place for them. And David, whenever he was up, I mean, he was high. Whenever he was riding on top of the mountains, them mountains, it just seemed like he skipped on top of one of another. But when that man got low, he got low. David asks more wise than any other author in the scripture. Study it sometime. Why this? Why that? Why do the people imagine a ma vain thing? Why does the heathen roar? Why this? Why that? Why does the wicked prosper like a green bay tree? Why this? And why that? How long, Lord, will you delay in answering me? A man that we would picture, and I'm afraid we've done it wrongly. a man that we think was constantly shouting, constantly enjoying the blessing of God. I'd say we'd be surprised if we would ever see the real true David. &gt;&gt; I imagine that people that we have made up in our mind and we have got fictitious characters of the way we think they were, but in reality they probably wasn't like that at all. Now, whenever you look at what God was fixing to do for her, now watch how this up to this point, Rebecca has been hastening in every response that she has made. Watch. Hastening this, hastening that, running here, running there, doing this at a rapid rate. And now they are wanting something contrary to what she has been doing all along in the response to this messenger. Now you know it it it has to make me wonder did this messenger did this message change something about her and they thought the methodical behavior that they had seen over and over again about her. Did they think that would be the predominant force that would fall back and this is what she would react by? Now, I want you to notice how that this message and this messenger had done something to her. Watch in in Genesis 24: 18. And she said, \"Drink, my Lord.\" And she &gt;&gt; hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink. And when she had done given him drink, she said, \"I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking.\" and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and &gt;&gt; and ran to the well to draw water and drew for all his camels. Notice in verse 28, and the damsel &gt;&gt; ran and told them of her mother's house these things. So notice what the message and the messenger had done to this woman. So it had hastened this, it had hastened that. There must have been a supernatural acceleration that was somewhat above her natural behavior. And then her mother and her brother, who it appears were the spokesman, they felt like they knew her. Well, they probably thought they did. But you see, something had happened to her because an angel had visited her and not them. And it had brought somewhat of a change into her. No doubt they felt like she was more stable than this. And they had brought her up this particular way and no way she was ever going to make a hasty decision. Now, this is a pretty hasty decision. No time to contemplate, no time to pray about it, no time to weigh it out, no time to Google it, as we said before, check all of it out. No way to do any of that at all. And that there's no way that they would have thought she would have responded in this way. But this had already began to develop in her by the supernatural influence of what God had done. I hope somebody's hearing me tonight. Can't you see why that your family and my family and the family of others whenever we begin to hear this word for those of us who were not born in it and raised up in it. And when we begin to hear it that it affected us in such a way that it alarmed our family and alarmed our loved ones and our friends and to them it made us very susceptible to being deceived. So they were quite overwhelmed because they saw us reacting in a way that was somewhat unfamiliar with what they had known us as before. Well, just to be honest with you, if it do if it didn't do that, then really it shouldn't be a message that we should leave one another and follow this one for. If this one don't do more for you than your Baptist church, just stay in your Baptist church. If this message don't do something more for you than the Pentecostal message was in, just stay in Pentecost. You'll be better off cuz you'll probably go back to it anyhow. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But notice there was something about the message and the messenger. Now, what was what was the sum of the message so far that she had heard? Now, it was not doctrine. It was not theology. It was not about many of those things, but it was about people. Listen now. It was about people. So this this servant now he started with the master of the house himself which in the anotype of course was Almighty God. And then he went on down and brought it from the expression of Abraham and typed by Almighty God. And he brings it on down to the expression of his son which was Jesus or in her case Isaac and wives as he be to expound the message and it wasn't dos and don'ts. Now we have no record that he mentions anything about now you got to do this and you got to do that and you got to do this and you got to do that and you can't go here and you can't go there and you can't do this and you can't do that. But if he could get her so attracted to the person of the message itself and let her fall in love with the messenger, then whatever he wanted her to do, there'd be no problem with it from that point on. I'm afraid sometimes that we failed to actually lead people to a place to where they fall so in love with the Lord Jesus that whatever he asks them to do, they just do it. Brother John because they love him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now whenever the messenger then begins to move and in this sequence of events remember it's unfolding supernaturally and we know that the Bible I love the way the prophet says this that that the Bible actually condenses its truths. So there can be so much compacted in three or four verses that categorically in history there would be so much that if it were all written and laid out it would be phenomenal how much would be there. But we know truly that the Bible does condense its truth. So was this everything that was said or did Moses just capture the highlights of the conversation? But no doubt the stream of what was going to be projected to her and the conjecture of what he wanted her to get was not about himself. So he never bragged about himself. I want you to see how much the master trusted me because I am the oldest of the master's servants and the master gave me this and the master gave me that and the master trusted me with this and trusted me with that. I imagine that certainly she wanted to know. But to her, I I I just can't keep from believing that that him being there was all of that that he had spoke well enough of his own character that she didn't need to hear a sermon every night on the messenger himself. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me. I I realize a lot of folks in the message, they'd rather hear the messenger preach than they would what the message is all about, the Lord Jesus. But I'm here to tell you tonight, this night's not going to be about your pastor. This night is not going to be just us focusing on God's prophet. It's not going to be focusing on Elijah or or Jeremiah. But I want to point you tonight to who this is really all about. It's about the Lord Jesus and you. Is that all right with you? &gt;&gt; So notice how the the methodical pattern of Rebecca is now running true to form. That doesn't say, of course, that she didn't have something about this before and it must have been something that was laying there. But you know from getting of the picture that we're able to even get about people like Noah, the prophet said that Noah was a man that had no certain desire, no certain ambition really to do anything. It wasn't like he wanted to be a great renowned worldshaking person and thinking I'm going to build a boat and I'm going to be the only man on the earth. I'm going to make history from this point on. I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. He was just a farmer just raising his crops. Happy to be alive. Happy to be, you know, knowing what he did about God and the mercy of God. But God did something to Noah and raised something up out of Noah that was laying in him in seed form that had been hidden under the mass of a farmer's life. And God didn't even call him and said, \"Now tell what I want you to do. I want you to raise these great big gigantic massive vegetables and I want you to climb up on top of a watermelon and you're going to sail the water on top of watermelon. Give a giraffe a cantaloupe and give everybody else a squash and green peppers and all that. God called the man totally out of his line of profession. And his vocation was not building. his vocation. We don't even know if the man could even hang a plum door or not until God called him and God changed him and absolutely went contrary to that which he felt comfortable in doing. That's a God called man. I said that's a God called man. You imagine he could have give all kinds of excuses. But yet think about it now that God can has the ability of bringing things out in people and it will totally shock and surprise those many times who knows it. Now those who have great capacities on their own and then the call of God what they think is the call of God and then they say here God I'll do it. I'll do it and then they want to present what they are so they've got a great mind and they can be able to take the scriptures and put it together. My really impressed people, nine times out of 10 that individual never has been called of God, never will be. But God will call somebody that looking at them and they'll say, \"Nope, there ain't no man in the world. That fell never mount to hill of beans.\" That old boy, I'll tell you one thing, you know, he'll never amount to nothing. And God says, \"That's my man.\" And the one that people say, \"Now, Lord, pick this guy. Pick that guy. Pick that woman. Pick that woman there.\" that God will say, \"Nope, I don't want nothing new as them because if I use them, all they're going to be is a stuffed shirt. That's all they're going to be, a stuffed shirt. I don't want to be a stuffed shirt, but I do want to have a stuffed heart. I want my heart to be stuffed full of the goodness and the mercy and the power of God.\" So, notice what they ask Rebecca now to do. So they're asking her to behave in a a way contrary to the way of what the message has done for her already. Now whether or not she acted like this before or not, we really don't know. But by them asking the question that they did, as I said, there's no way they would have believed her response would have been this way. They would have never asked her. They would have asked something in the way that they thought, well, she herself, we know her. if we look at her the right way, she's going to say no. Well, no doubt they both looked at her the right way and she didn't say no. So, whatever it was that they expected about her turned out totally different and the spirit of God had already moved upon her heart against all reasoning. Now, it would have seemed sensible. They're never going to see her again. Think of this now. They will never see her again. Her mother never saw her. Her brother never saw her. Her nieces, nephews, if they had any. Nobody of her family ever saw her again. So, she's met this man the day before and the next day she's heading out on a month-long journey to only God knows where if this man is even true and reputable or not. So, in one sense of the word, you could have see why they would have not been asking too much. But in another sense of the word, they were asking too much because what they asked for was simply contrary to what the messenger said. Now, had the messenger said, \"Well, I'll tell you what. All right. Now, this has gone really good. So, what I'm going to do is we're just going to kind of hang around here for about a week, 10 days, something like that. We're going to let you go out and say goodbye to all the school kids that you knew. we're going to let you say goodbye to these and this and that and that and you can have, you know, two or three different gatherings together with your family. And we understand that. We we understand that. But somehow the messenger must have had an insight that delay would have actually affected the cause of God. Now had he said it's fine for us to delay and then they would have said delay that would have been no problem. Now her first trial comes whenever the messenger says one thing but her family says something different. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many people around the message that's been around for 30 years still ain't learned what Rebecca learned after following the messenger only one day. But somehow another did she understand it? Now notice, I don't want us to make a superhuman woman out of Rebecca. There's no way that Rebecca had the faith of Abraham without her being tried in a similar way that Abraham was. So she could believe things that were not as though they were. So I believe myself that Rebecca was tried on this journey. I don't believe it was a pleasant journey. I don't believe that everything on the journey maybe went to her expectation. It would have been unlike the family she was going to marry into. For her to have had everything under her expectation on the journey would have been a great contrast to the way God dealt with Abraham and Isaac. So she is going to be a perfect match for the family of Abraham. Remember the requirement was to Eleazar, I want you to go find a bride for my son of my people. Now he's not just talking about his own flesh and blood. He is that. But he's wanting someone, a daughter that will be of his own kind, of his own nature. What? A daughter of faith. Not just a daughter of the same bloodline, but a daughter of faith. Now, whenever Eleazar has a month to make this journey, he's praying. He's thinking about it. God, give me the right questions. Give me the right things so I'm going to find the right bloodline. Yes, but Lord God, give me the right things to ask her so I can know she will be a perfect fit into the family of faith. Well, I don't mind telling you tonight there's all kinds of Christians around the world, but a lot of them do not fit in the real bride family of faith. They don't. They make good nominal Christians. They make good, you know, churchgoing people, and the Lord is the one to judge, all that sort of thing. But I'll tell you, it takes a really selected class, the better of their class like the Rebecca type that is able to answer in respond to the promised word. and they have something in them by the influence of the angels of God. I'm going to go ahead and tell you tonight, before you ever even knew about it, God made a deposit down inside of your soul. And there ain't enough devils out of hell to stop you from making that journey. I don't care what the devil does. I don't care what people do. You can be so hurt by preachers and hurt by people and everything else and it may tear your heart out of you. But I'll tell you what, it will never move that seed in your soul because it is an immovable part of the immovable almighty God. It ain't you. It ain't your determination. It ain't your desire. It's a deposit of himself that's given to his elect only. And the church said, Oh my. So, they're trying to do what? Delay. Oh, listen to me. Delay can be such a dangerous thing. When a person is being caught in the influence of an individual, whether it's a friend, whether it's a a a relative, whatever it is, and that influence is pulling them in a direction that they know is contrary to the word, and they keep putting it off and putting it off and putting it off to break away from that person. Look at the danger. Look at what they're flirting with. Now watch what the prophet said here in desperations. He said Rebecca the beautiful maid came and watered the camel and then said don't delay me in my way. She had to come to a time of decision whether she would go. She was a type of the bride. Notice Rebecca does not type the foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. So foolish virgin will never be able to relate to Rebecca type by type by type by type by type. They may pick certain things but only the bride can answer be the antitype of Rebecca. She was a type of the bride. Would she go and marry a man who she has never seen? Oh my. Now that's a great thing. Never even seen him. Yet she had only heard by his servant. Now look at the way God does this. That's the type of the bride. You've never seen Christ. Oh hallelujah. But you hear, notice now, but you hear by his servants what he is. So most of us have never seen the corporal body of the Lord Jesus. He personally never come put his arms around us and appeared to us in a vision and we saw him and we fell in love with him. But how did we start falling in love with him? By servants, people telling us. Some of you got started in a Baptist church, maybe some of you in a Methodist, some of you in a Pentecost, or some of you in a message. So, who knows where it was? But something moved upon your heart and you begin to hear about him and it started making a drawing power between you and him. And then the more you begin to hear about him, then you begin to fall more in love. Now, the more anointed the servant is and the greater gift in the servant's life, the more he can get out of the way, the more that he can project Jesus to you and it helps you fall in love with him more. And the church said, \"That's the kind of preachers I like to listen to. I like to listen to them and they get so out of the way.\" You can still see the human element there, of course, but they get so much out of the way and they project the Lord Jesus as being so great that you just feel like you could reach out and touch him. A man's already done what he's supposed to do when he can do that. Now, notice what is it? You sell out everything. You leave your homes, everything else it takes to go find him. Now notice and she made the decision type of the bride letter left her denominational home. Oh my. Okay. So Laban and his mother and that system there that they were in were typified. The prophet of God types them like a denomination. Now, we remember years later whenever Jacob comes back and he's going to leave out and remember and one of his wives, Rachel goes and what does she do? She gets the gods out of her father's house, &gt;&gt; this same Laban right here. So, he was a heathen, &gt;&gt; an idoltor. &gt;&gt; He believed in the trinity at least. So Rachel steals her father's gods. So Rebecca was delivered out of this denominational home. Then some of you tell me that God's given you a husband or a wife that's a denominational. I want to know where what are you people drinking? &gt;&gt; What are you eating? You sure ain't hearing to what your pastor's preaching. [Music] So God loved Harry out of a denomination and lead some of you back and you young men going into these denominational churches to find yourself a wife or you sister to find yourself a denominational man. What in the world's matter with you? &gt;&gt; Are you out of your mind? &gt;&gt; Boy, it's getting hot in here ain't it? Man, a lot. Now notice that God called her out of that denominational system. What's amazing is now that denominational system was her family. &gt;&gt; Her family was the denominational system. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, preach it, Brother Donnie. I'm with you, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now look how dangerous it could have been. I I know you don't you stand there thinking well what difference would it have made? But you see if she would have delayed I I know it's phenomenal really how that the exposure of truth can counteract once you've walked into light. People they they don't make any sense out of it. But actually after she had been exposed to this truth and then had she delayed and waited and answered the wrong thing. I hope you understand where I'm going to go with this now. Had she said, \"I will stay.\" Do you understand what Eleazar would have done? Left &gt;&gt; and left her there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, &gt;&gt; each answer, each response. Can you imagine? She could have done everything right up to the last answer. &gt;&gt; She could have quit cutting her hair as we say, and cleaned out her closet and done this and done that and done that. This This Oh, children, listen. This answer is the final decision. Rebecca, what are you going to say? Oh, if she would have said, \"Oh, what? My mama wants me to stay here. I I'm stay. And if you ain't willing to stay, \"Well, I guess I'm not willing to go with you.\" Then that would have let him know then you are not worthy of my master. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Happy Valley, Word of Life, Mendon Church, whatever your church is, if we are coming down and we serve him for 30 years and then he keeps asking questions and asking questions. Don't you see what he's doing? Do you still love me now? Are you still going to serve me? I took your husband. I took your wife. I took your son. I took your daughter. What are you going to do now, Lance? He's waiting for an answer. He's waits for an answer. Brother Jim, what will be our answer? Word of life. I will go. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will go. I'll have nothing to go back to. Can you imagine as he stands there nervously waiting and they ask the maid, \"Will you go with this man?\" No. How does in a derogatory tone this great messenger from God? Oh, no. Nothing complimentary like that. Will you go to your fame and fortune? Will you go to this great position of predestination? No. Notice what they done. They totally twisted it right back around now. Will you go with this man? &gt;&gt; Rebecca, answer carefully. Your whole destiny lays on this. I will go or I won't go. Only one word difference. Will or won't. &gt;&gt; Wow, that's close, ain't it? Now, delaying, as I said, isn't the same as waiting, but they can seem similar where people are directed by the Lord to wait and wait for an answer and wait patiently, sometimes for healing, sometimes for a move of God. Isaiah 40 and verse 31. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. But to apply this verse of scripture had it been written to her answer would have been misapplying the word and taking the word out of context. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and caused her to miss the entire will of God by misquing scripture &gt;&gt; and misplacing it. &gt;&gt; It's astounding statement that the prophet tells us the word of the Lord is not always always the will of the Lord because you have to place the word of the Lord in its right place &gt;&gt; or it's not the will of God. &gt;&gt; So they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up as wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. But this was not the time to wait. Why, brother Donnie? Because the messenger never told her to wait. The messenger said, \"It's urgent. The rapture's coming. &gt;&gt; The rapture's coming.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, you say rapture? Yeah. She was fixing to be caught up on the back of a great big power. &gt;&gt; An animal in the Bible represented power. And she's fixing to be caught up. She may never rode a camel in her life, but she's fixing to be raised up into a higher place than she'd ever been before. And she's going to ride up in this higher place. Oh, glory to God. Until she meets her bridegroom. Praise the Lord. So, it's not the time to wait. It's the time to pack up. I want you to notice here the prophet again whenever he's referring to Saul, he said, \"But then when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more, Samuel turned right away from him.\" Listen how serious this is. Remember the first time, not the second time, but the first time that Saul took upon himself to take over the service of the Lord, Samuel turned his back on him and walked away from him. And the first time that the church lets their leaders take over to lead the people, the Holy Spirit gets right away from them. the first time the church lets their leaders. Can't you see friends why God is so against a denominational move? I ain't talking about the people inside of there. I'm talking about the hierarchy and what they do. God don't want men directing his church. Well, I now we know the Bible said that, but I this is what the board thinks and this is what they told me up at headquarter. God don't want his church run by that. He wants his church run by men filled with the Holy Ghost that will never leave that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. They would die before they would compromise in the word. Don't you see that very simple thing is the very reason God left every denomination when they voted and decided we're going to have a board here. We're going to call the church this and that and that and you can't do this and you can go there. As soon as they done it, God left them right there. They may have shouted and jumped for years and years, but the presence of God as far as his omnipotence pulled away from them, Lord God have mercy. Don't you understand? has done the same thing around the message moves. The message moves when they want to hear what a man's got to say. Well, brother so and so says this this way. And brother so and so, don't you understand the spirit of God does the same thing? I pray I hope and pray he never leaves our church. I hope and pray he's always welcome here because we want him to lead us and guide us. Not me, not the rest of these preacher brothers. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh my. &gt;&gt; The very first time you go being led by man instead of God, the Holy Spirit will get away from you, too. Let the Holy Spirit lead. That's what we need as leadership. God gave us a leader and we don't hear it. Oh my. So what was Saul supposed to do? Wait on Samuel the prophet. And he waited and waited. And Samuel didn't come when he thought. What did he do? Run ahead of God instead of waiting on the Lord. But say, \"Oh my goodness, Rebecca, maybe you should wait. Maybe you should wait.\" It wasn't time to wait. &gt;&gt; It was time to leave. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice again, he's trying to do God a service. I've been pretty rough this morning, but see, they that are are on the Lord wait on the Lord and they're waiting. And when they do, they see the promise of today being vindicated and it renews their faith. But see, this is what Satan tries to do. He's so tricky that he mimics God. And he will try to get us to delay. Oh my. and convincing us that we're waiting on the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm just waiting &gt;&gt; on what? How long some of y'all been waiting for the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; What are you waiting on? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Johnny, I'm waiting on God. And God's waiting on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All I'm waiting on to get closer to God. I I'll tell you one thing. Sunday morning, boy, I'm going to get in service. I'm going to come in. I made up my mind. I'm going to get in. I'm going to clap my hand. But why wait till Sunday morning? This might be your last service. &gt;&gt; You're waiting and waiting and waiting on what? What's Satan doing? You're well just waiting on God. No, you're not. And many of these things you're delaying. &gt;&gt; Some of you shed broke ties with some of the people that's waited you down for years and years and you're waiting till you feel led. Feel led. Nothing. Look at the attributes of what they're doing to you. And you're seeing what you're doing. You're not waiting on God. You're delaying. Moses delayed circumcising his son &gt;&gt; and God went looking for him to kill him. &gt;&gt; God found him at the end and God would have killed him &gt;&gt; because he committed adultery to somebody else's wife because he delayed circumcising his own son. So, it's a preacher preaching circumcision to everybody else and didn't circumcise his own son. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; \"My my want to amen this part.\" You see, I'm called to preach the whole message. &gt;&gt; I remember the flood coming on. They rushed her out to the government depot out there for the hospital. That part of the night, it raining, twisting, blowing, always mine, God. No matter what it is, &gt;&gt; God says for you to do. And I tell you today that God in heaven who looks down upon me standing in this platform will forgive me. I know that many thousands of souls I will have to answer for it that day for listening to somebody else instead of God. Now I know people have said it for years and years. Say what the prophet said. Say what the tape say. Uhhuh. That's what I just said. How come some of y'all ain't saying amen? &gt;&gt; Why do people always get quiet when you read this? This is why I can follow this man right here cuz he told us this about himself. &gt;&gt; He tells us in another life story was the worst mistake he ever made in his life cuz he listened to his mother-in-law instead of listening to God. &gt;&gt; So he delayed delayed that delay cost him his wife. It cost him his baby. I got to be honest with you. I don't understand how all this works. Okay? He says that that day, Brother Dal, he's going to stand before God and answer for thousands of souls. How would you like to have that on your slate? But this is what I love about a man of God like this that can tell us his deepest faults and still rise above them. Oh, brother Josiah and say, \"I will not let that keep me down.\" &gt;&gt; How could you stand before people and preach to them and knowing that this you have to answer for? How would it not make you so low and so despondent that you think, \"Why should I even try?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Because God had his number. &gt;&gt; And the same God's got yours. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he won't let go. Oh, you say, \"I've got a hold of him.\" Baloney. You ain't got a hold of nothing. You've let go. I ain't no telling how many times. It wasn't that you had a hold to God. God got a hold to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus got a hold to my life and he won't let me go. There's probably been times we would have let go. and no doubt troubles and trials. We would have turned loose. But thank God when I would have turned loose, it wasn't me. My hand might have done this. But the great power is this. I had a hold of him. All right. But whenever I would have turned loose this way, he said, \"I got you, Peter. I got you, Peter. You're going down, but I've got you. I've got you, Donnie. I've got you, J. D. I've got you, Carol. I've got you, Barbara. I've got you, children. I won't let you go. [Applause] Lord Jesus. I walked away and I went down and she looked at me. Hope did. And she said, \"Bill, that's my mother, but I will go with you.\" And I said, God bless her heart. She said, \"I will go with you.\" And I said, 'Honey, I I said, I I guess I'm carrying water on both shoulders and but I said, I I I don't want to hurt her feelings. &gt;&gt; And I said, what if something would happen to her and then you'd be worried all your life? You broke your mother's heart. And I said, \"Maybe, maybe we'll just put it off a little while.\" So, Brother Brandham put off a little while going out on the field, preaching, reaching to the Pentecostals. put it off for a little while. Or you said, \"But I'm bright. I'm I'm bright. I I'll be good. Even if I do mess up, God will fix it.\" &gt;&gt; So that's what you think about election. That we could inadvertently walk right over the top of God's word and God will let you get by with it. &gt;&gt; God's prophet walked right over the top of it, but he did not get by with it. He paid a tremendous price. As a matter of fact, in Christ mystery of God revealed, when he come back in there, he said, \"Every time I come back in the valley, talking about Jeffersonville, he said, \"It gets sparred. It's just dark and spooky.\" And he said, \"He still makes it tough on me, hard on me when I come back in here cuz I didn't go out the first time. &gt;&gt; He's still paying.\" &gt;&gt; 30 something years later. Will you go, Rebecca? Or will you say, \"Well, right now is actually not a good time for me. &gt;&gt; Really? I you know, I mean, I I I definitely going, okay, don't don't write me off, God. I mean, I'm definitely going, but I've just got some things I need to take care of. I'm just, you know, I I'm trying to I'm trying to win this man to the Lord and I'm trying to win this woman to the Lord. And I know I really shouldn't be as close friends as I am to some of these early kids that I am, but I'm trying to shine my light. &gt;&gt; And how is that working for you? &gt;&gt; So, while you're shining your light, who's compromised? Them or you? That's what I find whenever believers go to Dayton or or court and whatever you want to call it, unbelievers. Well, the first one who compromised with that believer in the word compromise by going with somebody that don't even believe the promised word of the hour. &gt;&gt; And who does the most compromising? They do. &gt;&gt; You know what the sad part about it is? Them denominational people and this that and the other, they don't really give up nothing of what they believe. They still believe the same thing did when you started fooling with them. But you're the one that give up this and that and the other. And the devil's laughing at you while you're doing it. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm right, brother Donnie. I'm bright. It'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I said, \"Maybe we'll just put it off a little while.\" And friends, there's where I made the worst step I ever made in my life. Right there. We put it off. About a few weeks after that, things begin to happen. The flood come on later from that. The first thing you know, my wife got sick. Billy got sick during that wrong. Right after that, the little girl just 11 months difference between Billy and his little sister, which was Sharon Rose. Notice in Zurich, Switzerland, telling the same story. Now, from here, listen, I I listen to my mother-in-law instead of God. and forsaken the church and went on back with the Baptist people. &gt;&gt; So you see, it wasn't brother Brandham's mother-in-law that compromised. It was brother Brandham. So he did it to keep from hurting her feelings. &gt;&gt; Come on, gentlemen. Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; It's okay if I read these quotes, right? I mean, if we're going to press play, let's press this one, too. &gt;&gt; These quotes are here for a reason. &gt;&gt; They're here to teach us you can't do wrong and get by with it. &gt;&gt; So, God was calling Brother Brandham to move into the to the light of that day, which was the Pentecostal move. But of course, his mother-in-law called him all kinds of names and this and that and the other trash and whatever more. You know, it brother Ram doesn't say that he actually called them that. But when he's going down the river and heading toward the dam and his boat won't start. He's cranking and cranking and cranking. God have mercy. Don't let me go over that. And he said the spirit of God said to him, \"What about them people you call trash?\" I've never actually found where he said that he called him, &gt;&gt; but his mother-in-law did and he compromised with her. &gt;&gt; So if people call your church a cult and you don't call it a church, but yeah, you compromise with them, I wonder if God identifies you in the same way going down the river. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Woo! Oh my. Oh. And forsaken the church and went right on back with the Baptist people right away. Plagues hit my home. &gt;&gt; My wife took sick. My father died on my arm. My brother was killed. And everything happened just in a few days. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Children, don't delay. God's dealing with your heart with a closer walk. Don't you delay. God dealing with you. Separate yourself from this man, this woman, these kids, this this this. They're negatively affecting you. Oh, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm delaying. I'm delaying. You better be careful. God dealing with your heart and you know within yourself that these people aren't productive for your life before God. There's preachers I've had to pull away from through the years. I don't want to do it. But if I've got to do it, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; I had to pull away from my own family. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My mama, my daddy, most of my siblings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a very terrible feeling to have to be done that way. &gt;&gt; But I do it again. A I heard the cry &gt;&gt; and my response was what was important. I will go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My mama didn't go but I went anyhow. My daddy didn't go but I went anyhow. Amen. My cousins didn't go. My aunts, my uncles didn't go. They talked about me. They run me down and still do. that I made up my mind by the grace of God because I heard the message from a messenger and it did not make me fall in love with the messenger so much, but it presented Jesus Christ to me in a way that I'd never heard him before. I loved him, but I never loved him like I did after I heard the message about him. [Applause] Oh my. Notice this in this sermon. Look at the title here. 1959, a time of decision. Remember, she had to choose by faith. &gt;&gt; She had never seen the man. She had to choose by faith and the words of a servant. That's the same way you'll have to do cuz that's the only way there is to do it. God sends out his &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean it's not singular? &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; they preach the word &gt;&gt; and faith cometh by hearing. And what do you think about it? That's up to you to make your choice. I would advise you not to put it off. You say, \"Well, I've always longed to receive the Holy Spirit. I better think it over. Don't think it over. This is the time. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It's the truth. I believe that God would heal me someday. As long as you keep that in your mind, &gt;&gt; you're a defeated person. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I believe that God would heal me someday. And we'd hear people say that. We say, \"Man, what a statement of faith.\" That ain't what Elijah called it. He said, \"That person's defeated.\" &gt;&gt; Think of it. Why? Because their faith is being delayed until someday. Oh, Brother Donnie, I prayed and I've come up time after time for the Holy Ghost, and it discourages me. Well, what am I supposed to do? You're supposed to believe God and take God at his word and remind him of his promises to you and your children and them that are far off. I don't have to wait till I get perfect, my Lord. Children, if you're going to wait till you get absolutely perfect, what in you need the Holy Ghost for? But you give God everything that you are, and he endus you with power from on high, and he will finish up what you can't do. &gt;&gt; Some of you let the devil destroy you because you are delaying your progress with God. I believe that God would heal me someday. As long as you keep that in your mind, you're a defeated person. God healed you 1900 years ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the day of your decision. When you hear the message that Christ was wounded for your transgressions, with his stripes, you're healed. This is the time now to believe it. You have to make other decisions before you get married. You have to decide on what girl you're going to make your wife. You women have to decide on what man's going to be your husband. You better not put it off too long. He might change his mind. &gt;&gt; Listen to this sad story. Like the woman was here some time ago and she had two men. They were both good men and she couldn't make up her mind which one she's going to marry and she lost them both. God wants &gt;&gt; or brother Donnie, when's the next youth service? Because I'm waiting for the next youth service to get on fire with God. &gt;&gt; If I was you, I wouldn't wait another night. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you one thing, honey. If you want to come in here seven nights a week, I'll make sure these church doors is open and you can hit this altar right here and let the revival start inside of you. Don't wait for some youth preacher from Ohio, one from Louisiana, one from Mississippi, or here, there, or there. Why not waiting for a preacher with a briefcase? Why don't we just say, \"God, let it start tonight, right now.\" Why wait till Sunday? Lord God, let it start. This is my time. I will go. I want a move of God. I want healing. I want deliverance. I want the Holy Ghost. I want a stirring God. Why do I have to wait till Sunday? &gt;&gt; God wants immediate action. If you love him, throw everything else aside and take him. If you believe his word, cast everything else away and take his word. It's a time of decision. You have to make up your mind. &gt;&gt; I thought this quote was astounding. and souls in prison. If you've got any darkness on your life, won't you come right here around the altar now while we continue to sing right now? Is there a worry? Is there a spot? Don't put it off any longer. Now, he's now making an altar call for the lost, but for Christians that have a darkness in their life or even a spot. A spot. A spot. Don't put it off any longer. Notice again Genesis 24:56. And we'll close him momentarily. And he said unto them, \"Hender me not, seeing that the Lord,\" I want you to notice the word Lord here. It's not capital L and small O and small R and small D. It's capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D, and it's not plural. Wonder how this old boy knew this since he himself was a gentile. Remember, he was from Damascus, Syria. Hallelujah. And he said unto them, \"Hender me not, seeing the Lord has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.\" And they said, \"We will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth.\" No doubt they had all types of excuses and arguments of why she could not go and the longer she would have stayed around them as a human being. Don't make Rebecca now a superhum. You know what this shows me? It shows me even predestinated seed even elect of God can become influenced by your family or by your friends if you stay around them too long in a negative way. and they said, \"Well, now pray about this and pray about this.\" You know, I heard somebody that got caught up in that random stuff and they run off and done this and that and the other and you know, you better be careful going over at that church. I've heard all kinds of things about them people. Well, you probably have, but that don't mean most of them is even the truth. But what do they do? They delay and they delay. Now, I'm warning you, honey, just be really careful. Just so little questions of doubt in their mind. You know, you got to be really careful and we have to really pray about this. just go on a 30-day fast and let's just wait about it. What did he say? We put it before the Lord and then we'll kind of see what's going. He said, \"Don't you delay me. I need to get her and get out of here.\" And they can say, \"Now, honey, that's the first sign of a cult. That's the first sign of a cult.\" Notice he's trying to separate you away from your family and they're they're already pulling you off now. We're noticing you. You're going over to their special Sunday evening things and you're getting away from us. Oh, darling, we're so worried about you. We're so concerned about you, honey. Do they drink red Kool-Aid? Well, no, but the preacher drinks red Gatorade and orange Gatorade and purple Gatorade. But I've noticed he's the only one drinking it. But it must be okay. Yeah, it is okay. Well, I'm I'm just concerned about you because they believe really strange things. We do. We believe there's only one God. And we believe we should be baptized in his name. We believe that one God came down upon the earth in the form of human flesh and gave his life to redeem us. We believe that one God ordained his people before the foundation of the world. We believe that one God has sent men on the earth called prophets. Come on, somebody. We don't believe hell is eternal, but we do believe that we are. Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Donnie. Oh my. That that's really messed up, Brother Donnie. Are are you saying that that you think you're the only one? No, I ain't saying I'm the only one, but I'm just part of the only one. Well, it sounds like you say only the message people is going up. Oh, that's exactly what I do believe. But I don't believe we're the only ones going to be on the finale of it all. But this is a wedding and this is a wedding procession and only those that are invited get to go. Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, darling, please consider we just met this man yesterday. Now, does not the Bible say there'll be false prophets in the last day? Well, let me just tell you something right now. If William Bradam was a false prophet and more supernatural followed his ministry than any other prophets in the Bible and the devil had a greater false prophet than God had a true prophet, maybe we should switch sides. I heard of brother Random's name for years in Pentecost. Didn't know that much about him. I was sitting in a radio room one day making intros and promos for radio broadcasts. My voice was the beginning voice. Hello, we greet you here. Welcome to so and so and so and so. And then I would make announcements and then I would play 10 to 11 minute portion of a sermon. So that was the intro. Then I'd do the sermon part. Then I would do the outro. So one day when I was sitting in this radio room, I seen some books up here above my head on a bookshelf. So while the sermon was being recorded to send out to these radio stations, I just happened to reach up and pull one of them books down. Ah, sermon by the name of William Mary and Brandham. Well, it just so happened that the man that I was working with and working for at the time, his theme song was he was more than a man as he walked along the shores of Galilee. He healed the sick and he raised the dead and set all the captives free. Oh, I heard him preach it many a time. He was just a man till he stepped when he stepped up on the bow of the ship. He was a man when they woke him up. He was a man laying on the back of the ship as he rubbed his eyes. But when he spoke the word, he was more than a man. I thought, \"Where in the world did he get that out?\" I found out. I went and heard another man preach on the kinsman redeemer Ruth and Boaz. I sat there and slobbered like a horse eating clover and a new pastor. I thought, \"Where in the world did they get that at?\" I hear a man down in Kentucky preach this and preach that. I think, man alive, I read the same Bible they read. I don't get that. Oh, but I found out one day, brother Aaron, where they was getting all them little nuggets, it was bride food. Hallelujah. It was bride food. And boy, when I come to the message, all them preachers set a big distance between me and them because they knew I was going to tell where they got their stuff. &gt;&gt; They knew I was going to tell it. I didn't have any more sense but to get up and not only just hide it but you know just preach it and borrow a prophet's word but I got up and started reading it from where they got it from &gt;&gt; but they all wanted his anointing. &gt;&gt; Oh they all wanted his gift. &gt;&gt; And it's something how different we are from that. We don't want his anointing. We don't want his gift. We want his God. &gt;&gt; Right? We want his God. That that's that's what I want. We want his God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't just a great depths of theology. But one thing that got me was the way he talked to the Lord Jesus in prayer and just the way he addressed him. I'd never heard anybody talk to him that way. And it just made me so hunger to know him in the same way that the messenger did, his master. Well, let me say this to you. I will never know him in the same way this prophet messenger knew him. But I sure know him a lot better than I did. &gt;&gt; And now I can relate to him in a way that I never did before. Why? The messenger and the message and my response. So the prophet and the spirit and the bride all saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Me and Brother Daryl was talking about before I come out, let me close. Brother Daryl said he noticed here the other night whenever I was preaching that Rebecca already had a voice. So Eleazar said his voice. Abraham gave his voice, Isaac gave his voice. And after she heard Eleazar's voice, her mother and brother had a voice. &gt;&gt; Now it's Rebecca's time to have a voice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What' she say? I will go. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, bride. The spirit and the bride say come. Let him that is the thirst say come. And the final voice to the final age will be who in the bride. &gt;&gt; And what are you going to say bride? I will go. If my mother don't go, won't hinder me. If my mother don't go, come on, brothers. Oh, won't hinder me. If my mother don't go, won't hinder me. I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Well, I'm on my way to Isa. I'm on my way to Isaac 10. I'm on my way to Isaac, my Lord. I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. If my brother don't go, won't hinder me. If labor don't go, won't hinder me. If labor don't go, won't hinder me. Cuz I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Everybody now. Oh. Are you on your way to Canaan's land? Are you on your way to Canaan's land? Well, I'm on my way. Yes, I am the Canaan land. Thank ain't God. Well, I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Well, I won't turn back cuz I'm on my way. No, I won't turn back. Cuz I'm on my way. Well, I won't turn back cuz I'm on my way. Thank God I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Notice now. Well, I won't delay cuz I'm on my way. [Music] No, I won't delay. Getting the Holy Ghost or getting the healing. I'm on my way, glory. Oh, well, I won't be late cuz I'm on my way. Get out of my way. Devil, sickness, trouble, heartache, anxiety. Well, I'm on my way. Praise God. Yes, I am. Everybody all together now. Well, I'm on my way. Can Come on, children. Let's put our hands together. Let's just worship the Lord. Oh, praise God. I don't feel like it, Brother Donnie. I don't feel like it either, but I'm going to do it anyhow. I don't feel one lick of the spirit of God. I feel no anointing. I feel no chills, but I'm going to worship him. Hallelujah. Well, praise God. I'm on my way. If my family don't go, it won't hinder me. If my family don't go, it won't hinder me. Thank God. If the family don't go hinder me. Praise God. Is on my way. I'm on my way. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord Jesus. Praise be to God. Oh friends, how many people will wind up lost that never intended on going to hell? They had such great intentions. They was going to be saved. Oh yeah, I'm going to do it. Absolutely. That's my plans. I'm going to do it. I'm I'm not going to be lost. I'm not going going to hell. I I plan on going. Yes, absolutely. And they just wait and wait for what they think is the opportune time. and Satan tricks them and takes their life out before they ever get a chance. Or they get more deluded and deluded in darkness as they go and they finally get to a place they just send away their day of grace. &gt;&gt; And then they don't even want to be saved no more. &gt;&gt; But the question is, will you go? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let let me just set you straight tonight in case you're wondering. I don't think we're the only ones going, but I do think we're a part of a group that's going to go first. &gt;&gt; There'll be all kinds that'll come later. &gt;&gt; But this group goes first. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the bridal party. &gt;&gt; The bridal party. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Can we just bow our heads together? Let's just pray if you would like to be remembered tonight. You don't want nothing to hinder you. Men, women, boys, girls, adults, children, you don't want nothing to hinder your life. And if you've been slothful and lazy, can you imagine if Rebecca would have just sat there with her legs crossed and she wouldn't have said, \"I'll get this and I'll do that and I'll do that.\" That would have totally disqualified her from being Isaac's wife. Every move was judging her character. our moves in church, our moves out of church. God's judging us, our character. We want our best, don't we? Every time we come to the house of God, we ought to give our very best to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Lord Jesus, as we have our heads bowed once again, Father, dear God, I pray that you'd begin with me and search my heart this very night, Lord. See if you see any delay in me in any way, Lord, that hinders my walk or hinders this church. I know there's such a delicate balance in waiting on you and delaying. And people who are procrastinators by nature, if they're not careful, they'll bring that same nature and they will try to serve God in that procrastinating nature. So they procrastinate and procrastinate and procrastinate. Then other people who are always speedy, hasty, rush, do this, do that. They'll try to bring their same nature and serve God with that. It ain't no wonder we get in such messes. &gt;&gt; When the truth of it is you want us to serve you according to your requirement, not according to our human nature. So in certain times you want us to wait and in certain times you don't want us to delay and it may never be the same thing and even the same day. So basically what you're asking for is a people who will follow you. So at certain times we will delay and at other times there's no time for delay. At certain times we will wait and wait and wait and we will renew our strength. At other times if we wait we will lose our strength, our joy. We will lose so much because we waited instead of moving. If Rebecca would have said one word different, I won't go. Her destiny would have been totally different. She would not have been the mother of millions. She would not have been one of the great women of the Bible. She would have faded back into Mesopotamian life, married some local farmer, whatever more, disappeared out of the pages of the Bible. But oh Lord, she said the right words just like Hetty Wright did that day. That ain't nothing but the truth. Help us Lord Jesus. Oh Jesus, we want to say the right words at the right time in the right season. Father, forgive us for our slothfulness and other times. Forgive us for our haste. We need you, Lord. We need you. Lord, I've been serving you all these years of my life, and I have to say, I need you more now than I've ever needed you cuz it seems like there's so much that the children of God are going through. Brother Daryl, talking out about it before we come out tonight, all the sickness and the trouble and the heartache and the anxiety and the stress and the worry and this and that and the other that the children of God are facing. Lord God, they need your help. Father, is one of those that you've called to help them along. I need your help like never before to know how to guide them. Lord, sometimes they look to me as their pastor for answers and I don't have the answers. I don't know what to say if you don't give me something to tell them. I look through the scripture. I look through the message and search and look for an answer. And sometimes I can't find it. And sometimes I have to tell them the same things over and over again. And you're trying me as you're trying them. But we want to be faithful on this desert journey, Lord. For I believe that's where we are right now on the back of this power that's taking us from one oasis to another, one mile after another. are facing unsettled questions, fears, all kinds of noises and sounds in the desert night. Things that we've never faced before. Lord, I imagine Rebecca faced all kinds of emotions and things that she had never experienced in her entire life. We don't want to rise her above her humanity in these next few services, Father. But help me, Lord God, to be able to bring her down as a real type of your bride in this journey. Hallelujah. In order to be of perfect fit in the family of Abraham, she had to be tried. She had to not understand everything and had to ponder and wonder about things. So do we. But Lord, we will say it initially, I will go. We don't have any record that he ever asked her again on the journey. You still want to go? You still want to go? You still want to go? No doubt she did need a little reassurance. She need a little bit of comfort of this and comfort of that. Reason I can say that is because we do. And she typed us. you did when you were on the earth after you had fasted and the devil come to you and tempted you and then he left you. The Bible says for a season and the angels of God came and ministered to you. It shows us that you had laid aside much of your great splendor and your resounding glory because when you were in heaven in the form of logos, you never needed angels to minister to you. But it shows what flesh does what it even did to the son of God. The son of God being the logos in heaven that created the worlds. Yet when the logos was put in a human body, it was so weakened down by humanity that the logos needed angels to minister. Lord God, would you come in this building tonight? Father, may the Holy Ghost pass up and down these rows tonight of these chairs. Father, minister to the young, minister to the single, to the married, to the sick, to the troubled, to the weary. Would you do it, Lord? Our human bodies, it weakens us, Father. It pulls us down. Oh, come by here, Lord God. Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you tonight, Father. How many could just raise your hands up to the Lord? Lord, I need a little charge tonight. I need a little boost as it was. Father, come by here. Lord, come by here. [Music] Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Let's just sing it together. Oh, come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by? Whoever wants to just come up and stand around the altar, whatever your need is. Come on. Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by here? [Music] Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here. Here Lord come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Somebody needs you, Lord. Come by here. Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody needs you, Lord. Come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Come by here, Lord. Come by here. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] won't you come by here? Oh, somebody's praying, Lord. [Music] Come by here. [Music] Somebody's praying, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Oh, come by here, Lord. Come by here. [Music] Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, won't you come by here? [Applause] Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hands, I will sing of the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, [Music] I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in darkest night. You are close like no other. &gt;&gt; Like no other. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father. &gt;&gt; I've known you as my father. &gt;&gt; I've known and I've also known you as a friend of my closest friend. And I have hallelujah in the good. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you be willing to come up and stand around these up around the altars. Just pray for them. All my life you have been faithful. Oh yes you have. Hallelujah. All my life you have been so good. &gt;&gt; Lord God, you been so good. Every breath that I Oh, I will sing. &gt;&gt; I will sing our goodness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Just pray for one another. Pray for one another. Bear your one burden. So the scripture tells us, \"Oh, thank you, Father. Minister, Lord Jesus, to your children, Lord. Oh Lord, that they be a deck on this desert journey and they're weary, Lord, that feel downrodden and downcast. Oh Lord, lift your children tonight, Father. Bring healing, bring encouragement, Lord, whatever they have need of, Lord, in their walk tonight in their journey on this camel train. Grant it, Father, we pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we believe you have everything we have need of. Praise God. We worship you tonight, Father. We bless your name, Lord Jesus. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All my life, &gt;&gt; all my life, you have been so so good. Every breath that I &gt;&gt; I make I will &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing of the goodness of my God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you Lord. Your goodness is running. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's running. &gt;&gt; It's running after us, Lord. Oh, let it chase us down. Jesus is running. You're healing. You encourage me, your deliverance, Lord, whatever we need. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And I will run in the house of the Lord forever. Everything everything. Your goodness is running after running after me. Praise God. Oh my hallelujah. We worship you tonight, Jesus. We bless your name, Father. Thank you. All my life, you have been &gt;&gt; You have been so good, Lord. &gt;&gt; So good. Every breath that I make, I will sing. I'm going to sing the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Praise your holy name, Lord Jesus. We worship you, Lord. Let's just lift our hands together, can we? Oh, thank you, Lord. Or children, aren't you glad you responded and said the right thing? I will go. I will go. Now, we might need to update it a little bit. I'm still going and I'm keeping on going and I'll never turn back. There'll be no turning back. Be no turning back. Be no turning back. Be no turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. No turning back. Come on, help me sing it out. No turning back. No turning. Keep turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning. No turning back. No turning back. Oh, no turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. No turning back. No turning. [Music] He No turning. No turning back. No turning back. Now you white folks do a pretty good job singing that song. But let me just tell you something right now. And me and Carol stood in South Africa several years ago when I first heard that song. And black brothers and sisters there in South Africa, they can sing that song. Oh my. And this is one thing they do. Be no turning back. And they put their whole body into it. They do their hands like this. Be no turning back. Oh, I don't expect some of you white people to do it. You save all that for soccer. And you save all that for baseball and football and basketball. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all scream your lungs out at some kind of bunch of nonsense like that and come to church and stand there like a bump on a pickle. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Jesus wants your emotions like he does your heart and your soul. He wants everything about you. &gt;&gt; Will you say, \"I'll go. &gt;&gt; You let him have your emotions. &gt;&gt; What about your tears? &gt;&gt; What about your excitement?\" the pro. You say, \"Now wait a minute, brother Don. You're going Pentecostal.\" So, no, I'm going to mighty God unveiled before us in Philadelphia 1964. Same kind of people with the same experience, with the same emotion, acting the same way they did on the day of Pentecost. I'm also going to shreport 1965 at Invisible Union. There's only one way them acts 238 youngans act, screaming, hollering, shouting. &gt;&gt; Are we Acts 238 younganss? All right, let's sing it together now. One more time before we go, brother. Let's sing it one more time before we go, shall we? God bless you, Rebecca. Are you on your way? &gt;&gt; Are you happy you're gone or are you still looking back? Say, I wish I'd stayed at mama's house. Are you happy you're going? &gt;&gt; I will go and I ain't turning back. Be no turning. Pick it up a little bit. Oh, be no turning back. No turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. Keep turning back. Ain't no turning back. Hallelujah. Ain't no turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow the message. I have decided. It's Christ my Lord. I have decided to follow the message. I have decided. Reveals Christ my Lord. No turning. No turning back. I can't go back to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; You can't go back to Luther. You can't go back to Baptist. Christ is the word. Amen. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. We don't turn back. We don't turn back. Hallelujah. Turning back. Keep turning back. And this is what made it possible. Amazing. [Music] Grace, [Music] how sweet the sound that save a rich like me. I once was all [Music] but now I'm so found. So found, so found. Was blind, but now I see. Heavenly Father, we thank you for grace tonight. Rebecca, no doubt it was her first experience of grace on this measure. Something overwhelmed her. Something beyond her nature. Something beyond her learning. something beyond her heritage of her family, a supernatural presence from an angel of God that met her about 30 minutes before Eleaser got there and already prepared her heart. Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight. I believe that every bride member standing here present and the rest of those around the world have had a similar experience. It was more than just hearing some verses in the scriptures, more than hearing some miracles performed by a servant of God. It was a supernatural call. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We are told that Solomon was out venturing into his kingdom one day and he had been to different parts of his kingdom, but he had never been to this particular part and Shunum. And when he went there, he saw this lovely little lady. She wasn't as beautiful maybe as some of the other women that he had in his court because she said she was black and she was clumly. As a matter of fact, we know that she had been mistreated in her family and left to take care of the sheep. It was a great great prize of the women of that day to be fairs skinned and liked. In order to do that, they would have to stay out of the sun. But this little lady had lots of days in the sun. So it had darkened her skin. But she stole Solomon's heart and he fell in love at first sight. Praise God. Oh Jesus, we're so glad that we also have got a son of man tan. We don't believe in stripping our clothes off and laying naked out on a beach like a lizard on a sand pile. But we do believe in laying in the presence of the sun till all the greenness is baked out of us. Oh, the world may consider us black or faulty or whatever they wish to say, but you look at us and say, \"I loved you before the foundation of the world. And I gave you a part of me which would help you through your entire life's journey.\" Your prophet said, \"Many of you can fellowship with me on this thought.\" There was something even in you when you were a child that made you long for God. Even when others would do this or that or go this way or that way, there's something about it. And he said that laid in you then. We did not become children when we received the word. We did not become children when we received the spirit. We were children was the reason we could receive the spirit. We love you, father. Go with us now tonight, Lord. Protect us. Watch over us. Bring us back again Sunday if it be pleasing to you. Go with us now in Jesus name. Praise the Lord. How many can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord? Praise the Lord. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. We shall wear a crown. Oh, we shall wear a crown, my brother. When the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. In that new Jerusalem, we'll wear a crown. We'll wear a crown. We're a bright and shining crown.

and that's the truth i tell you friends it's just incredible and almost unbelievable from week to week the things that are happening in our nation and our world i'm so glad that our hope is not in anything less than the lord jesus and his mercy amen where would we be brother darrell and i was talking about it before the services but the dawning word would be be if one trust the lord i said like everybody else out here nuts just nuts that's all you can say thank god for his mercy you can imagine since monday over 1250 rockets have landed in israel by now it's even more than that that was of today the last report that i've heard of it so by now it's probably hundreds of more and yet some of the people in our nation are condemning them for defending themselves we've got congressmen we've got senators we've got so be like somebody you go home and somebody's robbed your house and they're eating your taters and eating your maters and sleeping in your bed and you go in and grab out a bald bed or a mixer or whatever you've got and say hey get out of here and people in your neighborhood say well rosa matthew you're some mean you're so rotten jim babe you'd run that thief out of your house you look at it in the natural sense of israel trying to defend their place and you look at the bride we're under a barrage as well a barrage of missiles and rockets from satan of sickness and worry and frustration and all kinds of things but we know god has his eye on his promised people as he does the nation of israel so does he his wife does he stop all the rockets no israel has what they call the iron dome and they're able to stop many many of them but they don't stomp them all we've got more than an iron dome we've got the blood and the mercy of god and the love of god but even with that he doesn't stop all the onslaught of hell but we know when he allows them to come through it's for our good amen aren't you glad praise the lord gracious and that in the name of the lord certainly privileged for us to be gathered together again tonight turn with him if you would in saint john chapter 3 verse 19. we'll read verses 19 through 21 we've been speaking about getting into the spirit i think this is about part 33 maybe something like that and really it boils down to two things the influences of two kings it's actually a tale of two kings one is the king of darkness king of lies king of deceit the other is the king of light king of peace king of deliverance he is our goel or our shalom and it comes to this simple simple thing light and darkness fighting they fight in our bodies they fight in their homes they fight in our church and our world but we have the promise light will prevail so mention to you i think last weekend when we read this earliest wednesday the scripture that john 3 16 is probably one of the most famous scriptures in the bible but i wonder sometimes how many people know john 3 19. you see people rejoice because of john 3 16 but they don't realize the consequence of when you turn down verse 16 then you have to deal with verse 19. and this is the same lord jesus that said god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the same lord jesus said this and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil now bring it down to america this is the condemnation that light has struck the nation of america but the majority of americans love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and now our nation is turned into hell the democrats will never bring it out the republicans will never bring it out she's finished [Music] that's right for everyone that doeth evil hateth light now here's the master himself and he certainly of anyone would know how to word this in such a way that would be just and true and i want you to notice in the way that he deals with these next two verses for everyone in verse 20 that doeth evil hateth light now he does not make excuse for them and say well really it's because they don't understand they really just don't see it if they saw it then they would do better he doesn't even approach it that way but he approaches it from the destiny of the soul or the darkness the everlasting chains of darkness that permeate from the souls of some that will never be quickened and notice how he places them categorically as if though they've already been judged for every one that does evil ongoing it's present tense and as a matter of fact many of them will never stop it everyone that does evil hate us so if they do us evil they hate us light they cannot just do evil and say well you know i really don't want to be a christian i really don't believe that word but you know i'm just going to kind of leave them people don't know if they do evil they hate lying always i know some good people and they don't never say nuts and only reason they don't because you ain't never crossed them right some of your friends you don't ever really lay the truths out there so you don't know what attitude they're going to have that's right but if they're ever exposed to light and they're of darkness they will have this darkness attitude for everyone that does evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light notice it's not possible that they will they will not they will not no never impossible no no hope friends we're dealing with many many people in this age that our souls in prison their souls are held in chains of darkness for everyone that does evil hateth the light neither come us to the light lest his deeds should be reproved now notice and then on the other side he says but he that does truth cometh to the light how in the world can a person do truth without seeing light and it shows the graduation of light and the way that god deals even with the elect but it still comes back to do us what you do what you don't do notice jesus identifies both groups by do us so they that do us evil in verse 21 he that does truths cometh to light now you don't come to light first read your bible he don't come to light first something begins to move on him he's from another land but he that does truth cometh to light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god now let me read you this involvement gilead 1959 cleveland tennessee our spirits has been born from above and in that land glory to god where we come from oh my god in that land where we come from the nature and the habits of that land is holiness cleanliness godliness if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land is strange to us might as well say amen and go home it's been good to be in the house of the lord this is it friends in simple terms it's the spirit of two lands light and darkness the spirit of two kings so if in that land where we come from the nature and the habits of that land is holiness cleanliness godliness if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land is strange to us because your soul and your spirit motivates you it makes you what you are and you'll never be able to join churches and get that out of you you'll still be a church member and make fun of people who preach against such immorals you know why you feel different tonight because the spirit of that land is living in you you know while the world hates you the spirit of this land lives in them i may like to be remembered tonight as we pray let's bow our heads together if you would lord it could not be said in more powerful profound terms i think so great yet so simple that it's the spirit of that land where we come from the very reason judas lived the way he did in the realm of deception and he must have been quite a deceiver because according to what we're able to read in the gospels there was not one of those elected apostles ever picked up anything about him that was negative in so much that when you said one of you is going to betray me they questioned themselves before they even questioned him is it i is it i is it i they went around the table because he was so close to the original of what they could see without the holy ghost they picked up not one thing but you knew all along who the betrayer was but once they received the holy ghost then they looked back and they began to see what their carnal eyes could not see he was of another land lord god i pray that you'd help each of us tonight may we lord as your people come under the influence not so much of this land but that land we are from that land is a land of holiness purity righteousness godliness forgiveness divine nature foreknowledge predestination a land of election a land of eternal life father may our spirits our souls be under the influence of that land for it is a land of light speak to us tonight father we pray we ask for illumination in the name of the lord jesus and we all say amen god bless you you may be seated you see no matter how much the lord jesus would have ever tried to preach and convert judas he could have never been converted he was baptized in water by the lord jesus like the rest of the apostles as a matter of fact the prophet tells us that when judas got baptized the devil got baptized so the devil must have wanted to know how it feels to be baptized in water so he allowed himself to be inside judah's body in such a way that when the lord jesus would have taken them down now there was much water in salim there was water and genocide there was water of course in the jordan so there was various places that they could have baptized and satan wanted to know himself you know what i think i'd like to get baptized today i hear jesus is going to baptize his disciples i think i'll let him baptize me you see it's not enough when we take people down in this pool up here it's not enough for them to come up and cry and say i'm sorry i want to be a better person they've got to be a new person so satan allowed himself to go in to this first step second step but he could not go into the changing of the soul to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the soul he accident went farther in this day than he went in the day of judas iscariot in so much that satan in the form into the form of arthur godfrey elvis presley pentecostal preachers message preachers and other false anointed ones instruments that satan in their soul would be able to experience the baptism of the holy ghost in their spirit it was even closer in this day than it was when judas was here himself one of the mysteries of the end time that people can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour of their life and still die lost and go to hell well praise the lord what a good way to start out the meeting tonight you see a person can have it in their spirit talk in genuine tongues have genuine gifts even stand up and preach and still be lost because they're lost from the soul out not the spirit so judas went went into the depths of god understood mysteries a partaker of the original ministry divinely imparted to him by the lord jesus himself his gifts were not inferior his understanding was not inferior so if you'd have been around peter james john the men of those day hearing them talk about the revelations of god the light that illuminated them judas would have been right there no doubt he could have talked about what the great things was that they understood whenever they come back rejoicing judas come right back and said i cast out devils in your name i heal the sick in your name you say how in the world could he have done that being a devil it was by the two greek words that was used in the new testament for our english word power one of them is excusia and the other is dunamis excusa is a delegated authority by one who has power to give you you you you you me whoever it is authority to do certain things but it has nothing to do with your own innate nature excusa would be similar would say to a police officer or a sheriff or a deputy or a state trooper that would be given power and authority to pull you and i over to write us a ticket to impound our car to put handcuffs on us whatever more because they've been given that type of power but it really has nothing to do with how much they weigh they might be as oh my they might be a little guy there might be a heavyset guy they might be brown yellow has nothing to do with the race the gender it is a delegated authority the lord jesus sent out the apostles not by dunamis by inherit nature but rather by excusa which was a delegated power you see he knew that satan would fall from the beginning so he separated his logos from the dunamis being on the logos itself if not then satan once the logos was written in word form anybody that could have full access to the power of god all that had to do is memorize the word then with the word would come the dunamis so it separates the invigorating power of the livelihood of the power of god away from the written word so it has the word written people memorize it they quote it and they even break into a certain element of it to make it live but it does not make it rhema word until the anointing of the hour falls on that lugos and then it quickens it and satan never has access to that so judas was able by excusa to cast out devils heal the sick so he sent them out to the two we don't know who went with judas the bible doesn't really say but judas had power to heal the sick perform miracles cast out devils whatever more like a trooper or say police or whatever more by that authority but he had nothing by innate nature now dunamis is something that comes into the individual as we said it before that we get our word dynamite from this word dunamis so it's something that's from within it's not just a delegated authority that you can do with or without a godly life but dunamis imparts not only power to lay hands on the sick but it imparts power in you to be able to annihilate the very nature of sin that we were born with and look for it it's not enough for us around the message to have excuses we must have dunamis it's not enough for us just to play tapes listen to me don't get mad you can play tapes every day of your life you can keep the tape going on your phone in your house 24 hours a day and be as lost as you can be because the tapes are not the token come on now i know that's contrary to what's being projected in this day you find me where the prophet of god ever said the token or the tapes the prophet said the token is the holy ghost it is that literal life of the lord jesus coming back inside of you and i now in this land that we are from we become baptized or immersed into that land which is christ jesus as i said opening up that is israel is under the barrage even this very hours i'm talking to you of all types of attacks from hamas and from all these other counter-terrorists and things that are going on and what do they want they want them to leave they want their land well look at it spiritually and see the bride of christ around the world has been under a barrage of attacks by satan in the last year so more than ever before why he wants you to forsake your land and say well i can't do it no more it ain't worth the fight no more i can't deal with this sickness this out the other but if you're a real seed of abraham you're going to stay on your land and say you devil i'm warning you right now you're trespassing and lord friend when god brings a deliverance for you whether it's a healing or a deliverance of a besetting sin whatever it is don't become confused or discouraged whenever the devil will come right back and try to take that land away from you or bring that same sickness or that same besetting sin and you find yourself being tempted by the very same thing that god delivered you from and you think what in the world's going on nothing going on it's the devil that's trying to give you back that sickness but you need to stand there look if netanyahu could stand there and warn the palestinians and say look you all keep coming i'm warning you now we're going to take this land and when we do we're going to push you farther back than you are now and we are not going to give you this land i think we need to serve the devil that notice tonight for those of you that are battling sickness or oppression or financial straits whatever it is in your home you need to give that devil a warning and say look you better get back because i'm giving you a warning right now as the son of god as a daughter of god i'm going to push against you and i'm going to push and i'm going to push and what i take i am not giving back so you better get gone while the getting's good because i'm not the majority but jesus in me are the majority and he's promised me healing he's promised me deliverance he's promised me peace he's promised me power whatever i need from my journey i've got a whole checkbook praise god made out in my name all i've got to do is sign it and claim the promise but will you have to fight you will you'll have to fight to get it and you'll have to fight to keep it but as children of abraham that's what we do that's who we are it's never been the way of the children of god to have everything handed to him on a silver platter daniel was not handed to him shout right me shack in a bid to go their victory was not handed to them you imagine they had to buy it so do we have to battle it was not handed to the prophet of god he had to fight and the prophet said when you get saved it's a fight from the time you get saved until the day you die but we are willing to accept every challenge that satan brings against us why because we are not fighting for ourselves we are not fighting for our agenda our agenda is of the kingdom of god our nature is of the kingdom of god our plan is of the kingdom of god we are not our own we belong to him therefore what he wants us to do is what we will do we will take our land we will fight for our land and we will keep our land hallelujah praise the lord and of course the devil will try to do you like some of the left-leaning and politicians in america want to do israel shame on you all for defending your land shame on you all for doing this shame on you all for preaching this and preaching that you ain't shaming us this is our land this is our territory this is our rights as the people of god those who have left this message have given up their land they want to dress the way they want to just act the way they want to let them do so but i'm not doing it that's not my land my land is a land of holiness a land of righteousness amen a land of purity a land of godliness look friend our land is a land of healing it is a land of miracles it is a land of supernatural power of god it is a land of angelic oh praise god it is a land of angelic visitation as a son or daughter of god you have a right to angels visiting your home [Applause] so it's up to us we can go down in our bomb shelters and hide under the bunker oh devil ease up ease up ease up oh my i remember years ago when i preached on demonology and my it's been several several years ago but all hell all hell seemed like it broke loose against our church so many people started fighting all types of sicknesses all time it was absolutely unbelievable and one day when i was in prayer and i was waiting on the lord and just i pray and then i wait brother baby said the problem is when we pray we do all the talking and he said we ought to pray and then listen for a while and be quiet so i waited and i waited on the lord and the lord wouldn't tell me nothing the lord was really silent and i've learned that whenever god's silent satan sure loves them opportunities then he'll come to you and he'll go to try to talking to you so i prayed and i talked to the lord and i waited on the lord and then i i just got signed a little bit and said well lord i'm gonna let you talk and the lord didn't say nothing well i just laid there on my face and laid there for a bit and the lord said nothing well old blabber mouse come up and he said i'll tell you what i'll do i'll make a deal with you you let up on me and i'll let up on the church i'm going to tell you something friends you think that preaching singing worshiping obeying the word of god does not absolutely destroy satan's kingdom that satan who who am i some little video spindly to before a preacher that does nothing done nothing amounted to nothing in life but demons out of hell would want to make a deal with you wonder why i didn't go to biden or trump or go to putin or some great person you know why we call them great because we don't know what greatness is i'll tell you who's great it's a sign of god down on their knees not just a preacher now but somebody that knows how to bombard heaven with prayers anointed by the spirit of god oh my when i heard that voice oh it's you know as a human being and say oh my i mean i just laid there brother weston as i heard that and something rose within me some of y'all probably remember me telling this years ago and something rose was in me and i said satan i will not let up on you as a matter of fact i'll preach more god gives me the more i'll preach it and the longer i'll preach it i'll make this series last as long as the holy ghost gives me unction now listen friend you realize what we are coming against that it's not against these people i hear so much it's not against this man or that woman or this church or that church but it is powers of darkness that we are warring against and they want to be able to take everything they can away from us that the lord jesus has given to us i'm sure you feel the same way as i do i don't want anything that does not belong to me i don't want something that belongs to someone else whether it comes to preaching whatever more i want only what god wants for me that's all but i do want what has my name on it i do want what has my name on it now if it's got my name on it i'm not going to fight you over my prison but i am going to take it away from you if you've got it why because it belongs to me and if he then belongs to me i want it deliverance belongs to me it's got my name it's got the package right there and it said to donny from jesus well guess what i'm gonna get that package i might be the last one to get it but it's got my name on it and that's the way you need to do the promises of god when they've got your name on them you stand right there i don't care what hell says and if hell came back and said i'm going to do this other you stand there toe to toe and said there's one thing you ought to know i know by now you are a liar you're a liar satan and i do not believe you so get back to hell and take your box of rattlesnakes back with you hallelujah you see it's the spirit of the land that refrain don't you understand what the lord is trying to bring to his people in this hour but brother dawn it's such struggles i know that i realize it's such struggles but our god is victorious oh my right in the midst of such difficult times it's during such times that his profound mercy and grace is able to anoint his people and their faith rise to a level that surprises them when it doesn't why because it's not just them it's him doing it [Music] let's pick up again what was looking at wednesday night ii corinthians 3 17. now the lord is that spirit boy i'll tell you one thing this used to be one of my favorite scriptures in pentecost oh i love this scripture and i was ignorant about it but i loved it i sure love it now now the lord is that spirit and what the spirit of the lord is their liberty now that was one of our favorite shouting quotes in pentecost those of you that was in pentecost you know what i'm saying that boy we get up here hallelujah oh by the spirit of the lord is our liberty oh but get the music going and everybody hallelujah there's liberty well now i look back and realize a lot of that was just emotional work up by the music because a lot of them people that was shouting really didn't have no liberty in their life because it's bound by sin so now we look at it in a total different light that where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty liberty to do what do whatever you want to do no you still ain't saved yet now notice what this liberty leads to now this where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord now it absolutely marvels me even i think about myself has been the pentecostal preacher and how many times i quoted this other verse about whether it was liberty but i don't remember quoting verse 18 very often at all because i didn't have an open fail i didn't have an open face i did not have a mirror to look into so i just shouted over the above verse and shouted over the top of verse 18 because i didn't understand it the first 17 made me shout out to be having a spell tonight at verse 18 shouldn't you now think of it but we all with open face to unveil or uncover by drawing back a veil we always open face beholding us in a glass which is already last wednesday night is not a clear glass but rather a mirror to show in a mirror to look at oneself in a mirror to behold oneself in a mirror but how strange that paul conveys this with open face beholding us in a mirror the glory of the lord so here we've got the mirror of god in our hands and we're looking and we're supposed to see ourself but instead we see the glory of the lord now remember the mirrors of this ancient times were a burnished type of metal so they would polish it really bright unlike our mirrors today and whenever the looker if it was outside or even inside the house and the light would catch it real bright it would actually hit the burnished metal and it would bend it and refract it and it would come right back and shine upon the face of it it would actually blind you it would actually blind you you could take and bend it to where it would come back and if you looked at it long enough it would put your eyes out because it was so direct so here paul says that we with the veil taken off of our face and we're looking into the mirror of god's word and we begin to see he said the glory of the lord changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so the gradual motion of the change into this image is expressed by the terms that he used when he said changed into the same image so the present tense implies a gradual transfiguration which is what the word change is a gradual transfiguration both mystical and spiritual and it is produced while we are contemplating christ now satan broke into the same thing and it is the power of spiritual assimilation so the world looks at all of these things that satan gives them and they look at pornography on their phones and they look at all these types of movies and they look at all the stuff that's going on in the woke their deal out here all the stuff that's happening all around us and what do they do they assimilate into what they are feeding upon they actually become that and the word assimilate is to process of the process of becoming a part or making someone become a part of a group country or society so the sphere of darkness is actually projecting all of these images that people don't know if they're man or their woman so you know the common practice among some of the people especially the left-leaning and the progressives and the liberals is that whenever they have children that anymore they don't check on the birth certificate whether it's male or female they leave that open so the child can pick which one it wants to be praise the lord in australia they're fixing to pass laws to where if someone is homosexual and they give their heart to the lord and they want help and they would seek counsel of the preacher not that the preacher tries to push it on them but they themselves ask for help that they need to be ministered to to break away from these tendencies the man can be arrested and canada our neighbor to the north they're trying to pass the legislation that either mothers and fathers cannot talk to their children if their children if it's a girl she wants to be a boy or vice versa that they will imprison the parents of those kids if they try to convert them now what's happening then the laws of sodomy are being put before the people come on children say amen and what is it doing assimilating into sodomites and the last days the prophecy as it was in the days of sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed so there is a great power both positive and negative in assimilation notice this in joshua chapter 1 verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate meditate therein day and night now okay just in case you're wondering i do believe in the power of meditation but not transcendental meditation but the meditation of a son or daughter of god on the promises of the word i dare say let me adventure here tonight and say we probably most of us even holy ghost filled saints do not meditate enough on the good things of god there is great power in meditating notice you notice a person that leans toward sickness so much and they just talk sickness and they oh you know they they claim they're sin well my sugar and my blood pressure and my this and my that what were you doing claiming that thing or it may be in your body but that don't mean that it's yours you need to send that thing right back where it comes from well my low blood my high blood my no blood and my my this and my that don't you claim that thing the devil will talk you into it and the next thing you know it's part of your family well come on now saints you need to meditate and the way you say well the doctor says i've got him that the symptoms are there but by his stripes i am healed i'm going to do whatever i've got to do to be able to take care of it but this ain't my diabetes this ain't my cancer this is not my high blood pressure come on saints why because the power of meditation look at people that all the time talk about sickness and live in the realm of sickness and they catch everything coming and going and some things that don't come and go they catch you too and they spend years of their life in the realm of sickness every time you get around them they've got something wrong with them and they're all the time dealing with this and that and the other it's a miracle they live to be past 30 because they're constantly talking about well hallelujah my you ought to spend more time meditating upon healing and upon miracles and upon the goodness of god instead of thinking of everything all oh my they got covered i've got i've got a temperature oh lord i've got covered oh no no no but yet what should we do why sure covet is real we know that it is but i don't think we should live under the fear of it 24 hours a day oh god oh god i've got it once oh god i'll get it again no if it comes again we'll factor it the same way we did the other time as we do other things but we don't need to meditate but we've let our smartphones fill our minds with so much news reports about this and that and the other how many of you get good reports of healing and miracles on your smartphone but it's negative this and negative and negative something else and you come to church and sit there like a bullfrog eating buckshot and you're as negative and down and low as you can be and then you wonder why it's your diet it's what you're feeding all that's why you're feeding on you're not meditating on the good things of god this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate you understand what he's talking about here psalms was not included in this wasn't yet written proverbs ecclesiastes jeremiah nehem zachariah zephaniah malachi obadiah only five books and what it contained thou shalt and thou shalt not thou shalt and thou shalt not thou shalt and thou shalt not but there was power in meditating on the torah this is why when you see the jews especially the orthodox and the elder orthodox those with their lawn the men that's got the little curly deals and the hats and all this thing and you've seen pictures of them and i've seen it also naturally they're going to the wailing wall the western wall so they have them separate the men over on this side and they have a wall there and the women on the other side and whenever they're standing up there they're doing this and they're little curly deals they're jumping around as they do it and man i'll tell you what i'm thinking oh lord i'm glad i don't have to do that i'll be sick on a horse they're sinning just like i don't see how they even read the book because they're jumping back and forth but according to the way they understand it the psalms in the book should bring such excitement to them that they can't stand in the same place that it ought to bring such joy lord have mercy if the law does that to a bunch of jews what about the covenant of grace to the bride of jesus christ the book this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success i mean he wants to be a successful christian i talk about how much money is in your bank account now i'm talking about being successful in god notice psalms 1 i love this first psalm blessed is the man that walketh not on the council of the ungodly nor stand us in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night now don't raise your hands but i wonder how many of us meditate how much time do we give to meditation on the good things of god you ever watched people i've watched people you've heard me say that before and i watch people when i go to doctor's office in different places and you watch the people of this age they cannot hardly even hit the chair before they've got their phone out husbands and wives sitting at the dinner table in restaurants i just saw it this week they don't even talk both of them's on the smartphone two dummies on smartphones now what do you think is going to happen to their marriage that's right do you understand that even psychologists and doctors are saying that the american people are losing the ability to talk all they know is snapchat and instagram and facebook and text they can't even carry on our president can't even talk they know what they're doing keeping them cameras away from that dude [Music] or you say poor old father do you want your youngans to grow up the same way that all they know how to do is use their thumbs god gave us a mouth to talk to praise to worship but his law his delight his delight his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law dost he meditate day and night all this psalm here psalm 19 14 to me oh it's one of one of my favorite let the words of my mouse and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength my goal you talking about a word how in the world could the psalmist david ever say such a thing by the west that knowing that he only had a law a torah an animal sacrifice and yet this man is praying with the new testament understanding this couldn't even happen in the old testament because the soul is not even converted listen let the words of my mouth now what david has done if you read this verses preceding this david is praying about different sins and lord keep me for this and keep me from that and forgive me for this and then david comes oh my he comes inward and said now lord i want you to perform a miracle in me it was a miracle when he made the universe it's a miracle when he made life but when he converted you it was one of his greatest all-time miracles cosmic light cosmic dust couldn't tell him no the planets couldn't say no they couldn't wrestle against his will but you were born to fight him your flesh born lost you were born to rebel against him but he performed a miracle in you praise god he performed a miracle in you and now you don't fight him no more you don't hate him no more you love him so much you live every day of your life for him it is a miracle you are a miracle let the words i hope you don't misunderstand me man's heart is one of the greatest creations of the universe it is actually called the crown jewel man's heart the crown jewel of the universe i know some of you think your head is where it's all at uh-uh the devil chose your head [Applause] god chose your heart he used eve's head in the garden of eden but god chose man's heart it is one of the greatest creations of almighty god the crown jewel of the universe from the heart oh and the heart can be so wicked it can be so vile and jeremiah said who can knows the heart but when god comes in i'm talking about these muscles and you're bumping i'm talking about that something in you that animation that animation amen not the muscle the door that beats and beats and beats but that's something inside of you the new fish your soul what's this let the words of my mouth in the meditation of my heart let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my crown jewel now watch how he does this let it be acceptable he's taking a man and joining the thoughts that come from the heart and spoken out of his lips and making them as a sacrifice to adonai oh may my words and my thoughts be a treasure of sacrifice acceptable oh lord now let me ask him you think god accepts gossip he's saying god accepts it whenever someone will tell us maybe a lie against a brother or sister we go to church with and we don't follow through like the scripture said to try to check that thing out we just like the person and we believe them and then we tell somebody else and they tell somebody else and now we're in the chain of spreading a lie against a brother or sister now you think god accepts that no i'm wondering how much of our speech how much of the meditation of our heart is acceptable and then we wonder why we're no closer to god it's quite simple friends the reason none of us are any closer to god it's as simple as it can be you can take your finger and point it this way not toward me now some of you would like to do that your other point toward me or your wife or your young ones or but just point it where it belongs right here towards you now some of your sisters don't cut your hair some of your brothers haven't smoked in years you haven't drank in years and years but right here's what you're missing your mind is so caught up with current events and you're trying to figure out who's the truth look friend you don't even know who to believe anymore you don't know which news caster is telling the truth you don't know if it's the bbc the cnn nbc fox news this one let me tell you i've found the great news source and you can totally trust it it's god everybody else you better take with a grain of salt all but they're conservative yeah right they're conservative according to them but the lord god is our source of truth and may i go on and say that god has a body on the earth and ministers on the earth that are interested not in political parties and political agendas but they are interested in preaching messages that will bring faith to the hearts of god's people in order to get us out of this hail that we're living in so he prayed against the sins of the body the sins of the flesh now he's praying against the sins of the mouth and the sins of the thoughts of the heart for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he oh you see i want my thoughts he says i want my words to be acceptable like a sacrifice was outspot brother donny what would i have to talk about if i didn't talk about gossip you want me to give you a list [Music] if i didn't talk about people in the church what would i talk about healing miracles peace faith deliverance heaven is that good enough for a starter for you that ties you over to sunday notice psalm 63 6 and when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches psalm 77 12 i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of all thy doings now are we as people in this age and society should we be concerned about the things going on of course should we be concerned that some hackers hacked the gas deal and you can't buy gas diesel yeah unless you've got a horse and buggy i'd say you should be concerned but don't do like people are doing in north carolina and virginia and tennessee going to the gas pumps and having knocked down drag outs fighting literally fighting over who gets the gas if you could get people that determined to go to church wow well the devil attacks them on wednesday and they say all right devil come on come on come on come on i'm sick and tired of you

church today [Applause] why say we stream i hope the lord don't hand a lot of you folks that think it ain't important to go to the house of god a streaming button for the millennium god never intended for streaming to replace going to church i know i know there's people that can't go to church but some of you who can and stay home because you're lazy you're going to be in trouble [Applause] well hallelujah psalm 77 12 again i will meditate also of all thy work and talk so i'll think about it and then i'll talk of all thy doings psalm 104 34 my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the lord psalm 119 verse 15 i will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways and he needs help [Applause] first timothy 4 14 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on the hands of the presbytery notice this meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that though that thy profiting may appear to all philippians 4 18 finally brethren oh look out devil whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are whatsoever sayings are whatsoever things are where's facebook where's instagram the gospel of google has replaced the gospel of god for a lot of people they got to google it they don't know nothing about matthew martin luke and john but they sure trust gates well his wife don't i'm not sure you should [Applause] there may be a little something that we ought to look into we put all of our confidence and all in our trust if you can find it on google google is not the absolute our god and his word is our absolute oh my whatsoever things aren't lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise praise god think think think on these things brother don't you live so apart from reality do i oh you don't have to get out here in the world and and work like all the rest of us and you don't know nothing about our troubles ah when you get about three or four weeks come see me and i'll tell you about what i deal with in the day you realize how fortunate you are not to be a preacher you see a preacher has to do this same thing friends i deal with deaths i deal with divorce i deal with improprieties of every imaginable thing than things you cannot even imagine i deal with things that if it was not for the grace of god a modern-day pastor in this day would go out of his mind under the pressure and stuff you deal with i have to do this myself if not you'll be coming to see me in the insane world so you have to apply god's word not as a family not as a church but as an individual well my nature has always been negative my daddy was always naked my mama but you're telling me you're supposed to be born again and you've got another parent and this is what your parent told you to you see as we look upon him we are assimilating his glory why don't we have more of it we're not thinking enough about him [Applause] sure you get up in the morning you want to know what's the latest is japan still on the map is israel still on the map sure you're going to read the news but don't read it all day long don't let your head be stuck in negative stuff all day long get out your bible get out the prophet's tapes and put them in your home and play them [Applause] my mind listen to this speaking of the prophet you know the way to find god y'all ready for this what's so deep oh i hope you can get it you know the way to find god is to meditate upon god think of god don't you see why satan holds our minds captive and with many of us it's not on sinful things it's just so many problems [Music] your nephew's sick your niece is sick her poodle has got the flu your aunt has got this your uncle has got that your grandpa's got this how many prayer requests do we turn in i i fear it like you do i feel it like you do every prayer because my thing lord have mercy on these poor people and we're we're cold heartless people if we just hear them and hear and forget about it but we're a people of god that love how can we hear such things and it not affect our hearts how can we hear of india having 400 000 new closest of cases of covet every day 4 000 people a day dying many of them are brothers and sisters in the message and not feel for them we have to feel for them but we've got to find a place somewhere to be able to cast our cares on him or it will drive us crazy we won't be able to take it david spoke of it how he would bind the laws on his bedpost i would meditate therein day and night if you notice it as the disciples on the road to emmaus that while they were speaking to each other concerning the lord jesus there he stepped right out of the bush and walked with them and if our minds would be more taken up on god and the things pertaining to god lord children it would be so much easier to live a victorious life in christ my you ought to put that on your refrigerator on your microwave on your toothbrush on your toothpaste on your mirror have it right there say devil get out of my way i'm claiming my mind back i'm claiming my time back can't you see it don't even have to be sinful wrong things that some christians cannot live a victorious life well i ain't got no sin in my life i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do that i don't know why the world's wrong right here you're just not thinking about him enough it's your aunts and your uncles and your cousins and and the price of oil and the price of this and the price of that and then satan knows for many people who have the holy ghost he ain't going to get them caught up and drinking he ain't going to get them caught up in pornography and all kinds of stuff for the world so what you do just get them caught up in the business of life but i'm taking it back oh what the devil done stole from me i'm taking it back oh my and if our minds would be more taken up on god and on the things pertaining to god no it would be so much easier how many could use for your christian walk to be a little bit easier every day [Applause] okay all right i gave you the script this is your prescription from dr donnelly reagan jr so now you can take him to the drive through and say all right god i need your help your servant read this from the message of the hour it's just as important to me as the seals or the thunders or anything else that prophet taught i need this field in my life lord god i need this field in my life and it's not that i've been thinking about evil and wrong and terrible terrible sinful things out there but just the things of life just the things of life do you all ever stop shut off your radio shut off your computer shut off your phone and just sit and meditate but see this way we meditate we want to hope because we're so busy and we're so important turn your dings off your bells off your whistles off so that devil won't aggravate you some of you love your smart form when you love jesus some of you might as well be honest you need delivered because you've got addicted to that thing [Applause] well i didn't get many amens on that i don't even know my well it sends you this to the how much screen time you spend every week don't it if it don't set it up so at the end of the week you can see how much time you spend on it you spent two hours and 57 minutes this week 16 up from last week and just write yourself an app or have somebody do it for you and see how much time you spend talking to jesus this week you spent 13 minutes and 28 seconds you're down 22 from last week and then we wonder why we struggle and we struggle let's stand oh my can i reach you one more here i'm blind bartimaeus also but in a different city there in phoenix as and as we said as he did in the days gone by it's time that bartimaeus now if our meditations is taken off of our church affiliations if our meditations taken off of our work or off the superstitions that we have in our mind superstitions that we have in our mind and place them upon him and his presence he will come and do the same thing tonight he did for blind bartimaeus on that day can you imagine it changes from the natural battles and struggles and things of life in a very simple equation by taking so much of our thoughts away from things that are around us and putting it on him and that releases his power to do what he did for bartimaeus which was what open up the eyes of a blind man not by fasting not by praying you know 14 hours straight but by changing the pattern of our thinking amen god i need help god i need deliverance god i i need this lord i thank you for all that you've already done i thank you so much lord jesus and all of a sudden there's a miracle right in front of you a miracle has happened and you say well how did that happen brother donnie wasn't here brother daryl never prayed for me no it happened because your mindset changed oh my he will come and do the same thing tonight that he did for blind bartimaeus on that day if we'll just do it if we'll just keep our mind stayed on him and notice it's when we're thinking on those things the bible said if there be any praise if there'd been a virtue think on these things now i want to ask you a question what good does it do is to come to church and sit in the meeting and ponder and maybe discouraged because we didn't get a prayer card or may be discouraged because of some ill saying a neighbor did or discouraged about one little matter or another that keeps christ lord have mercy children you mean he he ain't talking about us thinking of evil things or wicked things just us becoming so discouraged in church because we didn't get prayed for or somebody said something against us and that keeps christ away from us why we assimilate into the negative thoughts and that negative stuff so and so don't like you so-and-so said you noticed they wouldn't speak to you before church they wouldn't shake your hand before church and there you set the whole service is mulling over that and you're the lords wanting to deal with you speak to you and them thoughts just keeps him away from you oh god help us that keeps christ away from you it's when you're sinking on it that's when the disciples after the resurrection was going down to the road at emmaus and they were speaking about him that's when he appeared to them we got our minds on too many things of the world if we would throw those things off our mind and think about him his soon coming there'd be more revelations and power in the church but we keep thinking about the things notice he's not mentioned sins he's not mentioned wicked horrible awful things just things what am i going to do tomorrow oh my lord everybody that's not guilty of that even i can't say amen to them why we're humans i didn't know that he don't have to get you to thinking about somebody else's wife he knows he don't have to worry about bothering you with robbing a bank but just to divert your thoughts for a few minutes what am i going to do tomorrow oh man i don't think i unplugged my curling iron i hope it's just sisters that think that i don't think i turned off the crock pot oh no you know as well as i do that devil has hit you with thoughts that's to be so simple why he knows you'll sit there and assimilate the whole service the beans spilled over and it caught the counter on fire the cat the the cabinets is on fire but now you sit in your mind your whole house is up in smoke as soon as i said stand you hit the door you're gone you get home and say and what would you do you forfeited the whole service because you allowed satan to put it in your mind and you so assimilated you started sweating listen to me friends is it true with thoughts we can assimilate so much into those thoughts we can become paranoid what could it be by the if we could so assimilate into the presence of god every time we come in here and we would leave this building in rapture oh praise god let me close there'd be more revelations and power in the church but we keep thinking about things what am i going to do tomorrow what am i going to do next week will i hold my job will this be and those things are in the hands of god think on christ i've got to read one more ken it takes meditation on the lord to bring him in your presence i went monday after brother jim and i had lunch together to see brother eugene sister janet i sat on his little chair there and we talked for a little bit he said brother donnie i don't think it just happened that you come by today i believe the lord sent you by my way you know we've been talking about things of the lord you know things at the end time and just by him saying that thing i felt it in another realm so i could pull over into that right atmosphere and you could just feel it sister janet was there you could just feel the spirit change in the room what was it talking about the government talking about the end time talking about the signs of the time it didn't do it but whenever he broke into his need his need i believe the lord sent you today he said and that quick the spirit of god moved over into that channel and said we're going to pray right now children it's not me contacting god for you it's you contacting god and pulling me in your direction pulling brother daryl brother wes and these other brothers that are preaching you getting a hold of god do you believe you have that ability will you be honest with me tonight and say thank you man of god for telling the truth i needed to hear this tonight be honest with god now i said one more but can i read one you know sometimes we come to church and thinking about what tomorrow got to do this the next day i've got to do that i'm going we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world enter into fellowship with christ and worship meditating worshiping in our hearts and giving songs and praises to him thinking of his goodness and what he means to us worshiping in the spirit singing spiritual songs making melodies in her heart even the bible said if there's afflicted let them sing songs be happy be happy be in meditation always expecting god at any moment to appear to you praise god let's marry it oh jesus every one of you no doubt have needs desires requests something in your heart that you need from the lord maybe you're not sick tonight maybe financially you're done okay at the present no great issues going on in your family on your job but you want to be remembered tonight for this very subject that you've heard you want to meditate more on him sure this doesn't make us so heavenly minded we're no earthly good we will discuss political things we'll discuss the trouble of the world sure we will the prophet did but instead of meditating on that day and night day and night help us to be balanced you'd like to be remembered tonight in prayer both of my hands up too lord jesus first of all i want to say for myself i'm sorry i'm sorry lord i've given my time frivolously i don't think about another man's wife i don't think about robbing a bank getting drunk doing that that sort of thing lord sometimes my thoughts are just so caught up in the sicknesses of your children the worries of your children lord sometimes i just become so so weary of it all lord not just the people of this assembly but people from all over the world that would get prayer requests and emails and texts and whatsapp daily all over everywhere lord help me help me to find that balance god that i feel for your people that i love your people that i pray for your people the lord god i realize but constantly thinking in the realm of death and sickness and divorce and trouble and heartaches and this one done this and this and done that and this and sinned and done this and wrong and that one done that one wrong when this trouble is here and this trouble is there before long it begins to weigh on us lord oh help us jesus these parents are not going to stop being concerned about their children you don't want them to stop but you want them to find a balance in their lives they're not going to stop being concerned about their jobs the economy this that the other but yet lord you don't want it to dominate our lives are sinking you want us to think on whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are of a good report help us or we're honest christians and now we raise our hands before you and say we have been wrong and we need your help would you help us lord jesus maybe some tonight in need of a miracle in their body some need to touch whatever it is father would you move for him father i pray for brother bill younce tonight you say in the hospital lord heaven to have those stents put in his heart and then father being diagnosed with this pneumonia we pray in the name of jesus you had moved for him father may the spirit of god go down right now lord in that hospital room may the presence of god touch him we pray other needs of your children tonight father god we believe what we've heard thinking about you brings your presence near us so if you could move on a blind man's eyes and give him sight because some kind lady he said what is that noise what is that noise it's jesus of nazareth he said oh i've heard of him i've heard of him so he began to scream out jesus thou son of david the prophet said there's no way you heard his natural cry but you heard his face cry hallelujah and his faith stopped you maybe a daughter of god has a need in her body a son of god in his home some of these young people needs in their lives may their faith call reach out to you tonight lord god hallelujah may they stop you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah i'm crying savior savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling don't pass me by the lord whatever your need is tonight hallelujah if you like it to take a step of faith you'd like to step out of your pew just as a testimony you'd like to walk up here in front i'm not going to have a prayer line necessarily but just signify to the lord lord god i've got needs i'm walking up not before our pastor these preachers when i'm walking into the presence of god pass by me lord jesus you pass by bartimaeus pass by me come this way tonight lord jesus hallelujah brother daryl would you come up brother pray for the people of god hallelujah hallelujah maybe you need a stirring or refreshing some of you've been wandering for a long time little friend ain't no dummy i know enough about the holy ghost or not this word has read some of your hearts like a book it has read your hearts like a book and some of you have been wondering for a long time what in the world's the matter is man what what is going on this is your answer you've been wondering what in the world is wrong have i done something wrong no it's just simply you're not thinking about him enough you need to bring him more near and he's waiting on you to do it you see once you on him get your parts together you do your part he does his he does his you do yours but you see we tend to become lazy we want him to do it all all you need to do tonight is just acknowledge your part lord i'm sorry i've been too busy i've been i've been too caught up with just the things of life i want to think about you more jesus we'll talk about you more praise god just let him renew that that feeling in your heart tonight a crying savior oh savior do not pass us by while on other message churches you're visiting down in louisiana and mississippi and alabama and illinois and wherever you are don't pass us by you're at happy valley tonight lord god we have many needs many desires and petitions lord we're thinking about you now as bartimaeus did i believe there's people in this place right now father whose faith is just as strong just as pure just as profound as bartimaeus was grant their needs lord brother daryl just before we pray i was in cottonwood arizona just a few weeks ago during the service i just took a little thought on a witness of his majesty and was just sharing some of the things that i've seen our lord do there's a sister sitting there who had a weeping tumor on her chest she never came up for prayer just sitting there in the service just rejoicing over the things assimilating the things that was being said she went home took off her top to put ointment on the weeping sore that she had on her chest and when she took her top off it was gone it had disappeared during the service that same god that same god is in this building tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever heavenly father we bow in your wonderful presence lord we are so grateful dear god that you care so much for us lord to send your word to correct us dear god to refocus our vision lord to put it back upon you lord fathers we heard tonight dear god many times our enemy lord wants us to get our eyes off of you get our eyes on the problems god and get our eyes on the situations and the circumstances but lord as long as we look at the problem we'll never see the answer lord but i pray tonight in the name of jesus by the same anointing that raised my lord

of the enemy be loosed tonight god may the anointing god tonight set our feet back on the path of righteousness lord and holiness dear god that our lives will be pleasing unto you lord for we know that enoch took a rapture and he was not because he pleased you and before his translation he had this testimony he pleased you father and the prophet said god that we please you by keeping your word

sisters lord those that are battling oppression those that battle depression tonight dear god those who are battling sicknesses in their body god i pray in the name of jesus by the rising of the son

close save man hallelujah it's getting too close save man well we don't look to that or we concerned sir we're concerned we're humans we're concerned but that's not our priority amen blue we don't entangle ourselves in those things a man he untangled us he unshackled us he made us a free people tonight for the Bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free tonight or what a privilege people we are to know the truth they men Oh to know that we've got that thing it is there when he Satan knocks us down something in us gets us back up amen Oh hallelujah what a privilege people we are tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus it kind of such an honor to be able to gather here with a few that's gathered and with the Saints that's on the internet and I'm so glad that even though Satan can throw a great punch our God just got a stronger and a greater counterpunch tonight and amen he just moves right around and knocks him in the head anyway amen so we're grateful that we may not be able to similar selves together yet we can still gather ourselves together amen and I'm so glad that the Holy Spirit is not bound by state lines and borders and lockdowns and buildings and amen he's the same right here in Happy Valley in this building tonight as he is in your home making him the same yesterday today and forever if you have your Bibles to seem to turn with us to the book of Proverbs we want to read from chapter 3 starting at verse 23 it's a very unusual text that Lord just spit it on our heart last night and we studied up late and in most of today and we distrusted to be a blessing to use just a simple little thought that's really the only kind that I can bring and I was just thinking to I can preach like these brothers could sing would certainly have some church too not a man that just wonderful ha just the songs and the music that stirs our heart but anyhow we want to do what we can do and be what Lord has made us to be and we trusted to be a blessing to you tonight we want to read now from proverbs chapter 3 starting at verse 23 and may the Lord richly bless you whatever you're facing tonight whatever I want you to look to him and believe that even before this service is over he can do a miracle in your life that's just the kind of God that I serve amen proverbs 3:23 the Bible says this then shut up then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble and when thou liest down they shall not be afraid yay thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh notice it is coming when it cometh not if it cometh but when it cometh Amen be not afraid of the sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh Amen for the Lord oh I love this right here for the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken amen let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on when thou liest down to sleep o Lord father we're just so grateful for your presence that we feel here Lord no wonder God that you are our God Lord as I was thinking of these scriptures it reminds me of the prayer we prayed as a child now I lay me down to sleep lord I never want to get away from bad Lord to come to you with that childlike faith simply just to believe your word Lord that they don't have to be explained to me and figured out Lord but I can believe it and be happy in it simply because you said it Lord knowing your word cannot fail the Lord I pray for your children tonight Lord those dear god that's afflicted with the virus may your presence just go to him Lord and strengthen them god father we know that even while were yet praying the Holy Spirit can remove every symptom every affliction every sign of this evil Lord father we pray for different ones that come to our mind brother Wade Lord and may you touch his body God that he could swallow it enjoy his food Lord we pray sister Becky Lord you see her need tonight sister Lane Lord you see her need to not others Lord that comes to our minds God may your spirit move upon them we pray and Lord may you just come and take this simple thought Lord God may we be able to relay it to the people as we saw the Lord as we looked at it dear God Lord may it bring peace to their hearts tonight we pray Lord that we can just shut the door and let the storm pass by because we're safe and secure in your arms we love you tonight Lord we commit this service into your hands for your glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says it may God bless you may be seated this evening amen you know it always amazes me that we serve a god that is so great that is so awesome that he created the universes and billions of Oh billions of stars a God so great that he knows all things the Prophet said he knows every time that Annett my lord I can barely see in that and yet our God knows every time that an at-bat sits I the puppet said he knows every being where he goes into the comb to get his honey hook that blows we can't even comprehend that tonight of all the bees in all the world and all the honey cones in all the world and yet God knows where every bee goes in the comb to get its honey he knows every sparrow that sets in a tree he knows every bird that falls to the ground he knows every thought that's in your mind of God so great of God so knowing of God so awesome and a God who's so caring that he cares about the littlest aspects of our life God so great so awesome that even our canary brains cannot even comprehend him that God so great cares so much about the littlest things in her life that he even cares about our sleep for he said in his word when thou liest down to sleep be not afraid and when thou liest down thy sleep shall be sweet God has given us a promise in his word that I we don't have to have nightmares asleep doesn't have to be interrupted but when we lay down to sleep our sleep can be sweet he won't sir sleep to be restful peaceful he wants it to be pleasant you say sleep your brother you're talking about sleep I know I'm talking about sleep and I'm trying to get you to understand that's how much he cares for you my god if he cares about whether I sleep or not he cares about every aspect of my life this even amen amen he even cares about your sleep think about that tonight Amen brother branham in the sermon he said the little lady sitting back there with a little white jacket or thing home you can sleep at night do you believe the Lord Jesus is going to give you sleep from now on not a brain tumor not a life-threatening disease the woman had trouble sleeping and God anointed His Prophet to call it out and said do you believe he's going to give you sleep from now on you've not been able to sleep but after tonight you're going to be able to sleep that you might know that I'm his prophet or his servant that's your husband sitting by you do believe that God can heal him if God revealed to me what his trouble is will you believe it the arthritis will go from you sir you can go home now and be well and be a happy family a happy family because the husband was delivered of arthritis and the woman was delivered of insomnia the inability to sleep why would he do that because you see brother branham mentioned can't sleep 38 times he put those two words together can't sleep and out of the 38 times that the prophet mentioned it 15 different times was in discernment and while in discernment he mentioned every time while in discernment he mentioned it was caused by nervousness let me show you I just pulled a few of them up now I see you're having you're having some your you keep sitting up in bed you just keep sitting oh oh you can't sleep you've got your nervous is it that right a nervous condition and you can't sleep at night here's another one the man's going from me years ago your trouble started you're probably you look 15 years or more younger than what you are now he went back in a vision 15 years said it's a nervous condition that you've been bothered with a nerve trouble I see you can't sleep you're pacing around Restless it's a nerve cause you don't know what it is the doctors can't locate what it is they don't know what it is but God anointed the property said it's your nerves amen here's another one you had a feeling move over you that's the angel of the Lord oh he's here right between us right now that's see this here now now the lady's moving away from me she's very much distressed I see her in the bedroom she can't sleep she's walking up and down the floor she goes into another room she comes back she goes into another room she goes into a little place and gets something some kind of a little powder to take it to go to sleep and she's trying her condition is a nervous condition and she's taking powders to keep her sleep and she's taking so many of them till they just about got the best of her think just about got the best of us she's just about to go into a breakdown and be finished that's thus saith the Lord every one of them a nervous condition you can't sleep you're taking powders because I want you to understand one of Satan's tactics is to bind people with sickness and with fear and you'll find a lot of times the sickness is in our body it is a result of fear our spirit gets nervous our body gets upset your stomach gets upset it causes an ulcer many of the sickness of all goes back to nervous conditions in fear because the world of Satan's tactics he uses the greatest is fear Illinois no woman that's possessed with the demon to speak like a man to cause fear because that's what he operates in the realm of fear amen Oh hallelujah stew bound the people that fear the Prophet said now you're moving on you're the father you're moving you're showing signs and wonders the great Atomic Age is here nations against nations kingdoms up against kingdoms spirits fighting against spirits the people are nervous you said it would be fear up on the earth perplexity of time the stress between nations men's hearts failing for what a dig that we're living in mitts hearts failing them for fear perplexed of time distressed between nations the Earth's getting so nervous till it's burst and forth earthquakes everywhere Jesus said it would be that way there'd be earthquakes in diverse places what's the matter the earth knows she's doomed she's nervous the world's nervous but the church the church is rising in the gospel ducked away with security Oh an internal time perplexed the time nervous time Oh hallelujah the bride it's tucked away its security she is secured oh that my father had given me will come and no man can them out of my head that's security whoo hallelujah were not in this pocket we're not in a safe when I don't know what we are in his hands amen brother secured in the time of trouble the hour of gross darkness when gross darkness would cover the earth and gross darkness would cover the people because the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at nighttime they love darkness the Bible said men people loved darkness more than they do liked because the light would manifest their deeds a man that's when the cockroaches and the let's when all those things crawl around is in the darkness but turn the light on and watch them flee but in a time of gross darkness darkness on the land darkness on the people and the children look darkness the people loved darkness more than they love light when the spiritual darkness gets upon the earth like that then it's the time for the enemy to attack we're at that hour of gross darkness you know it sure showed me a video clip here not long ago of a river that was flooded out of its banks and the river out of its banks it struck a house and he destroyed the house broke it up and washed it away and that's exactly where Satan is tonight the spiritual darkness upon the earth has opened up the floodgates to allow the god of this evil age to unleash his destruction destruction upon the communities upon our government about our homes upon our families Satan is like a flood a raging river of water destroying everything that in its path have the people under a spirit of destruction because the puppet said God cannot bring destruction to the people or under the spirit of it that's why they're destroying their bodies that's why they destroy everything that they touch Satan is riding his horse he Satan has built his house now he's just wallpapering it this is the world that's around us as we know it today under a spirit of destruction Saint John 10:10 says that this way the thief cometh not but for to steal had to kill and to destroy he wants to steal your joy he wants to steal your peace he will store robbed you of every deadly blessing but I say let's not let him tonight God gave me joy God gave me peace God gave me healing God gave me deliverance that's the devil robbed us of none of it hey man he wants to steal your joy steal your peace Rob you've ever addicted blessing that Jesus died at Calvary for to secure for you we're living in a time when people are scared to death their nerves are on edge they can't sleep they can't eat depressed worried you sit on the people's faces at Walmart you see it at the red light you look at the VIPs almost like they're in a stoop it's almost like they don't even see they're in their own world because Satan has isolated the people isolated because we don't talk no more we got our phones they talk for us people are isolated don't you see Satan's this tactic has always been to divide and conquer divide and conquer you so you're painting the dark picture but that's what we're after is people are scared depressed worried they're tired the Restless that can't sleep they can't rest their minds are somebody told me the other day said I was up all night my mind was just racing I couldn't quit thinking what is it it's Satan's Kingdom all that is Satan's doing that's he's doing that's what he he's on this Howard she's riding the best he's ever rode right now safe and the Prophet said following you alone that great big King Lee Priest Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you the Satan trying to scare the living out of you like a kingly priests trying to rule over our lives Satan wants to rule our lives with fear he knows faith hallelujah he can't come again safe but he can work in the realm of fear if he can just get you scared oh I don't know who I'm preaching to but this is for somebody a great big King Lee priestly Goliath towering over the people I could giant trying to skill the liver out of you trying to rule our lives with fear we're living in the era or everything is a phobia now I've never seen so many phobias in all my life homophobia Islamophobia those phobias I can't even pronounce and probably don't want to everything I've never seen so much fear everything is the phobia people scared of lettuce that's a God's truth brother Joel look look at that brother people scared they go to psychiatrists and try to get hypnotized because lettuce scares them you can't make this stuff up fear phobias fear fears Satan's how to scare you thinking you go to miss the rapture a fear of dying a fear of losing the loved one a fear of being alone a fear of never marrying a fear of going out of the house I fear a bond to the markets fear of home invasions fear of riots fear of mobs fear everything is fear things happiness that people never thought people who think they're in control of their lives and all of a sudden things hit us that we didn't think it's supposed to be that way you know 2020 supposed to be like 19 we come to church three times a week we play volleyball after church on Sunday and all of a sudden it ain't like that no more all of a sudden it's changed all of a sudden the pews are taped and were isolated one from the other things happen that people didn't expect to get scared things begin to go sideways here he's supposed to be like I work God's people for heaven's sakes we followed the message but I was thinking about God bringing Israel to the promised land they had a prophet they had a pillar of fire they were coming out of bondage sound familiar and they were after Kadesh Barnea they had not been brought through many trials they had seen the hand of God a very beautiful picture of us 12 spies were sent to spy out the land I believe if my memory serves me like 40 days and they come back they come back packing a huge bundle grace takes two I'm just said my god is that a great vine see that's just one bunch that's how big they are they came back with evidence they came back with evidence that the land was exactly the way God said but 10 of them out of the 12 10 of them come back I said all yes like God said but but it's too hard it's too great of a place it's impossible that God walls they've got armies they've got cities that are well trained they're educated they're smart and we really you know as we look like grasshoppers and because we thought we were grasshoppers that's the way they perceived us we're a failure we can't do it well now God said it's a laugh oh yeah that's the grace but I'm trying to tell you you're not listening look at me focus those giants there they're scary they're big they're mean they've got tattoos it's impossible God brought us this far and we can't go no further and Caleb Joshua maybe your old man he stood up he said that's nonsense what more than able to take the land get me my mountain oh he's a quack he went in the alley well they're property you're gonna get get away from him we're trying to tell you there's giants in the land don't listen to em there's a bunch of hopped up faith 10 against two they were all numbers and that mob mentality you get a mob and get them in the direction they'll do a lot of damage a mob mentality tend against - it wasn't long till it spread throughout the entire camp how fast bad news travels and it's something somebody can get healed all I ever hear about somebody break a leg everybody hears about it how fast bad news travels the minute when it said we're not able to go up against these people that's stronger than we and they brought an evil report to the land that they searched out to the children of Israel say in the land which we have go to searches the land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people we saw an army and a great statue and all the congregation look how fast this fear went through the church the Bible said all the congregation except for two as far as I know all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night they were no sleeping in Israel that night their fear produced insomnia the nervous condition the report that they believed changed their whole attitude changed their whole atmosphere and they went from a people of God's people who had saw miracles and wonders and they become a people that were scared to death what are we going to do and they cried and they wailed and every time they take a breath to cry again they heard somebody snoring you know who it was capable that was no sleep in the camp because the report caused him to lose confidence in the god that gave him the promise but kind of never lost his faith he just laid down and his sleep was sweet cousin said I'll tell you one day I'm gonna sleep about eight hours and then we'll get up in the morning and I'm going to start with my sword now I'm gonna go get my Mountain now what made Caleb so sure when the opposition was so great God brother you're not listening you don't know how bad this thing is it's spreading throughout the message all kinds of churches people getting infected oh my lord you just don't realize how bad it is but look at Caleb he never catered to that fear he never even entertained it what make Caleb's is sure what the opposition was so great it's according to what you look at it's according to what you take care it's according to what you believe in what you hear Caleb was looking at the promise of God his confidence was in God the other kids were looking at their circumstances if you go to looking at your circumstances or look what's around you you're sure to fail you must never look at what's around you never look at what's around you look at the promise that's where Eve made her fatal mistake Satan come along with this theology and she mixes theology with what God gave her and she gave it to Adam and it caused a hybrid faith you won't have her faith will do nothing well I believe but hybrid faith commotions well I believe that the doctor said hybrid faith hybrid faith cannot produce life but faith in God's Word the doctor may say you're a double tensor but faith in God's Word can cause that to dissolve out of your body I've seen God do it I know he's able to do it amen she mixed it gave it to hi Adam a hybrid faith that's what the church has got today the so-called Church a hybrid faith it's mixed with fear and doubt and frustration are you hearing me tonight so if you've got four well I believe I believe the message but if you've got fear and doubt and frustration you've got hybrid faith hybrid faith is mixed with fear doubt frustration or brother I thought you said fear and faith don't mix fear and faith don't mix but hybrid faith and fear does mix there's splits with hybrid faith and pure faith hallelujah amen amen it's frustration if it was genuine faith Taylor continued on faith it wouldn't move when God says anything it'll be that way if God says it'll be that way the Prophet said if God said George Washington what's going to get up in five minutes I'd say get him a chair so he could shut down when he gets up because God does not lie we're just who's recovering from the from the accident or a woman from the Institute's coming to call me said mr. Ward can I talk to you I said yes ma'am said this is not about Jessica said it's about someone else I said yes ma'am she said there's a boy that we've got a class that he he got choked on a hot dog had sprain damage so he's not able to speak said his mama said they're Christians like you are they're Christians his father's a pastor also said his boys mother's telling everybody that God spoke to her and said on a certain date her boy will speak I said yes ma'am she said with mr. Ward here's what I want to ask you said if that's just a few days away and from what I can see there is no way that boy can speak and she said if he don't speak mr. Ward she was such a nice lady she was so concerned she said I'm so afraid if that boy don't speak it will crush that woman because she's told everybody that God said so I said well ma'am I am NOT a smart person but there's one thing I do know if God said the boy will speak it maybe one second before that time expires but that boy will speak because God does not lie now if the woman got an impression or thought not said that then that's something else but if God said the boy will talk he will talk because God does not live I'm so glad my confidence isn't that kind of God tonight not a wishy-washy God that spins a will but a God who speaks it and confirms it and backs it up and manifest it to his people amen amen Oh hallelujah genuine faith wouldn't move but she mixed it up with what Satan gave her turned it together said here it is you see Satan wants you to see the problem but not the answer he wants you to see the symptom but not the healing he wants you to see the chaos but not the calm he wants you to see the storm but not the rainbow the darkness but not the light but I say to you don't see the problem see the answer don't look at the symptom as long as you look at that arm as long as you look at that throat you'll never be able to swallow don't look to that look to that either a my head so nervous Said's what is it the Prophet said the churches are in an erotic age every church is proselyte in pulling and fussing and steward so neurotic aids the world in chaos but I say stand still God's calling his church to halt see stand still don't be jumping around running around not knowing what you're doing be sure be sure whom you believe be sure of your testimony be sure of your experience be sure of who you are and stand on it I'm not a Christian because I feel like it I'm a Christian because I met God's requirements amen amen amen be confident the one who gave the promise had to give a solemn warning to the church stand still God always commands to stand still before he does anything stand still and see the promises of God God doesn't make a promise that he can't keep God will bankrupt heaven before he'll let one promise of his word fail Oh hallelujah tonight we have a word from the Lord amen he told us these things would come he told us this time would be he told us what to look for did he not do it did he not prepare us did he not make us aware for the signs and the times in the hours that were living in is to take none of us by surprise he said these things would come men's hearts would sell for fear in a day of fear it's not something that's coming in here a man told us what to look for he said when these things begin to come to pass they lift up your heads your redemption comes back comes coming 9 amen you see tonight my brother my sister the prophecy said that's my message to the church it stands still and looked to the promise stand still don't be caught up on all this fanaticism we're going on don't get caught up in taking sides and all these things that's going on be sure be sure in whom you have believed they may stand upon the promise of his word of who we are the seals have been open to reveal to us who we are where we come from what our position is the sons and daughters of God he's gave us these things not to put on a chef somewhere not just to marked up with a highlighter but he gave us these things to believe it and to live it amen oh I'm so happy too that brother Louie we serve a God who turns water to wine I love it right there turns water to wine and some of the best wine he ever put to you lips touch water to what rain to sunshine fear into peace death into life sickness into health sorrow into joy sinners into Saints it can do the impossible how do you know he can do the impossible look at me look what he done to me look what he's done for you brother job if we can lie down at night then we can sleep can I sleep can be sweet because our confidence is in him and what he said and what he said he will do what he said we will be here we can rest oh brother Darrell thoughtful bad it's off don't don't worry about that don't look at that he should be concerned yes concerned sir we're humans were concerned about a fella I'm not saying don't be concerned I'm saying don't fear it don't get caught up in it that the Death Angel pass we're safe and secure we're locked in with him when I doing that now we could have sleep knowing his eyes on the sparrow and he watches over me his eyes ever upon me it remember Billy Paul wooden I don't have to get it he was he was thirsty wanted to drink brother Ben was tired been praying for the sick and I think there's Billy Powers crime holding water and he said Billy get up and get it yourself I'm tired something like that he said the angel of the Lord said go to your son the brother brems said he got up and got him by the hand and I think all the way through the house he slipped on a rug because the angel the angel Karen is watching over his home watching over his family watching over his children and he didn't just do that for the branham's he does it for the Reagan's the officers the wards the alias the Browns he does it for all God's children his as ever a bonus is not forgotten this he's aware of every thought every weakness everything that we have God knows aim ahead if he knows where a beat gets his honey he knows what you're thinking tonight he knows what will happen tomorrow he knows what I face next week I don't know that he does know I know he knows my name and everything will be all right amen confidence in him he's given us his word and that word will not fail because God can't fail and God is his word heavens and earth shall pass away but God's words shall never pass away I saw the video brother weight of a car accident a man was coming home from church and he ran off the road struck the telephone pole the car burst into flames it burnt to the ground even the tires the rubber tires exploded and burnt off the rims and in the car on the dash was the man's Bible because he was coming from church and he laid it upon the dash and everything in that car inside outside was consumed but the Bible the man reached in and pulled it out open to death you could read the words in the Bible because when the board passes through the fire the fire will not harm you if that word residual if that word if that were visiting me brother Larry if that word hallelujah this bride is not a denomination she is not an organization she is his word for this hour manifested man we can no more fail than God's work and fail we are undefeatable nothing could stop this Friday but hallelujah tonight we can lay down our sleep can be sweet because we know my daddy got it all in control he's given us the confidence of his words John 14:27 peace I leave with you my peace are given to you not as the world giveth give I unto do let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid isaiah 41:13 for

went to Jesus in the boat I know I preach don't hear not a while back but what I was looking at is my mind way straight back to that story of Jesus in the boat knowing the storm was covered knowing it would be a cat 5 hurricane no doubt a major storm knowing the cells would be torn no the boat would fill with water knowing that the sciples would be frenetic and woods filled with fear screaming and running around he knew every bit of that because he was the word yet what did he do he laid down and he went to sleep because the word said with all the hair stem that shall not be afraid sleep sweet he just laid down and went to sleep because he knew the word would override the storm be not afraid of a sudden fear me not afraid of the sudden storm being unafraid of the desolation of the wicked did not afraid when it comes by the Lord shall be that confidence that Lord shall bear that confidence his sleepless week because he knew who he was hookah Oh God let that strike us tonight his sleep was sweet because he knew who he was and he had confidence if the God who made him that that he would pass to the other side because the Son of God had spoke the word who were the son of God Bob faith takes the word into his heart and spits it back upon his lips every mountain must move it's just the same as deity speak God give me that confidence in your word that in the hurricane category five storm I can get some of the best sleep sleep she'll be sweet laughter wake up are you tired no I feel pretty good that was a restful sleep what's the matter what's going on oh oh it's a storm it's a peace be still okay let's go to the other side Psalms 27 the host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the hosts you remember Elijah remembers out there camping okay hazel Elijah and he got up that morning don't know how he got hazed to be in the servant he said put the coffee on him okay he goes out to get the coffee and he walks outside the Tennyson hey Raj better come out here what's the matter you better come and see and the largest steps is head outlet and he looks around hey Shou well my goodness there's more of us than there are them make the coffee and I just go on I don't to be disrespectful but are you sure What did he say God opened the boy's eyes and I say to you didn't I hole in our weakness and we may be looking so weak but as brother Tommy's been preacher in perfect weakness comes perfect strength and I say to you tonight there's more of us there's more than us so we are an army we're two armies amen the hostess kept against me my heart shall not fear though this war shall rise against me and this will I be confident one thing about the side of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to enquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock Philippians 1:6 says be confident being confident of this very thing that he was begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he never brought us this far to leave us he never told us to swim to let us drowned he never umbilical nests to move away and he never lifted us up to let us down he never created us to forget us he created us for himself [Laughter] that's why Satan hates us what he wants to destroy what God created for himself it was anything he ever asked for he didn't have a car he didn't have a chariot he didn't help us he didn't have more than one change of clothes as far as I know but he never asked God for a new suit to preach it he never asked God for a new tractor idea he never asked God for a good out the only thing he ever ask the Father for was both foolish be a confident of this very thing he that started the hook I've never done it myself but you never did you you was looking for you he come looking for us we wasn't trying to find Elijah God sent Elijah to find us a bird being competent in this very thing that he who started the work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ like Ruth like Ruth were arrested we're just resting waiting on his Lord he finished the work at Calvary but before he can come and take us to his home he goes home first to prepare a place for us so we're just resting in sleep sweet sleep resting relaxing remember the prophet of God said under the Seventh Seal it's laxing time why because the open of the word reveals to us who we are brother Joe I don't have to guess no war I know I come from God I know I go back to God I know that my DNA is God's DNA and I can no more die than God can die how can no more be lost than God the seals revealed them to me my position he just didn't tell me who brother Branham was but the opening of the work he come to tell me who I am and I'm resting now waiting on him to build the home he promised to build for his queen that Ruth were West resting he said let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you so because you're my bride I don't keep secrets from you I would have told you so I told you I felt good but you understand this word this message is God's very hard to us sir to us his love secrets think of it let not your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many men in wasn't so I'm what I told you but I'll go and prepare a place for you if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again I will return again and receive you to myself home brother bread how do you love you to that there is no peace to a troubled heart to a sinful heart there cannot be peace the man longs to drink he calls because that life he thinks he's having a big time it shows his emptiness take a man make a million dollars he wants to take a man that goes to party drinks one drink tonight he wants another take a man lives untruth his wife once you live it again vice versa see it's something he's never satisfied he might have a million dollars in his hand ten million in his hand he lays down at night with a drunken still on him he wakes up the next morning haunted nightmares troubled mind and you call that peace that's no peace that's the world today trouble sleep nightmares who died long ago someone I think it was in this church somewhere I was preaching I believe it was in they don't matter who it was that somebody come to me with having nightmare said I have nightmares at night I said you don't never have to have another one you let your nightmares right here take good dreams and go back with them you have to live that way troubled Minds can't rest can't stop thinking about what's going on he never wanted us to live that way that's not the way he wants us to live I give you peace not as the world giveth give unto thee the man I'm coming to a close a man may not have a pillar to press his head to oh I love this right here a man may not even have a pill at the press's head - he may not even own a decent pair of shoes or be able to have a decent meal in his house but if God reigns in his heart he can go to bed happy and he wakes up happy it's a lasting peace because he's got confidence that God told David I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed beggin for bread so when I have meat of it he will provide it for me so troubalert you'll give it to us not when we think we need it but when he knows it'll be right old if you go to bed happy and he wakes up happy it's a lasting peace it's something that God does it's our confidence in our Lord that he'll never leave us nor will he forsake us brother sister he said brother Harry your brother's come

Lord we'll sing a song I don't regret a [Music] mile come on go ahead brother Bobby this makes me God's grace does for us um as many of you know I was diagnosed with therosis of the liver and a 10 cm Mass on the right side of the liver this was in about May of 2022 we had took a family trip to the Ark in Kentucky and I became very sick and while I was there I broke out in a rash that covered about 80% of my body my temperature was high I made it back home and went to the emergency room and they thought they titled it maybe a boil skin disease uh I I just looked like I'd been boiled in oil that's how my whole body looked and uh they didn't know what to do for me uh they sent me home then it escalated till I was hospitalized and they found out out it was a rare form of sasis and it only happens in random cases uh Mayo Clinic has treated two cases of it and the rest the doctor said it most doctors had never seen it on a human it was only in textbooks that they had saw it so God brought me through that but in the meantime I was uh began to swell in my abdomen and they had uh the doctors had done MRI and they determined I had therosis but I had to go in for a parenthesis and they had taken actually nine and a half 2 lers of fluid from me so I went on for a little while the fluid began to gather again and usually when this happens you're not too far from the end is what they say sometimes so but I was trusting God so I go back again they take 8 and 1/2 2 L again then my right lung filled and they took a one L of fluid out of my right lung I sat and watched them draw it out into something like a coke bottle I was uh 6 years old and we had a chance to go to brother braham's meetings in Chicago Ohio in 1960 and we we were there for five nights and two things that I remembered we were in a Pentecostal Church growing up there was a lady that they requested prayer for her name was Polly Reed and she she was in Middletown Ohio and you'll hear it on the tape it is I Be not Afraid we our family was setting two rows of seats from her when brother bam called her out he said that light was circling over there it landed first on a lady beside of her then it moved over to her and he told her he said you have a hole in your heart and you're going to die well we had just heard that testimony about 3 weeks before that in our hometown Church in Virginia never did we believe that we would see that lady so she was healed immediately I'm giving you this background to to try to encourage you with faith uh on the night he preached the reject the king there was a lady laying across from me on a stretcher and she looked like the great niece of Florence Nightingale she was Skin and Bones she's able to barely raise her hand up off the cot brother R's getting ready to leave the platform and he turned back and looked in our Direction he said what was that past me he said that wasn't an uler he said that was a cancer devil well he immediately prayed for her and I saw her with my own eyes get up off that cot and Shout to the glory of God I whispered to my mother I said how is she standing on those legs or nothing but broomsticks but she did that was a platform for for the faith that I I got when this when I got this diagnosis so I go to the doctor and they say well you got the therosis you got a 10 cm Mass it's possibly cancer first wanted to do surgery maybe a transplant then they come back and said you don't qualify for either so I said you you giv me no hope medically they said no I said well I've got a high power that has the final answer so I would not take any drugs any chemo uh they they actually got mad at me because I wouldn't go the route they wanted me to go but seeing this from my childhood I knew God was the same yesterday today and forever and I have testified that to many of these brothers they can tell you that I've said that after saying this as a young boy that God was the same and he still is I don't care what you're going through what you've been diagnosed with you don't have fear and you get up every day and you testify you thank God for healing you that's what I did and I'm still standing here today they did a MRI and a again about a year ago the doctor three months ago said well you know you've got cancer don't you I said well that's what they say I never have said I have this or I don't have it I said they say I have it but I'm not testifying to that so they don't you know they couldn't couldn't hardly grasp that so but anyway uh I was uh recovering doing better and I was on a platform on Wednesday night playing the guitar but I still very weak in my body I was hardly able to walk brother Daryl had prayed for his last person here and uh I I wanted to get up and go down but I was too weak I didn't think I could get back up if I did so I said God I saw this as a child I said I don't have to go to him you can send him to me that was the very words I said in my heart he prayed for the last person I was sitting here in the old church he put his coat across his arm he walked toward me and he turned around looked at me like he had never seen me before he walked straight to me and started praying for me from that time on my health started turning and by the grace of God I'm standing here today and can give you this testimony no matter what the devil tells you don't accept it it's it's not the final answer he's a blood and go go about your life brother BR said go about your life and don't fear I had no fear I can honestly say with my hand over my heart when they told me the diagnosis I walked through the valley of the shadow of death but I had no fear because I knew if he he took care of me all the rest of my life he could do it this time that's right so brothers and sisters no matter what he tells you don't fear it brother Ram said do not fear it and you go about your life and you sing and you give God praise and you thank him every day for what he's done and you will see the results God bless you I think brother Bobby could say that he doesn't regret one mile that he's traveled for the Lord and that right there is why because if he didn't believe in him he could have left him there to die but instead he healed him and there he is amen let's sing this old song I don't regret one mile I've traveled for the Lord and I don't re ret one time I trusted in his words I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m that I traveled for the Lord let's sing it one more time oh I don't regret one m i Trav for the Lord and I don't regret one time I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m I traveled for the Lord no oh I don't regret [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] D for the you can say Amen to that can't you brother Jackie seemed like I was uh well I was just a a young boy and the Lord spoke to me down on the river that day and told me to preach then he spoke to me told me when I turned 30 I'd start traveling and so when I turned 30 I got an invitation down into South Carolina and that kind of got me traveling and then I traveled for years and worked 40 hours a week and I come home sometimes 3 4:00 in the morning and sat in the chair for a little bit and throw water in my face and go to work then in June of 2000 I was coming back from lunch going back to surgery come around the corner of a hallway there at the VA hospital and just walked right into the presence of the Lord he was just hanging there and I just begin to weep a voice spoke to me and said go preach my word so in 2000 I went fulltime and 24 years later I don't regret a mile that I've traveled for the Lord amen he's he's been so good for all of us and that's what we want to look at tonight is to know that none of us are here by accident but there's a purpose for all of us if you have your Bibles turn with us tonight to the book of Ephesians want to read from Ephesians chapter 3 verse 11 and brother Justin talking about 911 as we remember that that day and he was right he was at our house was having a little birthday party for Carissa and Allison uh the day that that happened and I guess everybody remembers where they was at when they got news of that that terrible day but amen Ephesians 3 we just want to read one verse there of verse 11 trust something to be said tonight to help you to encourage you that's truly the reason that we came and I don't uh know all that everybody here is facing or what you're going through with individually and how many needs would be here tonight but there's one thing that I do know is that there's not a need in the building that's greater than our God there's not one diagnosis that you've got that God wasn't aware of didn't take God by surprise it might have shocked you but not God he knew all about it can you believe that tonight he's got it all in control I said he's got it all in control Ephesians 3:11 the the Bible says this according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord now Eternal means without beginning and end that which always has been and always will be without beginning Without End never to cease Eternal may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on God God's undefeatable Eternal purpose God's undefeatable Eternal purpose or if I could take a context out of that I'd like to say the man who wrote the book says I'm one of them Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to stand before your people we surrender this congregation and oursel into your hands For Your Glory may you come tonight Lord and speak Words of Life to our hearts and Lord may we not just be hearers of the word as James said but may we be doers of that which we've heard may we accept it believe it and confess it for we know that is the ABCs of our healing that is the ABCs of our walk dear God is to believe what you said in your word about us we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you may be S seated thank you buddy now I want to draw this first into your mind that there's not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing that could destroy us not one thing until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing the prophet said so then we come to understand this evening that we are made for a purpose you see this church here T night that we're in and we thank God for it it's such a such a beautiful building but this Foundation that was dug this building the roof and the interior and that was put in it was not just done all this wasn't just done to see if it could be done it was put here for a purpose your home that you was in before you come to church tonight was not just accidentally put there for somebody just wasting time where well we'll just see if we can build this no your home was made for a purpose your home was made to serve a purpose the automobile you drove here tonight was not made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it was made for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing that you wear tonight was not just to see if somebody could design or fashion a piece of clothing no it was put for a purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see if it could be grown but the food that we eat was grown to serve a purpose amen and God just not uh just didn't just happen to be making a tree just to be making a tree but he made a tree for a purpose and I want to say tonight that God made you not just to see if he could do it but God Made You for a purpose amen therefore there is a purpose for all of us being here we're not here here just to be another human being but we are here because God made you for some purpose we W just put here to eat the food that God grow we're not just put here to live in a house that some man made or or to drive an automobile that somebody created or wear clothes that somebody fashion but we are here for a specific purpose the trees God didn't have to make trees the way he made them but he made the trees for a purpose though they're different from one another yet he made each tree for a purpose purpose he could have make trees any way he wanted to make them he could have made flowers any way he wanted to make flowers but he made all of them the trees and the flowers everything he made for a purpose and what was that purpose to give a witness to give a testimony oh think about that he just didn't make a tree to be making it but he made a tree for a purpose that it would be a witness that it could give a testimony some people well that's just a tree but to God it's a witness it's a testimony he made them to Bear witness for they are God's Witnesses they are a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right the very trees that God placed upon the Earth will condemn some of these false religions for the trees the that God himself created serve a purpose to give a witness that Jesus Christ is right the death burial and Resurrection gives a witness that we are not dead eternally but we shall live again amen it shows a supreme intelligence look at the sun the prophet said when it comes out in the morning what's what happens to the sun it's a little baby born in the East about 10:00 it's a teenager at noon time it's in its strength in the evening time it's middle aged and at the evening time it's gone it's set it's finished but is that all there is of the sun no God's got a purpose for the Sun so the Sun comes back and rises again what does it what does it speak of it speaks of a birth a life a death and a resurrection Hallelujah it goes to show that it was made by a supreme intelligence to serve a purpose it's here for a purpose and I say tonight if that's true for for a flower if that's true for a tree if that's true for the sun then what about you what about you do you think we just accidentally fell into this thing you think God just accidentally created us I tell you no as the tree has a purpose and the flower has a purpose and the sun has a purpose to give a witness to be a testimony God has created you Hallelujah to be a witness no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose it don't matter how old you are how young you are every person here was here for a purpose to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose and the nail on my finger is here for a purpose my eye and every part of my body is here for a purpose sure this little finger maybe not look as much as the as the bless of my eye but it's still a part of my body and it serves a purpose and I need that nail on the little finger come on somebody well I'm not the eye I'm not the tongue I'm not the ear but I don't care if I'm just a little toe on the foot the last toe where that little crease touches the foot if that's who I am in the body I still am here to serve a purpose hallelujah amen my eye every part of my body is here to serve for purpose it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing nothing that can destroy us till God's purpose is fulfilled I make a Baptist shout I said there is nothing that can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache we have how sorrow that we go through all these things are for a reason God is not the author of confusion and everything that happens in our life God has a purpose for allowing it to happen amen and no matter what we Face the sorrow the pain the disappointment the sickness the fear all the things that we face as human beings has not been put here to destroy us because our purpose Hallelujah cannot be defeated by the things we suffer Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter how much heartache no matter how much sorrow all these things are a reason there's a reason for it but nothing you face in life will defeat the purpose that God has brought for your life it's the undefeatable Eternal purpose of the almighty God oh Hallelujah God placed you here you didn't stagger into this thing he could have put us in Luther's day Wesley's day he could put us in the days of Paul he could put us in the days of Jesus we could have been one of the discipl I Les but he chose this age this time this season this place to place you here it was not by accident but God knew in the last day in this age of confusion and lies and all the distress and all the darkness he knew he could put you here because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen hallelujah Nations a lie to you governments a lie to you family a lie to you come on somebody but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah and he knew he could have you here he could place you here and against all and against all darkness and against all confusion and against all denominations and against all internets somebody would believe his word and he said that's you I placed you here because I know you're the Seed of Abraham and Abraham's seed believes God when he speaks Hallelujah I'm not based well I got a sensation I'm not basing on a sensation I'm not basing it on the Goosebump I'm basing on thus sayth the word of God Sensations a lie to us emotions a lie come on somebody those things a lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah well brother I want you to know I got it when you shouted no you got it when you believed that's right well Glory Hallelujah the undefeatable Eternal purpose of God God placed you here as a true witness of God that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ well brother Dar what's the answer to believe the sign what is the answer to believe the sign on Facebook and on the Internet it's you Hallelujah he put you here to be a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right think about it go with me for a few minutes in your mind before there was ever an angel a star a planet there was no air there was no life there was no stars there was no World there was nothing else it was God and God Alone Ella Ella Elohim which means the self-existing one there was nothing else existed but him and the self-existing one that we call God but before there was ever anything to worship him he was just a self-existing one and the self-existing one had a desire he had a purpose something that he wanted to achieve and he purposed within himself that he would do this thing and he spoke let there be light and there was like why he purposed it and the Darkness could not stop the light from coming forth because God's purpose can never be defeated amen hallelujah no matter how mysterious it may seem to be God always keeps his word God keeps his word if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that promise you and I make promises we intend to keep but things happen that we have to to break a promise but not God oh no he knows all the future from the beginning he don't make a promise unless he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise God Don't Make A Promise unless he knows it's going to unless he knows he's going to keep it unless he knows what's going to happen Hallelujah he will not make a promise unless he knows he's going to keep it other words God just don't say something to be sa if God says something he means it and if God says he'll do something he'll bankrupt all Heaven before he'll let that promise fail you God purposed within himself to prove his word he said I will prove my word to be the truth listen to me I don't believe God heals people just to show his power to heal that's not why God heals he heals to fulfill his word for the word says He Is A Healer amen he shows he fulfills his word he keeps his promise when he came here on the earth the first time he said that he did this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets listen to me all God's word must be fulfilled all of it all of it all of it God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it so how happy we all to be today are you happy y let your face know it come on somebody he's got it all in control oh brother darl you don't know what I'm going through with you don't know what I'm going through with but that don't matter that don't change God's program that don't change God's purpose that don't change God's plan he's still God he's still mov come on somebody he's got it all in control he's not lost his power he's not a do old Grand Pa sleeping somewhere God is on the throne amen how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said Hallelujah God said let a virgin conceive and bring forth a child and it was as God said God said behold i s you Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as God said that's right God said there'll be a bride she'll be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit and she is she is him and it is as God has said there will be a bride brother I reckon when she'll come she's here brother Bon said in 64 he said the bride is born in infancy the word is come forth through the end time friends we're at the end time in' 64 it was a bride in infancy but what's happened between 60 64 and 2024 the bride has come to maturity she's reached the age of love She's reached the season she can reproduce him again on the earth Hallelujah think of it the heavenly father do you think for one minute that the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything amen what the father has purposed in your life can never be defeated the undefeatable eternal purpose of God for your life think about that you see what do you mean well think of David David was anointed by the great prophet Samuel to be king and between the ages of 10 and 15 year old who was 9' N9 in tall and saw the king that David no doubt looked up to he tells David you're just a youth you're too young you can't do it and Goliath has been a Warrior from his Youth and you're still a youth but the giant that stood before David did not see the God who was with David Hallelujah if he did he would have turned from the battle amen but God done said to David you will reign as king it came through a prophet's message God sent a prophet to tell David what his future was he might have preached future home to him come on somebody God sent a prophet to tell David not only what was happening right now but things that are to be and God told David through a prophet you will reign his King now how can he die by a giant as a boy and reign as king so David took God at his word and as far as the word was was concerned Goliath was defeated before the battle ever started because God's purpose for David's life could not be defeated by a giant and the giant that tries to R over your life cannot defeat God's purpose for your life amen you said brother darl I've got a giant raining in my life right now I've got this mountain as a boy told me Sunday down when he come up for gra me want me to pray for him he said I've got this mountain that needs to be moved but let me tell you no mountain can stand in the way of God's purpose for your life amen no jant no trial no habit no sickness no disease come on somebody there is nothing n o t h n nothing that can defeat God's purpose for our life it'll be as God has said it will be Shad M shako Flo into a furnace heated up seven times hotter than it ever been heated before and we said they said whether God would deliver us this we do not know but there's one thing we do know he is more than able to deliver us he's able to deliver us but nonetheless we will not bow to this image and the prophet said God had someone who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan and the prophet said how we left the say this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church well brother Daryl you reckon Putin I don't care what Putin's going to do he ain't going to do nothing but what God allow him to do amen and if they push one button we'll be gone before it ever strikes the United States yeah all the bombs they have all the threats they have the imminent oh my yo everybody's looking for a donkey they're looking for Harris or they're looking for Trump to save this nation they believe in a donkey tell you this nation don't need a donkey nor an elephant it needs a lamb they rejected the thing that they [Applause] needed all the bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all the explaining the way all the mathematics so forth the intelligence of the world has disguised the purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children don't you understand they'll never crucify him again but the prophet said what is the third crucifixion brother Jackie the crucifying the effects of the word that can never nail him to a tree again that's been done one time but what they they do now through the websites through the books come on somebody they try to take the word of God and make it no effect in your life amen come on somebody but the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the the word of God so what did they do they tried to explain it away by their intelligence they try to explain it away by their mathematics something trying to destroy the faith of God's children all this believe the sign trash all these books that they buy on Amazon it's a bunch of nonsense I said it's a bunch of nonsense you think I'm going to believe somebody that wrote a book that can't do one miracle that don't know God from a hot and to come on somebody I serve the Living God tonight and he promised to send Elijah the prophet and he kept his word and he sent that prophet to me and he opened the seals and he revealed to me my purpose for being on the earth amen there is no book from Amazon going to take that away from me Hallelujah the prophet said they'll never do it that faith that faith will live on forever Moses when he talking and all the wisdom of the Egyptians when he knew that God had a purpose for his life what did that Revelation come from his mother said she was the Fifth Gospel it was Joseph his mother who took Moses and shoved him right out into the jaws of death what did she take him to what were they doing with these Hebrew children they was throwing them into the river they was feeding them to the crocodiles and and what did yed do she knew that God delivered Noah by an ark so she built an ark for her baby and what did she do she pushed it right out there in the now where all the crocodiles was she pushed it right out into the jaws of death why would she do that because she knew God's purpose could not be defeated amen there wasn't enough water in an aisle to drown him there wasn't enough crocodiles in all the world that could swallow him he was God's chosen and he was God's chosen for that purpose and nobody could take his place we are God's chosen today we believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus there's no bombs there's no hell there's no nothing else that can destroy God's purpose we have got to go into the resurrection it's promise it's a promise that we have of our God Amen he said there will be a Rapture as far as God's concerned we already have Moses on the back side of the desert out there the the screams and the HTS and the Wilderness stagging around almost perishing but he knew that nothing could defeat God's purpose huh for God had placed him there God had put Moses there to do what God told him to do cuz his purpose cannot be defeated think of Joseph and and mared a child the child was to be born in Bethlehem not on the road to Bethlehem not on the hill to Bethlehem not at the city welcome sign of Bethlehem it had to be Bethlehem because the word of God called for it listen to me Mary Don't Be Afraid Of The Journey Don't worry about the mule Dy don't worry about the thieves on the road we're on the journey to the Eternal purpose of God the child will be born in in Bethlehem the word will become flesh in Bethlehem why God purposed for it to be oh little bride don't be afraid of the journey we were born for a purpose and that's to reproduce Jesus Christ in flesh again Hallelujah God watched over them AGI why because they had the appropriate gifts to identify his presence on the earth there was nothing that would stop them from getting to Jesus Jesus they were born to identify him on the earth then what have we been put here to do little bride I tell you we have been put here to identify him on the Earth today amen making him the same yesterday today and forever we're more than a church member we're more than a message believer come on somebody the devil believes and trembles we're more than that we was born for a purpose God wrote your name with Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world he knew the color of your skin he knew the color of your hair he knew the color of your eyes he knew your name and wrote your name with Jesus why Brother David why would he write my name with Jesus why brother Jackie because we are join AES hallelujah hallelujah when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable well brother I don't feel that way he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it if you believed it you might start feeling it there is nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable you got to turn to your neighbor and say you're undefeatable well that was weak well you'll say it sooner or later you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not Christ the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her then let's go from here tonight with this understanding we will not be defeated there is nothing that is is coming there is nothing that Satan is bringing there is nothing that can stop this bride we may have trials we may have troubles but there is nothing that will stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose of God for the bride will not be defeated and God's purpose will not be defeated he has given us perfect Assurance amen that we are the bride and we will not be defeated therefore we have nothing to fear amen did not he tell his disciples that night when they were scared did not he say Be not Afraid when he stepped in the boat him man I turned to him and said don't you understand what's happening don't you understand what you're experiencing don't you understand where you're at the word is being made flesh do you understand where you're at forence not a Creed not a Dogma the word is being made flesh amen listen you were made for an eternal purpose because you are the manifestation of an attribute you are the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being every man that come to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he's called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening listen a young

people there's no persecution of the world can can blow out that flame that God has lit for God has purposed that his torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers no

can we rest can we rest in his plan how many of you remember brother Alfred Hall anybody remember brother Hall you know brother Hall was a pretty dark skinned man wasn't he well here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion now some of you may not know what a mungon is but a mungon they call them the mysterious people out of the hills of Tennessee and Virginia over here and some people claim they were Cherokees some claimed they were pugie and genre and I don't know what all they claimed these people to be but there was actually a tri-racial people they were white black and Native American reason I know so much about it a lot of my mama's people the Goodman and the Moors and the Gibsons and the Sweeny they was all identified as that so here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion up in Virginia and me and my brother went to it and we was walking out through there now they had brother they had a man by the name of Brent Kennedy Dr Brent Kennedy and he wrote a book on the mungon it's called the mungon a mysterious people actually have the book there in my study and so we was walking around up there at this melon reunion and I told my brother Dwayne I said I tell you right now if anybody is at this reunion it'll be brother Alfred Hall and we turn the corner guess who we run into I said brother Hall I knew you would be here and he started laughing and he had that book Brett Kennedy the mysterious melons of mysterious people I said I knew you'd be here he said yeah he said the man that wrote the book said I'm one of them and I've come to tell youall come on now the man who wrote the book the author of this book The Bible said he is the author and finisher of our faith amen and he's come to tell us he's come to tell us the author of this book has come to tell us according to Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did prate him whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and what shall we say do these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things how many things how many how many amen this bride is lacking nothing he has freely given us all things he's given us joy he's given us peace he's given us Health he's given us Redemption he's given us for he's given us forgiveness he's given us the Holy Ghost he's given us the promise of a Rapture he has freely given us all things the author of the book said [Applause] so who shall lay anything to charge elect to God's elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of God of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded can I get an amen I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come nor hyp nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord then what should we be we are children of the promise being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and our HS with him with the promise no matter how much sickness comes what kind of death we die how much poverty we go through God's purpose cannot be defeated he will raise us up again for he said because I live ye shall live also the author of this book said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the her of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me saith the Lord that's what the author said well so and so and well they got this book I don't care what they say that's what the author said I think I shared this with you but I it just came on my heart here a few years ago this bookstore took the book of this man and he invited his Professor down from a major university he had a degrees about this long and he invited this man down to give an interpretation of this book so the man comes you know he's kind of famous so all these people come into the bookstore and gathered around going to get him to sign this book you know and they're going to listen as he gave his interpretation of the book and he started out he said now in chapter one what the author was trying to say was this and when it got done oh that was just so good chapter two they chapter three when he got to chapter 4 he said now in chapter 4 what the author was trying to say was thus and thus and thus and just as the people got ready to clap there was the man in the crowd said nope that ain't right sort of like saying Amen in the church everybody turn around and see who it was that said it you know and so he goes on to chapter five and every chapter five six 7even the guy says Nope ain't right so by chapter eight this professor he was Furious and they just lost all self control and just as he said now in chapter eight before he could even get it out the man said nope and he just lost it he said who are you who do you think you are don't you know who I am I'm Professor so and so leard University I've got a dou LD a DDD a PhD I got all these degrees in literature don't you think I know about this book don't you think I can read this book and give the interpretation what makes you think you so much about it who are you anyway and the man said I'm the author well brother Dar I don't know about what you preach I'm just trying to tell you what the author said I'm not giving my interpretation of it I'm just telling you what the author said no weapon against you shall prosper

scenic view one mile and I thought I'll just pull in there and look at those rocks and so I pulled in and when I pulled in this place as all grown up looked like nobody hadn't been there in the years and so I parked the car and I got out and one of my favorite scriptures is Jeremiah 29:11 I know the thoughts I think toward you sayith the Lord so I got out of the car and sat down on this cement bench and I began to whine again just a big baby I'm going to be honest with you I was just a big baby I said Lord do you even know my name do you even know I'm even out here I said I just want to be

So let's change the atmosphere. In Christ we have authority. Our praises make the darkness flee. And he promised to be near. So let's change the atmosphere. Jesus promised to be near. So let's change the atmosphere. The timeless theme. Earth and heaven will pass away. It's not a dream. God will make all things new. that day. Gone is the curse from which I stumbled and fell.

For we will live in the light of the r. Let's all stand this morning. Sing a little chorus just before pastor comes. So good to be in the house of God. You enjoy the specials this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's sing an old an old song. We've sung a million times, but it's always going to be true. He looked beyond my thought and he saw my need. Brother Randy, he's the only one that could take care of it. Amen. I shall forever lift mine eyes to Calary. Oh, of view the cross where Jesus died for me. How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul. He looked beyond all my fault and sorrow. Sing you one more time from your heart this morning. Oh, I shall for him. How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul. He looked beyond beyond all our thoughts and saw our need. Sing it together, shall we? I shall lift my eyes to come to Calvary. the cross to the cross for Jesus for you and me how you are Jesus. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; The grace that come by soul looked beyond our fraord. Thank God. Praise the Lord. We're so grateful he could do that for us. But I'll tell you, the more I read into his word, the more I look into the message of the hour, the more I realize how much more he wants us to be like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not just him loving his enemies, but us loving ours. &gt;&gt; Well, you say he loved his enemies. Yeah, he loved you, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Every one of us was an enemy to God. &gt;&gt; We were born that way. Don't you see when he tells us to love our enemies, he's telling us to do what he's already done himself. &gt;&gt; You see how godly we are when we do that and how ungodly we are when we don't. &gt;&gt; No matter how long your hair is, sisters, you may dress just perfectly on the outside, but you see, until we achieve these things, friends, what are we doing? What are we accomplishing? We put our church clothes on and go to church and play tapes every now and then and sing religious songs. I don't want just that. &gt;&gt; I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Isn't it wonderful to be able to be in church today? &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Matthew chapter 4 if you would. Matthew chapter 4 verse 43. Here we are up into almost the third week of January and we ain't had to cancel church because of snow and ice. &gt;&gt; I'm one happy pastor. &gt;&gt; I don't like winter time anyway, but I sure don't like it when we can't have church. Listen carefully now to the words of our Lord Jesus. You have heard that it has been said and let me just give you a heads up. Sometimes you have to be very careful on what you've heard has been said to make sure that it was God who said it. Ye have heard that it has been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. Now part of this is scripture and part of it is addition from man's ideas. &gt;&gt; But by now they had merged it together and made it one saying. One was 100% truth and the other was error and they merged it together to be one saying. Ye have heard that it has been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, love your enemies. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you. And pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you. This is the reason why that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven. You mean it's that important to God? It is. For he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. How many lives to be remembered today in prayer? Also need prayer today. I've not been feeling well since Thursday. Just desire your prayers today. Lord Jesus, we count it such a great honor and a privilege to be able to be gathered together today. Thank you, Lord, that I was feeling better that I could come to church today. I love church. I love it when I can get in your presence and I love it when I can get with your children. We just love it, Father, because it's a little foretaste of what heaven will be like. So we pray today, Lord, that you would help us. You saw the hands that were uplifted, Father, and you know, every need, every request, dear Jesus, this prayer cloth that I have on my hand today for her, Sister Ruth Ward. We're praying for her, Lord, and just asking you to move for these needs in her body. I know, Lord, she's desirous just to go home, step out of this old house that she's held a prisoner in. But we believe our days are allotted by you. So we pray that you would help her and be with her, Father. Dear God, strengthen our sister. Father, I'm asking you today. I normally don't do it, but I'm asking you for myself that you'd help me. Give me strength, Lord Jesus. Help me to be able to get out of the way. Father, that you can speak through me your words to your children. They've come today with needs in their lives. Some of them have driven a long way. So, dear God, I don't want to waste their time. And I know if you will come, it won't be a waste of time. So help me that I can submit everything that I have. I'm not 100% today. And for that I apologize. And I pray that you would take whatever that I can submit to you, Lord, and use it for your honor and your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be seated. And everybody look at me. Don't get your eyes on me. Don't sit there and worry and how is he? Is he fixing to die? No, I ain't fixing to die. I ain't fixing to kick the bucket. I just don't feel good. But let's not focus on that. Let's focus on today's service &gt;&gt; and what God has for us. Let me draw your attention back to verse 43. You have heard that it has been said, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.\" Now actually Leviticus 198 19:18 rather tells the children of Israel to love thy neighbor. But it does not tell them to hate their enemy. So where did this come from? Both scribes and Pharisees agreed that this should be something that would be added to the commandment of God. So by the time Jesus gets there, now it's been many hundreds of years since they've had this attitude. And by the time Jesus gets there, this is quoted as if though it was scripture itself. Do you can imagine then if you were a scribe or Pharisee and you were setting under their teaching believing them to be men of God and servants of God and you heard them quote this and they said love your neighbors and pray for them and be kind to them but don't you ever forget hate them Philistines hate them Amorites hate them Gentiles and you'd leave church that day was the attitude Dude, my priest, my Sadducee, my Pharisee head told me to hate our enemies and I'm going to hate them. So here's Peter, James, John, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the Less, James the Great. All of these men had a religious background, either Pharisee or Sadducee, and they have this instilled in them since children. Hate your enemies. People do something against you, don't you never forget it. And you get back at them if it's the last thing that you do. And here stands Peter, a Pharisee. Here stands John, a Pharisee, other brothers that are a scenes and Sadducees. And they hear Jesus say these words. Their world must have been turned upside down. Now notice what a treacherous thing this is when men leaders, religious leaders will take truth and merge their own ideas in with it and mix it together and hand it out to the people. And it may not happen initially, first time they say it, first week, first six months, maybe even the first year. But if they're not careful in time, the lines will become so blurred from what is really truth to that man's idea that it will merge together and be one and the same. And then what you've done is allowed God's word, the absolute to become mixed up with some man's ideal. Well, I think this is should be this way. I think that should be that way. And it starts out as an I think and then the time I believe and then it becomes church doctrine. Then it becomes so dominant that it takes years sometimes to get it out of people's lives and it's buried so deep in their subconscious that it can flare up even years after they've been washed away from it doctrally. Now watch. He said, \"But I say unto you, love your enemies and bless them.\" Now, are are we supposed to love the conduct of our enemies? &gt;&gt; Are we supposed to love their behavior, their talk, the way they dress, the way they act? What do we love their souls? We love their souls and we pray that God can have mercy on them. And the church said, \"So, we pray for them and actually seek their good.\" Now, let me just share something with you that a lot of the nations in the Old Testament would have never found a place in scripture had it not been for them being the enemy of the children of Israel. God would have never even named them whatsoever. But they found their place because they were opposition to the people of God. And I'll tell you, as I studied this yesterday, I had to laugh a little bit. And I thought, well, in reality, I guess there's some people that would have never made it into my prayers had it not been for the injury that they did to me. It ain't people that you just, you know, just randomly pick out and and pray for. But when they do injure you as a real son or daughter of God to be like God, we are taught to pray for them. Now, when I say that, I don't mean, Lord God, I pray you'd send lightning down out of heaven. May their kids all die. May their crops burn up. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, send your wrath and let me deliver it, Lord. That's not the kind of prayers that we're to pray for them. So to pray for them is ask God to be merciful. These are my terms that I tell him all the time. If they are savable, save them, Lord. And if they're not bride, at least let them be church. Let them at least be saved. Praise the Lord. You understand? It might be your prayer and your attitude to some mortal out here that God would save them because you simply asked him to. And God would be so moved by you being like him. He would answer your prayer. Remember, it was the very prayer of the righteous man Abraham interceding for Lot. We know what kind of guy he was. It was not Lot's prayer. It was not Lot's wife nor Lot's children that saved them. It was simply because an elect member of the body of God and had such imprint upon God's own divine nature that God saved a man like Lot, which was nothing but a penny. I'll tell you, it's quite an honor if a silver dollar is praying for you. Now, think, I wonder how many more that we should pray for. What if God would honor your prayer or my prayer and God would move on someone's heart and they themselves not even have the ability to be bride, not even have the capability to reach up where you ever would, but you in mercy and you in grace petition our heavenly father and God moves upon their heart. My should make us want to pray for folks more. Now I want you to think that love will give blessing back in return for cursing. &gt;&gt; Real divine love does not love after like. It does not love those who love it. Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter 4:12 that Paul says, \"And labor, working with our own hands, being reviled, we bless. Being persecuted, we suffer it.\" So they were treated one way and did the exact opposite. I want you to notice that these men of God living in this age, they were not just identified by signs and wonders. They were they had that there. But that within itself is not what identifies us with the divine nature. As a matter of fact, I read it the other day where the prophet said that faith can come from a heart to do great supernatural miracles and not even come from a sincere heart. You imagine a person have great faith to be able to see God do mighty things and not even come from a genuine heart. Lord help us. Watch 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 20. And Peter said, \"For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? But what if when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently? This is acceptable with God. For even where here unto were ye called, I hope everybody hears this today. You are called to be persecuted when you live right. You're called, oh yes, to be ridiculed, laughed at, made fun of when you live right. This is part of your calling. Praise the Lord. Notice now, oh, I I love this. Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps. Now, here's some of his steps. Who did no sin, neither was G found in his mouth, who when he was reviled, reviled not again. When he suffered, he threatened not. Notice the polar opposites that he took. He was reviled against, but he didn't get back. Whatever they said against him, he went the exact opposite. When he suffered, he threatened not. Now, what is this? Is contrary to human nature. It's contrary to a great majority of the population of the earth on the today because there's something about it that's built up in the human makeup to defend oursel and especially when there's lies being told against us and people are accusing us of things and we're just as innocent as we can be. Then we want to take it into our own hands and say, \"I'll get back with them. I'll go on Facebook. I'll do this, that, and the other. I'll straighten it out. You're fixing to make a mess out of it. It's what you're fixing to do. Now, I'll tell you what you're doing. You're taking it out of God's hands and putting it in your own hands and trying to settle it. I figure he knows a whole lot better how to settle issues than I do. I just wish some of y'all would learn this now. &gt;&gt; It'll make you a lot better Christian. Help you sleep a lot better at night time. Who knows, you might even make the rapture, too, which is always a plus. Who when he was reviled, reviled not again. When he suffered, he threatened not. Notice this, but committed committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. Now watch what he done. He so succumbed to the ideology of a servant into the role of the spirit of God. Remember Isaiah said, \"Behold my servant.\" So this is what the humanity of the Lord Jesus was. The sunship was just simply the humanity of God. So in the form of humanity, the logos took on sunship and he had to strip himself of many of the great attributes of deity. So he had to learn how to commit himself which had never been done before. He never had to do that when he was forming the worlds. He never had to do that when he created the stars. But in the form of sunship, humanity, he had to submit himself. Why? For you. For me. He would give us the example. Children, I'm going to do it first. I'm going to do it. Then when I do it, you walk in my footsteps. I'm going to show you how to submit to him who judges righteously. So what do I submit, brother Donnie? my opinion, your attitude, your rights to fight back, your rights to get even, your right to walk up to somebody before church or after church. I'm going to give them a piece of my mind. Don't do that. Commit the situation to God. Come on, somebody say, \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Notice how the Lord Jesus now, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. And the word committed is to give into the hands of another. To give over into one's power or use. CAN YOU IMAGINE? NOW HE HAD THE POWER. HE COULD HAVE CALLED AND THEY SAID ONE WORD. The angels of God could have smoked him right there. But instead of using that power, he said, \"Nope, I'm not going to do it. I'm I'm going to be an example for Donnie. I'm going to be an example for Jim, Fred, Betty, Susie, Janet. I'm going to be an example. I want to I want to write have this written about my life so they can see they won't have all this power the way I have access to it. But I want them to hear this preached over and over again. So by this word, I'll be able to conform them. Even though they'll be held captive in that flesh body, they'll every day become more and more and more like me. And they'll realize that when they can learn to commit theirel, it's not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of godliness &gt;&gt; and greatness. Now, how many of us relate to that in that way? Doesn't it look weak WHENEVER SOMEONE WOULD SAY SOMETHING AGAINST US? Doesn't it look weak for us not to defend oursel? Doesn't it look weak that if some people will think less of me? Who cares about that? As long as he thinks great about me, what do I care what other folks say? Now, can you imagine the greatness is actually being able to commit? but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. I want you to notice that as we endeavor by the grace of God to become conformed more and more into the image of his son, the godliness attributes which will be minimized by the majority of Christendom. We realize that and they'll say, \"Oh, it can never be attained to. It can never be had. Nobody ever wants it's not deep. It's not really that important. And they'll kind of put it in that type of a category. But the elect of God, they look at it totally different. Notice in Matthew 5:44, he says, \"I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Now remember, he is advising his disciples to do what he himself has already been doing, but they're going to see more of a fulfillment of this when he goes to the cross. For there they will crucify him and they will not even ask for forgiveness. But he prays for their forgiveness anyway. &gt;&gt; Can we do that? Can we forgive people even when they don't ask for forgiveness? I don't mind telling you there's an element about all this I don't understand. If I do wrong, God won't let me get by with it. &gt;&gt; I got to apologize. I got to make it right. &gt;&gt; But there's other Christians, they can do this and that and the other and they'll go right on like it never happened. And I don't understand that. &gt;&gt; Anybody else don't understand that? I don't understand it. No, I don't. But you know what? I'm not waiting on them if they've trespassed against me for them to come and and do it. Because some people, it's just like they cannot do it. They just cannot admit that they're wrong. &gt;&gt; They just have a awful, awful time of admitting that they're wrong or that they've done wrong. So, I guess this is what worries me. If I think if I'm waiting on them for me to forgive them, it may never happen. &gt;&gt; So, I figure I better go ahead and do it. That way, I'll be clear cuz I don't want them holding me back. &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm talking about? So, why should I wait? Why should you wait? Well, I've had this sure in my heart. I'm waiting for him to come and ask me. I'm waiting for her to come and ask me. And did Jesus do that? &gt;&gt; Come on, admit it. It's our ways. And it gives us a little right to hold on to a grudge. Preach, brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOW WATCH. SO THE LORD JESUS has actually done this and will continue to do so. And he gives us these examples that we might be able to walk in his footsteps. Notice in Romans Romans 5:10. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. So if we cannot love our enemies, that means God cannot love us cuz we were his enemies. You see, when he tells us to do this, he's telling us, \"Children, be like me. &gt;&gt; This is godliness. &gt;&gt; Love your enemies.\" &gt;&gt; Because I loved you. And you know what he did? I was born an enemy. I didn't realize it. Of course, most of you didn't. I I didn't know I was an enemy of of God. I didn't know I was an enemy of his kingdom. &gt;&gt; But he loved me so much as his enemy. He wanted me to be a part of his kingdom. So his love transformed me from being born an enemy to being reborn a friend. Praise be to God. SO THEN HE TELLS US, \"NOW CHILDREN, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, I want you to act LIKE ME BECAUSE I LOVED you when you were my enemies and you're no longer my enemies because my love broke that and brought you into sunship, friendship with me. Now I want you to show the world and I'm going to let you be tried the way I was. not in the same measure, but it'll be certain aspects of my walk. And I will let you be tried in that way. And I'm going to let you be hated. I'm going to let you be persecuted. And sometimes it'll be people that you love so much. And they'll hurt you so deeply. And I'm going to let you go that way. So my love continue to be extended in the same way in human flesh, except this time it won't be my flesh, but it'll be yours. And some people will actually be turned from being your enemies to being your friends because you let me love them through you and I will destroy that hold of that hatred they have on them. Lord Jesus, Colossians 1 21. And ye that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hast he reconciled. Now look at what a degree of love this is. This love is a is a mark of maturity, proving that we're not just little bitty tiny children in the kingdom of God, but we're growing up. So, we're not, OH, WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE'RE CHILDREN of God. That's all well and good, but are we maturing or are we still little three-year-olds? &gt;&gt; Are we little teenagers? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Any of you that's had teenagers, God help you. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way a lot of Christians are. Some of them two year olds, some of them's three year olds. You know, they go through that whatever age it is. You parents, you know, you had a had a name for every bit of it. What age they're in? Terrible twos. I've had plenty of those church members that were in their terrible twos for 58 years. And then they go up into the pre-teen and the adolescence. And then they become a teenager. Then all of a sudden they know everything there is to know about everything. Nobody can tell them anything different. Even Almighty God himself. Well, you know, we've got the same thing in church. We got spiritual teenagers and they know absolutely everything. I don't need the preacher to tell me nothing. Well, you're a spiritual teenager. But I believe that God is not coming. And the rapture is not going to be for a little 2-year-old infant bride to marry and be consummated with our Lord Jesus. He's going to marry and take unto himself and consummate this wedding with who? An adult woman. So, how are we going to be adult? Just because we know how many times brother Brandham said the word seven thunders. We're going to know how many times he said the word, you know, seven seals. It'll be by the manifestation of the person of Christ revealing himself in the full stature of every individual. Not just the pastor, not the deacons, not the trustees, but leoty as well. &gt;&gt; Oh my God help us. So it's a sign of the mark of maturity. And what is it? It's godlike. To love like this is godlike. Look in verse 44. But I say unto you again, love your enemies, bless them which curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. So the verb here, persecute, generally refers to religious persecution. So you know what that means? As a bride of Christ, we're going to suffer an element of religious persecution. Now, look, we're not going through the tribulation period. Thank God for that. But where does a lot of our persecution come from as far as following the message of the hour? A lot of it comes, of course, in form of people that sit among us. But others, it comes from uninformed people that don't really know what we believe and they think we're a cult, some kind of weird bunch of people cuz they never really ask us theirel. They take everybody else's word for it. So Jesus says that we're going to be persecuted. But notice, I love this in verse 45. That you may be the children of your father which is in heaven. For he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good. Now he said, \"The reason I want you to be like this is because this will be one definite sign and evidence that you are my children because you can love like me.\" So if you're a white man, you'll have no problem loving a black man. &gt;&gt; And if you're a black man, you'll have no problem loving a white man. If you're an American, you'll have no problem loving a Chinese. &gt;&gt; You might not love all the stuff they make there, but you get mad at all that junk. You see, THE LORD JESUS DOES NOT LOVE A CERTAIN color of people and they say, \"I I don't love this other color near as much.\" The true love of God in our hearts will love like he loves. Come on, somebody. Oh my. You see, you will be the children of your father. And the declaration is by the Lord Jesus himself that you may be the children of your father. So you see one of the great divine things that God wants to attribute to his people is that in this position of sunship and daughtership that our conformity to the divine nature is being reflected by divine behavior in our human life right now. Do you understand what a miracle that is? Some of you were born with a temper. You would fight THE DEVIL HIMSELF. SOME of you would slap the devil up the side of the head before you realized who he was. I mean, you would cuss. You would do this and that and the other. And the Lord got a hold to you and changed you and made you a different person. Praise the Lord. Some of you were this way and that way. And the devil himself probably looked at some of you and said, \"They're even too hopeless for hell. I'm not sure I even want them down there. Is there another place we can send them?\" And what DID GOD DO? GOD GOT A HOLD TO YOUR HEART AND changed your nature and then God started that slow process of taking out this and taking out that. Look friends, it's absolutely marvelous what the new birth can do. And it does not take 45 years for the new birth to consummate and change the nature that we're born in. That is an absolute miracle that happens in an instant. But you're just getting started then. Then you're on your journey. All my people just preach the cross, the cross, the cross. I love the cross, but the cross made a way for me to come into disciplehip. You've got to preach more than the cross if you're ever going to go in the rapture. Come on, somebody. And what do we believe? We believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus. We believe in the cross, but we believe the cross was simply that breach where the lamb of God gave his life that we might be able to come back into the presence of God and start molding and shaping and making us into his image. Thank God. Amen. &gt;&gt; ONE GREAT EVIDENCE THAT WE can know that we are partakers of the divine nature is when that cry within our soul is to be transformed into his great image. You see, WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE God in wisdom or in power. That was part of what got man in trouble in the Garden of Eden. Remember Satan's words? Uh did you do this? and you'll BE LIKE GOD. WHAT'S HE offering them? An element of godship, an element into the godhead, and trying to blind them from what they already had. Don't you see what man wants today? Man wants to be the god of his own life. Self-power, selfie this, selfie that. The devil was the first one to be hung up on selfies. &gt;&gt; I'll do this and I'll do that. Don't you get caught up in that trap of the devil. Amen. Somebody say amen with me. &gt;&gt; Now notice God wants us to crucify oursel and it was Satan playing this trick upon Eve. Eve bringing it to Adam. But in striving to be like him. We know we cannot be like him in divine mercy and all that that he is. But he wants us to be able to love the way he loved and do what no ordinary human could ever do. to be able to forgive beyond our own human capability. You see the word perfect whenever Jesus talks about it and he mentions that we might be perfect before God. The word perfect does not mean sinless perfect but it suggests completeness and maturity and nothing lacking. In other words, we've grown up into that spot. Notice in verse 46, he says, \"If you love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same? And if you salute your brethren, now that ain't a military salute, but look at the meaning of the word. It means greet or embrace, bid welcome, or wish well to.\" So, is there anybody sitting in the church today that if you met them oneon-one outside the door there that you couldn't bid them welcome? &gt;&gt; Or would you turn your head and walk away? &gt;&gt; You're acting like a sinner &gt;&gt; and a publican. &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at me. These are the words of Jesus. I'm just the mailman. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice what he said. If you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others? Do not even the publicans do so. SO IF WE LET SOMETHING GET IN OUR HEART against our brothers and sisters or family members or friends or whatever it is, and because I ain't having nothing to do with that, I won't speak to them. I'll tell you one thing, shame on us. And we claim we're full of the Holy Ghost and ready for the rapture. Oh my goodness. Notice in verse 48, be ye therefore &gt;&gt; perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect. AND NOW WHERE DOES ALL THIS COME FROM that Jesus talks about raising the dead, casting out devils, healing the sick, laying hands on the lepers. No, no, he he's not saying perfect comes by those signs. And we believe in those signs. But he says, \"What will make you complete is when you love the way I love.\" &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. AND GOD'S LOVE IS complete in that the Bible says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him. Whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world.\" The world cosmos world order, not bride, world. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. Do you understand? He reached beyond the lamb's book of life and let mercy spill over into the book of life and said to many, many millions and billions of you OF YOU PEOPLE, YOU'RE not even of my genos, MY KIND. YOU'RE NOT MY ELECT. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you be saved. &gt;&gt; I'LL LET YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; If you want it, &gt;&gt; all you have to do is accept my perpetuation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we become so full of sectarianism. Anybody know what that word means? Sectarianism. Brother Rand mentions it through the message. Then of course the message was in its infancy and the sectarianism had not grown to the stage it is now. But it's simply a compound word that takes the word sect which you know what a sect would be and then it becomes either an ideology or theology or a group or it can be a group of churches and they're so set in their own little ideology that they cut off fellowship from other people. Sectarianism and our message is full of it. Come on somebody say amen. And if we're not careful, sectarianism will be inside of our own church. So we got this little sect and that little sect and well they don't, you know, we're on the Baptist side of the church. So we don't say amen very much. And then this is the Methodist side here. And then this over here is kind of the Pentecostal side. And that over is we're still trying to define if they're unitarian or Lutheran. We're trying to define what everybody are. Well, we believe in this and we believe in that. And then we become so divisive among ourselves that we can't even love one another. Are are are we going to be divided that way when we go into the paradise of God, friends? THAT'S NOT COMPLETE LOVE. OH, BROTHER DONNIE, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT? HOW WE KNOW YOU GO OUT AND PREACH FOR PREACHERS you don't agree with. I sure do. I go out and preach for many I do not agree with, but I love them. And I don't figure being mean to anybody is going to help me or them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my. YOU SEE, THE DESIRE FOR THE CHILD OF God should be to so thrive and hunger and thirst to be in God's mature love. And at the same time, now remember what Jesus said when we was looking at this a week or so ago about for us to be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. Let me pick this up again. That he wants us to be harmless. Now, he likened us to a dove. Read with me in Leviticus 12:6. AND THE DOVE WAS SO pure in the eyes of God that he would accept it as a sin offering. Think of it that the dove, not the eagle. Now, we all admire the eagle and we love the eagle. Yes, the eagle has a great place in our message, but it's not the only bird that does. The dove has a great place as well. Now, I want you to notice a scavenger or a mighty eagle, no species of the eagles, out of all of them, could be accepted as a sin offering. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or for a daughter, then shall she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle dove for a sin offering unto the door to the tabernacle of the congregation under the priest. Now notice again in Hebrews chapter 7 26. For such a high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens. So harmless is not injuring to anyone. Now he did no one wrong to their name or to their person or to their property. I say harmless. So if it would be in your power, your ability to tell something on someone and it could be true and it would render you the power to mark their character and you say, \"I'm simply telling the truth.\" &gt;&gt; What would you do with that truth? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all must have left your ameners at home today. &gt;&gt; Well, if you brought your Omir, I I'll take that for a while if you want to say oh me. YOU SEE, GOD GOD knew God knew this would be impossible &gt;&gt; for human beings to do. &gt;&gt; This is why he asked preachers to preach it so high. AND YOU SAY, \"LORD HAVE MERCY. I CAN NEVER DO IT.\" Praise the Lord. That means my preaching worked this morning. That's where I want you to be. I want every one of you when you walk OUT OF HERE TO REALIZE THIS IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE for me. &gt;&gt; That way it'll get your eyes off of yourself &gt;&gt; and it'll turn your eyes where they need to be on the Lord Jesus. Notice in Philippians 2 that Paul goes on to say that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world. NOW, WILL WE HURT ONE ANOTHER? I hate to say it, but we will. &gt;&gt; We will. But the difference between someone who really is a son or daughter of God and wants to walk in this image of the Lord Jesus is when they realize they've hurt someone, they will make it right. Look at Stephen. Acts 7. He kneel down and cried with a loud voice,\"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\" And when he had said this, he fell asleep. What last words of glory to say from a redeemed human being. &gt;&gt; You imagine the very nature. You see what this was doing, church? This was showing Peter, James, John, this man here, the life, THE DIVINE nature had come back on the day of Pentecost. And now that divine nature was coming out of the deacon's mouth. Remember this was a deacon. THEY HAD FALSELY CHARGED HIM. THEY FALSELY accused him. AND THEY DONE ALL THESE HORRIBLE THINGS. AND THE LAST words to come out of his MOUTH WAS NOT, \"HOW DAMN YOU TO HELL. &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. I PRAY YOU'LL BURN IN HELL.\" &gt;&gt; NO. NO. I don't understand. I I I don't I don't understand how some people when you do something against them or you offend them somehow and they're sitting around waiting for bad things to happen to you and they keep up with you just so they can keep a record of, you know, God's getting you back and punishing you for this and punishing you for that. I don't I don't understand. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with that heart, friends. I'll tell you that right now. &gt;&gt; Are are bad things going to happen to us? They sure are. &gt;&gt; Are they? How many have bad things to happen to you or your family, people that you love? Of course. Does that mean that God's getting back at you because you done this or that or the other? Lord have mercy. Can you imagine if God would let bad things happen to us because of all we've done to him? I wouldn't even exist today. And I'm gonna go ahead and say it for the rest of you. None of you would either. &gt;&gt; But what is it that you can see that people are missing something? I'm talking about people in our own ranks. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU, BROTHER J. D. SO THEY CAN SAY, \"I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT. I KNEW GOD WOULD GET HIM. I can see him as he sets outside that cave five miles outside of Jerusalem. And he sees them one by one. They're being led captive. He sees his prophecy being fulfilled. The man's name is Jeremiah. He sees thousands of his brothers walking before him, bound. Some of them their eyes are gouged out. Some of them, the women, they have blood running down their legs because them soldiers had raped them. But I don't see a man sitting there. But I see chapter one of the book called Lamentations reflects a man who's weeping because his prophecy had to happen. Help us, Lord. You see this dove like meekness is the best jewel of ornamentation that we can have. This is what meekness does. Anger disfigures. Have you ever noticed people when they get really mad? I mean really mad. &gt;&gt; You ever notice how that it brings contorted, twisted expressions? on a human's face. Now, I know some of you is going to sit there and not move a muscle, you're going to act like that don't happen in your house. &gt;&gt; All right, you go ahead and act that way if you want to. How many knows what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; When people get angry or sometime or another you've got angry, I mean, back 185 years ago, and of course, you don't do that anymore. HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED WHAT IT DOES TO YOU? It reflects on your face and that anger will contort and and twist and I read people. I do I mean I have to talk to thousands of people and have through the years. So I I watch people and a few times it saved me from getting my head hit, you know, by watching them uh in my office after church. And if they've got a habit and their little their upper lip will start quivering and it'll start pulling up or their eyes will start going back and forth back and forth. Certain things that it does. Now it's the emotion on the inside but they can't hide it from the outside. &gt;&gt; Well, if that has that kind of an expression, what about the gentleness of the love of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the dove is this emblem of purity and it just can't stand this this anger. And remember, brother Random used the the symbolism of whenever we would hear gossip or whenever we would become bitter that that dove would just fly out and fly away. &gt;&gt; And remember, your soul is not unsealed. You've not broken that seal and you've lost the Holy Ghost, but it's simply as Paul said in Ephesians 4:30, \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed.\" See, he's writing to Holy Ghost fil people. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God. How many's ever grieved the spirit of God? That's right. &gt;&gt; Several years ago at the old church, we'd had a a fall fest. We had service on Saturday night. And I was going to preach and whenever I came out, there was quite a crowd of people there, visitors. And so I just looked across the crowd. And I just I just said what I felt to my heart, what I you know, the way I felt about it. I said, \"I hope our church never gets this big.\" And as soon as I said that, I knew I had offended him. I felt the awful thing strike me like I was the boss and what I had to say mattered. It was everything I could do to go ahead and preach because I knew he did not like what I said. And I've asked him, I couldn't tell you how many times, please forgive me. I'll never say that again. That ain't my place. It ain't for me to say. How many has had similar things happen to you as believers that you just grieve? So that mean I need to go up to the altar and get saved? I felt like it. &gt;&gt; I guess it'd been really odd if I just got up and say, \"You know what, saints? I need to get saved tonight.\" The Lord probably some of y'all just passed out and said, \"Lord have mercy. Our pastor ain't even saved.\" But when you grieve him, it breaks your heart because of what you feel it does. &gt;&gt; So what happened to me that night? It wasn't that I broke the seal, but I grieved him. and that gentleness and I had to labor and stand there and preach and he was faithful because of the people's sake cuz I felt like folding up my Bible and going back into the office and getting down on my knees and praying and asking him to forgive me. But you know what? I'm so glad that I have got something inside of me that when I do wrong, I can still be convicted. I'm so glad. Aren't you glad today that when you do wrong or say wrong or misbehave? IT DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST, IT MEANS YOU JUST GRIEVED him and you hurt his feelings and you offended him. Matthew 5:8, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\" And remember this is the mount, his great sermon of the biatitudes. Blessed are the pure. Look with me at this word. Cather, clean physically purified by fire in a similitude like a vine cleansed by pruning and so fitted to bear fruit. Esthically free from corrupt desire, from sin and guilt, free from every ad mixture of what is false, sincere, genuine, blameless, innocent, unstained, with guilt of anything. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. First Timothy 1:5. Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and faith unfeigned. 1 Timothy 5:22, \"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure. And remember, after the Lord Jesus changes our nature, there is an element of sanctification that the spirit of God will not do. It's up to us to do. Modern day Christianity has no walls, has no boundaries, &gt;&gt; has no limitations. &gt;&gt; So everything to them is pure, I guess. Notice again 2 Timothy 2:22. Flee also youthful lust, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 1 Peter 1:22, \"Seeing that you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.\" Now, don't raise your hands, but I wonder how many of all these hundreds of people here today have a pure heart. Pure heart. Second Peter 3:1, the second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you AND BOAST WHICH I STIR UP YOUR pure minds by the way of remembrance. So a person can have a pure heart and then keep a pure mind. How in the world you going to do that? whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are faithful, whatsoever things of a good report, think on these things, it helps purify your mind. Praise the Lord. First John 3:2, beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure. Now you see friends this is the part that modern day Christendom wants nothing to do with. They want Jesus to do it all. Jesus save them. Jesus cleanse them. Jesus make them ready for heaven. And they go ahead and just do whatever they are. And they'll just sing these songs all the time. Oh, I'm still just an old sinner saved by grace. So, I'm still sinner. I'm still running around. I'm still committing adultery, but I'm saved by grace now. Oh, okay. So, you was a sinner and done that. You was going to hell. Yeah, that's right. Then I got saved by grace and I'm still doing the same thing and now I'm going to heaven. That's crazy. &gt;&gt; I SAID, \"THAT'S CRAZY. WHAT GOOD DID IT DO HIM TO COME AND DIE AND PAY THE PRICE IF HIS BLOOD AND HIS HOLY GHOST HAD NO MORE POWER TO IT THAN THAT? &gt;&gt; Oh my cleansing ourselves. Can I have a few more minutes? 2 Corinthians chapter 7 verse one. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; Cleanse ourselves &gt;&gt; ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Look at the word cleanse, purge, purify in a moral sense to free from defilement of sin, from faults. To consecrate by cleansing or purifying. Oh, you mean, brother Ni, there's some things I got to do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that pitiful? &gt;&gt; You poor little overweight lesian Christian. Now, there's no way I'll be able to finish this this morning, but I'm going to go into it and then we'll stop. Let me share something with you now historically about a Jewish wedding. In ancient Jewish tradition, marriage was considered a deeply sacred covenant and various rituals were performed to prepare the bride and groom spiritually and physically for this important step. The ritual bath or mitvah was a central part of this preparation particularly for the bride. Here's an expanded explanation of the practice and its significance. The bride immersed herself in a mikvah, a specially constructed pool of natural flowing water. And she could not be cleansed in a sistern. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like a broken sister. &gt;&gt; It had to be running water, particularly constructed for this purpose. from rain, springs or rivers. This immersion was not just about physical cleanliness but ritual purity. It was seen as a spiritual cleansing symbolizing the bride's readiness for a new chapter in life free from purities. The immersion typically occurred shortly before the wedding and water symbolized life, renewal, and a connection to the divine. By immersing fully in the water, the bride experienced a symbolic rebirth. Praise be to God. So the bride experienced a symbolic rebirth preparing her to embrace the sacred bond of marriage. The immersion was accomplished by specific blessings often said silently by the bride. These blessings expressed gratitude to God and invoked his presence in the new phase of life. So the bride goes into this pool which has been designed for this particular purpose. She goes in by herself and she immerses herself in this waters of baptism as we'll say. And then she comes up and she may do it multiple times. And as she's doing it in her own heart, she's praising, giving gratitude to God and blessing his name. What's this doing? This is preparing her for a new phase of her life. Now remember, she's already betrothed to this man. By law, she is already his, but he's not yet into her yet. and the last cup of wine has not yet been drank. Now watch the parallel in Ephesians 5 as Paul uses this same type. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself FOR IT THAT HE MIGHT sanctify and cleanse it with the washing which is present tense. the washing of the water by the word which is not logos but rama rama. So Paul picks up that the bride in the New Testament must enter into this washing. And the word Rama means that which IS OR HAS BEEN UTTERED by a living voice. A thing spoken, a declaration of one's mind made in words. Go with me to things that are to be. A pest house is where they put all the diseased people. Well, that's what sin done unto us. Put us in an earthly pest house. They wouldn't let anyone else come in the pest house because there's all kinds of germs. germs flying around in there and the people will take these germs and be sick themselves and sin brought us into the devil's past house. Oh, but the other one is called my father's house. And remember he reads this when he preaches this things that are to be is where he reads from in St. John 14. I go and prepare a place for you and take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house. Amen. THERE YOU ARE. TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS OLD EARTHLY PEST HOUSE. HE'S gone to prepare A PLACE, A PERFECT place where no evil exist, no sickness exist, no old age exist, no death exist. It's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there. The Bible said, \"So Jesus said, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect.\" IT'S A PERFECT KINGDOM. So it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of God. And you must be a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; So how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God? which is the waters of separation that washes US FROM OUR SINS. AMEN. That's right. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THINK OF IT. THE DRIPPING BLOODY WORD. THE BLOOD, THE WORD OF GOD. BLEEDING blood to wash the bride in. So the word become a man and the man released three elements out of his body. Water, blood, spirit. So it was the word hanging on the tree that would release the washing of the water that be able to give the bride a rebirth. BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND OUR CLEANSING happens one time when it comes to the soul, but then we've got that daily cleansing of our hands and our feet. &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful to God for that? &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. NOTICE BLEEDING BLOOD TO WASH THE BRIDE IN. AMEN. YES, SIR. SHE STANDS PERFECT, VIRGIN, UNADULTERATED. She never sinned in the first place. SHE WAS TRAPPED INTO IT. SEE, there's the father's house that he's gone to prepare. The night before this, he preaches the rapture. One day, there will come a blast from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. them Old Testament saints back yonder who are waiting will blast forth and come out first and go into the resurrection and we'll drop right in line going into the sky. These old mortal bodies changed and made like unto his own glorious body. What a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward some of these days and that rapturing time that LAYS AHEAD. ALL PROUDLY DISPLAYING THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST UPON THEIR CHEST, &gt;&gt; the message of God in the hour that they lived in. &gt;&gt; That's the hour we're looking forward to. Brother, &gt;&gt; can't you see, children? As we come closer and closer, he wants us just to keep washing. I remember when I was a little boy, I was an odd little old boy. Always was. You say, \"You're still odd. I know that.\" But I remember when I was a little boy, I couldn't stand to have my hands dirty. And that's crazy. We was a bunch of hillbillies, man. Harry was rednecks from top of our head down to the bottom of our feet. We'd get out and swing on grape vines and just, you know, do all kinds of crazy stuff. I was constantly washing my hands. I couldn't stand I'm still that way. I hate to say it, but I'm still that way. But oh, how much MORE DO I WANT MY MY WALK WITH GOD? HOW MUCH MORE I WANT MY MOTIVES, MY OBJECTIVES, MY ATTITUDES TO BE WASHED IN HIS PRESENCE. OH, brother D. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT SAVED. NO, I'VE ALREADY HAD THAT INITIAL MIKVAH. &gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY BEEN I'VE ACCEPT THE BETROAL. HALLELUJAH. I HAVE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT I KNOW IT AIN'T GOING TO BE LONG. I'M GOING TO SEE HIM. AND I DON'T WANT NO SPOTS ON MY GARMENTS. I DON'T WANT NO BLEMISHES. I DON'T WANT NO WRINKLES. &gt;&gt; AND HOW AM I GOING TO STAY CLEAN? &gt;&gt; Washing of the water by the word. Let me read this and I'll close. Paul goes on in verse 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle. Where does wrinkles come from? Setting or laying. The bride ain't got no spiritual recliners. I ain't talking about in your house and I'm talking about in your walk with God. You ain't got time to sit down. You ain't got no time to to just relax. This is not the time to relax. It's a time of war. &gt;&gt; No spot, no wrinkle or any such thing. Verse 28. So ought men to love their own bodies, the wives as their own bodies. Let me read just another part of this and then we'll pick it up real money next time. The pre-marriage mikvah is a spiritual and uplifting preparation for the sanctity of the wedding day likened to the bride's own personal yam kapor the day she is reborn as a unit together with her husband approaching ing life a fresh slate. You imagine one day you'll hear the last sermon that you'll ever need and your hands and your feet will be washed for the last time. And either you leave the earth in your own personal embark or we will go together as bride and the great resurrection will set in. And those who have gone on before us will be released from the sixth dimension who've walked in the light of their day. And what have we done? We've had our own personal yam kapour, our day of full redemption. And that last cleansing will be consummated with a surge of the spirit of God that will come over our bodies and we will take our last dip. You go to your church service the last time you'll raise your hands and praise God as a mortal. for the last time. You'll sing for the last time as a mortal. Praise be to God. And then all of a sudden, you'll come up out of those cleansing waters. It oh my, who knows, the last service we have before the rapture might be a hide skin and type of service. And we all just be have to have help being packed out of the back door. And the Lord says they're ready to come home. They're ready to come home. I don't know what it'll be, but I know one thing. Shouting ain't what gets us ready a lot of the times. Preacher pat us on her head ain't what gets us ready. It's that hide skin and type of stuff that says you got to do this and you got to do that. Come on, somebody. Why? Because the real bride of JESUS CHRIST WANTS TO BE A PERFECT MATCH &gt;&gt; FOR HER HUSBAND. STAND. Praise be to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you today, Father. Lord God, I want to give you praise and honor. Thank you for giving me strength today, Lord, to help me. I'm grateful, my father. I pray for what I'll lack, dear God, that you'd make up for it. Lord Jesus, may each of us realize what the rest of Christendom laughs at and makes fun of and oh, they preach this and they preach that. I can never go there. Don't do this. Don't do that. What they think is unnecessary is what we realize is the final building blocks for our walk with you. Oh Jesus. Even though that little lady has been betrothed to that young man, she's lived faithful. Most of the engagement was at least for a year to make sure she was not with seed of another man. Then everything starts going to the day of preparation. She doesn't even know when it will be, but he'll send the friend of the bridegroom with her wedding dress. Even then, she doesn't know exactly the day to put it on. But then that messenger will come with a message on a certain day and say, \"Today is the day. Get ready. Get dressed.\" She may get dressed at 8:00 in the morning cuz she's under such anticipation. Noon passes, still not there. 1:00, she's getting more anxious. two, three, four. She's still more anxious. All he told her was get dressed and be ready. Praise God. And we know it was night time actually when he come because that's a parable you gave us in Matthew 25. Oh Lord Jesus, we know how it is. We're living in this dark, filthy, cruel, ungodly world. Everywhere we look around us is black and smut, nasty, filthy, ungodly things around us. We just brush up next to it, Lord. And it gets all over our white wedding garments. We have to go to church and hear the preaching of the word. And every God called man's got spot remover. Every God called man has got these blemish remover. And he's got his iron in there to iron out them wrinkles. Sometimes he uses it on her head and here and there, too, cuz we need it. But it's to have us ready. We want to be pressed spotless. We want to be ready, Jesus. Help us, Father. Thank you for being patient with us, Lord. Thank you for being longsuffering and enduring and waiting for the harvest of the earth. We're sorry that it's took us so long to come up to where we are. We ask for your forgiveness for our longevity, Lord, of how we've delayed it. Oh God, may you help us, Lord, that we'll have a desire greater than ever before. May we be like that little lady whenever she steps down into that mikvah. She may go up and down several times, who knows? Rehearsing the promises of God, remembering who she was before he met her, remembering what life she had and what new life she's fixing to do. May we look at it that way when we come to church. Say, \"Well, praise God. Wonder what I'm going to hear today. Wonder what I'm going to hear Wednesday night that's going to help cleanse me and get me one service closer to being ready to meet the Lord Jesus.\" Lord, that's the way we want to look at it. The prophet said, 'We come to church to find out our faults and our shortcomings. One day, Lord, I'll dip for my last time. I'll be cleansed of whatever it is that hinders me. And when that last dip removes it and whether I go by the way of the grave or whether I I'm privileged to be able to live and be caught up with the rest of the living saints, I don't really care, Lord. just at your timeline. Whatever you want for me is what I want. What a day that will be. Jesus. Hallelujah. As our brother Dave sang it earlier, Lord, we're longing for that place. No more night. No more pain. No more suffering. No more babies born blind. No more cancer, no more disease, Jesus. Oh, Father, help us. We love you today, Lord God. We worship you with all of our hearts. We magnify your name, Lord. How many wants to be ready with all your heart? You just want him to take your life and mold you and shape you. You want to have an open heart to him today, friends, where he can always speak to you and you won't resent him. You won't resent his word. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, Jesus. I'm going to ask you, would you just take and lay your hand over on the brother, sister that's standing by you. Brother Joe, would you come and pray over the people? Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Pray for Abby. She is sick. And also Leah and Shawn traveling to Alabama as orientation for a new job. So, Sister Bonnie, let's remember that. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful for your word this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I pray, Father, that you would let it embed itself in our hearts, and our souls, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we take granted so many times, Father, that Lord, that we're a Christian, we're Christlike, Father, when we look at the definition of what it's like, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we seem to feel so short. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want to give you praise and glory this morning, Father, for what you've made us, Lord. We thank you for for touching brother Donnie this morning for giving him Lord strength Lord Jesus to to bring forth the word Lord. Lord we want to worship you. We want to praise you Lord for what you've given us Lord. Lord as I was reading last night Father when when when John turned and looked and Father the the lamb had opened the book Lord that contained the seals and brother Benham said that was rapturing faith in those seals. The redemption plan Father was was brought out Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And the Bible says I pray father &gt;&gt; that the elders hearts our lives help us beast ourselves from anything &gt;&gt; Lord the angels that was around the throne father tens of thousands times tens of thousands &gt;&gt; thank you father &gt;&gt; Lord if they could rejoice &gt;&gt; for our redemption Lord &gt;&gt; yes father &gt;&gt; beings Lord that don't need redemption beings that didn't need rapturing faith Lord &gt;&gt; Jesus we bless you &gt;&gt; Lord they rejoice because our name was revealed Lord &gt;&gt; Father we love youordord We may our see ourselves as pure. May we see ourselves as you looked on that book and you saw our name. Father, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, if we would fall short in any way. If we had a ought against anybody, Lord, Lord, may you take it out, Lord. I read what your prophet said. Lord, when you have that in your life, where you have a you're struggling against somebody, you become a stumbling block. When you pray, God don't even hear you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want nothing between us and you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to look in the mirror of our word. the word Lord and we want to see Father that Lord that this we have no blemish we have no spot father &gt;&gt; Lord that's what you for ordained for us Lord touch every need here Lord touch brother Donnie give him strength Lord Lord you know the hearts of the people father meet their needs Lord as so much sickness is going around Father Lord I pray that you would touch it all give them health father Bonnie's request Lord &gt;&gt; we're believing you for it Father Lord God &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; thank you Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; thank you Lord Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Come sing your song again. You going to play it from the organ? Play from the piano. The timeless thing earth and heaven will pass away. It's not a dream.

And we each\n[17:26] have our own needs that are not\n[17:28] expressed\n[17:30] so personal to us. Lord, I pray that you\n[17:32] would meet with us and help us to get\n[17:34] out of the way of ourselves. Help the\n[17:36] the minister to be used of you, Lord,\n[17:39] and help us to to just\n[17:43] sit and and hear what you have for us,\n[17:45] Lord. We thank you for this time\n[17:47] together, and we pray that you would be\n[17:49] with us in all that we'd say and do\n[17:51] throughout the rest of the day and\n[17:52] throughout our week, and that you'd help\n[17:54] us to be an example and a light for you\n[17:56] in Jesus name.

No\n[18:14] matter where we were. Amen. He came\n[18:17] looking for us.\n[18:19] Oh, one night while home life's rag and\n[18:24] sea, it looked as if I would suffer\n[18:28] defeat. As the blackness of night closed\n[18:33] off the light, my heart sank with fear.\n[18:40] My desperate cry rang out with fright.\n[18:45] All I could see was no hope inside. With\n[18:50] faith all but gone, I met the one who\n[18:55] came looking for me.\n[18:59] He came looking for me.\n[19:04] He came looking for me.\n[19:10] He made a way when there was no way that\n[19:16] I could see.\n[19:18] [Music]\n[19:20] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near to\n[19:25] rescue my soul and calm all my fears.\n[19:30] Now I'm saved from all harm. I met the\n[19:34] one who came looking for me.\n[19:40] Oh, Satan had already picked out my\n[19:44] grave. His plan had moved forward to put\n[19:48] me away. I'd drifted so far. Would\n[19:52] anyone care that I'd soon be lost?\n[19:59] I knew my destruction was a matter of\n[20:03] time.\n[20:05] Jesus appeared and said, \"This one is\n[20:08] mine. I'm safe with no harm.\" He walked\n[20:13] through the storm. He came looking for\n[20:16] me.\n[20:18] Oh, he came looking for me.\n[20:24] He came looking for me.\n[20:29] He made a way when there was no way that\n[20:35] I could see.\n[20:39] I drifted so far. Jesus was near. Rescue\n[20:45] my soul and calm all my fears. Now I'm\n[20:49] safe from all harm. I met the one who\n[20:54] came looking for me again.\n[20:58] Oh, Satan had already picked out my\n[21:02] grave. His plan and moved forward to put\n[21:06] me away. I drifted so far. Would anyone\n[21:12] care that I'd soon be lost?\n[21:18] I knew my destruction was a matter of\n[21:22] time. But Jesus appeared and said, \"This\n[21:26] one is mine now. I'm safe with no harm.\"\n[21:31] He walked through the storm. He came\n[21:33] looking for me.\n[21:37] &gt;&gt; He came looking for me. He came looking\n[21:41] for me. He came looking for me. He came\n[21:46] looking for me.\n[21:48] He made a way when there was no way that\n[21:53] I could see.\n[21:57] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near.\n[22:03] Rescue my soul and calm all my fears.\n[22:08] Now I'm saved from all harm. Since I met\n[22:11] the one who came looking for me. Oh,\n[22:15] let's sing it one more time. He came\n[22:18] looking for me. He came looking for me.\n[22:22] He came looking for me. He came looking\n[22:26] for me.\n[22:28] He made a way when there was no way that\n[22:33] I could see.\n[22:37] I drifted so far. Jesus was here to\n[22:43] rescue my soul and calm all my fears\n[22:47] down safe from harm.\n[22:50] I met the one who came looking for me.\n[22:57] When I drifted so far, Jesus was near to\n[23:03] rescue my soul and calm all my fears.\n[23:07] Now I'm safe from all harm. Since I met\n[23:11] the one who came looking for me.\n[23:17] Glory. Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap\n[23:20] of praise this morning.\n[23:22] Mighty you are. Holy you are. Mighty you\n[23:25] are.

While he's uh while he's away\n[41:18] I think it's always a special uh uh\n[41:20] feels like a just a special privilege to\n[41:23] have the trust of uh speaking somewhere\n[41:26] while the pastor's away. want to be good\n[41:28] stewards of that this morning and just\n[41:30] uh trust that the Lord will use it to\n[41:32] bless you, to help you, and encourage\n[41:34] you. That's that's all that we want to\n[41:35] be this morning is a help and amen. So,\n[41:38] God bless you and good to be with you.\n[41:40] We'll go to the word in Matthew chapter\n[41:42] 6 today.\n[42:03] Matthew chapter 6 26- 29.\n[42:07] I'd just like to consider the lily this\n[42:09] morning.\n[42:24] Jesus says, \"Behold the fowls of the\n[42:26] air,\n[42:27] for they sow not, neither do they reap,\n[42:30] nor gather into barns, and yet your\n[42:32] heavenly Father feedth them. Are ye not\n[42:36] much better than they? Which of you by\n[42:39] taking thought can add one cubit unto\n[42:41] his stature? Why take ye thought for\n[42:43] raignment? Consider the liies of the\n[42:46] field, how they grow. They toil not,\n[42:50] neither do they spin. And yet I say unto\n[42:53] you that even Solomon in all his glory\n[42:56] was not a raid like one of these. Amen.\n[42:59] I I quite like that scripture. Amen.\n[43:02] Let's uh let's just bow our heads in a\n[43:04] word of prayer. Lord Jesus,\n[43:07] Lord, uh every opportunity with your\n[43:09] word, Lord, is an opportunity, Lord, and\n[43:12] to hear your voice, Father. Lord, to\n[43:15] experience your presence, Lord, to look\n[43:17] upon your face. And we just ask, Lord,\n[43:20] as we just brought simple, Lord, uh\n[43:23] humble things, Lord, that are on our\n[43:24] heart this morning, Lord, that your Holy\n[43:27] Spirit would come, Father, and make it\n[43:29] not a dead letter, Lord, or or or empty\n[43:32] lecture, Father. But I pray Lord that\n[43:35] your Holy Spirit would just inhabit this\n[43:36] service. Father Lord maybe things that\n[43:39] we've heard many times Lord would just\n[43:41] uh Lord you would just bring an a\n[43:43] special inspiration today Father that\n[43:45] would make it more real than it's ever\n[43:46] been before Father. It's many times Lord\n[43:49] when we consider Lord the simple things\n[43:51] of your creation Lord but Lord but spend\n[43:54] a little time with them Lord that the\n[43:55] the great profound truths Lord behind it\n[43:58] is open to us Father. I just pray Lord\n[44:01] that Lord as we would consider the liies\n[44:03] Father we would consider the seed that's\n[44:05] within us Lord Jesus. Father that we\n[44:08] would just find inspiration Lord to know\n[44:10] that there's a law of life at work Lord\n[44:12] in every Christian heart. We just Lord\n[44:14] uh we ask Lord that you would inhabit\n[44:16] the service. May you anoint the lips of\n[44:18] the speaker Father but also the ears of\n[44:20] the hearer Lord Jesus. Have your way\n[44:23] Lord and let your Holy Spirit take\n[44:24] control in Jesus name. Amen. God bless\n[44:28] you as you're seated today. Amen.\n[44:32] Just to consider the lily today. Uh you\n[44:34] know uh I think uh uh I think of a quote\n[44:38] brother Brandham would use and God\n[44:39] hiding himself in simplicity. It's uh I\n[44:42] quite like this quote brother Brandham\n[44:44] would would say in that message you know\n[44:46] which is all about you know the depths\n[44:48] of of of the revelation of Christ yet\n[44:52] it's hid in simple things right God is\n[44:54] hidden simplicity. One of the things he\n[44:56] would say in that message, he would say\n[44:58] he'd say that a man could sit down and\n[45:00] look at a bunch of flowers, a bouquet.\n[45:03] And and and he said a man could sit down\n[45:05] and study that bouquet for 30 minutes if\n[45:08] he and if he would do that sincerely\n[45:10] with all of his heart. Brother Bram said\n[45:11] he would know more about God than he did\n[45:14] if he had all the degrees that a Bible\n[45:16] school could offer. Amen. All the\n[45:18] degrees a Bible school could give him.\n[45:20] He said, \"For God reveals himself in the\n[45:22] flower.\" So just uh might might behoove\n[45:25] us just for a few moments today. Amen.\n[45:27] To consider the lily. Jesus has put it\n[45:29] forth in the scripture as a symbol of\n[45:32] the Christian. It's a symbol of one of\n[45:33] God's children. Amen. We are his liies.\n[45:36] We are we are flowers in his bouquet. Is\n[45:38] that right? And brother Brandham would\n[45:40] would speak on it many times. Uh uh uh\n[45:43] as far as I'm aware, I don't think that\n[45:45] it's on tape. I think it was an early\n[45:47] one that he preached called Reverend Mr.\n[45:49] Lily. But he would reference it a lot.\n[45:50] you could tell was one of his favorite\n[45:52] thoughts there on Reverend Mr. Lily. So,\n[45:54] you know, the story of a of this flower,\n[45:57] the story of this lily is your story and\n[45:59] it's my story. The story of an\n[46:00] overcoming Christian. It, you know,\n[46:02] there's a uh there's a there's a there's\n[46:05] a growth to the life of a Christian.\n[46:06] There's a process. It starts with a it\n[46:09] starts with a quickened seed, but it\n[46:11] comes up into a blossom. Amen. And a\n[46:13] flower has a it has a purpose. There's a\n[46:16] purpose for a flower and its purpose is\n[46:18] to show forth a beauty. Amen. And it and\n[46:21] and and to put out a fragrance and\n[46:24] there's something that comes out of the\n[46:26] expression of that lily life which gives\n[46:28] it meaning. It gives it worth and it\n[46:30] gives it value. Is that right? Amen. So,\n[46:32] you know, we just want to we just want\n[46:33] to just uh kind of kind of kind of go\n[46:36] with that line of thinking today. Would\n[46:37] that be all right with you? Amen. Amen.\n[46:39] So, you know, to start to start with the\n[46:41] the the story of a lily, you start with\n[46:43] a seed, right? You go down to uh there's\n[46:46] a family in our church has a greenhouse.\n[46:48] Quite quite an amazing operation that\n[46:49] they have. And when you go down there on\n[46:51] opening day in the springtime, you look\n[46:53] and you see such beautiful flowers and\n[46:55] just uh every different color and shape.\n[46:58] And you know, these flowers are given\n[46:59] out this, you know, this beautiful\n[47:01] expression. It's just uh has such a\n[47:04] value to it and has such a beauty. and\n[47:06] you look at that flower, you begin to\n[47:08] say, \"Well, my goodness, you know, uh I\n[47:10] I I love the beauty of this flower, but\n[47:12] now what if I wanted to have that in my\n[47:15] yard?\" And you know, what if I wanted to\n[47:16] have that in my front garden or in my\n[47:18] you know, in a in a window in my house?\n[47:20] And you know, how can I attain that?\n[47:22] Well, you you you can't just you can't\n[47:25] just uh you can't just manifest a flower\n[47:27] into being. You got to start with a\n[47:29] seed. Is that right? It's the same way\n[47:31] it is with the Christian life. Sometimes\n[47:32] a young Christian, we look at people\n[47:34] around us and and they're living such a\n[47:36] to such a on such a level with Christ\n[47:39] and and their their their life is giving\n[47:41] out such virtue and such a testimony and\n[47:44] such an atmosphere and and a young\n[47:45] Christian will look at that and say,\n[47:46] \"Well, you know, that that seems so\n[47:49] unattainable. What hope do I have of of\n[47:52] achieving, you know, that that level of\n[47:54] the expression of a Christian life?\" you\n[47:56] know, how do I become that that that\n[47:58] that that blossoming lily of a\n[48:00] Christian, you know, that has a\n[48:02] fragrance to their life and they have a\n[48:03] beauty that they're putting forth? And\n[48:05] it's the exact same principle. Amen. You\n[48:07] you don't become that overnight. You\n[48:09] don't just uh you know, uh uh you don't\n[48:10] just join the church on Monday and then\n[48:13] you're, you know, you're just a fully\n[48:14] manifested son the next Sunday. Amen.\n[48:17] You you uh you got to start with a seed.\n[48:19] Amen. But but there's a something\n[48:21] beautiful in that is that all all true\n[48:24] lilies and all fully manifested liies\n[48:27] started in the humility of a seed. Amen.\n[48:29] And God puts something in a seed. Amen.\n[48:32] That that uh that will guide it to its\n[48:35] full destiny and its full expression.\n[48:37] Getting ahead of myself today, but but\n[48:39] you got to start with a seed, friends.\n[48:40] And you know, that's why we we minister\n[48:43] on the quickening power. Amen. Uh how\n[48:45] many believe that this message is still\n[48:47] full of quickening power? I know that a\n[48:49] lot of people you know have uh\n[48:50] intellectualized it over the years there\n[48:53] uh traditions of men have come and you\n[48:55] know and taken the moving the spirit out\n[48:57] of the church and given us a form and\n[49:00] you know uh uh a lot of people become\n[49:02] cold and formal and lukewarm and starchy\n[49:05] and powerless with this message. But I\n[49:07] believe as long as the message amen is\n[49:09] is on this earth and as long as the\n[49:11] people that believe it are on this earth\n[49:13] amen we've got to have quickening power\n[49:15] moving in the church of the living God.\n[49:17] Amen. And the reason I believe that is\n[49:19] not so that we can, you know, just\n[49:21] gather together and have a big noisy\n[49:23] service and the preacher can feel like\n[49:24] he really preached something because\n[49:25] everybody's excited. Amen. I believe\n[49:27] that because I believe that uh it takes\n[49:30] quickening power to make a seed live.\n[49:32] Amen. It takes quickening power to make\n[49:34] a seed live. Because a seed, you know,\n[49:36] you may think uh because a seed, you\n[49:38] know, think of a think of an acorn or,\n[49:40] you know, any kind of a a tree seed. Uh,\n[49:43] that seed isn't born to life when it\n[49:45] falls from the branch of its parentage.\n[49:47] Amen. Amen. An aorn isn't born when it\n[49:50] falls off the oak tree. That's not the\n[49:52] birth. Amen. Amen. But sometimes it'll\n[49:54] fall from where it came from. It'll fall\n[49:56] from its parent tree. Amen. And it might\n[49:59] lay in a dormant condition for a long\n[50:01] long time. Sometimes years. Amen. And uh\n[50:04] it it could lay there just as dead as it\n[50:07] could be. No life in it. No ability to\n[50:09] express itself. Amen. But it takes a\n[50:11] moment. Amen. A quickening. It takes a a\n[50:14] from that time moment. And that's the\n[50:16] way it's got to be for every born again\n[50:18] son or daughter of God. Amen. We've had\n[50:20] our experience, but for our young\n[50:22] people, it has to be the same thing.\n[50:23] It's not because they join a church.\n[50:25] It's not cuz they believe God sent a\n[50:27] prophet. It's not about the way you\n[50:28] dress. It's not about the lifestyle that\n[50:30] you follow. Amen. It takes quickening\n[50:32] power, amen, to take a intellectual\n[50:34] message believer and make them a message\n[50:36] liver and a message manifesttor. Amen.\n[50:39] Amen. If you're you see uh because\n[50:42] that's when a seed is born is when it's\n[50:43] quickened. Amen. Something has to\n[50:45] germinate. Something has to happen.\n[50:47] Amen. Amen. And everything else about\n[50:50] that seed. When you look at a seed,\n[50:51] you're looking at the outward things,\n[50:54] you know, the outward appearance of a\n[50:55] seed. What you're looking at is just a\n[50:57] dead husk which is eventually going to\n[50:59] rot away. Is that right? All of that is\n[51:02] just, you know, those are that's just\n[51:03] the conditions. That's just the\n[51:05] circumstances and the, you know, and and\n[51:07] the uh and the nutrients which are which\n[51:09] are put around that seed. Amen. To give\n[51:11] it what it needs, amen, to be quickened\n[51:14] and then it'll begin to grow. Amen. And\n[51:16] that's why we come to church on Sunday\n[51:17] morning. We sing songs and we worship\n[51:19] the Lord. We fellowship with one\n[51:21] another. We build buildings. We we have\n[51:23] programs and we preach sermons and we do\n[51:25] all these kind of things. But without a\n[51:28] life at the core of that, Amen. without\n[51:30] uh quickening power. Amen. In that\n[51:33] tabernacle, it's a husk. Amen. It's it's\n[51:35] just dead religion. Amen. Amen. And so,\n[51:38] you know, I if you're uh Amen. that\n[51:41] that's the only uh that's the only\n[51:43] prescription. Amen. That's the only way\n[51:45] today. Amen. You see, brother Bram would\n[51:47] say uh he would he would tell us that no\n[51:49] matter how good a seed looks, he said\n[51:51] the only question of a seed is whether\n[51:52] it's been germatized. Amen. If it's not\n[51:55] germatized, it'll rot and it'll lay\n[51:57] there. And I Yeah, I like how he said he\n[51:59] said it's no matter how good you are,\n[52:00] how much of a deacon, preacher, pastor,\n[52:02] teacher, Sunday school person, whoever\n[52:04] you are, no matter how loud you shouted,\n[52:06] no matter how you've danced or whatever\n[52:08] you've done, and how many missionaries\n[52:10] you sent to the field or when you die,\n[52:12] he said when you die, you're dead if the\n[52:14] Holy Spirit isn't there to raise you up.\n[52:16] If your spirit hasn't been changed into\n[52:19] that person of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.\n[52:21] But you know, just to turn that around\n[52:23] this morning then to think, Amen. You\n[52:25] might not be the best pre- Christian\n[52:26] there is. You might not be the best\n[52:28] church member. You might not look like\n[52:30] the best preacher or the best believer\n[52:31] or the, you know, the best dressed one\n[52:33] in the church. You may not have the best\n[52:34] gifts and talents and amen. Uh whatever\n[52:37] it is, it might not look like uh from\n[52:39] the outside you might not look like\n[52:41] much. But but the thing is if you've\n[52:42] been germatized, amen, if you've ever\n[52:44] been quickened, if you ever been\n[52:46] baptized with the Holy Ghost, Amen. then\n[52:48] it looses something on the inside of\n[52:50] you. Amen. that will go that from that\n[52:52] time it'll begin to grow. It'll begin to\n[52:55] advance. Amen. It'll begin to push out.\n[52:57] And it does that all on its own. Amen.\n[52:59] Because it's a seed. Amen. And I I I\n[53:02] believe uh I believe the message of the\n[53:04] hour in that way. I believe this message\n[53:06] is so full of power. Amen. That it can\n[53:08] still Amen. bring forth Holy Ghost\n[53:10] baptized children in the church of the\n[53:12] living God. I believe I believe it's\n[53:14] still so full of power. Amen. that the\n[53:16] Holy Ghost can come down on Sunday\n[53:17] morning and begin to walk the aisles and\n[53:19] move on needs and perform miracles and\n[53:22] heal the sick and deliver the bound and\n[53:24] do all of those kind of things. Amen. I\n[53:26] know that a lot of people have uh have\n[53:28] taken the message and and and and they\n[53:30] kind of got the idea that we've come so\n[53:31] far and that we know so much that now\n[53:34] we're a mature church and and we no\n[53:36] longer need, you know, the the\n[53:37] manifestation of the spirit because that\n[53:40] was all for that's just for the\n[53:41] Pentecostals and that's for that's for\n[53:43] Pentecostal babies and we're mature,\n[53:45] brother Nathan. But, you know, I believe\n[53:47] if you look at a tree or look at a\n[53:49] flower, Amen. that a mature plant is not\n[53:52] a plant which is fallen down and dried\n[53:55] up and just just no life in it and you\n[53:58] know and and and and and just laying\n[53:59] over in a corner somewhere. A mature\n[54:02] tree is a tree which has come to the\n[54:04] point, Amen, where it's able to\n[54:06] reproduce life. Amen. That that that\n[54:09] runs a lot deeper than I'm preaching to\n[54:10] this morning. But I believe I believe\n[54:12] we're a mature bride. I believe we we're\n[54:15] under a mature message in a mature\n[54:17] season. Amen. But brother Brandham said\n[54:19] that maturity would be full maturity\n[54:21] with full power. Amen. Amen. And I\n[54:23] believe, Amen. If if this message, Amen,\n[54:26] doesn't still have in it the ability to\n[54:28] bring forth children. Amen. And\n[54:30] reproduce new life, if it doesn't bring\n[54:32] life to the next generation, amen. Then\n[54:34] whatever our idea of the message is, we\n[54:36] need to throw it out and get back to the\n[54:38] quickening power. Amen. I believe in\n[54:40] quickening power. Amen. That'll not only\n[54:42] birth a seed, but it'll bring it up\n[54:44] higher than it is. Amen. It'll cause\n[54:46] that seed to grow. It'll cause that seed\n[54:48] to bring forth. Amen. Amen. We brother\n[54:52] would say if we get them to church,\n[54:53] that's good. But we got to get them\n[54:55] Amen. past the church and get them to\n[54:57] Christ. He said, where there's\n[54:59] quickening power. Amen. Where there's\n[55:01] quickening power. And I believe Amen. I\n[55:04] believe uh I believe that's where we're\n[55:05] to be. We ought to be a church that's\n[55:07] able to reproduce the original seed, the\n[55:11] original church, that original book of\n[55:13] Acts. Amen. That original life. Brother\n[55:16] Brandham would say, I'm I'm just laying\n[55:18] kind of a foundation here. And then just\n[55:20] bear with me for a little bit. Brother\n[55:22] Brandham in the rising of the sun there,\n[55:23] he would say he he would he would\n[55:25] challenge even his own church. And Amen.\n[55:27] I think it's a worthy question for any\n[55:29] for any believer. He would say, \"Is\n[55:31] there somebody here who doesn't have\n[55:33] this quickening power in you where the\n[55:36] sun has shined across?\" He said, \"Now\n[55:38] you might have,\" he said, \"you might\n[55:39] have sat in this tabernacle. You've\n[55:41] listened to tapes and yet the spirit has\n[55:44] never quickened you to follow the word\n[55:46] of God. He said that is a dangerous\n[55:48] thing. That's a dangerous thing, brother\n[55:50] sister. Cuz you know it's real easy to\n[55:52] join a church and be part of the\n[55:54] movement and dress the part and you know\n[55:56] rub shoulders with a with a with a group\n[55:58] of people. Amen. And and feel a sense of\n[56:01] belonging and feel a sense of identity\n[56:03] because of uh because of the church that\n[56:05] we associate with and still be a dead\n[56:07] seed. Brother Brandon say, \"The greatest\n[56:09] deception is for somebody to think\n[56:11] they're a Christian and not be.\" Amen.\n[56:13] Well, you know that, but there's a lot\n[56:14] of people who think they're a Christian\n[56:16] because they can quote some quotes. And\n[56:18] they think they're a Christian cuz they\n[56:19] dress better than somebody else. Or,\n[56:21] Amen. think they're a Christian cuz, you\n[56:23] know, they got better doctrine than a\n[56:24] Pentecost or think they're a Christian\n[56:26] because they got freer worship than a\n[56:28] Baptist. Or, you know, think they're a\n[56:30] Christian, Amen, because of all of the\n[56:32] outward husk of our Christianity. Amen.\n[56:34] Amen. But a real Christian is somebody\n[56:37] who's got a life. Amen. A power, a\n[56:39] quickening on the inside. Amen. Who can\n[56:42] take the word and then they can follow\n[56:43] it. Amen. Not just believe it, but\n[56:45] follow it and manifest it. Amen. And\n[56:48] bring it to pass. Brother say it was a\n[56:50] dangerous thing. What if you would be a\n[56:52] dead seed with no life in you? Oh, it's\n[56:55] dangerous. He said, \"But but there's\n[56:57] something in you.\" Oh, I love this.\n[56:59] There's something in you that tells you,\n[57:02] I want to rise this morning.\n[57:05] I want to rise this morning. I want to\n[57:07] rise from the state that I'm in. I don't\n[57:09] want to just be a dead seed and be left\n[57:11] to dirt and driftwood. I want to rise.\n[57:15] Amen. Now, brothers and sisters, I I\n[57:17] don't know where everybody's at this\n[57:19] morning, but there might be somebody in\n[57:20] the house of God today. Amen. And you\n[57:22] you might come and you might have come\n[57:24] to church today and your your life's in\n[57:26] a mess and you're really not in a good\n[57:28] place spiritually. And Amen. You might\n[57:30] you might be way below living way below\n[57:32] where you're supposed to be living.\n[57:33] Amen. and and and uh and and and feeling\n[57:36] just so much condemnation on you. Amen.\n[57:38] Just feeling so much pressure. Amen.\n[57:40] Because of just where you're at in in\n[57:42] your Christian walk. But but let let's\n[57:44] look a little deeper than that this\n[57:46] morning. Amen. Is there something under\n[57:47] all of your struggles, under all your\n[57:49] weaknesses, under all of the things that\n[57:51] you're pushing through? Is there a\n[57:53] little voice on the inside of you, just\n[57:55] a little still small voice? Amen.\n[57:57] Something in you saying, \"I want to\n[57:59] rise. I don't I don't want to live here,\n[58:02] Brother Nathan. I don't want to. This\n[58:03] isn't uh I don't believe this is where I\n[58:05] was who I was meant to be and what I was\n[58:07] meant to do. I don't know how to get a\n[58:09] little higher with God, but something in\n[58:10] me is telling me and pushing me and\n[58:13] pulling me and saying and saying I want\n[58:15] to rise. I want to come up a little\n[58:17] higher in the Amen. I I want to see\n[58:19] Amen. Uh I want to live in higher\n[58:21] heights. Amen. I want to be more than I\n[58:24] am. Brother, if you got that little\n[58:26] voice inside of you, you might feel like\n[58:28] the weakest Christian in the church.\n[58:29] Amen. But if you got that little voice,\n[58:31] you ought to thank the Lord today. Amen.\n[58:33] Cuz if you got a little voice of a seed\n[58:35] on the inside of you saying, \"I want to\n[58:37] rise.\" Brother, you got power. Amen.\n[58:40] It's power. You say, \"Brother Nathan,\n[58:42] but but my I have no power in my\n[58:44] Christian walk.\" Amen. But I'm talking\n[58:45] about a different kind of power. Amen.\n[58:47] There's so much power in the word of\n[58:48] God. We could preach on power to\n[58:50] overcome, power to heal, power to\n[58:53] perform miracles, power for signs and\n[58:55] wonders. Amen. Power, Amen. power to\n[58:57] speak in tongues and power to do this\n[58:59] and power to Amen. the Amen. The word is\n[59:01] full of power. But I want to preach on a\n[59:03] very special kind of power. And I might\n[59:05] be so bold today to today to say this is\n[59:08] the most important kind of power a\n[59:10] Christian has. Amen. It's power to\n[59:13] become. That's the power of a seed. It's\n[59:16] got power to become. Amen. There's a\n[59:18] power in a seed that no matter what it\n[59:20] looks like today, Amen. next year it's\n[59:23] not going to look the same. Amen. It's\n[59:25] got power in it to become more than it\n[59:27] thinks is possible. There's power in you\n[59:30] to become more than you ever imagined.\n[59:32] To experience more than you thought was\n[59:33] possible, to be more of a have more of a\n[59:36] Christian life than you thought you had\n[59:37] access to. It's power to become. Amen.\n[59:41] Amen. There's see something in you\n[59:43] wanting to rise that shows there's a\n[59:45] seed in there. Amen. And so and and that\n[59:48] and the thing is if you got a seed of\n[59:51] predestination in you, there's a law in\n[59:54] that seed. How many know that? That a\n[59:56] seed, naturally speaking, a seed is the\n[59:59] encapsulation of a law of God. Amen.\n[1:00:03] When you look at a seed, you're looking\n[1:00:04] at something that just uh it just\n[1:00:06] contains a law of God. Now, we're\n[1:00:09] talking about a law today. Amen. This in\n[1:00:11] other words, it's something God set into\n[1:00:13] motion. It's not a hope so or a might\n[1:00:16] be. It's a must be. It's a law. Amen. A\n[1:00:19] scriptural law. How many know in\n[1:00:21] Genesis? Amen. He created the heavens\n[1:00:23] and the earth. Amen. And then uh and\n[1:00:25] then he put a law into motion. He he he\n[1:00:28] remember brother Graham said he put the\n[1:00:29] seeds of creation into the earth. And\n[1:00:31] everything that he wanted to have life,\n[1:00:33] he would put the seeds of that life in\n[1:00:34] the earth. Amen. Amen. Now, now uh and\n[1:00:38] but when he planted those seeds, he put\n[1:00:40] a law in that seed. He said, \"Let every\n[1:00:42] seed bring forth of its own kind.\" Let\n[1:00:46] every seed bring forth of its own kind.\n[1:00:49] Now, that's a law. Amen. That's a law.\n[1:00:52] You ready for a little deep teaching\n[1:00:53] this morning?\n[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Ever since God put this law into place,\n[1:00:57] a cat has never had puppies.\n[1:01:01] Anybody ever seen it? Anybody ever seen\n[1:01:04] a dog have kittens? It's never happened.\n[1:01:07] Amen. Because it's a it's a law of God.\n[1:01:10] He put it right into the nature and the\n[1:01:12] makeup, amen, of a seed. Amen. That when\n[1:01:15] a seed is planted, there's already a\n[1:01:17] potential in that seed. Amen. That it\n[1:01:19] can become a and express the life that\n[1:01:22] it came from. It doesn't have to try to\n[1:01:24] do that. It doesn't hope to become that.\n[1:01:27] Amen. It must be that because it's a law\n[1:01:30] of Genesis. It's the law of the seed.\n[1:01:32] Amen. And now the law of the seed, it's\n[1:01:34] a very simple principle, but it runs\n[1:01:36] very, very deep. And you know, you can\n[1:01:38] sp God's things that God's simple truths\n[1:01:40] are are so profound. They're simple on\n[1:01:42] the surface and they're profound when we\n[1:01:44] begin to dig into them. But you know,\n[1:01:46] you can study a lot on how a seed works\n[1:01:48] and and they do today. There's never\n[1:01:50] been a time when our agriculture and the\n[1:01:52] growing of our food was more scientific\n[1:01:54] and more advanced. And you look at the\n[1:01:56] technology that they have and you know\n[1:01:58] they go in a lab somewhere with a little\n[1:01:59] seed and they they unwrap the gene of\n[1:02:01] that seed and they can you know they can\n[1:02:03] they can mess around with chemicals and\n[1:02:05] nutrients and and fertilization and amen\n[1:02:08] and and environment and they can do\n[1:02:10] everything and there's so much study\n[1:02:11] that you can put into it. There's so\n[1:02:13] much you know you can learn. There's so\n[1:02:15] much you can you can uh you can uh wrap\n[1:02:17] your mind around this process of a seed.\n[1:02:20] But you know, at the end of the day,\n[1:02:22] brother, sister, as scientific as it is\n[1:02:24] and and as advanced as it is, Amen. and\n[1:02:26] as intellectual as it's become, at the\n[1:02:29] end of the day, a farmer goes out in the\n[1:02:31] field, he puts a seed in the dirt, and\n[1:02:32] he lets God's law happen. Amen. Because\n[1:02:35] at the end of the day, there's something\n[1:02:36] beyond human control. There's something\n[1:02:38] beyond human ex understanding. Amen.\n[1:02:41] Something beyond comprehension. It's the\n[1:02:44] law of life that God put in a seed.\n[1:02:46] Amen. That it doesn't need your help to\n[1:02:48] become what it's supposed to be. And\n[1:02:50] then you can't tamper with it. Amen. You\n[1:02:52] can't come reach down and pluck a\n[1:02:54] blossom out of a lily seed. It's got to\n[1:02:56] follow God's law. It's got to go through\n[1:02:58] his process. It's got to grow. Amen.\n[1:03:01] Hallelujah. Amen. It's only the life\n[1:03:04] that's in the seed that can make it\n[1:03:06] blossom. Amen. Yeah. And and uh Brother\n[1:03:09] Bam would teach this and God's power to\n[1:03:11] transform. Let's listen. Listen close to\n[1:03:13] this quote here. Brother Brham said when\n[1:03:15] he put the seed in the earth, the seed\n[1:03:17] can only come forth with the power of\n[1:03:20] life in it. I love that. The power of\n[1:03:23] life to transform it from a seed to a\n[1:03:26] plant or whatever it was. His\n[1:03:28] transforming power. Now God put the So\n[1:03:32] what is God's power to transform? It's\n[1:03:34] the power of a seed. Amen. And he said,\n[1:03:37] \"Now God put the seed in there with\n[1:03:40] potentials that it would be what he said\n[1:03:42] it would be.\" Amen. And as long as it\n[1:03:45] stayed in its right category, it would\n[1:03:47] be just exactly what God said it would\n[1:03:49] be because he made it that way. And he\n[1:03:51] made a channel. Brother Bram said that\n[1:03:53] anything that stays in his channel or\n[1:03:56] follows his law in his line of word, it\n[1:03:59] will have to bring forth exactly like\n[1:04:02] his word said it would do. Hallelujah.\n[1:04:04] And brother Bram said, see, God planted\n[1:04:06] those seeds and then God said, \"It's all\n[1:04:08] good. It's all good. I'll just rest.\" I\n[1:04:11] tell you what, God's resting today.\n[1:04:13] God's not worried about it. He said,\n[1:04:15] \"It's all good and I'll just rest\n[1:04:17] because each one of those seeds has\n[1:04:20] power in itself.\" Amen. To transform\n[1:04:24] itself into the species that I desire it\n[1:04:27] to be. That's what it must be because I\n[1:04:30] have given to every seed. How many\n[1:04:32] believe you're a seed of God today? He\n[1:04:34] said, \"I have given every seed\n[1:04:36] transforming power.\" Amen. to make out\n[1:04:39] of itself in its potentials to make of\n[1:04:42] it exactly what I want it to be.\n[1:04:45] Hallelujah. You say, \"Brother Nathan, I\n[1:04:47] need that transforming power today. I\n[1:04:49] I'm sick and I need my body transformed.\n[1:04:52] I I I need my I need my mind\n[1:04:54] transformed. I need my attitude\n[1:04:56] transformed.\" Hallelujah. Amen. I I need\n[1:04:58] transforming power. Amen. Cuz I'm living\n[1:05:01] here and I want to live here and I need\n[1:05:03] a transformation in my life. Amen. Don't\n[1:05:05] look a million miles away in outer\n[1:05:07] space. Amen. for the power that you're\n[1:05:09] looking for. It's not on the other side\n[1:05:11] of the sea. Amen. When God, Amen,\n[1:05:13] predestinated you to be a child of God.\n[1:05:16] Amen. He planted a seed in you. And the\n[1:05:18] power that you need to become what God\n[1:05:20] wanted you to be is already in you.\n[1:05:23] Amen. There's a law of life in the seed\n[1:05:26] of election. Amen. He isn't worried\n[1:05:29] about it. God is resting on what he\n[1:05:32] already planted.\n[1:05:35] Hallelujah.\n[1:05:37] Amen. See, God didn't gain confidence in\n[1:05:39] you as this child. Amen. When you went\n[1:05:41] to the altar and knelt down to pray. God\n[1:05:44] didn't get confidence in you the day you\n[1:05:45] got the Holy Ghost. God didn't get gain\n[1:05:48] his confidence in you. Amen. When you\n[1:05:49] made a decision for the Lord or Amen or\n[1:05:52] or or when you joined the right church.\n[1:05:54] God has had confidence in you. Amen.\n[1:05:56] Since he carried you in his mind in seed\n[1:05:59] form before the foundation of the world,\n[1:06:01] God trusts his own law. Amen. We got to\n[1:06:04] trust it, too. You can trust that seed.\n[1:06:07] Amen. God put the power in it.\n[1:06:09] Transforming power to make itself what\n[1:06:11] he wanted it to be. Amen. God's already\n[1:06:14] provided the power. The Bible said,\n[1:06:17] Amen. As many as believed on him and\n[1:06:19] received him, to them gave he power to\n[1:06:22] become the sons of God. Amen. Even to\n[1:06:26] them that believe on his name. Amen.\n[1:06:28] That's God's law. That's God's See,\n[1:06:30] that's God's program. Amen. Is life\n[1:06:32] begets life. There's a there's a channel\n[1:06:35] to it. There's a cycle to it. Amen. You\n[1:06:38] know, we could stop and and preach here\n[1:06:39] a long time. Amen. We won't today, but\n[1:06:42] just to think of that of that process.\n[1:06:44] Amen. Of reproduction, Amen. of of life,\n[1:06:47] beginning life, of a seed line coming\n[1:06:49] down through generations. Amen. That's a\n[1:06:52] that's a there's a great focus on that\n[1:06:54] in the word of God. You can look at the\n[1:06:55] Old Testament and the great focus that\n[1:06:57] that they put on the rituals around\n[1:06:59] reproduction. Amen. You you can think\n[1:07:02] about think about to a Christian the\n[1:07:03] sanctity of a marriage vow. Amen. And\n[1:07:06] just the the terrible shame and Amen.\n[1:07:08] the terrible stigma. Amen. Around\n[1:07:10] infidelity and around, you know, being\n[1:07:12] promised to this one and running with\n[1:07:14] that one. Amen. What that means to a\n[1:07:15] Christian. What a wicked thing it is.\n[1:07:18] Amen. To be unfaithful. Amen. To the one\n[1:07:20] God has placed you with. Amen. You you\n[1:07:22] see some people today, they think, well,\n[1:07:24] all of those things, that's just some\n[1:07:25] man trying to control me and that's\n[1:07:27] just, you know, that's just some church\n[1:07:29] trying to tell me what to do and keep me\n[1:07:30] away from things that feel good or, you\n[1:07:33] know, thing things I want to do. Amen.\n[1:07:35] But it's a lot deeper than that,\n[1:07:36] friends. Amen. This seed line is very,\n[1:07:39] very important to God. It's very\n[1:07:41] important to God. Amen. Even so much\n[1:07:43] that that your great great great\n[1:07:45] grandfather would have angels escorting\n[1:07:47] him on the battlefield. He he would be\n[1:07:50] fighting a war somewhere. Amen. But\n[1:07:51] God's angels would escort that seed.\n[1:07:54] Amen. So that it wouldn't come to an\n[1:07:55] untimely end. Amen. Because God had to\n[1:07:58] bring this one to this one and this one\n[1:07:59] to this one. Amen. And bring it down\n[1:08:01] generation to generation. Amen. See,\n[1:08:03] God's got a purpose. God's got a plan.\n[1:08:06] God's got something he's trying to bring\n[1:08:08] forth. Amen. So, see, God's God cares\n[1:08:11] about the seed. Amen. And he cares about\n[1:08:14] preserving that life. And and all of\n[1:08:16] these things are about the preservation\n[1:08:18] and the propagation of life. Amen. The\n[1:08:21] protection of life. Amen. That's that's\n[1:08:24] see that's the kind of God who's\n[1:08:26] watching over this message and the and\n[1:08:28] its believers. Brother would often quote\n[1:08:31] the scripture in Isaiah. I the Lord do\n[1:08:33] keep it and I will water it every moment\n[1:08:36] lest any heard it. I will keep it night\n[1:08:39] and day. Amen. You somebody came to\n[1:08:42] brother Brand. Brother Bran would always\n[1:08:43] quote it this way. He would say, \"I the\n[1:08:45] Lord planted it before the foundation of\n[1:08:46] the world and I'll water it.\" Amen. lest\n[1:08:49] anybody should pluck it from my hand.\n[1:08:52] Amen. You can see he's putting you right\n[1:08:53] in that scripture. One of God's seed is\n[1:08:55] one of his sheep. Somebody will come to\n[1:08:57] say, \"Brother Brandon, how how is it\n[1:08:59] that there's anybody that believes your\n[1:09:01] message? How h how h how do you have\n[1:09:03] anybody to listen to you?\" He said,\n[1:09:04] \"Because I can see why people listen to\n[1:09:06] Billy Graham because he's got all the\n[1:09:08] denominations in support of him.\" And\n[1:09:10] Oral Roberts, every Pentecostal hangs\n[1:09:12] with Oral Roberts, he said. But brother\n[1:09:14] Brandham said, \"You're against the whole\n[1:09:16] thing. You're against all these\n[1:09:17] organizations. You're against all these\n[1:09:19] power structures and and systems. So,\n[1:09:22] how in the world do you ever get\n[1:09:23] anybody? Brother Bam said, \"It's God.\n[1:09:25] It's God. I the Lord planted it. I'll\n[1:09:28] water it. I'll plant it. I put their\n[1:09:30] names on the book before the foundation\n[1:09:31] of the world by predestination. I'll\n[1:09:33] water it.\" He said, \"Just keep on\n[1:09:35] moving.\" Amen. I believe, brother,\n[1:09:37] brother, sister, that if God planted a\n[1:09:39] message, Amen. He already had somebody\n[1:09:41] in mind, amen, to receive that water, to\n[1:09:44] receive that light. God's got seed in\n[1:09:46] this day. Amen. It's not any powers of\n[1:09:49] men or our ability to organize or our\n[1:09:51] ability to, you know, to make programs\n[1:09:53] that's carrying this message forward.\n[1:09:55] Amen. But the husband men, amen, the the\n[1:09:58] great gardener of heaven, amen, is is\n[1:10:00] looking after the vine. Amen. And he\n[1:10:02] said, \"And now, if this vine ever\n[1:10:04] succeeds to grow, amen, if it's ever\n[1:10:06] able to put forth, Amen. If he if I take\n[1:10:09] care of my vine, if I water it, Amen. If\n[1:10:12] I put light on it, they'll write another\n[1:10:14] book of Acts behind it.\" Hallelujah.\n[1:10:16] Amen. I believe, amen, that uh we got to\n[1:10:19] just go on with the message cuz there's\n[1:10:21] a seed life that's in the message. I'm\n[1:10:24] not worried about whether we're going to\n[1:10:25] make a rapture. I'm not worried about\n[1:10:26] whether we'll see adopted sons. I'm not\n[1:10:28] worried about power. Amen. And authority\n[1:10:31] and manifestation. It's already in the\n[1:10:34] seed.\n[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; It's already in the message.\n[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You just need somebody to believe it.\n[1:10:39] Let's just say it simply like this. When\n[1:10:42] God plants a seed, God expects a\n[1:10:44] blossom.\n[1:10:45] He's not he's not worried about whether\n[1:10:47] it'll come forth. He's already expecting\n[1:10:49] a blossom when he plants the seed.\n[1:10:51] Isaiah 55 says as the rain comes down\n[1:10:54] and it gives seed and bread. Amen. Amen.\n[1:10:57] Seed and bread. Remember it said the\n[1:10:59] rain comes it gives seed to the sewer\n[1:11:01] and bread to the eater. Now the\n[1:11:04] beautiful thing about this there's a\n[1:11:05] there is a process involved in seed\n[1:11:08] becoming bread. Amen. But it all comes\n[1:11:10] by the same rain. Hallelujah. And there\n[1:11:14] is a process involved. Amen. From Amen.\n[1:11:16] From taking a holy ghostborn, Amen.\n[1:11:18] quicken seed of God and then bringing\n[1:11:20] them to the place of an adopted son.\n[1:11:22] There's a process, but it comes by the\n[1:11:24] same reign. Amen. And brother, brother,\n[1:11:27] sister, we got a message that's the\n[1:11:29] former and the latter reign together. We\n[1:11:30] got enough power in this message, amen,\n[1:11:32] to get somebody born again, amen, to\n[1:11:34] fill them with the Holy Ghost. And\n[1:11:36] enough power to take a Holy Ghostborn\n[1:11:37] son of God and make them more than a\n[1:11:39] Pentecostal baby. Amen. But bring them\n[1:11:41] up to a capstone life. Amen. Where they\n[1:11:43] can express the life that they came\n[1:11:45] from. Hallelujah. This ain't a time for\n[1:11:47] little twig Christians, little sprout\n[1:11:50] Christians. We're living in the blossom.\n[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's that's the way my\n[1:11:56] word is. It shall not return to me void,\n[1:11:59] but it shall accomplish that which I\n[1:12:01] please, and it shall prosper in the\n[1:12:04] thing whereto I sent it. Amen. I I\n[1:12:08] believe we receive a message of\n[1:12:09] adoption. Amen. And so if God would send\n[1:12:11] a message of adoption, God's expecting\n[1:12:13] manifested sons, manifested daughters.\n[1:12:17] Amen. A mature church with full maturity\n[1:12:20] and full power. Amen. You and that's\n[1:12:23] where but you know that's where the\n[1:12:24] intimidation comes in for a lot of our\n[1:12:27] young Christians. You know, uh uh some\n[1:12:30] of us were we're young in the Lord. We\n[1:12:33] we weren't there in 1963.\n[1:12:36] We weren't there in 1977 yet. We weren't\n[1:12:38] we, you know, some of us are young in\n[1:12:40] the Lord and we're early on in our\n[1:12:42] journey, you know, and so you know what\n[1:12:45] happens as a young person or a young\n[1:12:46] Christian, amen, they'll say, \"Well,\n[1:12:48] brother Nathan, I see the great call of\n[1:12:50] the hour. I I listen to brother\n[1:12:51] Brandham. I listen to the message and I\n[1:12:53] see I see this great image, amen, that\n[1:12:56] that is presented of a bouquet of\n[1:12:59] overcoming Christians, amen, with such\n[1:13:02] power and such maturity and such\n[1:13:04] manifestation.\" I hear brother Bram say\n[1:13:06] that this bride would be an invincible\n[1:13:08] army, that she would do the greater\n[1:13:10] works, that she'd be a sinless, virtuous\n[1:13:12] bride, and that, you know, and all these\n[1:13:14] great things that are spoken about the\n[1:13:16] bride. And I'm looking at myself,\n[1:13:17] Brother Nathan, and I feel like I I've\n[1:13:19] only got Amen. I just only have a little\n[1:13:22] Jesus. And I don't I, you know, I I I\n[1:13:25] know I know, Brother Donnie, you know, I\n[1:13:27] I I know he's a manifested son. And you\n[1:13:30] know, I I know I know this one. Brother\n[1:13:32] Daryl, you know, he's a manifested son.\n[1:13:34] And I'm looking at this one and that one\n[1:13:35] and I see that virtue coming from their\n[1:13:37] life. And you know, I see them walking\n[1:13:39] in the hour, you know, in the light of\n[1:13:41] the hour and and doing what they're\n[1:13:43] supposed to do. And I'm looking to\n[1:13:44] myself, brother Nathan, I just don't got\n[1:13:46] enough. I've only got a little Jesus.\n[1:13:49] Amen. But you know what? Little Jesus.\n[1:13:51] Amen. Little Jesus. Little Jesus could\n[1:13:54] take all that Jesus. Little Jesus could\n[1:13:56] go down to church on Sunday morning and\n[1:13:58] he could sit around with a bunch of\n[1:14:00] theologians and a bunch of doctors of\n[1:14:01] divinity and he could wrap him in\n[1:14:03] circles just by just by being little\n[1:14:05] Jesus just on the grounds of who he was,\n[1:14:09] just on the grounds of the life that was\n[1:14:10] in him. Don't ever underestimate little\n[1:14:12] Jesus. Cuz if all you got is a little\n[1:14:14] Jesus today, let me tell you something.\n[1:14:16] Little Jesus was still Jehovah Jesus.\n[1:14:19] And little Jesus, just a little Jesus in\n[1:14:21] you is still a healer. It's healer\n[1:14:23] Jesus. It's victory, Jesus. It's peace,\n[1:14:26] Jesus. It's It's overcoming Jesus. Amen.\n[1:14:30] But the thing about little Jesus, little\n[1:14:31] Jesus don't stay little.\n[1:14:34] Amen. Brother said, \"When a man gets\n[1:14:37] saved, a little bit of light, Amen. Just\n[1:14:40] a little bit of light.\" He said, \"Just\n[1:14:41] the size of a button on your shirt.\"\n[1:14:43] Just that much light comes into a man\n[1:14:46] when he's saved, when he's born again.\n[1:14:48] Just a little button of light like that.\n[1:14:50] Amen. Just a little seed of light. Amen.\n[1:14:52] And you look friends, you're not the\n[1:14:54] fullness of the Godhead bodily. Amen.\n[1:14:56] But when you got the Holy Ghost, Amen.\n[1:14:58] Brother Brand said, a little lick of\n[1:14:59] fire off of that pillar of fire. Amen.\n[1:15:02] Just a a little flame off the Godhead.\n[1:15:05] Amen. A little spark came out of that\n[1:15:07] logos and it inhabited your life, came\n[1:15:10] into your heart. Amen. Just a little\n[1:15:12] button of light. That's all that it is.\n[1:15:15] But it won't stay little. Brother Graham\n[1:15:17] said that little light, it'll begin to\n[1:15:18] grow. Amen. It begins to grow and it\n[1:15:20] begins to expand. And from that time,\n[1:15:22] it'll begin to push out. And all of a\n[1:15:24] sudden, that little light that's in you\n[1:15:26] starts pressing against the darkness\n[1:15:27] that's in your flesh. Amen. And that\n[1:15:30] little bit of light starts pushing this\n[1:15:31] way and pushing all of a sudden it\n[1:15:33] starts pushing on your bad attitude and\n[1:15:35] it starts pushing on your depression and\n[1:15:37] pushing on those worldly pleasures and\n[1:15:39] pushing down entertainment. Amen. That's\n[1:15:41] Amen. Why? Cuz it's a seed. And if a\n[1:15:44] seed Amen. If it's a true seed, all it\n[1:15:47] needs is time and atmosphere and it'll\n[1:15:49] grow.\n[1:15:50] Say, \"Brother Nathan, I only got a\n[1:15:52] little Jesus.\" I'll tell you what to do\n[1:15:53] with little Jesus. Don't sit home in\n[1:15:55] your pajamas. Get down to the church on\n[1:15:57] Sunday morning and get in an atmosphere\n[1:15:59] of believing Christians. Amen. Amen. And\n[1:16:01] let the Holy Spirit move as licks of\n[1:16:04] fire come together. Put it in an\n[1:16:05] atmosphere. Feed it the message of the\n[1:16:08] hour. And little Jesus won't stay\n[1:16:09] little. It'll start to grow.\n[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it'll keep growing,\n[1:16:15] growing, growing. It'll start crowding\n[1:16:17] out unbelief. Amen. That's what you got\n[1:16:19] to do. Amen. That's Look, that's what\n[1:16:22] our young people need is not a 12step\n[1:16:24] plan. Amen. But get them the Holy Ghost.\n[1:16:27] Amen. And then feed that experience so\n[1:16:29] that it begins to grow. Amen. You know,\n[1:16:32] I I had an old house. A house I used to\n[1:16:34] live in was in right in the middle of\n[1:16:36] town, just a little yard, and it had a\n[1:16:38] had an ugly old fence around it. Brother\n[1:16:40] Josiah, it was just a just a terrible\n[1:16:43] the fence was just falling apart, and I\n[1:16:45] didn't really want to get a new fence\n[1:16:46] cuz fences ain't cheap. And so, so I\n[1:16:50] thought I had this bright idea. What\n[1:16:51] I'll do is I'll I'll go down I'll get\n[1:16:53] some kind of a flowering vine and uh and\n[1:16:56] I'll take that flowering vine. I'll\n[1:16:58] plant it all along that fence and it'll\n[1:16:59] fill up the fence and it'll hide all the\n[1:17:00] broken places and and you know that oh\n[1:17:03] that'll be beautiful. You know that that\n[1:17:04] that'll be the ticket. So I went down I\n[1:17:07] went down to Menard's. Bless the Lord.\n[1:17:09] And uh and I found I found a a seed of a\n[1:17:13] little plant called morning glory. I\n[1:17:15] thought I like the sound of that.\n[1:17:18] Morning glory. Well, okay, that'll work.\n[1:17:20] And I saw it was a flowering vine. So, I\n[1:17:22] went home. If any of you are gardeners,\n[1:17:24] you're going to laugh right now. Uh but\n[1:17:26] but on the back of that packet, it said,\n[1:17:28] \"Take one seed and put it every 6 in.\"\n[1:17:30] And I thought, I bought tons of this\n[1:17:32] stuff. So, I took that seed, man, and I\n[1:17:35] scattered it just every inch all the way\n[1:17:37] down along my fence cuz I really wanted\n[1:17:39] to hide that fence. And you know,\n[1:17:41] nothing happened right that day. And the\n[1:17:44] next week, you couldn't tell the\n[1:17:45] difference. Amen. But but after a season\n[1:17:48] and after a time, Amen. All of a sudden,\n[1:17:50] here that morning glory starts coming\n[1:17:52] forth and it starts pushing out and it\n[1:17:54] started and you know just in no time\n[1:17:56] that stuff filled up that whole fence\n[1:17:58] and I thought, \"Praise the Lord.\" That's\n[1:18:00] where I wanted it. I wanted it on the\n[1:18:01] fence. The problem with morning glory,\n[1:18:04] it don't stay on the fence.\n[1:18:06] Amen. You know, that's the way some of\n[1:18:08] you thought. You thought you just get\n[1:18:09] enough Christianity to come down at\n[1:18:10] church on Sunday morning. Amen. But one\n[1:18:13] day the word was going forth and\n[1:18:14] something on the inside of you said,\n[1:18:15] \"No, you're called to be higher than\n[1:18:17] that.\" You're not some leoty and chicken\n[1:18:20] just a peck and scratch around. Amen.\n[1:18:22] You there's there's heights that you\n[1:18:24] were made to fly in. Amen. Well, if you\n[1:18:26] want to be that eagle, Amen. You got to\n[1:18:28] recognize what kind of life is in you.\n[1:18:30] Amen. Cuz that morning glory starts\n[1:18:32] pushing out. All of a sudden, it takes\n[1:18:33] over my yard. It goes up my trees. It\n[1:18:36] went up the side of my garage. Went up\n[1:18:37] the side of my house. It got into my\n[1:18:39] vegetable garden. And it started at the\n[1:18:41] bottom of my tomato plants and it went\n[1:18:43] all the way up to the top of every last\n[1:18:45] one of them and choked them out. Weeds\n[1:18:48] couldn't grow in my garden cuz they were\n[1:18:50] too full of morning glory. Amen. I'm\n[1:18:52] preaching to you this morning. That's\n[1:18:54] what God planted in you. Amen. When he\n[1:18:56] made you a partaker of the divine\n[1:18:58] nature, he put the law of a seed within\n[1:19:00] you that there's a life in there that's\n[1:19:02] going to grow. Amen. And it's going to\n[1:19:04] take over everything. Amen. Don't worry.\n[1:19:06] Amen. You got sin in your life. Let the\n[1:19:08] Holy Spirit choke it out. Amen. You got\n[1:19:10] things that need pushed out. Let God\n[1:19:12] push it out. You'll never separate it.\n[1:19:15] Amen. But God puts something in you.\n[1:19:17] Amen. With the ability in it. Amen. To\n[1:19:20] take over. Hallelujah. Just like, you\n[1:19:22] know, driving around these these back\n[1:19:24] roads around here. Down here, you got a\n[1:19:25] lot of that kudu, I think it's called,\n[1:19:27] if I'm saying that right. You see that\n[1:19:29] everywhere. And you know that kudzu, it\n[1:19:31] just it starts to whenever it just it\n[1:19:33] gets a chance to sprout. Next thing you\n[1:19:35] know, it takes over everything. Nothing\n[1:19:37] else can live there. It's just the only\n[1:19:39] life that can do. You know why it's so\n[1:19:41] aggressive and why you can't control it?\n[1:19:43] Because it came from another country.\n[1:19:45] Amen. Amen. That's why you'll never\n[1:19:48] Amen. You'll never hold back the Holy\n[1:19:49] Ghost. Amen. That That's why you'll\n[1:19:51] never hold back a predestinated son or\n[1:19:53] daughter of God. Amen. The devil can\n[1:19:55] pile unbelief on you. He can try to push\n[1:19:57] you down with condemnation. He can tempt\n[1:19:59] you. He can attack you. Amen. But\n[1:20:01] there's Amen. There's a life in you that\n[1:20:03] came from another world. Amen. It has no\n[1:20:06] natural predators.\n[1:20:10] Say, \"Brother Nathan, how Amen. I'm\n[1:20:11] living in this flesh body and and and is\n[1:20:14] subject to sin. Amen. And every time I\n[1:20:16] try to do good, evil is present.\" Amen.\n[1:20:18] Well, you know that's right. The Bible\n[1:20:20] says there's a law of death that's in\n[1:20:21] your flesh. Amen. And that law is trying\n[1:20:24] to have a hold on you. Amen. And and\n[1:20:26] make you subject to the urges and the\n[1:20:29] temptations of the flesh. You know, but\n[1:20:31] look, there's another law in you called\n[1:20:32] the law of life. Amen. And and that and\n[1:20:35] so then the law of life, Paul says, has\n[1:20:38] set us free from the law of sin and\n[1:20:40] death. Amen. You you ever think about,\n[1:20:43] you know, how uh I believe one time\n[1:20:45] brother talks about an eagle when he's\n[1:20:46] flying, how he defies the law of\n[1:20:48] gravity, right? Or when you raise your\n[1:20:50] hand, you know, you're defying the law\n[1:20:52] of gravity. Ever heard that? But you\n[1:20:55] know something, the law of gravity is\n[1:20:56] universal. And uh you know I don't mean\n[1:20:59] to give you a physics lesson today, but\n[1:21:01] you know that if you look at an eagle\n[1:21:02] flying in the sky, the whole time he's\n[1:21:05] flying, the law of gravity's acting on\n[1:21:07] him the whole time. Amen. An eagle\n[1:21:09] doesn't have a magic ability to put to\n[1:21:11] put uh you know to put uh the law of\n[1:21:13] gravity on pause. It's just that there\n[1:21:15] are other laws. There's laws of\n[1:21:17] aerodynamics.\n[1:21:19] Amen. And the laws of And so the reason\n[1:21:21] an eagle can fly, Amen, is because he\n[1:21:23] overcomes the law of gravity with the\n[1:21:25] laws of aerodynamics. Amen. That's how\n[1:21:28] we overcome, brother, sister. It ain't\n[1:21:29] about being perfect in your flesh. But\n[1:21:31] to recognize there's a law in the seed\n[1:21:34] that's in you. There's a law of life\n[1:21:35] there. And the law of life God put in\n[1:21:37] you. Amen. It's got the power in it to\n[1:21:39] overcome the flesh. Amen. There's it's a\n[1:21:42] greater law. Amen. You can soar. Amen.\n[1:21:45] Higher than you think you can. You just\n[1:21:48] got to trust in the right law.\n[1:21:50] Hallelujah.\n[1:21:52] Amen. It's the morning glory. It's the\n[1:21:55] rising of the sun. It's a shalom\n[1:21:57] message. I I believe you know I I I'm\n[1:22:00] convinced you could drop a nuclear bomb\n[1:22:02] on that old house. You could erase every\n[1:22:04] memory of Nathan Ericson. Ever se every\n[1:22:06] cell of me. Amen. That that ever\n[1:22:08] inhabited there. But next spring that\n[1:22:11] morning glory is coming back. Just as\n[1:22:13] sure. Don't you ever p Don't you ever\n[1:22:15] plant that in your yard, friends. And\n[1:22:17] God has put something in you. Amen. It's\n[1:22:19] a resurrection life. It's a it's a it's\n[1:22:22] a token life. There's a there's a law in\n[1:22:24] it. There's a power in it. Amen. God's\n[1:22:26] not God's not worried about whether\n[1:22:28] it'll be there on resurrection morning.\n[1:22:30] Amen. He's not worried about whether\n[1:22:31] you're going to take a rapture. He\n[1:22:32] already planted rapture in you. Can't\n[1:22:35] you see it, friends? Amen. It's the law\n[1:22:37] of life that's in a Christian.\n[1:22:39] Hallelujah. And then if you're a seed,\n[1:22:41] there's only one limitation on how far a\n[1:22:44] seed can grow, and that's the season\n[1:22:46] that it's living in. But friends, we're\n[1:22:49] not in a justification season. We're not\n[1:22:52] in a sanctification season. We're not in\n[1:22:54] a Pentecostal Zusa street. We're not\n[1:22:56] Pentecostal babies, but we've received a\n[1:22:58] message. And brother Brandham said, now\n[1:23:00] we're living in the blossom. Amen. And\n[1:23:02] the message has come to a place. Amen.\n[1:23:05] Where it's time for manifested sons to\n[1:23:07] come forth. What are you saying, brother\n[1:23:09] Nathan? I'm saying whatever your idea is\n[1:23:12] of the ceiling of your potential. You\n[1:23:14] got something in your mind. It's a it's\n[1:23:16] a ceiling. And you say, \"Well, Brother\n[1:23:18] Nathan, if I'm going to be a Christian,\n[1:23:19] I'll only ever be this much of a\n[1:23:21] Christian. And this is just as high as I\n[1:23:23] think I can go. What I want you to do\n[1:23:25] this morning, take that, throw it away.\n[1:23:27] Amen. Throw it away. Cuz I'm talking\n[1:23:29] about we're living in a season and\n[1:23:31] there's a seed that's in you that's got\n[1:23:33] potential in it like you can't even\n[1:23:35] imagine. Amen. If you only knew what\n[1:23:37] kind of a Christian you could be. If you\n[1:23:39] only knew what kind of a what kind of a\n[1:23:41] father, what kind of a mother, what kind\n[1:23:43] of a preacher, what kind of an elder.\n[1:23:45] Amen. What kind of a young person you\n[1:23:47] could be. Get rid of your artificial\n[1:23:49] constraints. Get rid of your idea and\n[1:23:52] realize, Amen. This is the age of the\n[1:23:54] blossom. This is the age for a bride\n[1:23:57] manifestation.\n[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to get rid of it. Amen.\n[1:24:00] Because look, Amen. No matter where a\n[1:24:02] Christian's at, Amen. There's a law in\n[1:24:04] them. There's a voice in them, a seed.\n[1:24:07] Amen. That wants to push up higher.\n[1:24:09] Amen. Don't you you can't stop halfway\n[1:24:11] on the journey. You're called to your\n[1:24:14] adoption. Predestinated to adoption.\n[1:24:17] Hallelujah. That means if you're\n[1:24:19] predestinated to adoption, there is a\n[1:24:22] positional placing. There is an\n[1:24:24] expression. There is a beauty, a\n[1:24:26] blossom, a fragrance that's going to\n[1:24:28] come out of your life. And no other\n[1:24:30] flower, no other person can reproduce\n[1:24:32] it. Amen. There's nobody else. Amen. It\n[1:24:35] don't mean everybody's got to be another\n[1:24:36] William Brandham. It don't mean\n[1:24:38] everybody else has got to be everybody's\n[1:24:39] got to be a preacher. Paul said not all\n[1:24:41] speak with tongues. Not all perform\n[1:24:43] miracles. That's not what we're talking\n[1:24:44] about. It's not some charismatic idea\n[1:24:47] of, you know, throw away your limits and\n[1:24:48] everybody's going to be rich and\n[1:24:50] successful and famous and have a great\n[1:24:52] ministry. No, sir. Amen. It's much\n[1:24:55] greater than that. Amen. It's saying\n[1:24:57] throw what? It's saying there's a seed\n[1:24:58] on the inside of you. Amen. And that\n[1:25:00] seed has a destiny. That seed has a\n[1:25:03] future. There is something God wants to\n[1:25:05] bring out of your life that nobody else\n[1:25:07] can reproduce. You got a place in his\n[1:25:09] bouquet. He made you a different a\n[1:25:11] different color, a different shape, a\n[1:25:13] different stature with different\n[1:25:14] fragrance with a different appearance.\n[1:25:17] Amen. Because Amen. He wants to bring\n[1:25:19] his glory out of you. Hallelujah. Amen.\n[1:25:22] And I that's what I want in my life.\n[1:25:24] Amen. I received a message which took\n[1:25:26] the limits off of me. I want to be\n[1:25:28] everything I can be. I want to preach\n[1:25:31] Amen. Uh to the best that I can preach.\n[1:25:33] I want to live to the greatest I can\n[1:25:35] live cuz that's the age that we're\n[1:25:37] living in.\n[1:25:39] Hallelujah. Amen. You're an overcoming\n[1:25:42] Christian. You're the bride of Jesus\n[1:25:43] Christ. You're not under you're not\n[1:25:45] under condemnation. You're not under the\n[1:25:47] leodys and rebuke. You're not naked,\n[1:25:50] blind, and miserable. No, you're a\n[1:25:52] you're a flower in full bloom.\n[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand would talk about that pond\n[1:25:57] lily. I always thought it was amazing\n[1:25:58] you use the pond lily specifically. How\n[1:26:01] that it came out of the muck and how\n[1:26:03] it's come up through, you know, came out\n[1:26:04] of a dark place. You remember where you\n[1:26:06] were when this message found you. Amen.\n[1:26:08] You were down in a dark place somewhere\n[1:26:10] crawling around in filthy things. Amen.\n[1:26:12] But the grace of God called you up and\n[1:26:15] it brought you up above the mud. It\n[1:26:16] brought you out, Amen, into the sunshine\n[1:26:19] and it's brought your life into blossom.\n[1:26:20] And we look around at Christians, amen,\n[1:26:22] showing the virtues of Christ and\n[1:26:24] showing his character and Amen. and\n[1:26:26] manifesting his life in this day. And\n[1:26:28] you look at that and you say, \"What a\n[1:26:29] beautiful lily.\" Amen. But you can't\n[1:26:31] point at that. Amen. Sometimes people,\n[1:26:33] you know, they some the Lord brings them\n[1:26:35] so far and they're still under\n[1:26:37] condemnation of where they came from.\n[1:26:39] But brother Bam said, \"Look, you can't\n[1:26:40] you can't say nothing about that lily.\"\n[1:26:43] Amen. Once he comes up to a blossom, you\n[1:26:45] say, \"Well, he come out of the mud.\n[1:26:47] Well, you know that brother, you I know\n[1:26:49] what kind of church he came out of and\n[1:26:50] you know that sister, I remember her\n[1:26:52] family situation and that that young\n[1:26:54] man, you know, he was in he was messed\n[1:26:56] up in such terrible things, you know,\n[1:26:57] and brother Bam said, \"You can't you\n[1:26:59] can't say anything about him now.\" Amen.\n[1:27:02] cuz he's not in the mud now. Now he's on\n[1:27:04] top. Amen. You can't point back at what\n[1:27:07] he was. What is he now? He's on top.\n[1:27:10] Glory to God.\n[1:27:12] Amen. But you know, it hits a little\n[1:27:15] different for a young Christian or a\n[1:27:18] young person, Amen, who's not on top of\n[1:27:21] everything and they're they're in a\n[1:27:23] season in their life, amen, where they\n[1:27:24] don't feel like they're up in full\n[1:27:26] bloom. They feel like they're they're\n[1:27:27] just down there in the mud. Amen. And\n[1:27:29] and you look at that lily, the journey\n[1:27:31] that it had to come through. Amen. And\n[1:27:33] you watch this now, how that it uh it\n[1:27:35] started down in a filthy place. And when\n[1:27:38] you pass over the seed down there in the\n[1:27:39] earth, whatever kind of neighborhood you\n[1:27:41] grew up in, a lot of you, Amen. when you\n[1:27:43] when when when when somebody passed over\n[1:27:46] you, they couldn't tell the difference\n[1:27:47] between the seed and the rock next to it\n[1:27:49] and the clump of dirt next to that. It\n[1:27:51] just looked like it was like all the\n[1:27:52] rest of the earth. No, not no difference\n[1:27:54] to it.\n[1:27:55] not not expressing anything different\n[1:27:57] than just a regular worldly person. But\n[1:28:00] somehow someway there was a potential in\n[1:28:02] that seed that all the rest of the earth\n[1:28:04] didn't have. And so one day, amen, a\n[1:28:07] little ray of light came down and it\n[1:28:09] somehow it got through all of that filth\n[1:28:11] and dirt and all the molecules of earth.\n[1:28:13] Amen. It came down and it struck the\n[1:28:15] seed just right. Amen. When that little\n[1:28:17] light struck you, Amen. Now, what it\n[1:28:19] might not have, you might not have\n[1:28:20] jumped and screamed to shout it. Or\n[1:28:22] maybe you did, but it's not always a\n[1:28:23] great big explosion. Sometimes just a\n[1:28:25] little.\n[1:28:27] But from that time, something awakens in\n[1:28:30] that seed. Now, now, but when it comes\n[1:28:32] to its awakening, it's in a filthy\n[1:28:34] place. It's surrounded by filthy things.\n[1:28:37] Amen. But look, Amen. There's a law in\n[1:28:39] that seed. It don't matter how deep it's\n[1:28:42] buried in filth. Amen. How how earthly\n[1:28:44] it is, something in it says, \"I want to\n[1:28:47] rise.\" So it starts to push back on on\n[1:28:50] the filth and it pushes back on the muck\n[1:28:52] and it begins to claw and fight and oh\n[1:28:55] the harder it fights the dirtier it\n[1:28:57] gets. Amen. But something's driving it\n[1:28:59] until it pushes and and strives and\n[1:29:02] works and toils and spins and all of a\n[1:29:04] sudden there's a breakthrough.\n[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for the\n[1:29:09] breakthrough. But you know what happens\n[1:29:10] to a lot of Christians? They come to\n[1:29:12] that breakthrough and guess where that\n[1:29:14] lily is? It's still at the bottom of a\n[1:29:15] pond. Yeah. And so all of a sudden\n[1:29:18] people think they get the Holy Ghost and\n[1:29:19] all their problems are over. But then\n[1:29:21] they find out they get out in the water\n[1:29:22] and they're under pressure. Amen. And\n[1:29:24] then you know the Leotan tides come\n[1:29:27] through and Amen. all these influences\n[1:29:29] around you and you're trying to live a\n[1:29:30] Christian life and trying to grow. Amen.\n[1:29:32] But it's pushing you this way. And Amen.\n[1:29:34] is pushing you that way. And Amen.\n[1:29:36] Something just it's just hard to keep\n[1:29:38] your bearing. It's hard to Amen. But\n[1:29:39] something in that lily says no, I don't\n[1:29:41] belong here either. There's got to be\n[1:29:43] something higher than this. There's got\n[1:29:45] to be something greater than this. And\n[1:29:47] and so it begins to swim. It begins to\n[1:29:49] go against the flow and it'll look\n[1:29:51] around. It might look at the other the\n[1:29:53] other plants down there under the water.\n[1:29:54] And then what I don't know what the\n[1:29:56] plant's called. We always call it\n[1:29:58] seaweed, but it's a freshwater one\n[1:30:00] actually. You know when you go these\n[1:30:01] little streams around here and there's\n[1:30:03] that one there's that one little weed\n[1:30:05] and uh when the water's running real\n[1:30:07] fast, it's just\n[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and then a flood or something comes and\n[1:30:12] the tides turn and it's run the other\n[1:30:14] way and it just\n[1:30:18] cuz it's made for shallow water. There's\n[1:30:20] nothing in that kind of a plant to\n[1:30:22] resist. Nothing in it to try to get any\n[1:30:24] higher than that. It just goes with the\n[1:30:26] flow. Amen. And you know, sometimes\n[1:30:29] Christians, they think they look at\n[1:30:30] people in the world and they say, \"Why\n[1:30:32] why can't I be like everybody else? Why\n[1:30:34] can't I just do what's normal? Why can't\n[1:30:36] I just go with the flow? You know, why\n[1:30:37] can't I just, you know, why can't I just\n[1:30:39] give way to the pressure and just But\n[1:30:41] no, cuz there's a different life on the\n[1:30:43] inside of you.\" Amen. that's wrestling\n[1:30:45] with that and say, \"No.\" Amen. I've got\n[1:30:47] a backbone. I've got a structure.\n[1:30:49] There's a strength to the life that's in\n[1:30:51] me. I'm not going to bow over and be\n[1:30:53] tossed by every tide. Amen. I'm going\n[1:30:55] higher. I'm rising up.\n[1:31:02] Amen. And oh my Amen. And when it gets\n[1:31:06] to the top of that water and then it\n[1:31:08] comes out into the presence of the sun\n[1:31:10] and comes out in that warmth and gets\n[1:31:13] above all of those pressures and things\n[1:31:15] and then brother Brand said it just\n[1:31:16] opens up its bud and Amen. And and uh\n[1:31:19] and and comes into full blossom and a\n[1:31:22] fragrance comes out of it and everybody\n[1:31:24] around can enjoy the atmosphere of that\n[1:31:27] lily. Why? Because it's an overcomer.\n[1:31:29] Amen. Because it's pushed up through\n[1:31:31] some things. Cuz it's living on top.\n[1:31:35] But again, for a young person, for a\n[1:31:37] young Christian who's not on top,\n[1:31:40] sometimes, you know, you look at where\n[1:31:42] somebody else is, you say, \"I'll never\n[1:31:44] get there. I'll never get there. Look at\n[1:31:46] that life is in full blossom. I'm down\n[1:31:48] here. I'm messing with this filthy\n[1:31:50] thing, and I'm and brother Nathan, I\n[1:31:51] feel like that I don't feel like a that\n[1:31:53] overcoming lily today. I feel like that\n[1:31:56] I feel like I'm like you're I'm under\n[1:31:57] the water, and I'm I'm feeling all this\n[1:31:59] pressure, and I I'm drowning. I think\n[1:32:01] I'm drowning, Brother Nathan.\n[1:32:04] Here's what you got to realize. Amen.\n[1:32:06] You can look at that beautiful\n[1:32:07] overcoming lily. That beautiful blossom\n[1:32:10] of a Christian life. Amen. And and and\n[1:32:13] what a beautiful life it is. Amen. But\n[1:32:15] look, when that when it was buried down\n[1:32:17] there in the dirt so deep you couldn't\n[1:32:19] even tell the difference, it was still a\n[1:32:21] lily. And when it was pushing up through\n[1:32:23] that filth and crawling out of the muck,\n[1:32:26] it was a lily then. And it was going\n[1:32:28] when it was swimming against the tide\n[1:32:29] and getting pushed here and there. Amen.\n[1:32:31] and and and a and and and uh and subject\n[1:32:33] to every influence. It was still a lily.\n[1:32:36] Amen. It was a lily the whole time\n[1:32:38] because the law, Amen, is not in the\n[1:32:40] blossom. The law is in the seed. Amen.\n[1:32:42] And when God, Amen, when you were born\n[1:32:44] again, God sealed his virtues in you in\n[1:32:47] potential form. Amen. With the with when\n[1:32:50] made you a partaker of the divine\n[1:32:52] nature. Brother Ram said when you got\n[1:32:54] the Holy Ghost, God gave you everything\n[1:32:56] you have need of for life's journey.\n[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't add virtue to your\n[1:33:01] faith. Let the Holy Spirit do it. You\n[1:33:03] can't add knowledge to your virtue. Let\n[1:33:05] the Holy Spirit do it. Let the inside\n[1:33:07] teacher. Amen. Just push up and let him\n[1:33:10] have let patience have her perfect work.\n[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just trust the Lord. Trust the\n[1:33:16] seed that he planted in you. It was a\n[1:33:18] lily the whole time, friends. Amen.\n[1:33:21] Amen. Still a lily. And that's what you\n[1:33:23] are. On your worst day, you're a child\n[1:33:25] of God. Amen. In your worst struggle,\n[1:33:28] you're still a child of God. You can't\n[1:33:30] change the nature of the seed.\n[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You can only yield to the law that's in\n[1:33:35] it.\n[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam preached the law of life in\n[1:33:39] the restoration of the bride tree.\n[1:33:40] Remember my I don't have time to preach\n[1:33:42] everything that's on my heart today. I'm\n[1:33:44] enjoying myself though. Amen. He he he\n[1:33:47] talked about that law. It's in a fish.\n[1:33:49] And just to just to put it in a quick\n[1:33:51] paraphrase, you know, he's talking about\n[1:33:52] a fish might try really hard to be a\n[1:33:54] fish. It goes up and gets a big burst\n[1:33:56] gulp of air and says I'm going to dive\n[1:33:58] down real deep. Brother Bram said it'll\n[1:33:59] burst because it's not made to try to be\n[1:34:02] a fish. It's already made to live in\n[1:34:04] those conditions. If he said if a bird\n[1:34:06] gets running said, well, if I run real\n[1:34:08] hard and flap my wings real hard, I'm\n[1:34:09] just going to try to fly. Brother said\n[1:34:11] he won't get off the ground. Amen.\n[1:34:13] Because look, amen. There's already\n[1:34:15] something put into that nature. There's\n[1:34:17] a law in the life of a bird. He's\n[1:34:18] already made to fly. He's just got to\n[1:34:20] yield to the currents of air. Amen. He's\n[1:34:23] got to use what's already in him by a\n[1:34:24] law of life. And brother Bam said, \"We\n[1:34:26] have a law of life.\" Amen. Cuz a lot of\n[1:34:28] people, Amen, they say, \"I'm going to\n[1:34:30] try real hard to be a Christian. I'm\n[1:34:32] going to work real hard. Oh Lord, when I\n[1:34:34] get up from this altar, you know, I'm\n[1:34:35] going to do better. I'm going to go turn\n[1:34:37] over a new leaf. This time it'll be\n[1:34:38] different.\" But brother Brand said,\n[1:34:41] \"Amen. It's uh\" He said uh he said,\n[1:34:43] \"It's not how we fight and pull and\n[1:34:45] hurry and say, \"If I don't get this and\n[1:34:47] I don't get that.\" He said, \"That's not\n[1:34:49] it. It's to know that the law of life is\n[1:34:52] in you. And then you just let go and let\n[1:34:55] God. And he takes you to your healing.\n[1:34:58] He takes you to the baptism of the\n[1:34:59] spirit. Any claim he's given is yours by\n[1:35:02] letting go and letting God. Amen. It's\n[1:35:04] come to find out I'm a son of God. I'm a\n[1:35:07] daughter of God. Amen. And so there's a\n[1:35:09] life already in me. I've just got to\n[1:35:11] yield to it.\n[1:35:13] I'm not trying to be the bride. I'm not\n[1:35:16] trying to be a Christian. Stop trying to\n[1:35:19] be a son of God. You already are. Just\n[1:35:22] yield to what you are. When the Holy\n[1:35:25] Ghost says, \"Hey, that ain't what we're\n[1:35:26] about.\" Uh, we don't look at that. We\n[1:35:29] don't say that. We don't we don't go\n[1:35:31] here. Amen. That's not who we are. Then\n[1:35:33] you just yield to the law of life. Amen.\n[1:35:35] See, there's something already on the\n[1:35:37] inside testifying of who you are. Oh,\n[1:35:40] what a beautiful thing. I think about\n[1:35:41] that Reverend Mr. Lily, Brother Bram,\n[1:35:42] would talk about. remember how he'd go\n[1:35:44] on and on and it's amazing picture that\n[1:35:47] he paints about how this lily how that\n[1:35:49] it's got to how it's got to push out.\n[1:35:52] Oh, he said it's got to toil and work\n[1:35:53] and it's got to oh, just spin and and\n[1:35:56] just crawl its way up out of the dirt to\n[1:35:58] get up and be the lily that it's\n[1:35:59] supposed to be.\n[1:36:02] Amen. And then I went, you know, and and\n[1:36:04] and then I went and heard what Jesus\n[1:36:06] said. He said, \"Consider the lily. They\n[1:36:09] toil not, neither do they spin.\" And I\n[1:36:12] thought, well, there's a paradox. But\n[1:36:14] you know what? I believe it is, friends.\n[1:36:16] Amen. Sure, Lily. You know, sure, Lily's\n[1:36:18] got to rise above some things. There's\n[1:36:20] things it's got to press through to be\n[1:36:22] what it is and to express the the\n[1:36:24] potentials that are in it. But it\n[1:36:27] doesn't have to work to be a lily.\n[1:36:30] And brother, sister, you never worked\n[1:36:32] one day in your life to be a child of\n[1:36:34] God. Amen. It was grace that elected\n[1:36:36] you. Grace that predestinated you. Amen.\n[1:36:39] Grace that's got a hold of you. It was\n[1:36:41] his grace that made you a child of God.\n[1:36:43] Sooner you find out who you are, sooner\n[1:36:45] you can rest and let the law of life\n[1:36:47] that's in you go to work. Yield, amen,\n[1:36:50] to the life that's in you. Oh. Oh\n[1:36:52] friends, he said that little that little\n[1:36:54] seed burst open into life. Brother Bram\n[1:36:57] said it can't do that till it goes\n[1:36:58] through all that process. It's in the\n[1:37:00] message birth pains. A birth pains of\n[1:37:03] going through a process. Amen. But when\n[1:37:06] it gets fully above the dirty water and\n[1:37:08] muck and so forth, oh, he said it's so\n[1:37:10] happy and it gives its life out freely.\n[1:37:12] And it's a beautiful life. A beautiful\n[1:37:15] life when it gets into the presence of\n[1:37:16] that which is drawing it. Amen. Friends,\n[1:37:19] a lot of people come to the church,\n[1:37:21] Amen. And they got just enough religion\n[1:37:23] to make them miserable. But let me tell\n[1:37:25] you, Amen. If if uh if all you got is a\n[1:37:28] bunch of dos and don'ts and rules and\n[1:37:29] regulations and church membership and\n[1:37:32] current events and whatever the latest\n[1:37:34] drama is and Amen. and you're miserable\n[1:37:36] under that. Amen. Don't you know there's\n[1:37:38] something higher up? It's the presence\n[1:37:41] of the Lord Jesus revealed in this\n[1:37:43] message. It's drawing us up. Amen. And\n[1:37:46] if you could ever get up into that, it's\n[1:37:48] a beautiful life. What's the message to\n[1:37:50] you, brother Nathan? It ain't a cult.\n[1:37:52] Amen. It ain't it ain't a it ain't\n[1:37:55] legalism. Amen. It ain't it ain't some\n[1:37:57] ism. Amen. It's the Lord Jesus Christ\n[1:38:00] revealed to me personally. And it's a\n[1:38:02] beautiful life in the presence of the\n[1:38:04] Lord. It's a beautiful life to see\n[1:38:06] Christ. Amen. Revealed in his word. It's\n[1:38:09] a beautiful life. How many want to reach\n[1:38:12] that beautiful life? Oh, no doubt. We're\n[1:38:14] all pressing through some things. We all\n[1:38:16] got a things we need to get on top of.\n[1:38:18] Amen. But there's a law of life within\n[1:38:20] us. Amen. that with the power in it to\n[1:38:22] get there.\n[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that sunlight\n[1:38:27] pulling us up.\n[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Pulling us up. Oh, I'm reaching for that\n[1:38:32] beautiful life. My my when can where can\n[1:38:36] we sit this down?\n[1:38:38] Amen. You see\n[1:38:40] the thing about a a flower. Amen. What a\n[1:38:43] flower is for. A flower has a purpose.\n[1:38:46] There's a there's a sermon in a flower.\n[1:38:48] There's a meaning. There's a beauty.\n[1:38:50] There's a truth in it. A a and uh and it\n[1:38:54] it's in the scripture. It has its place\n[1:38:55] in the word of God.\n[1:38:58] But the thing about a flower, most of\n[1:38:59] what the scripture has to say about a\n[1:39:00] flower, it's very fragile. It's very\n[1:39:03] fragile. And it's a that speaks of your\n[1:39:06] human life. Friends, I want you to think\n[1:39:08] about, you know, here on earth, look, uh\n[1:39:11] uh you know, what do we get? 70, 80\n[1:39:12] years of life. And there's something in\n[1:39:15] me, I believe it's a seed. There's a\n[1:39:18] voice in me that says,\"I not here to\n[1:39:21] live 70, 80 years and have a job and\n[1:39:24] build a house and have get married and\n[1:39:26] have some kids, you know, and accumulate\n[1:39:28] some wealth and then die and it all just\n[1:39:30] fades back into the void and none of it\n[1:39:32] meant anything.\"\n[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; The seed speaks of purpose. Every time\n[1:39:37] Brother Brand would preach on a seed,\n[1:39:39] he's preaching about purpose. A seed has\n[1:39:41] purpose. That's what drives it. That's\n[1:39:43] what brings it higher. God didn't give\n[1:39:45] me the Holy Ghost just to sit on my\n[1:39:47] hands and join a church. There's\n[1:39:49] something for me to do with the power of\n[1:39:51] the Holy Ghost. There's something for me\n[1:39:52] to express. I'm here for a reason,\n[1:39:54] friends. Amen. Oh, don't you know what a\n[1:39:57] privilege it is to be in God's bouquet\n[1:39:58] today? There's only going to be so many\n[1:40:01] message believers. There's only going to\n[1:40:02] be so many message churches. There's\n[1:40:04] only going to be so many Sundays to\n[1:40:06] worship the Lord in the light of this\n[1:40:08] hour. Only so many sermons to preach and\n[1:40:10] only so many preachers to preach them.\n[1:40:13] There's only going to be so much time.\n[1:40:15] Amen. And if we spend all that time and\n[1:40:18] it didn't mean anything, then what was\n[1:40:20] the point of it all? But what the flower\n[1:40:22] tells us is that yes, I'm fragile. Yes.\n[1:40:26] Amen. A man is a flower and he quickly\n[1:40:28] fadeth. Amen. But while I'm here, I've\n[1:40:31] got something to express. There was a\n[1:40:33] little flower one day. Amen. It only\n[1:40:36] bloom maybe only bloomed for a week and\n[1:40:37] then it wilted away. But that particular\n[1:40:40] flower was in the right time and in the\n[1:40:42] right place that gave it purpose. Amen.\n[1:40:45] Because it was growing next to where Job\n[1:40:47] was walking one day and Job looked down\n[1:40:49] at that flower and all of a sudden a\n[1:40:51] revelation struck him and under the gaze\n[1:40:54] of the prophet that flower's life took\n[1:40:56] on a greater meaning cuz he said the\n[1:40:59] flower goes away but the next spring it\n[1:41:01] comes back. Amen. Oh my. So therefore I\n[1:41:04] can see the resurrection and the life of\n[1:41:07] Jesus Christ. That's why I'm here,\n[1:41:09] friends. I'm not here for long. I'm not\n[1:41:11] here. Amen. I'm I'm here temporarily,\n[1:41:15] but I'm here to bear witness to not only\n[1:41:17] the resurrection, but the life of Jesus\n[1:41:20] Christ. Amen. Because the same power\n[1:41:22] that raised him from the dead has\n[1:41:24] quickened this mortal body. Don't you\n[1:41:26] see why you're here, friends? Amen. Your\n[1:41:28] life doesn't have any meaning. It don't\n[1:41:30] have any purpose. Amen. just to just to\n[1:41:32] live a human life and fade away, but\n[1:41:34] under the gaze of a message, under the\n[1:41:36] under a prophetic gaze. Amen. Our time\n[1:41:39] here matters. And I believe there's\n[1:41:41] something that I can express. There's a\n[1:41:44] fragrance we can bring forth in time\n[1:41:46] which will echo in eternity.\n[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to do something for the\n[1:41:51] Lord today? There's no such thing as a\n[1:41:53] seed without a purpose.\n[1:41:56] There's no such thing as a child of God\n[1:41:58] without a destiny. There's no such a\n[1:42:00] thing. There is a there is a there is a\n[1:42:03] mountain that belongs to you. There is a\n[1:42:05] positional placing. There is a work for\n[1:42:07] you to do. There is something you're\n[1:42:09] here on earth to express.\n[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the only way we'll do it is by\n[1:42:15] the law of life that's in us. Amen. I I\n[1:42:18] want my life to serve a purpose. I want\n[1:42:21] to show that beauty. Amen. Not just not\n[1:42:24] beautiful Christ, not beautiful works,\n[1:42:26] beautiful church membership, beautiful\n[1:42:29] Christianity, beautiful life.\n[1:42:32] Amen. You see, it's a it's there's a\n[1:42:34] natural beauty to that when it's not all\n[1:42:37] just put on and just all dressed up and\n[1:42:39] when we're just not just trying to, you\n[1:42:40] know, just trying to really really be a\n[1:42:42] somebody of a Christian, but when\n[1:42:44] there's a life that's in you that's\n[1:42:46] pushing out that's that a fragrance\n[1:42:48] that's coming forth freely. That's what\n[1:42:51] I want. That's why brother Bram said\n[1:42:52] that that little lily is greater than\n[1:42:54] Solomon in all of his kingly garments\n[1:42:56] because it didn't matter how much how\n[1:42:58] well you dress Solomon up. It's\n[1:42:59] artificial. But brother Bram said that\n[1:43:02] Amen. That lilyy's got a natural beauty.\n[1:43:05] That's why I like a natural\n[1:43:06] Christianity. I don't like taking the\n[1:43:08] message and trying to put dove feathers\n[1:43:10] in a blackbird and, you know, trying to\n[1:43:11] shove it down somebody's throat and just\n[1:43:13] try to force it on our young people and\n[1:43:15] try to manufacture and make sure\n[1:43:16] everything everything looks so polished\n[1:43:18] on the outside. I believe Amen. And when\n[1:43:20] God sent a message, he knew that it was\n[1:43:22] a message to human beings. And he so he\n[1:43:25] understands human weakness. He\n[1:43:26] understands human problems. He\n[1:43:28] understands our human struggles. Amen.\n[1:43:31] But he wasn't worried about that. He\n[1:43:32] just went ahead and planted this\n[1:43:34] message. And when he planted it, he put\n[1:43:36] a law in it. Amen. That anybody who will\n[1:43:38] any seed of God who will lay in the\n[1:43:40] light of this word, Amen. and and uh and\n[1:43:44] and dwell in the atmosphere of his\n[1:43:46] presence,\n[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. will put forth an overcoming life.\n[1:43:49] Amen.\n[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in churches without\n[1:43:52] purpose. I believe there's a reason. I\n[1:43:55] believe there's a reason for Word of\n[1:43:56] Life Church is here in Amen. in Johnson\n[1:43:59] City, Tennessee. There's a reason we\n[1:44:01] come to church today. There's a reason\n[1:44:02] you're sitting where you're sitting.\n[1:44:04] Brother Brand said that one time. He\n[1:44:05] said he wanted you he wanted me in the\n[1:44:06] pulpit, Brother Bam said, and he wanted\n[1:44:08] you sitting exactly where you're\n[1:44:09] sitting.\n[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of purpose. Amen. And I\n[1:44:13] all I want friends is in my little\n[1:44:16] fragile liy human life I just want to\n[1:44:20] serve his purpose\n[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; because brother Bram says any seed that\n[1:44:23] serves God's purpose you can't keep it\n[1:44:25] in the ground when resurrection comes.\n[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You never keep it in the ground.\n[1:44:33] You know\n[1:44:35] uh just bring it bring it down in a few\n[1:44:37] moments here. When you walk into a\n[1:44:39] house, you see what this bride is. See,\n[1:44:42] it ain't just the prophet that was a\n[1:44:44] flower. It ain't just the flowering life\n[1:44:46] of the preacher, the pastor. But you're\n[1:44:49] a flower in God's bouquet. Some of you\n[1:44:51] say, \"Well, y well, brother Nathan, but\n[1:44:53] I don't feel like I've fully I I just\n[1:44:56] haven't fully reached the potential of\n[1:44:58] everything that I could be. I'm just\n[1:45:00] maybe a bud. I'm not fully opened up.\"\n[1:45:02] Brother Brandham said there's a purpose\n[1:45:03] for a bud in his bouquet, too. There's a\n[1:45:04] good quote for that. Amen. But but you\n[1:45:07] see we've been gathered here together\n[1:45:10] not to be members of word of life. Amen.\n[1:45:13] But to be part of his bouquet. Amen. Cuz\n[1:45:16] when he puts this see gathered with you\n[1:45:18] sometimes you say how come I didn't get\n[1:45:19] to grow up in church like these young\n[1:45:20] people. How come I had to go through all\n[1:45:22] that mess in the world and be mistreated\n[1:45:23] and all that kind of stuff. Well look\n[1:45:25] friends a real seed brother said you can\n[1:45:27] put it under a slab of concrete. It'll\n[1:45:29] find a way out. Some of you came through\n[1:45:31] every kind of all kind of you grew\n[1:45:32] through all kind of barbed wire and mess\n[1:45:34] and fil and came out of a such a but you\n[1:45:37] came forward and God had a purpose in\n[1:45:39] bringing you through that cuz it brought\n[1:45:41] a different expression out of your life\n[1:45:42] and he's got another one that he raised\n[1:45:44] in church and maybe they never spent\n[1:45:45] much time in the world and he'll put you\n[1:45:47] next to that one and then he'll get\n[1:45:49] another one over here. What's he doing?\n[1:45:50] He's making a bouquet. Amen. Because it\n[1:45:52] takes more than one life. It takes more\n[1:45:54] than one uh more than one person. Amen.\n[1:45:56] To manifest the glory of God. Amen. But\n[1:45:59] that's why we're here, friends, is just\n[1:46:00] to play our part. Say, \"God, position me\n[1:46:03] in the bouquet.\" Amen. Let me do what\n[1:46:04] I'm supposed to do in the church. Let me\n[1:46:06] express what I'm supposed to express.\n[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who you are is not where you came\n[1:46:11] from. Amen. But it's the it's the life\n[1:46:14] that you rose out of. Amen. It's a Amen.\n[1:46:17] It's the who you are. Amen. Is what is\n[1:46:20] where God envisions you in his bouquet.\n[1:46:22] And then he gets it all together. And\n[1:46:24] what does it mean, friends? What does it\n[1:46:25] mean to believe the message and have\n[1:46:27] message churches and and gather together\n[1:46:30] like we do? It's like if you came if you\n[1:46:33] if you came to a house of a young\n[1:46:36] married couple, you walk in that house\n[1:46:39] and on the kitchen table there is a\n[1:46:40] beautiful bouquet.\n[1:46:42] Now, what does that tell you? That tells\n[1:46:45] you, look, look, there's a love affair\n[1:46:47] going on in this house. Now, you might\n[1:46:49] not see the you might not see the the\n[1:46:52] husband. He might be somewhere else\n[1:46:54] working on a better place for them to\n[1:46:56] live. But when you see that bouquet,\n[1:46:59] Amen. It bears witness that there's a\n[1:47:01] love affair happening. Amen. That\n[1:47:03] there's a romance that's unfolding in\n[1:47:04] this place. That's what it ought to be.\n[1:47:06] When somebody walks through these doors,\n[1:47:08] spends a little time around the bride of\n[1:47:10] Christ. There should be such an\n[1:47:11] atmosphere of love. People should be so\n[1:47:13] in love with the Lord. There should be\n[1:47:15] fragrance. There should be beauty. There\n[1:47:17] should be an expression. Amen. Cuz\n[1:47:19] that's what the bouquet is. It's an\n[1:47:21] expression of the heart of God. If I\n[1:47:24] take if I go buy my wife a bouquet, it's\n[1:47:26] been a little while. I should do that.\n[1:47:28] If I buy her a bouquet of flowers and I\n[1:47:29] bring it to I surprise her, you know,\n[1:47:31] come in the door. Here's here's some\n[1:47:32] flowers, honey. You know what? She she\n[1:47:35] never uh she never asked me, \"Oh, what\n[1:47:38] store did you buy those at?\"\n[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Uh huh. Was there was the\n[1:47:44] traffic bad getting home? And you know,\n[1:47:46] uh who who who was working the counter?\n[1:47:48] Who sold it to you? Were they on sale or\n[1:47:50] what? You know, she don't think about\n[1:47:53] any of that cuz her what what her mind\n[1:47:55] is fixed on in those flowers. What she's\n[1:47:58] seeing is the expression of my heart.\n[1:48:01] And friends, this message ain't about\n[1:48:03] what church we go to and who's got the\n[1:48:05] best ministry and you know and and uh\n[1:48:07] you who's saying this and who's doing\n[1:48:08] that and what they're teaching over\n[1:48:10] there. Amen. And what this one said and\n[1:48:12] how that one's acting and how this one's\n[1:48:14] a hypocrite and that one's causing\n[1:48:15] trouble in the church. That ain't the\n[1:48:17] focus. Amen. But God sent a message.\n[1:48:20] Amen. To bring the bride and Christ\n[1:48:22] together. Amen. It ought to be such a\n[1:48:24] love affair that we'd be undistracted by\n[1:48:26] everything else. Amen. Oh my. When you\n[1:48:29] get discouraged about what's going on\n[1:48:30] around this message, I want you to\n[1:48:32] understand something that you look\n[1:48:34] around, you say, \"Brother Nathan, we got\n[1:48:35] church troubles, ministry troubles,\n[1:48:37] fellowship troubles.\" Amen. And all\n[1:48:40] these kind of organizational problems\n[1:48:41] around the message. But the message\n[1:48:43] wasn't sent to an organization. It was\n[1:48:46] sent to an individual. Amen. And when I\n[1:48:48] received the message, amen, it was such\n[1:48:50] a love letter to me. Amen. I can't worry\n[1:48:53] about what everybody else is doing. I'm\n[1:48:55] too caught up in the message of the\n[1:48:57] heart of God. He loved me. He elected\n[1:49:00] me. And he put me here to be manifested\n[1:49:02] as a son. I'm his bride. I'm going in a\n[1:49:05] rapture. I'm destined for a wedding\n[1:49:07] supper. Amen. It's a love affair.\n[1:49:11] Don't worry about the rest. Amen. Just\n[1:49:13] make sure you as an individual receive\n[1:49:15] this love message. Let that Holy Spirit\n[1:49:18] whisper in your ear.\n[1:49:21] Amen. You remember what they used to do\n[1:49:23] little girls? I think I don't know how\n[1:49:25] far this goes back. It might It's like a\n[1:49:26] Victorian thing or something. Goes way\n[1:49:29] way back. Some of you Some of you did it\n[1:49:30] when you were little. Little girl take a\n[1:49:33] flower. Remember? Just say, \"He loves\n[1:49:36] me. He loves me not.\n[1:49:39] He loves me. He loves me not.\" Because\n[1:49:42] then you got to get once you get the\n[1:49:43] last petal picked off of there, you find\n[1:49:44] out whether he really loves you, right?\n[1:49:47] You know, there's a trick to that\n[1:49:48] because the trick is what kind of flower\n[1:49:50] you use. Cuz some of them got an odd\n[1:49:52] number of petals and some of them got an\n[1:49:53] even number of petals. So if you really\n[1:49:55] you really you can rig it to find out he\n[1:49:57] really loves you if you want to. Amen.\n[1:49:59] Just make sure it's the right kind of\n[1:50:00] flower and you start picking that off.\n[1:50:02] Love me, love me, not love me. Oh, he\n[1:50:03] loves me. Oh my. But friends, that that\n[1:50:06] ain't the kind of Amen. But there's so\n[1:50:08] many Christians, you know, who got that\n[1:50:10] mentality about it. Oh yeah. Sunday\n[1:50:12] morning, oh, he loves me. I'm in church.\n[1:50:14] I'm happy. I'm worshiping the Lord.\n[1:50:16] Monday, oh, I'm being tempted and tried\n[1:50:18] and Amen. Oh, he loves me not. And oh,\n[1:50:20] Wednesday, glory to God, we're back in\n[1:50:22] church. He loves me. And Thursday, oh\n[1:50:25] no, I I'm a little depressed today. He\n[1:50:27] loves me not. Amen, friends. Amen. What\n[1:50:30] you got to find out is what kind of a\n[1:50:31] flower you are. Amen. When you realize\n[1:50:33] you're a seed of God. Amen. He loves you\n[1:50:35] today. He love you tomorrow. He loves\n[1:50:37] you the day after that. Amen. Get rid of\n[1:50:40] your love me, love me, not religion. And\n[1:50:42] just say, \"Lord, I'm a seed of God. I'm\n[1:50:44] predestinated to adoption. I'm coming up\n[1:50:46] into full blossom. And I thank you for\n[1:50:49] the light of this message that can make\n[1:50:50] me all that I can be.\" Glory to God.\n[1:50:53] Let's stand and worship the Lord today.\n[1:50:56] Oh, aren't you glad you're in his\n[1:50:57] bouquet? Blessed be the name of the\n[1:50:59] Lord.\n[1:51:01] He loves me. Loves me. Loves me. Loves\n[1:51:03] me.\n[1:51:07] That's the way it is, you know. Amen.\n[1:51:09] When it when I hear brother Donnie\n[1:51:11] preach, Amen. I I I'm seeing something\n[1:51:13] in the bouquet, it's telling me, \"Oh\n[1:51:16] yeah, he loves me.\" That's what all\n[1:51:18] these gifts and ministries are put in\n[1:51:19] the body. When brother Harry sings, oh,\n[1:51:22] he loves me. Amen. When this one plays\n[1:51:24] the Amen. When when the when the when\n[1:51:26] the brothers play the instruments and\n[1:51:28] you hear that beautiful music, oh, he\n[1:51:30] loves me. And we look at these young\n[1:51:31] people raising up in the fear that to\n[1:51:33] carry this message on to the coming of\n[1:51:34] the Lord. Oh, he loves me. Amen. He He\n[1:51:37] the message is real. Amen. His\n[1:51:39] intentions are true. He's going to put\n[1:51:41] me in a rapture. He's going to make me\n[1:51:43] what he wants me to be cuz he loves me\n[1:51:46] and he put a law of life in me by a seed\n[1:51:48] of predestination.\n[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; I'll close on this quote. We just ask\n[1:51:53] the brothers to sing and lead us in\n[1:51:55] worship. Brother Bamman, I know my\n[1:51:57] redeemer liveth. It talks about the\n[1:51:59] resurrection life of Jesus. He said\n[1:52:01] nothing can destroy it.\n[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; It's been planted.\n[1:52:06] It is the seed of God. It is a purpose\n[1:52:09] of God to give us the blessed Holy\n[1:52:11] Spirit. It's the purpose of God to show\n[1:52:13] us signs and wonders and miracles. It's\n[1:52:15] the purpose of God and nothing can\n[1:52:18] destroy it. All powers of hell might\n[1:52:20] wage against it, but it will prevail. We\n[1:52:24] have God's eternal promise. There might\n[1:52:27] be teachers. There might be isms rise,\n[1:52:29] great programs and things that look like\n[1:52:31] it would be destroyed, but it can never\n[1:52:33] be destroyed. It is the purpose of God\n[1:52:37] to see that it will prevail. Then I love\n[1:52:40] what he said. Then look, see, if it's\n[1:52:42] the purpose of God, he says, then it's\n[1:52:44] not up to me.\n[1:52:46] Thank God. And it's not up to you\n[1:52:48] whether it will be destroyed or not.\n[1:52:50] It's up to God. And we can rest assured\n[1:52:53] on it that God will never let our\n[1:52:55] heritage be destroyed for it's his\n[1:52:58] purpose to give it to us.\n[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; How many feel the presence of the sun\n[1:53:04] today?\n[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Say, \"Lord, I want to come up a little\n[1:53:08] higher. I want to yield a little more to\n[1:53:11] that law of life on the inside of me.\"\n[1:53:13] We just have a word of prayer. Lord\n[1:53:15] Jesus.\n[1:53:17] Lord,\n[1:53:19] we've gathered together today to look,\n[1:53:21] Lord,\n[1:53:24] for the power that we need, Lord, to\n[1:53:26] take another step with you.\n[1:53:28] Many of us need healing. Many of us need\n[1:53:31] deliverance. Many of us need leadership,\n[1:53:34] guidance,\n[1:53:35] comfort.\n[1:53:37] Oh, we're such a needy people, Lord.\n[1:53:40] But I thank you, Jesus, that the power\n[1:53:43] that we're looking for is not a million\n[1:53:45] miles away.\n[1:53:48] But you said when you planted that seed,\n[1:53:50] Lord, in the good ground of these\n[1:53:51] hearts,\n[1:53:53] Lord, that you put within it, Lord, the\n[1:53:57] potential and the power to become\n[1:53:59] exactly what you wanted it to be. Lord,\n[1:54:03] we're not so much trying real hard,\n[1:54:05] Lord, to be Christians today. We're just\n[1:54:08] trying to learn how to yield to the law\n[1:54:10] of life that's already in us. I pray,\n[1:54:12] Lord Jesus, that your Holy Spirit would\n[1:54:15] come and the same quickening power,\n[1:54:17] Lord, Lord, that that many of these\n[1:54:19] lives before me, Lord, you you baptized\n[1:54:22] them with the Holy Ghost maybe many\n[1:54:23] years ago. Let that same quickening\n[1:54:25] power move, Lord, on that seed life\n[1:54:28] within them, Lord, and bring them into a\n[1:54:29] fuller blossom. And if there been\n[1:54:31] anybody here, Lord, who doesn't know you\n[1:54:33] in life and reality, Lord, but they're\n[1:54:36] just caught up in miserable religion,\n[1:54:37] Lord, laying in a filthy place\n[1:54:39] somewhere, let the quickening power,\n[1:54:42] Lord, bring that seed to life. And from\n[1:54:46] that time, Lord, let it never be the\n[1:54:48] same. I commit this service into your\n[1:54:50] hands, Lord. I pray, Lord, that hearts\n[1:54:53] have been ministered to, Lord Jesus, use\n[1:54:56] it for your glory, Lord. And we commit\n[1:54:58] ourselves, this congregation, this\n[1:55:00] church. Bless Lord, the pastor, the\n[1:55:02] people. Bless this church in a special\n[1:55:05] way. Continue to use them, Lord, as a\n[1:55:07] bouquet of the expression of your heart,\n[1:55:09] Lord, in the days ahead. In the name of\n[1:55:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.\n[1:55:16] God bless you.\n[1:55:18] [Applause]\n[1:55:20] More than coner,\n[1:55:28] overcomers\n[1:55:29] in this life.\n[1:55:35] We've been made\n[1:55:37] victorious\n[1:55:42] through the blood of Jesus Christ.\n[1:55:49] We've been made more than coner,\n[1:55:55] [Music]\n[1:55:57] overcomers\n[1:55:59] in this life.\n[1:56:04] Oh, we've been made\n[1:56:07] victorious\n[1:56:11] through the blood of Jesus Christ.\n[1:56:16] [Music]\n[1:56:18] Oh, we've been made more than coners,\n[1:56:24] [Music]\n[1:56:26] overcomers\n[1:56:28] in this life.\n[1:56:33] We've been made\n[1:56:36] victorious\n[1:56:41] through the blood of Jesus Christ.\n[1:56:47] Oh, we've been made\n[1:56:51] and coners\n[1:56:56] overcomers\n[1:56:58] in this life.\n[1:57:02] Oh, we've been made\n[1:57:06] victorious\n[1:57:07] [Music]\n[1:57:10] through the blood of Jesus Christ.

held in the galleries what a privilege brother warning sister Vicky god bless y'all so good see it tonight he's the Lord a man this just bow our heads together and ask the Lord's blessings on the word father we thank you so much tonight Lord for this wonderful opportunity again to be able to assemble ourselves together this place has been dedicated to be the house of God father we pray that your grace that you administer to us give us those things which we have need of Lord there's many many needs it's among us Lord I'm thinking of different ones that are sick but the bird gravely Lord you see this surgeon that a brother had to have this week and we're asking for your mercy to him others that are sick and afflicted dealing with various things in their lives Lord we know that you're mindful of us would you come by this way to not Lord Jesus whereas bartimaeus was so many many years ago Oh son of David don't pass us by we called upon you not under the name of son of David but under our true dispensation or linked to you and that is our husband our blessed Redeemer with predators speak to us than that father from your word I want to yield myself that you can be able to take this human instrumentality and speak through me to the glory of God in Jesus name and the Saint said God bless you you may be seated her journey is about two thousand years or excuse me two days this has been in the making for a long long time she's been through many dangers toils and snares got delivered of so many habits set free of so many terrible terrible sins he's washed her in his blood rooster from the Adamic nature that she was born with set her free from so many things that she was bound by in sin and yet here she is in this chariot as it's called of cedar the pilasters of silver covered with purple on the top and she's fighting the greatest battle that she's ever felt and that is the battle in her mind she's no longer a southern Galilean girl she's no longer under the control or the dominance of her brothers that can make her go here and go there and do this and that she's free from that she's free from the burning Sun of which she said I am black but comely and the word is in hebrew tanned by the sun which she had many long hours she said I kept my my family she but it did not tend to my own garden because of neglect she's free from that she's no longer subject to these overlords that would try to control her why would she still be fighting battles there she's free from the Lions and the caves that are near the mountain region which she was from near Lebanon she no longer fears the leopards lions and the sayings that was in her home stretch of land where she was from why she still fighting these battles and why does it seem as though these battles in one way are more difficult than even getting saved it makes no sense it would seem the hold of sin would certainly be the most difficult battle anymore - whatever fight to be loosened from that will truly bring the greatest Liberty that a person would ever known in what other battle could even compare to being loosed from sin but you see my brother Adam preached in 1962 and entitled the message the greatest battle ever fought he never said that being a sinner and being loosed from sin was the greatest battle he never said that being loosed from alcohol or cigarettes or pornography or profanity was the greatest battle ever fault but he brought it down to basically when you listened to that sermon down to the Christians the believers that are fighting the greatest battle ever fought not getting saved after you are saved not coming to God but after you come to God learning how to surrender to God knowing then that the sinner coming to God is certainly not the greatest battle a person that would be bound with such filth and decrepid nice of sin yet that but in itself is not the greatest battle that mortal will ever fight in one sense of the word when they come to Christ in the simplicity of believing he is the one taking upon himself their battle of darkness and liberating them from sin but after they become set free then they are the ones that enter into very great battle now let me let me go this direction for just a little bit I know a lot of folks don't like it when you go in this direction dealing with brother branham but I've never been one to really kind of cater to people anyway I want to follow the leading to the Lord that's the most important thing other bam tells us in 19 and 60 the biggest enemy that I've got is William Branham can Happy Valley say amen to that he's always in my way now there's a couple of questions now that I want to ask so brother branham's greatest enemy is William Branham William Branham and brother Branham is not the same person just not brother Donnie and Donnie ain't the same person that brother David and David in you and you and you and you you understand now I know message folks go to get all tore all nervous that ain't that complicated just listen that's the biggest enemy that I've got is William Branham not brother William Branham but William Branham notice now how he severs himself from William Branham the greatest enemy ah God well my question is who's I now you can't say that I is William Branham so I must be somebody different than William Branham the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's always in listen out some of the persons way so I and my is on the same side and William branham's on the other side ah am I is on warm side and darkness on the other side and go ahead and say man cuz you're the same way now notice he's always in my way he's always in God's way I will say he's always gets in God's way he's too tired he don't want to do this he don't wanna do that if I can just crucify that guy God can use it so the urea is a william branham that is in god's way and here is a william branham that is in brother branham's way and here is a william branham that brother william branham must crucify in order for God to use him oh praise the Lord I said if I can just crucify that guy God can use it God can use this and God can use this body use this microphone now notice how that he likens and you can search us if you like but he uses these terms very very over and over again repetitively in the message that he was simply like a microphone he says that ministers are like a microphone and the microphone is mute and the microphone does not have the ability to speak its own words and he said that he was like a microphone now the problem is that many folks are making him the microphone God you can't make the microphone God because the microphone is mute would it be done to call this Donny Reagan now Donny Reagan's used it ever since it was bought new as a matter of fact it has my name on the body pad right but the Louie has his name on his the visiting Minister had their own it's called vision Minister others has called the pale each one of them are named this one has my name on it nobody uses it but me it's set for me for the travel for the mid range for the mid treble for the bass exactly in the way that I like it so it's set for my voice but no matter how much my name is on the pack I'll tell what you do now next Saturday night when I'm in Switzerland take this microphone and laid upon the pulpit and turn it on and see if it will repeat my words see if it will say what I say tonight praise the Lord it cannot it will not and if it does run that's exactly right now it's the same of any true minister of God so to make brother branham's voice the literal voice of God it's contrary to what he taught my voice no other preachers voice is the literal voice of God there's only been one of those and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ that's right so brother Branham became a microphone now notice this you know I'm looking at this how that he brings us in God can use this body use this microphone it's a mute till I speak in it or somebody else speaks in it but it can't speak itself now what's this battle that we are engaging again it says in perfect change of perfect weakness I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he is the one that gets in God's way he gets lazy praise the Lord I know friends I know this is not popular but I as I said I really don't care it's the truth we need to hear it so that we can learn if we're going to overcome how many of us overcome well there's only one way we can overcome we've gotta know who our enemy is I mean if you think that tree is your enemy you pull the leaves off of it and you kick it and turning over and turn it upside down all you're going to do is get hot and sweats going to run down your face and your fragrance is going to be tore all the pieces and when you get down you still got your enemy if you think that Gatorades your enemy when you get done you know what you ain't you ain't done that's it but if you can identify who your enemy is and learn how to fight your enemy it will change your entire world that's right notice he's the one that gets in God's Way he gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes he thinks he can do something about it now notice this William Branham so this William Branham sometimes get to a place that he's lazy there's other times that William Branham would get to a place and he thought he could do something about it now this is you I'm talking about even though you're named a William Branham but this is a very epitome of us all we're never all exactly the same on the same day or in the same aisle really we can change from one thing to another so sometimes we're lazy and then other times we think we've got the answer and other times are not really sure so we just go back and forth and back and forth and that's what gets in God's Way rather Brennaman who said that he was exactly the same way by the RAM got lazy in you Christians ever get lazy brother Ram got lazy then there will be times he said he thinks he can do something about it and what he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that is out of the way then God can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about can happy valley say amen to that God can do it in a way that william branham knows nothing about it that's when God can use you that's what he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot now this is the battle you see when you as a sinner it was not you battling trying to get yourself out of the way you cut him God didn't ask you to get yourself out of the way when you was a sinner he simply asked you to take his atonement for your sin that imply the blood and bring you into the work of reconciliation but now that you're a child of God it is a day to a battle and this is why Paul said that I die daily here talking about the sin nature the sin nature god when he got born again it is the human makeup it is your makeup or your human nature that we deal with every day oh my notice this again he says improving his word 1964 William Branham is the greatest enemy I got now watch again he's separating William Branham from I now wonder how God feels and I wonder how brother Brandon would feel when people make an idol out of brother branham's greatest enemy according to him his greatest enemy was his flesh and yet people idolized brother branham's greatest enemy oh now don't sit don't judge them too bad because most of us did the same thing to ourselves now you see if we really believe that we are our greatest enemy I think we would attack ourselves in a much more aggressive way and we would attack others in a less aggressively because we would know really we are our enemy anyway it's not your husband your wife your pastor the Deacons and so on but it is yourself now we say we believe that and we say Amen to it but by our actions it is evident we do not believe it the way he believed it about himself now he really believed that William Branham was his enemy praise the Lord now if we believe the same thing then will not we take the same mindset toward him not notice he said William Branham is the greatest enemy our God see but when I can get him out of the way then Jesus Christ can use the body so there no doubt if brother branham's greatest enemy was William Branham then our greatest enemy will be us you agree with me so far now once again he says I used to preach over the Baptist Church a little sermon I called it let loose and let God that's I just let loose and that God as always you've got yourself into it there no way don't you love him theological terms there ain't no way you know who the biggest enemy I gots william branham he's always in god's way if I could just get him out of the way then God can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself I'm going to say it again that's your worse enemy it is yourself I'm going to say it again that is your worst enemy it is yourself that's better make it that you are sending me it as yourself just get yourself out of the way then God can go to work now be careful of your associates when you get out there and get among the people this one begin to tell you this and this one back then you get yourself all mixed up and you don't know what you do believe now why is this very important because the type of things we feed on type of preachers we listen to has a great impact upon our stand on the gospel notice again now this is a very peculiar quote you have to really listen to it several times give me give time to the old fashioned heartfelt pouring out of the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy Ghost pours down upon your soul you'll get besides yourself now listen you'll get massaged yourself maybe you can get with Jesus if you get away from yourself once notice how you can't be with yourself and Jesus you find out you're the biggest enemy you got now listen you can't be with yourself and Jesus so what you want to do is get besides yourself now in the sense I'm not talking about just a static warship and jumping up and down and all that but get besides yourself get yourself where it needs to be not in the control tower of you but beside you so you can get with Jesus now what we're trying to different well all the Christianity in this a is merging you and Jesus and your nature on the same thing just put it all one big bow and let God work it out it'll never work you've got to get yourself out of the way and get you your soul in with Jesus but if you try to take them three and mix it together you're gonna have a mess you try to take your human makeup all your fears your complexes your inferiority and all that together let that dominate you know now Satan will try to convince us that our dearest closest friends is after all who do you talk to more than anybody else who do you trust more than anybody else who do you love more thinking about oh my goodness here we go in reality most of us subconsciously would consider ourselves our closest dearest trustworthy friend oh Jesus help us but there put me to more services and you'll have a break I'll be gone for a while now notice this he says a man never knows what it is to live a victorious life until he's completely over God and then he asked the question who himself that's the biggest enemy you got is your self but if you believe yourself is your friend will you try to overcome yourself or will you try to subdue yourself or will you not cater to yourself so if yourself tells you brother Donnie don't like you or the church don't like you or God don't love you what most people will believe who their closest friend so then they set there and they hear me preach or other ministers briefs and they will hear that word through what their closest friends interpretation so when they get a text they read that text through their closest friends interpretation which is complexes and fears and in very Ortiz and Oh Lord the further I go the Quadra y'all will get why because our friend our dearest closest personal friend is the one that we give the most credence to oh thank you Jesus notice instant reproach for the cause of the word brother Mercedes praying father he goes on he says in this prayer it's really touching to hear him say but he said heal the sick afflicted that's among us bind up the brokenhearted Lord we went through so much my heart's got so many scars on it Lord from hard battles I'm a tall veteran help me Lord I need your help help me Lord I need your help now remember we're in the greatest battle that's ever been fought and when you listen to this in 1962 you'll hear brother Branham said the greatest battle that's ever been fought is right in the future fixing to happen when him going on a 62 he said it's fixing to take place and soldiers truly we are in that battle right now now because of all that we are in the natural sense of see taste feel smell hear love imagination conscience memory and all the aspects of the gates of the flesh and the spirit and the main one of course to the sola supreme moral agency then satan has ten gates by which he tries to reach us and that is to the outer realm and then the spirit realm and on the inside is exactly where the seat of life ways but yet satan doesn't even have to have direct access to the soul in order to rob us a peace joy victory and all of that because when we become converted we are a new creation in the same old temple so we are born again added breath of God the seed of God inside of us it's quickened but the human element is still there and Satan can still aggravate is he can make a sick put sickness afflictions and we get in our mind this person no lock us in that one don't like us and God don't care if I ever die you know whatever more that we go through and if that is our closest dearest friend then when we go to talking to our self then if that's who we have the confidence in no matter what anybody else tells us they can come up and say look brother I love you I love you but if your dearest friend tells you they don't love you that's the gospel because that's the one that we paid the most attention to oh mama now why is that though it's because the two outer elements would still remain unconverted and this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought God is calling for every seed of Abraham to separate themselves from ck's fields now here imagination conscious memory reason and affection you imagine God is calling you to separate yourself from yourself this is a lot of friends yes as those it's going to take the rapture and only those what's this in standing in the gap he says I become an old man an old veteran preacher and had a lot of hard battles oh my and maybe I'm scarred all cut out on the inside from fights because my Lord the Lord gave me was not to back to kiss the babies and marry the young and bury the dead but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the battlefront against the wiles of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness inside it were the Word of God till I seen the enemy defeated I've been cut deep many times I remember just because you are a man of Valor because you are a great soldier even a great general as he was does not mean that you will leave the battle without being wounded and many times better animals greatly wounded he was wounded by enemies he was wounded by friends he was wounded no doubt my family and those of us around him as we all have been now every one of us said in here tonight that if you've been a Christian very long no doubt you have been wounded I prayed to God if I've ever wounded you forgive me now if the word has wounded ship I refuse to apologize for that but if I wounded you as a man I beg your forgiveness because you have enough wounds the way it is about me adding more but I figure as long as I'm your pastor I'm going to keep on wounding as far as the word so I'll go ahead and let you know that but whatever we see now that the human being because of the the way that were designed these things certainly can affect us how well your brother branham from his very heart saying that he's wounded am i this reproach for the word 1962 and then about six months or so later he's saying it a little bit more now the scars are coming out so it is the scars from war not because the sin didn't run around with other people's wives trying to steal money or any that sort of thing but it was because of the particular call that God had given him he was not a James as we've been looking on the book of Acts that James are so loved and respected by the Jews and James is not a controversial sort of guy Peter could go and preach among the Jews they didn't hang him up I've get one or two Paul but God has got different men in different positions and it's very tough on men like Paul right brother Branham who have a very difficult role and because of that brother Branham had got wounded many many times he held his scars very well he was able to hide them very very well but yet he come to a spot to where that they begin to leech out of him as it was and begin to affect his heart and his conduct and his behavior toward those that he was sent to personal come on go get quad on me you know this is true he said I'm all scarred and cut up on the inside now he says this is what God called him to be and the last 5-6 Verwoerd's there he says I've been cut deep many times now Satan of course knowing this and he's been dealing with human beings for six thousand years now so as he learns unlike you and I Satan no doubt has as we would say in a sense of perfect recall of remembering all the battles all the weaknesses all the frailties of dealing with human beings so whenever he learn something he can apply that to the next one the next one the next one and when he finds your repetitive pattern he knows exactly what to do against you and I in order to try to defeat us well he'd found that brother branham was quiet all night he was quite a soldier quite a general quite a man al valor but he also found he was silly human me autocad race you are I don't care what prophet pastor singer whatever you are you're still a human being now in this brother enemies reached the place to where that he's fighting this this war that's going on was in himself you remember standing in the gap it's not one probably the lot of message folks deliver player in their church because it displaces humanity a brother branham but I can follow a man like this I can follow a man that admit he was wrong come on I know some of you don't like it because you're going to idolize his flesh huh huh you want to worship William Brown I'll worship in the Lord Jesus I want to identify this man that William Branham said was his enemy because it will help me identify my enemy my enemy is not William Branham it's not Jim Bob it's not David Siler it's Donny Reagan will the true Donny Reagan please stand up now I'm standing you see this guy right here he wants to cook my lady that country shut your mouth get Elaine to real Tommy Reagan what's now standing of the gap paragraph 122 I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to and that's wrong I've built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message everybody okay to this now we're talking about friends Elijah the greatest man as far as ministry next to the Lord Jesus but it was a man with a ministry and as long as the man is there this can happen now for you all your brother doesn't do it may no but run the parallel in your own life what we're fixing to find is a prophet of God that is called to minister to the sick Minister the message of the word they get a loss of feeling for the people another can become so stressed with her children a father can become so stressed with work and with family and with this and that another never enough time never enough money never enough this never enough set and yet he's still in the role of father a mother still in the role of mother a deacon can still be in the role of deacon but yet we lose something in our heart now watch this is the very heart now this man that we see I let the sick way I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and God forbid that I try to compare the life like Moses but that's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him and when he come to deliver them so he just left him alone and went into the wilderness but God turned him around he long forgot the suffering people Moses forgot how in the world could you forget the suffering people because your best friend you see the longer we listen to our best friend the worse we get I hate to tell you all tonight the child's best friend's a two-faced liar ain't nothing but a hypocrite he'll lie to you on Monday he'll lie to you through Sunday he'll lie 24/7 come on I'm talking about your feelings I'm talking about your imagination I'm talking about your memory don't you understand for many of us the person that we have made as our best friend our closest confidant is a liar if I lied to you folks half as much as you lie to yourself you would have tarred and feathered me and yet you will lie to yourself and believe yourself daily yourself or say you ain't saved you don't feel I say you can while I even read the Bible you do get now the Bible you listen to pay for you don't get another wife and go to church you don't get nothing out of shirt he's a liar you do get something if you come at a halfway attitude you able to leave you're not without something out of the service but you're listening to your lying South Omaha he says Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him brother Roy and I remember in this story here in Roy Roberts inhabit a dream about brother randomly seen brother Branham carried up to a certain place and seen brother bedroom changed now brother Raymond's going to relate to this remember brother Roy in your dream and now I cannot go with a ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me whoa okay so God told him to go back I say I can't do it God I'm sorry oh dude chief where the gym is my life insurance paid that Betty I'm not needed after this service notice no matter of God did tell me but that is to change the scene in the dream role robertson saw brother Branham changed what was it his heart his attitude why his best friend been lying to him [Music] the William Branham that his heavens greatest enemy that William branham's got a big mouth oh Jesus he's been lying come on go children don't recollect or by saying I know by steam he was a sinner he needed to be saved like you needed to be saying he had to have the Holy Ghost he had to bring William Branham subject don't idolize that man's flesh you'll make yourself on a dollar to your Brice same the Holy Ghost notice he said something's got to change me because I'm a heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they also heard that message and they also done it I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have as I said I can follow up man like this to me this is a big man it ain't a big man that has his faults and has everything about income on children that's nothing but a coward a lot of preachers want you to think they never go through no battles he's a liar preachers fight hell they get discouraged they get down you get down brother don't I do get down I did weary I think what what's the use even go to church anymore and preach people come and they won't - don't come they don't want to what differences in math I'm gonna preach it in head to do my best for God it's up to you what you do with it oh I've gotta keep driving over the David I'm waiting on you to encourage me I appreciate it when you do but there's times I've got to encourage myself and I've got to say Johnny you're up on the wall and you're doing a good work and you are not coming down and my friend Donny will say I'm tired of this I'm weary of this and the seat of God will say shut your mouth you are not my friend you are a liar get behind me Oh notice he said I don't have the feeling for the people but I should have until I can get that feeling there's no need of me going because I'd be a hypocrite so his brother branham back slid his brother branham lost the Holy Ghost where's the problem lies in the realm of feeling all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I'd go to I got a feel that that isn't Ricky and Rick Adam and remember the Lord rebuked him for that and it isn't that virtuous god's children that's in bondage and I must go to them until I can feel that way oh gotta be kidding me until I can feel that way oh Jesus there's no need to be gone I'd be ahead today guys go tell us the remedy most you can say while friends a lot of the idol worshipers can't listen to this tape it totally destroys their God image don't destroy my god image because I don't have a God image of other enim I've got a God image of Jesus Christ amen can't you say this is the william branham that was his enemy if you'll see him you'll see yourself if you don't see brother Brennan rot you'll never see yourself right if you don't see me Roddy's your posture you'll never see yourself right if you put me in this holy image old brother Donnie is always so strong he's always so good he'll always be here well ah make no man no man your ultimate example but Jesus Christ on the throne and leave in there no preacher no deacon nobody else right mama notices he says I'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait dis loaf are you still going to get a salary you didn't say that it what what's going on they had been saved got rid of a temper been delivered of so many things but now the greatest battle ever false going on to William Branham against brother Branham so it's William Branham against brother William Branham there's only one word difference rather on the word word one word difference swing you and yourself and that's brother or sister god so they all need to sever your friendship to not face up Jordan seven just tell your closest friend move out from this point on I refuse to listen to your life if you say one more lie to me almost smacked you in the mouth well praise the Lord you talk about something to me listen fish and pretty girl for 73 would you do this one favor for me now both hearing on the tapes also you brethren pray that God will place into my heart that's something that I lost out there that complex it's so easy to build a complex now remember complex has nothing to do so you don't get complexes from the blood of Jesus you don't get complexes from the baptism the Holy Ghost you get them from yourself sometimes it comes from other people sometimes are inherited but it's basically the outer two realms I had an interview the other day with my brother way sitting here Sammy here in front a good man but built himself around the complex another kind of a complex did the same thing but the way you can so easy so easily do it it's just Allison how easy it is to build a complex you can so easy good you just get a little something no oh you mean we feel complexes from the mind out more children you get a little something in your mind and keep thinking that way now those of you that are familiar with the service right here when quoting from brother Wei is standing right here in front of brother Brennan pretty close up to the pulpit area his wife is a nurse brother Wei resents what brother Branham says and he dies in a heart attack okay they're in enough ambulances in Carter County in Washington County so for your own health don't resent what's been said tonight [Music] [Applause] now this is serious friend this is not playing now you remember that brother Brennaman by God's grace was able to pray over this man and raise him back up and I hear he talks about this occurrence happening in dimensions in Chicago a few three weeks ago while I was speaking a man standing before sees an Englishman's wife is Norwegian very fine nurse him a very fine man and so the man I was speaking of complexes and the man kind of resented it when I said it I told him a couple years ago when I first met him that he was bothered with a murmur in his heart he hardly didn't want to believe that I think at first and then finally the doctor told him that he had the murmur his art and that morning he had kind of bent a little Torah and when I said that he resented it and quickly dropped dead right on the for oh my fell out on the floor and his wife got down to examine him and he was gone now look at what this man which is very unusual for brother Brennan to do at this wedding I've never found myself anyplace else what he quite did it this way that he would you know expose a person in one sense like and the man it calls him to go in to resemble what you might do any of us the same way so here he calls it out and then the man dies and brother BAM goes and by the grace of God is to say he was able to bring the men back to life again but what do receive in this man now had the complex built from listening to all these things whatever it was that the man was troubled about hearing it exposed publicly caused such a rise inside of this and now it becomes so great and he becomes so resentful toward the prophet of God that his life is cut off momentarily oh god help us from that now you imagine then when we go to believing if yourself is your best friend then when we accept ourselves as our best friend we go to evaluating everything through the filter of that best friend so we will evaluate people we will evaluate situations we will evaluate sermons we will evaluate the way the preacher looks at you if he says a certain thing and then you will evaluate that in your mind now basically your best friend is your filter so you're pulling the word through that filter then you are pulling services and texts and emails and phone calls and so on and so on so you are hearing that as that best friend is interpreting under here see he's on that radix eulogy notice the way he said that about Judas he looked right at you look you know I got to look somewhere and I'll say Judas unless y'all want me to do this I'm not sure how safe that would be I'm afraid I'll fall and hurt oneself bad so you just got to realize and I'll talk about Judas you've got to have enough faith to say he told about me I'm Judas I don't belong to the Judas much I belong to the Jesus much when it talks about Farrell why because you've got a different interpreter in your heart you refuse to allow your best friend just said well that was you and that was you and that was you and you might as well leave you might as well get out this message it ain't for you in the first place and your best friend is trying to lead you to hell are you going to let your so-called best friend lead you to hell oh ma so we'll make your brother branham then we will put the filter of our best friend why our fears our inferiority Tsar complexes and we are also complex don't show us them one reason why we need to change it ain't just to make you young let may be open and honest and frank with you tonight there probably ain't but about maybe a dozen people that I'd want to spend eternity with like we currently are and I probably wouldn't make your dozen less now think of it really would you want to spend eternity was people the way we are now husbands don't don't move don't move husbands you wives don't you even flutter my lord some of you wouldn't want to spend seventy thousand years with your kids what's less eternity don't you see we all have to be changed our nature's already been change what's left the human make up with all of our scars and all of our hurts and all of our peculiarities I read this see last weekend but I thought it was so fitting I want to read it to you again Roy Graham says you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing you'll be shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you after a while it becomes so reality to you you'll actually believe that person doesn't like you now where are you getting this your best friend right your best friend is telling you this and that other person may tell you over and over and over again there's nothing between me and your brother sister I love you with all my heart but going to heaven you know we're going to shout down the streets of gold one day but the best friend will come back say huh sure right now you don't believe that you know we innovated it's a truce Boetticher this is what you need to do in my mouth [Applause] if my brother tells me there's nothing there I'm gonna believe him over you but you see most of us will do that well they'll believe our best friend cuz after all he's been with me all my life he stuck with me through second he's been with me when I had no friends he's probably one reason you ain't got many [Music] because he's telling you it's everybody else he won't be honest and tell you part of the problem is yourself whichever I'm a preacher Lord put this on my heart I'm a priest god help us why but we believe it and we make it so realest and how brother brems brings it you actually believe that that person doesn't like you who like you who which would wanna who you who you are you each one the best friend of course the soul ain't gonna believe no lies it's born again man and your body believes all kinds of stuff that's right so I've got to be changed now you might ballin out or say something telling for instance your wife or your husband or some neighbor someone that when the person is absolutely innocent of any you'll see and it's because that oh why do you have to use that little three-letter word that's your best friend you just imagined it so and where is your imagination in your spirit till it become very hot to you and then your best friend says see okay you ever invite you for a Big Mac y'all ever go to Dunkin Donuts for a cup of coffee don't invite me for coffee I don't walk off see what am i telling you what am i telling you but you see friends it's because our closest friend feels no threat from most of us he knows we just set right now he can lie to us he can spin the yarn and we'll set that we'll never questioned never asked him for proof never asked him for facts it was set right there and swallow down but I hope after tonight some things won't change I'm Patrick tonight by at least the time I get back from Switzerland that some of your old selves is so torn up around 14 xanax a day now physically now but your spiritual self is so nervous that yourself is afraid to open its mouth because you have set down and had a talk with yourself y'all ever do that well you need to sometimes me and me you sit down and have a talk cuz sometimes I get out of hand no I don't want to drink I don't want to run around I don't want to know that cell I just get wore out was preaching it wore out was studying and wore out you know just Dean with all that sort of thing and Donnie says look man you're 60 years old how many pictures do you know that preach three times a week and the message you're too old for this brother Graham said he was a veteran preacher you know how he was when he said that he was 53 I'm 60 so I'm older than he was OMA so you say my god but you need to set on say listen here you need to shut your mouth all could preach them and God says for me to quit preaching either that or they vote me out whichever comes first come on children do you ever just a dance and look here it's time for me and you to have a talk and I'm doing the talking and you're doing a listen you can speak when I give you permission let me start so high and the seed of God my name is on the Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world I was before you was and I'm going to lead you to a body change so set out and shout out I'm fixing to preach you or for our sermon I'm a child of God I'm ordained to live I'm a PI a Happy Valley I'm a part of the bride of Jesus Christ and you're going to follow what I'll say and you're gonna like it do you understand yes sir yes so whatever you say so there you go yeah we're in harmony [Applause] [Music] what's this in perfect faith brother Aaron said I get spells twos you know I get moody I get to a spot what gets me is when these spells I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me listen this nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world now if this was not believable for the film I would say never told him but somehow brother blames feelings or his emotions or you're not keeping relate to it every time people come to him most of the time that's always wanting something prayer for their daughter prayer for the son they lost her keys and he dis that need that you wonder how many people just come to him and want it to be his friend but try to coughs tell me whenever they'd come there and the visit said he'd never try to push him never try to ask all kinds of questions just let him come and just let him run and brother Ben would sit down the table and draw all kinds of spiritual things but they'd never pull on it just let him relax and let him rest and let him life oh oh wow some of you couldn't handle that milk it has to be walking around all the time of the pen and paper in his hand but he was a human being he needed to break away from that yes he did and I thank God there was people that was able to recognize it or drove him insane but you imagine he got to this spot where he was so Moody and overwork and Satan were telling you really ain't got a friend and yet was known around the world by millions just cause people know your name don't mean they're your friend remember I'm not immune to that temptation see I got over OMA I've got to overcome why don't you sing drinking doesn't run around with women dissing smoking so he's got to overcome that who is it William random talkin to brother room I've got to overcome that then when I look back and see something like this now what is relating here to the people is that he won one after and seen the license plates from the different states and all that people had stayed over from the morning service to the Sunday night service some of them will be driving 6 hours 8 hours 10 hours and they've you know they're going to be senators it whenever I see that I get in these moods and I get all that nobody really loves me nobody cares for me and then it amazing church attendance with what helping to overcome you don't know what it feels like would you spend hours and hours and sometimes days preparing a meal and half the church don't even show up how many times that your sister's put up to that and your supper praise the Lord oh I'm sorry y'all didn't realize then huh now this is what was going to over help brother branham to overcome listen to this and then amazing and I'm gonna take that word hallelujah I'm gonna use that scripture I'm going to quote that word oh no what he's going to do is remind Satan I remember a few Sunday nights ago when then people stayed over and drove six hours and eight hours to be in service on Sunday night here you go Dell you mean he's going to use that to combat the devil why preacher and his his flock and sheep are so tied together all sure friends every times you can't be at the house of God but when you're more busy vacation and going here in their livin you are the house of God you don't know how many times your pastor and the preachers that preacher leaves so down because you decided you didn't want to come just stay home and stream and one of these days and you stand before God you're going to be held responsible you're going to be held responsible oh ma notice is that I look back and see something like this notice what he said I put it right back in his face and say what about that what about that oh ma or the devil tells me I'm wasting my time and somebody stands up to preach it rather well with you oh you think well I shouldn't even done and I'm glad you done it because I want to take your face and your hand and your reaction and put it right in the devil's face and say see the devil see our devil it's the truth [Music] Roma can have a few matter what's the complexity of us as human beings now what's your trouble you've had an accident and that accident you were gassed with carbon monoxide gas that's true poisoned you poisoned your liver and you had trouble with that had troubled your stomach the brother says right you had trouble in your heart right so this is a false prophet it's this man's opportunity you're telling me Allah your guest and that ain't right show me one of these that they ever did [Applause] notice this oh ma who can glory I trouble in your stomach the brother says that's right I had trouble in your heart right it's makes you so nervous until you built yourself in a complex you're poor you must go back to work but you're afraid to go back to work you're afraid of that carbon monoxide gas so this mean gets poisoned on the job and it gets poor and he gets sick and he goes to all these things now look what the devil does the devil no doubt the one who caused it in the first place and now the devil is using the very thing that he calls to make the man worse and several more aspects of his life and no doubt telling the whole time if God loves you how come God ain't doing this and this is this he'll put sickness on you and then tell you God any heater boy if we ain't dealing with some kind of devil well if the devil put sickness on you I'm going to tell you God is a healer the army of the devil puts it on I'm part of the army of God that helps cast it off oh my notices but it's going to be alright now remember Jesus ha so tell me who you are Adam thing sure wasn't they if you're tell me who you're but you accepted in no and go on back and be of good cheer will you do it your name is mr. Wagner that's right that's right go on back on your road well I may not have the ability to go down through there until your name is mr. Sol and you remain as mr. Johnson this and that let me tell you what your real name is your real name is the word and let me tell you you well there's a complex about my mama or daddy or something that happened to you as a child our God wants you delivered tonight oh god what's every one of us to be able to fight this great old dad whatever then fall and find it and not only fight it but win Oh notice this a man just educate themselves so they educate themselves away from one another and they get complexes you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love you get love not a complex I'm a little bit bigger than somebody else a little bit better than somebody else can't you see what happens among us this message folks this doctrine and that doctrine and that go where we're bigger than you were the only bride well the only ones this is the bride's revival yeah more complexes we won't have nothing to us one another all nine notices she said you get love I'm bigger than somebody a little better than somebody else I know more than somebody else you just got your arms around everybody and it's a basis of love through the blood the blood cleanses because of this what's this just come in from California the other day and hadn't gotten my suitcase in been home and hadn't been home for two months right at two months got the second suitcase in the phone rang a lady she used to be kind of a girlfriend of mine years ago I used to pastor the mill town Baptist Church and she had two lovely daughters ready to find man Brotherhood he was a millwright that one of his fingers and thumbs cut off very nice brother they had twins and another girl making children the twins are staunch Christians they were ube I'm not sure exactly what that means people but they really believe God wanted a girl on a school she got a complex the girls tell her well why don't you smoke hot we do you think more better than well why don't you go to dances now they didn't go to dances and they didn't smoke or drink and I may find the healthier girl notice in this the healthier girl the healthier girl she said let him jump the river some y'all need her health you know I was emphasizing there for some reason didn't the healthier girl oh my glory to God let him jump in the river I'm the one serving Christ I don't want to I don't know her but the other one she began to think oh maybe I could do something she built a complex got nervous she went insane the header in an institution for two years my friends we're talking about complexes on steroids now that you would listen and think and make yourself your best friend and yourself what actually calls the departure don't ask me how this happens because I don't understand but remember first of this and he says when you went to see her begin to torture you remember the story he had to go out and find her spirit we say she'd lost her mind what does that mean exactly her brain was there the brain matter was there the stem cell was were there the brain all the tissues everything was still there what was it her thinking ability you don't think with your brain you think with your spirit so somehow another her spirit had went roaming this complex had got so severe it caused a breakdown let me tell you something some of you better get a hold of yourself as we say you can't toy with sin this is not something to be played with you better put your foot down on your complexes lest they drive you insane you better put your foot down and know who you are well unless I can find a church somewhere I'm accepted until you get different you'll never find one I wish I wish I could find the perfect Church so let me save you a lot of gas money there ain't no such a thing you better find where God puts you in settle down and set out yourself to shut up shut up I'm we're gone once made of it come on children I'm or will you folks want to go to Pentecost you want to go to Baptist methods go right ahead God call me to this message and in this message I'll die in this message I will rapture I'm not looking to go back to Pentecost why would I want to go back all that nonsense ah we've got the word of the hour a man that I want to tell myself surround Arnie and shut up I'm told of God I'm all dying to God I'm chosen of God I'm the bride of Jesus Christ himself shut up Oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Oh Lord so here we go on the palak wind of the king the men of valour are all around us they're fighting their own battles we've got everything we have native and yet we're still raging in our minds for some of you it's your past some of you have complexes because of your looks I understand that I'm not saying it to be funny I think I'm just about one of the ugliest preachers you'll ever see I have complexes about the way I preach I hate the way I preach hate it with a passion I think my style my mannerism there's one thing I like about my preaching that's when I walk out the door all the rest of it you can have it and Satan will always be sure to send people around you who say you preach like a Pentecostal you preach awful you preach that you preset why cuz Satan knows us and then your best friend is taking notes why he wants to talk to you later about it praise the Lord some of you may have complexes because of your financial situation or your family some of you have complexes because you've been married more than once Satan wants try to make you feel like a second-class citizen all the divorce folks up in heaven live over in the debt certain side of town and some of you make them feel that like shame on you lord have mercy there's many hundreds of people that there are here and many more that's here in the service it would probably overwhelming if we knew the complexes the fears and fiora teas I heard it twice this week exit from sisters in our church about always feeling inferior never really feeling loved feeling like they were apart you'd be surprised if the people who come up here and told me and asked me for prayer and say that they have a hard time relating to God loving them the way I preach it because her daddy didn't love him that way or the mother and they pulled that through themselves and when they hear love preached that God loves us so much they have a hard time processing it because the best friend is constantly telling them how long work for you he may love somebody I saw that but he don't love you doctor why it's the way we're made but won't it be wonderful wouldn't it be wonderful when the body change sweeps over on the earth all over there's all around the world some that were raised without a father some that were raised without a mother in the home some the commander divorce families and all just horrible horrible situations and still pack that in them and all of a sudden will be changed back to young men and young women and that part of us them complexes and all that would totally disappear and maybe people in our church or people in the message that you love them as far as loving them in the Lord but you've never really been compatible with them or never really been able to get close to them because of differences in this but if that day you imagine when we see him you'll start smiling and they'll start smiling and you'll know it's over we'll be more barrier of language no barrier of nationality or peculiarities that we clash Jim some say as it doesn't make us weird and demon-possessed we create an atmosphere by the way we are what we think about it what we feed on and sometimes our atmospheres clash one with another there's preachers of our class with I hate to I hate I don't intention Christ but just see might you just you just can't you know you just can't be chummy buddy pally frenzy when Z we gooey stuff you love them and they love you and they'd come to your rescue and I go to theirs myself maybe I'm weird I long for the day when you look upon millions and millions of people and they'll never be nothing there you know oddity no peculiarity you know what everyone we won't just be young every single big oh no sickness no runny nose no headaches nothing can all be gone and who's it for the overcomers blessed are they that overcome are you going to overcome or not this is what we must don't get your man friends cigarettes and drinkin all that's part of it that this is your greatest thing this is mine overcoming donning its batteries together dear father I realize this is not deep it's not something that they'll just do and all about for weeks and weeks on the end but yet another way I know it is to the deepest part of us that is our soul our spirit and our body so lord I thank you for the word tonight help me Lord I want to apply everything that's applicable to me I'm not just here to deliver it to them is one of the brothers today showed the text of several of us ministers when you was on the earth you broke the bread and gave it to the apostles and they in turn broke it and gave it to the people and brother Branham liken that to you giving the gospel to preachers and then the preachers turn back and give it to the people and then they send another quote along with it that when you broke the bread and more bread grew back and you broke that and more grew back you broke that and more grew back brother Brent said that was a significance he broke it into grew back broke it in and grew back and said that was a sign that you was the same yesterday today and forever Lord if we can only understand it receive it to not once again Jesus has given unworthy messenger disciple preacher fresh bread fresh hallelujah from the presence of God not something new not something different what's already been said that just for our particular needs Jesus broke it put it in a basket I come here to not let that basket in my heart now I've given it out to the people may they leave you're tonight father with basket falls in their hearts Lord Jesus help us I pray to find our enemy to know him and be able to deal with him in the proper manner lord I pray not only for the visible audience but for those that are streaming those that are archived at those will be on the podcast whatever

Lord and make us different what you want us to be but we ask for healing and soul spirit and body granted heart I don't know how close we are to Jerusalem but we must be getting close or ratting on the Pelican of the King we must be close Thank You Lord we want to step out that day and be conquers the herd the prophets say it several times this week one day when Caesar had took a great country we was going to have his great March he said I want a man to ride with me all the generals put on their best armor they trimmed the plumes of the feathers on their hats they stood at attention as Caesar came by one gentleman there was not a general he was not a great high-ranking guy and he walked by where Caesar was scars on his face all over his body he stopped him and said where did you get those scars he said fighting from my lord Caesar he said you get up here in the chariot and ride with me brother branham said I want to go that day and be a battle-scarred veteran God had mercy on the man who says a cut his hand on a sardine can and gets a citation lord help us I pray help us Lord Jesus that our scars will not destroy us got it hard your loving saints look up this way I mean it wants to be a battle scarred veteran for God many of you know Harry one of my sisters we got Fox bet when we were kids I've still got the scar right on my hand turns white whenever I press it that way you can see it from here all the way down to here my hand was laid wide open my grandmother was really good at telling tall tales some of the tall tales she used to tell us is about people getting rabies and going mad so on my way to the doctor I was telling mama daddy please mama if I go mad don't let me back the kids in my mind that was always going to happen my grandkids look at that other people look at it you know what I can I can rub that I can touch it you don't hurt no more it don't bleed no more that scar is a sign I'm healed when I've been something unspent when I was about 11 years olds that thing would have bled all my life so the doctor sewed it up we had to take the rabies shot seven shots up this out of her stomach seven at that side one a day for 14 days but that's a sign that I'm healed you can wallow in your scars wallow in your complexes in your fears or you can say scars mean I'm healed I refuse to let this control me I refuse to let these complexes control me

God for that this life is hard enough the way it is can you imagine having to walk alone without the Lord in your life without him being the guidepost and helping you through all the things of life I know I know people do it every day but I ain't one of them aren't you glad you ain't one of them I know people think it's small it's inferior when I was in China several years ago and preaching in those meetings there there were professors School teachers people of every occupation that you you can imagine and the type that the communist government thought would not search for God if you can educate them and give them this and that then that'll do away with the need of God yeah but I sat there and looked at them people and I thought there was still something in them even though they were professors teachers mathematicians and all of that but you can't satisfy the soul with mass amen you can't satis y it with algebra you can't satisfy it with money it's made to search for God when it's all said and done friends and when our heart is slowing down the blood pressure is dropping and we get ready to cross over all you own won't amount to nothing what you think you are won't amount to nothing what's going to really matter is you know him I'm glad I do don't you let's turn tonight to Matthew chapter 16 how are y'all we're well doing good doing good thanks for asking how he's happy to be in the house of the Lord ain't it wonderful to be a Christian just awesome to be a be a child of God Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 let's look tonight and see what we are a part of by the grace of the Lord the Lord Jesus saying these words and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church I will build my church now what is an organization an organization is a man-made system there are also many independent churches that are manmade churches yeah if Jesus don't build them they're not hisen now people can put his name on the sign that still don't mean he built that church because Jesus uses a particular type of material and this is the way you'll always know that Jesus founded whatever Church you're going to whatever one you're looking at or fellowshipping or whatever the traits of the Builder will be in there and you'll be able to identify it by its characteristics its traits its foundation and the building material that is used this is it Upon This Rock I will build my church so what was the rock of course The Rock was Revelation revelation of who he is not who he was so the churches of this day that are built by Jesus himself will be focusing on who and what he is in 2023 and shortly 2024 right so if they're built upon a memory of what he was 2,000 years ago that's not a church that Jesus Built right amen cuz Upon This Rock he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it acts 15 verse1 now some traits and characteristics of this church now a few years after Jesus starts building and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now notice certain men don't call them Brethren just calls them men certain men came down from Judea and taught the Brethren yeah so here was some men that were not Brethren but they were teaching the Brethren how in the world did that happen so you got man that's not even born again and somehow the Brethren let them among them and start teaching them wow that ought to be a double wow we ought to take warning an't that amazing certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you speak in tongues you ain't got to hold holy ghost or except you run and Shout you're not the bride I see then it was circumcision but it's changed in every age and it's happening in our ranks as well that we're making new evidences of what the bride is we've had so many bride revivals I can't even keep up with them but let me tell you what the bride Revival won't be the bride's Revival will not be hacking and splicing and cutting the word or the message and putting it together to fit your idea it won't be that now of course they were saying this because this was such an important thing in that day and this day we don't even think nothing about it so the evidence will change but that Spirit never changed except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no SM small no small dissension and disputation with them wow so Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question now you see because the scarecrow has been so effective for thousands of years if we would try to do this today in our message people would start screaming denomination denomination denomination you know why the scarecrow has started scaring Eagles now this is the way the original Church operated and the devil put up a scarecrow of the name of denomination and they started pulling some of these things out of there and Satan knew it would scare the elect from the 3 Century right on down and it still scared them notice in verse three and being brought on their way by the church they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and Elders wow Paul the prophet a church AG messenger had to be received by the church and by the apostles and the elders oh why didn't he get this attitude I don't care if y'all don't think I'm of God or not glory to God go on to Hell well that's the attitude a lot of the men message folks have I did say message folks not real Believers you see real message Believers know that brother bram's message is not something new on now it's a restoration to the original amen now you see a lot of message people do not believe that they can never believe a lot of the doctrines they do they could never stay home play tapes don't need preachers no more all that the reason they believe that is because they believe this message is something totally new and if you believe that tonight I pray to God you get the Holy Ghost before you leave this service cuz you ain't got it now cuz the Holy Ghost will never lead you to believe a lie because the prophet messenger come to return the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and the church said and they declared all sa that God had done for them I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray sister Wendy Asher has an aunt that has a real need and they want this prayer cloth so just hold that request in your heart as well as you pray over what you have need of heavenly father we so love you tonight oh I'm so glad to be back in church I'm so thankful when you saved me you saved me to go to church you saved me to sing you saved me to worship you saved me to pray you saved me to live right you saved me to Rejoice you saved me from heaven and you saved me from hell I don't worry about being lost cuz I didn't come from there and I ain't going going there how grateful We Are Tonight Lord Jesus for your mercy father as we approach your word tonight we're asking for your help we're asking dear God that you'd help me to get out of the way help the people to be able to enter in the service Lord they've worked today many of them and no doubt they're tired and would your presence just come and catch us up Lord father I know there's several that's sick and couldn't be with us in service tonight we ask that You' be mindful of them Lord I have this prayer cost in my hand for sister Wendy's Aunt you know all about this need and request and we believe you father that you're going to move for dear God we desire to be with all of our hearts one of those churches that has been turned back to the apostolic faith help us I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you you may be seated now I'm sure that you all believe already tonight that just because people say they are Apostolic does not mean that they are the original Apostolic anybody here ever belong to the UPC Church of God in Christ few of you Church of God in Christ one is Church of God the black side of that UPC thing probably nobody many of them claim to be Apostolic but basically what they preach is one God and they don't even have it correct and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I was at a funeral some time ago of an Apostolic man a family member close to someone of mine and the preacher which was Apostolic of course got up and every way that he could he tried to bring in Acts 238 and uh speaking in tongues evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and preaching this guy's funeral but also trying to get forth his Apostolic Doctrine now many of those Apostolic preachers they they are specifically known for acts 238 and a lot of them turn into preachers that carry an Acts and 238s so that's all they know how to do with that scripture is fight with it and they will fight you and they will get angry and they will get upset and they have no mercy whatsoever for someone that maybe God has never opened their understanding to that so they take their Axe and cut their heads off and if there's anything left they pull out both 38s and finish them off with that and as I sat there listening to that man's funeral and I thought you know I knew the man well and knew the man was a good man loved God with all of his heart but yet this preacher saw it as an opportunity to be able to convey once again their so-called Apostolic Doctrine but I had talked to some of those people years before about the message ah mentioned predestination serpent SE some of the different doctrines that we know the apostles actually preached and what I found was that those Apostolic people wasn't Apostolic at all they were Apostolic denomination so because they baptized in jesus' name and because they preach the tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you shout and this and that then you're true Apostolic no you're just Apostolic by name but there is a true Apostolic people on the face of the Earth today so true Apostolic people are built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets so the true Apostolic people are those that can tie their original Roots back to the church in the book of Acts which was what Jesus started himself now Jesus said himself on this rock I will build my church now it may be kind of offensive a little bit but as I said earlier every church that's built on every Church Corner between here and Memphis and back is not built by the Lord Jesus because Jesus could go in there and start just preaching a little bit about his word we'll say he would start in the Book of John and he might say something like this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and many might come on down to verse 14 and say and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth some of them might make it to the end of that and say amen and then we might bring Jesus over to St John 10 when Jesus would say I and my father are one amen we might bring him over to where Phillip said so Lord show us the father and he said Phillip have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am if you see me you see the father well right there a bunch of the trinitarians would fall out of their Pew would they and yet they claim to be following Jesus well Jesus was actually the one who said that and then we come over to the first church AG messenger that was the foundation stone that God began to build a lot of these Revelations on what he gave him and he would say something like this for without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh just in the justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles who did God God then we might come to the book of Titus where he said Hing to and the coming of the day of God in that day when the Lord Jesus will come himself you mean calling Jesus God not one of them but him Jesus wasn't one of the Gods in heaven he was the only one and we might move over to the Book of Revelation when John was carried up and he said I saw one and I saw a throne not three but I saw one throne and he that sat upon the throne was to look upon as a Jasper and a Sardis Stone which was the birth stones of the tribes of Israel so I wonder how many churches in the tri cities that the Lord Jesus would Acclaim that he himself started that church and it would be identification that all would know because the building material that church is built upon so it's built upon the Revelation then of who Jesus is in this age and yet many of them will take people down to the water and they'll say in obedience to the Commandment of the Lord Jesus I baptize you in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost so in other words you spiritually baptize them into the Catholic Church well glory to God I thought y'all was Apostolic here tonight so I wonder then how many of them that Jesus would stand up and say I did not build my church upon the teaching that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost well there'd be some more that'd get mad at Jesus and then others that would say well you know I I believe once in Grace always in Grace and once you get saved as a matter of fact this I was going hunting this last week and on and one of the brothers just telling me that he had Hunted been around a guy up there where we were some time before this and the guy was cussing I mean cussing everything off the hinges and the brother asked him he said uh what do you do he said I'm a licensed ordained minister oh my goodness so I doubt Jesus would want to put his arm around that dude and call him buddy wouldn't you so you can imagine then one church after another after another the Lord Jesus J would say you are not mine I never built this church as a matter of fact this one was built by this organization or this man or this or that or the other this is not even my church my name is not here my Revelation is not what built you it was built out of Envy or Strife or whatever more this is not my church it's going to be surprising when we get to the end of the way and a lot of people stand before the Lord and they will stand there sinking you know that I've done this and that and the other and the Lord Jesus will look at them and I know some of the brothers right now don't like it whenever preachers will still preach on Matthew 24:24 but I've got to because I'm a Full Gospel preacher and I believe in healings and signs and wonders and miracles but by no means do I believe that the bride's only identification is the miraculous because there's going to be all kinds of people that's going to stand before the Lord and say we cast out Devils we raise the Dead We heal the sick in your name come on church and they will absolutely be anointed I heard the prophet say it today it is the true anointing of the Holy Ghost but they are anointed falsely to the word so you mean the spirit of God would come upon people and anoint them fall ly to the word so you don't judge them by their signs or their miracles or how much they jump or dance or shout but what you judge them by is the word that includes me that includes every other preacher that includes every one of us and the church said am so the church then that Jesus is going to come for in the last days is going to be an Apostolic Bible believing church now keep in mind that God did not send brother brandom in order to replace our Bible but to make our Bible more real to us is that right is that the way you believe it and understand it so he did not come to sim brother brandom so that people would formulate their doctrines outside of the context of scripture and they would come up with all kinds of strange ideas which of course is going to be in every age but he would come right back cuz when he would be on the curtain of time and he saw his people only didn't see Paul's did not see Luther's did not see Wesley's but he saw his only and whenever he reconciled and he told the angel said if Paul's group goes in mine will and then those thousands I heard him say it today that there was hundreds of thousands of those people looked like there could have been millions that was there and they screamed out we are resting on that and they said one day Jesus will come to you and you will be judged and if you are accepted and you will be then we will go in on your teaching so that would be totally impossible for us to go in on brother brandom's teaching unless he was a word Prophet praise the Lord so Paul didn't say one thing and brother Ram say something else now he might have said it in a Kentucky way where Paul said it in his way but it's still the word of God now whatever the Lord started forming this church he knew of course that there would be Seven Ages it would be spread over seven dispensations and there would be seven manifestations of the spirit of God in the Book of Revelation it would be called the seven spirits of God but it would be seven manifestations of the same spirit of God each one of them would be represented by a horn on the Beast and then there would be an eye in the horn now these were actually the horns were the power on the earth which protected the Lamb's rights so in the first church age there was a horn which was under the lion anointing and there was an eye in the horn oh you're trying to get deep brother Donnie no I'm not I just want you to know where you're identified and where every age has been so a horn come up on there and that was the church that was the true Acts 2 church then in that horn was an eye so the eye represented the sear or the dispensation of light that was given to them so he saw seven horns and then he saw seven eyes an eye in each horn so it was the messenger of that age so the eye of the age catches the mind of God looks into the script of God catches the word of the day pulls it down into the horn and then the horn gets under the manifestation of that word you following me of what their word is for their day cuz we didn't know what our word was the Ephesian people didn't know what their word was the Samarian people pergamos saus Sardis Philadelphia and leoda we didn't know what our word was and every Church age message if you notice in the Book of Revelation unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write notice who the letter is addressed to it's not addressed to the denominational headquarters it's not sent to a bunch of Bishops that's going to tell everybody what they can do and cannot do come on church say Amen but who is the letter sent to it is sent to the church M messenger the angel of God of that day he is the eye on the horn so the eye gets the message direct from God then the eye comes right down and projects it down to the horn and then the horn protects the Lamb's rights in that day now we're talking about the bride's rights but also the Lamb of God has rights this is one thing we're called to do we're not called to be passive we're not called to let the world do whatever they want to do and people just say whatever they want to say and let's just s around and hold our peace and and be real quiet Paul didn't believe that Paul and Barnabas did not have no small dissension and disputation with those that was teaching contrary to the word of God they confronted them and said you're not saying the truth well come on now children this is what we are called to do we are called to protect the Lamb's rights in this leot to sin age now everybody in this age one of the most important things to them is what their rights so the gay rights and the you know this rights and that's right well that's fine if that's what they want to do but the Lamb of God also has rights he has a right to have a church he has a right to have a church filled with the Holy Ghost a church built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets is that right and he's not going to send Gabriel down to protect those rights but he's going to have men of God under the same anointing that the eye brought it I don't want to just repeat what brother random said I don't want to just repeat it like a tap recorder but I want to have the same spirit of God he had I want to operate under the same thing that's what I love when he writes it down pick up your pen and write in the spoken words original see that the bride not only has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word it's evident friends a lot of churches and a lot of preachers around this message are missing the mind of Christ notice the seven seal he said whenever the mind of Christ comes in that is the supernatural element so people can come to the message but it does not mean they get the immediate oh my the immediate deposit of the mind of Christ just when you hand them a book if they do not have the mind of Christ they'll never know what God wants done by that word but if you receive the mind of Christ with the message itself then you know what he wants done it's evident some folks still don't know what he wants done they think he wants us to argue and debate and make this little kingdom and that little kingdom that's not what he wants done with the word he wants us as preachers to preach the word and produce word first and Obey them scriptures lay hands on the sick I know some of the preachers in the message they're fighting laying hands on the sick and they say we're Beyond it we don't need it no more I'll guarantee you one thing we've still got a lot of sick folks around here and I'm going to still keep on go brother Donnie brother brandom got to a place he never had no more Visions I want you to show me that in the message I'll tell you when brother brandom stop having visions when he move into the other dimension you want to tell me the prophet stopped praying for people people and the prophet start having prayer line I want you to show me that where he said that himself what did he do he was still ministering to the body right before he left the Earth and that's what every godall man is called to do cast out Devils lay hands on the sick praise the Lord now notice if here in the chapter 15 again verse 5 but there arose up a certain set wow of the Pharisees which believed wow so you mean they still kept their old name on Pharisees that believed I guess my question would be believed what how could you be a believer and still want to be called a Pharisee or a sad you see I think some of y'all are sad you that it was needful to circumcise them how could they believe how could they be word born Christians and still believe you had to be circumcised In the Flesh they had no Revelation that the Holy Ghost was the tool of circumcision in the New Testament they had no idea it was still to do with this right here amen that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and the elders came together for to consider of this matter now notice they did not consider it denominational at all when questions raised up for the preachers to get together and try to resolve some of these issues come on wonder why that's so foreign to us come on now wonder why that's so strange and we're Apostolic are we really I wonder I wonder how many Apostolic churches we actually have in the message we have a lot of message churches but I wonder if they're Apostolic message churches you hear what some of them is preaching you can understand they're a long way from the doctrine of the Apostles verse 22 then pleased it the apostles and Elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas wow so what if we hear there's some kind of Doctrine that's broke out wherever and then some of the brothers get together and say you know what we we all need to go to timbuck two we'll say we need to make a trip to timbuck too and we need to straighten out some of stuff cuz this is going to affect us all boy can you imagine what some of the message people say Lord have mercy brother Donnie and brother Daryl and Brother David S or this brother they're going to 10 Buck too and they told me that they're going over there to straighten out a bunch of stuff who in the world they think they are Lord we're going into denomination that's the way they done they did in the Bible you know what I just realized I'm I'm I might I might be in the wrong church tonight I mean I'm preaching to people that look just like you two weeks ago the last time I preached But now y'all are looking at me like you don't know me come on brother oh my goodness so they send these people now with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas her name barabus and Silas Chief men among the Brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this matter the apostles and elders and Brethren send greetings unto the Brethren which are in the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and cissa for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us on now they went out from them but they went out without Authority you see this is the way God wanted to control Division and contention I wonder how many them guys when they heard Paul was in town shook like a leaf and the fall winds blowing they said Lord have mercy he's here oh good gracious I didn't realize h why because Paul said you think I've got this attitude they say oh his words are powerful but he's puny as we saying his body he said let him know that these same words I write when I get there I will have the same attitude sir you see that would have kind of helped Squatch down a lot of false Doctrine and a lot of false teachers why is it that all these things are breaking out around the world you know because the greatest most powerful Nation so-called in the world has a weak leader and Satan waits for weakness as Nations wait for weakness now watch for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so they actually came out from under the apostles and the elders and then they started troubling the people sewing Discord and false Doctrine and whatever more uh with the word subverting your souls subverting subverting your souls and saying that's what it said today oh well you know we really think it's not necessary to no longer quote the prophet well of course we believe the message in secret but you know I I'm kind of thinking that maybe maybe we should start a TV program or something like that not against anybody wants to do all that sort of thing but you know if if we're going to have a TV broadcast and maybe a radio broadcast and we're going to do this and other or maybe we're going to do a lot of Outreach meetings well that's good nothing wrong with that either unless of course you have to compromise What You Preach well since we're going to do that it wouldn't be fitting to you know to mention anything about so I won't say it but you all will understand so from this point on I won't say seventh angel or any preachers that come into our church I'll mention to them and ask them not to read quotes of subverting their souls so you understand what some preachers now begin to do they began to cut off the light they're supposed to filter down into the soul of the horn the body the body is supposed to absorb the light as it comes through the eye and the revelation of the hour it sets their soul on fire by that word but of course if you become ashamed you think it was just a mistake to Paul wrote to Timothy and said don't be ashamed of me as his messenger there must have been something already moving among them what do we have to actually get up and say Paul I mean really he's got a pretty bad record you know this guy was a murderer can you imagine in that day now of course we pick up our Bible today and we read it as a holy word of God but in that day it was simply books or letters written by this man that was so strange and bizarre that he said he was carried up to the third heaven whoever heard of such a thing and he said women couldn't even preach my Lord what in the world's a matter with him and he even wrote In the book of Romans that men were sleeping with men and women sleeping with women and he said those that do it are worthy of damnation and I say the same [Applause] thing I heard some of the guys up in the lodge where we were staying out in the hunting trip talking about a gay Pastor I thought oh my Lord make me sick at my stomach gay Pastor can you imagine can you imagine a man being that blind can you imagine people being so foolish they would set under such when God's word will condemn them oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I must have got a little raise of that light it come down on me and hit me and made me kind of Li you like or something kind of rough let me let me let me cut off that light and say oh how is everybody this is the greatest day of your life oh boy come on now some of you that would feed on that slop that's all it is slop fit for Hogs I want you to notice how that Luke whenever he writes this in chapter 15: 24 it said for as much as we have heard that certain went out from us now you see they were not sent they just went amen it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord well that's a miracle within itself ain't it to send chosen men unto you as our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas not his scar it now Judas and isus who shall also tell you the same things by mouth so now they notice the difference between these men and the others the others went but weren't sent these went but were set the others didn't have a message that coincided with what the apostles was preaching but these were the voices echoing the truth of what the apostles said now they didn't just send Paul and Barnabas but they sent these other brothers who had been around even longer you see friend a lot of the thing that Satan has wanted to do is to try to corrupt us away from this original Apostolic order and it gives him more Liberty to do whatever he wants to do all people have to say is they feel led I challenge any person here any person listen to me tonight around the world I challenge any preacher to show me where the words feel led all right in the book of Acts where any preacher felt led to go do this or do that or the other contrary to God's scripture I'll be waiting but I ain't going to stop preaching till I get it I'm just going to go and preach now notice we have sent ah so you mean the church sent wow hope it's hard for me to say this brother Joel Brown's had a burden on his heart to do something for the community where he was raised up and he come and talk to me about it and want me to pray with him of course he follow the leading of the Lord and God would be with him and wed my advice lesson so it so happens that there's a church not too far from this community where brother Joel was feeling and I told him brother Joel the first thing you need to do of course after praying about it is contact the brother in that area right Joel I said don't you go in there and try to start something different than what he's got said why would you tell him that because I think Bible I think Apostolic that's the way they did you never find them coming in come on children now preach with me you don't find it in the Bible with them going along with men who done something contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets so I said go in and let the brother know you're not there trying to undercut him but you've got a burden for your your black Community where you were raised because many of them of course still live in their own community and may not go to some of the white churches yet or whatever more and he just wanted to go see is there somebody there Lord is there somebody there said but brother Joel the thing of it is you don't want to be like brother random brother random went to India and had hard no churches to support him all those people come to God and he said whenever he come back he said probably nearly every one of them went back to the siks the James the Buddhist because there was no church to s send them to so I said go there and talk to that Pastor which brother Joel did so and the brother actually said well you can have our church if you wish to if you want to use it for outreach whatever and I thought praise God that that's that's an awesome way to do it and brother Joel said well maybe not maybe we just you know get a building and I tell them I said where you going to have it I said I hadn't thought about that said well you going to use for PA well I hadn't thought about that well you see whenever you've got men that are experienced and you're going to start a work work it's foolish so foolish not to ask the men of God who's been laboring for decades it shows scriptural ignorance in the minds of so many people as I said I wonder how many Apostolic message churches we have thank you Jesus y'all want me to go on another hunting trip this week is any place say we can go brother Danel notice now in verse in verse 40 and Paul chose Silas and departed because he felt led and he felt led and and uh Silas felt led Paul CH Silas and departed so do you understand what would happen in that day if a man would feel lad to go out and start a church or do whatever and they would go to the local church and say hey he come talk to you are you all working with this is this a work together with you and if they would have said no real Apostolic Believers would had nothing to do with it right come on message people will read your Bible now remember from this night forward every one of you is going to be held accountable and you will stand before the Lord God himself and these scriptures right here that you've seen on this screen will be on Heaven's screen yeah not only you visible but those of you that are streaming and if I'm taken from the earth and people go back and archive it them too cuz this is God's word not mine and he went through Syria and Sicilia confirming the churches chapter 16:4 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the oh no decrees I mean y'all still believe your Bible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of who ordained of the Apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem wow verse five and so oh so here's the way New Testament churches expanded and started and so were the church is established notice and how many faiths Presbyterian Faith Church of Christ Faith Church of God faith one God faith two God faith three God faith there was one Faith well there's truly still is just one true faith can I go a bit farther thank you chapter 20 verse 17 and from myus he sent to Ephesus now this is Paul as he's journeying through he sent to Ephesus and he called the Elders of the church wow so you mean the prophet of the age is going through an area and he would not even pass through that area Harry until he called the Elders of the church and wanted to meet with them chapter 21: 18 and the day following Paul went in with us into James and all the elders were present and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had WR among the Gentiles by his ministry 1 Corinthians 4:17 for this cause have I sent unto you osthus you mean Paul sent another preacher okay now some of y'all buckle up okay put your shoulder harness on your seat belt your crash helmet and everything before brother Ron Spencer ever started pastoring I sent him on a mission get your handkerchief out and wave it by that person by You Phantom phanom you don't believe me ask him as a matter of fact we was talking about long ago he said you remember when you sent me to certain certain place I said yes sir I remember that brother Jim bab went with him they had some Great Fellowship until they started talking about the different football teams that they liked and then they nearly had a fallen out it didn't last long now can you imagine brother Ron Spencer being able to be sent somewhere come on now well glory to God it's either getting awful hot in here or I'm feeling the pressure notice and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had wrote among him among the Gentiles now he jumps over here First Corinthians speaking about now what he do have i s unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord and shall bring into you remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I have taught everywhere in every Church wow you mean to tell me that Timothy then whenever he would go in and preach the message and he would actually preach about the messenger and talk about the messenger to the people and say now I want to remind you now brother Paul you remember how he lived now brother Paul you remember you imagine people say now what in the world is he doing referring to some man what in the world is he doing talking about some man oh my good people say I cannot believe you all stand up and quote a man well what's the difference between us quoting the Vindicated prophet and you quoting the smiley preacher from t what's the differ that El standing up here preaching and you quoting the 700 Club or The 500 Club or the 200 Club you're going to quote somebody I'm just GL I'm quoting the right body amen I'm not ashamed of this message know of this [Applause] messeng 2 Corinthians 8:16 but thanks be to God which put the same Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for you for for indeed he accepted the exhortation being more forward of his own court and he went unto you we have sent with him the brother my goodness so you mean men of God actually felt they could influence others and they would go because these men of God hey why don't some of you Brothers go down to a jail over there why don't you do this what you want to do something for the Lord some young preachers want to preach and where a lot of them want to start out preaching before 500 yeah they want to stand up so why don't you go to the nursing home oh no no no I'm too nervous to go over a nursing home if God's called you you'll start in a hog lot if that's where you have to start if you've got to start down out with one woman Jesus wasn't too big to go to one woman anytime a preacher is too big to go to one woman he's too big for his britches amen if you're a called of God you'll preach in a pig lot you'll preach wherever God sent you because it's burning inside of your soul you ain't preaching for an offering you ain't preaching for a crowd you're preaching because God himself called you to do it now can you imagine if brother Joel Brown moved on his heart whenever they start having Services maybe he's already started having some and the brother from that area would call me and say Hey brother Donnie brother Joel Brown from your church is coming up here and he's doing this this or this you know anything about it and brother Joel didn't think it necessary of course to come to me and I would have to say no sir I don't I don't know one thing about it so I don't know exactly what verse said he might use but more than likely Sunday brother Joel is going to be his text why cuz he don't know brother Joel he want alpam under the headship of his pastor [Music] but now if the brother's concerned and he ain't call me cuz he trusts him you imagine when say oh yeah done talk to Brother D okay that's good that's exactly right oh you say that's a denominational that's the Bible that's God's protocol but again friends people don't believe what the prophet told they do not believe what he said that God called ministers are God's commanding officers they simply don't believe it and do you realize your unbelief will keep you out of the Rapture you think it matters to God which scripture you disbelieve whether it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 I want to believe all of them don't you brother amen boy it seems like I've been preaching for three days is it that long man a lot God help me tomorrow notice we have sent him the brother whose praises and the gospel throughout all the churches not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace what a recommendation so the churches was in such Unison they said brother Paul We believe this young brother he'd be a blessing to you and a help to you and a strength to you so it wasn't just I feel L I feel L I feel L I feel L but the church has recommended this brother and Paul so honored the way the churches felt about it he said I believe I'll take him with us all these scriptures of will be available for you if you'd like to read them yourself this is not a king Donnie version It's the King James that's right I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible maybe you'd spend more time reading your Bible instead of on Facebook and Tik Tok and twick twack and everything else in the world and social media spend a little time in Social mediating with God you might know your Bible a little better Philippians 2:25 yet I suppose it necessary to send to you aphroditus and companion and labor and fellow Soldier but your messenger he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness don't you understand what this did this eliminated so much false [Music] prophets they would not let them in their pulpit without [Music] recommendation for he longed after you all and was full of Heaven is because that he had heard that ye had heard he had been sick for indeed he was sick and N to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also amen won't you look at this prophet of the age he needed men around him that had inferior Ministries and he did not feel threatened he needed men that could come he knew he wasn't going to live forever he knew in order for the message to live there had to be other men of God that would pack that same message oh I heard brother man said today things that ought to be and he's preaching that last message I if you knew it or not but that Assembly of God and he said I know I'm I know I'll go on I oil pass something like that and he said go on and these young men I used to fulfill that scripture not anymore since I'm an old man but these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus tape players don't have legs Church come on MP3 players don't have legs Shaman don't have legs a tape player can't baptize you a tape player cannot sit there and cons so you God call men is what God ordained to pack this word he's never changed it and that's what we believe because we are original Apostolic [Applause] Believers praise God can you imagine what this recommendation meant now for a pafitis to the church I send him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may Rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore so what about hus fius and some of those others that he wrote their name in the Bible now they too were preachers but they were preachers without a recommendation oh my they were preachers that Paul warned the flock about now no doubt there some dumb sheep that went and hurt him just out of curiosity but if they really believed this man was a servant of God you imagine ever darking in a door where amus was preaching or felius was preaching and Paul said their Doctrine does eat like a canker which is cancer and a corruption that starts in on the body and the skin begins to die word used for a couple different medical terms there and Paul would liken their Doctrine and their preaching to the rottening of the Flesh and the limbs would fall off ain't a saying of God full of the Holy Ghost going to sit and hear amanus preaching nothing why wasn't recommended by the church receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such and reputation fimon 1 ver10 I beseech you beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him wow so if some other man raises up glory to God I'll tell you one thing I believe the word too hallelujah amen thank you Jesus and Paul didn't recommend him so it show up at Corinth or show up wherever wonder what them people would think and where where's your recommendation oh Lord to God I don't need no recommend Hallelujah I feel that oh [Music] my friend should not believe some of the trash and the nonsense that's going on around our message people with some of their so-called gifts prophesying for this man to leave his wife and marry this man's wife and someone sometime ago a woman standing up and speaking in tongues and interpreting or prophesying or whatever you want to call it I've got a different name for it yeah the Lord I'm calling for a trim I'm calling for a trim so the sisters of the church went home and got their scissors and they started trimming well that's what the Lord said he wanted not my God beels above the devil well come on now well Hallelujah how do we judge prophecy oh I felt it we don't judge it by feeling we judge it by the word and if it don't come to pass it ain't the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my notice in Jude chapter one only one chapter of course verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ notice how now Jude is the Foster brother brother of the Lord Jesus notice how Jude is exhorting the people to Remember The Words which were spoken by the Apostle as if though it was the holy word of God wow how many believes the apostles Doctrine is important yes sir brother how many be honest and say well to be honest with you I'm not sure how much of the message churches even go with that anymore I'll raise my hands whether you got enough courage to or not I can guarantee you it's so sad when you look at it oh my brother Donnie we're in the age of the Prophet The Apostles don't even matter no more really well Jesus certainly disagrees with you that's right because he built his City in heaven in a reflection of the earth Revelation 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb yes so you mean when you get there and you're going to live in that City for eternity you're going to see them 12 names of them Apostles now you see the Lord Jesus want he said brother brandom did not go in there and tire at TH Foundation say now wait a minute I made a mistake here I shouldn't have never built the city on the foundation of the Apostles I should have just buil on brother Bram alone and have brother Ram's name there he makes no mistakes so what did Brother Brandon be built upon the doctrine and the teaching of the Apostles and Jesus Christ was so confident that he could build the church on it that he himself allowed himself to be the first stone laid on that foundation and then you and I are given the privilege to be laid by him on that same Foundation that's right let's stand praise the Lord and the church said how many wants our church to be a Bible believing Apostolic Church not UPC not Church of God in Christ not any of these other denominational things but a Bible believing Church oh my hallelujah thank you Father thank you Father you see in reality friends a man a preacher which cannot be led and cannot recognize headship himself is not a leader he is a dictator you look at the difference between Saul and David Saul could not be corrected Saul could not admit he was wrong he couldn't follow directions so therefore he could not be LED under the teachings of the prophet Samuel and look he becomes so stubborn so hard-headed he didn't want to be told what to do oh yeah God said this I've done what God Said but look at David boy he had his mistakes didn't he but he knew how to repent amen and he could do it not because of act but because he genuinely meant it that's right he could be led to repentance he could be led to saying he was wrong he could be led and God even hundreds of years later God was still referring back to David and he said for my servant David's sake for my servant David's sake hundreds of years after he was gone but his legacy meant so much to God oh may God help us we can be that kind of Christians let's bow our heads if you would praise the Lord now maybe you're here tonight and you say actually brother Donnie I didn't realize the Bible said all that well you probably didn't because you're not called to study the word like a preacher would and God knows that so maybe you didn't understand maybe you didn't see it maybe you didn't know it was there but after tonight you say my I want to be that kind of believer I want my heart my life my home our church to be established upon the doctrine the teaching of the Apostles that original word because I truly believe God sent his Prophet to restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers that's right the apostolic fathers praise God how many wants our church to be that kind of a church would you just raise your hand before God and the angels are watching you the Lord Jesus is watching you and demons are watching so remember we're making our stand we want to be a Bible believing Church oh yeah a message sure oh absolutely with all of our hearts yes we want to believe it teach it walk it obey it praise the Lord heavenly father as we lift our hands to you tonight dear God in your presence I thank you Lord for the Bible I realize Lord Jesus some of our brothers and sisters still in parts of Africa India different parts of the world still don't have a personal Bible I've seen some pictures of some just a few days ago getting their own Bible for the first time we have them laying in our cars laying in our homes we have access to them all of us that have a smartphone have access to them and how much do we read them how I thank you for the Bible and Lord how we thank you tonight for the message of the hour amen that points us right back to the Bible the devil tried to lay a trap for your Prophet one day a man come to the prophet and said now now brother brandham you've had so much experience with God so many visions and so on you would be qualified to write your own Bible now he said the man i' have been trying to catch me a little and I said well brother that might be so but that couldn't be what God would want because he said there would be NE added to this word I remember brother Charlie Cox telling me one time that when brother brandham was there at their house and brother Char had been reading a message book and he had his Bible laying there on a table and he had just laid that message book over on top of the Bible brother brandham saw it went over and picked it up and laid the Bible on top of the message book said brother Charlie don't ever put anything before the word of God Lord God I pray our people will always believe that I pray your people around the world will always have that attitude to love the word to love their scriptures to read them oh Jesus we love you father we don't want to just baptize in your name say we're Apostolic we're one God but we want to be able to take the founding of a new church or the advancing of the kingdom of God brothers that would go out of our assembly I don't believe you call preachers just to set them all under a preacher the rest of their life but they may be sitting there for years to get training so they can be able to go out maybe start other works or missionary or whatever more more but Lord if they follow the apostolic pattern they will not have to sneak around behind the pastor's back like a snake in the grass thank you Lord cuz if they would have done that in the days of Paul they would have got no recommendation help us father What a Sad thing it is many churches will crumble because they aren't built on the revelation of your word I didn't start this church Lord it was started years ago on rone Hill I thank you for those who started it Lord Lord the Yan's family and the Phillips family and many of them dear God their parents and grandparents and we thank you for them they were the Pioneers that started it then move moved it over to Happy Valley and Lord they changed the name of it when it moved from Ron Hill to Happy Valley because they didn't figure that Ron Hill would quite fit the name anymore with them being at Happy Valley sort of the way I looked at it whenever we left Happy Valley I didn't figure it'd be fitting since we're sitting in Buffalo Valley to call it happy valley so I figured it's time for a change Lord God just because we change the name of the church don't mean we change what we stand for as a matter of fact I'm more determined now to disrupt the kingdom of Hell than I've ever been in my life hallelujah hallelujah we're more determined dear God to stand for your gospel stand for your truths cast out Devils heal the sick I'm more determined dear God to pray for the sick people people I'm more determined to pray for folks with cancer than I've ever been in my entire life I am by no means discouraged I am by no means down or weary Satan thought he would get my face but he better thinkink again he thought he would discourage us but he better think again we are not discouraged we are encouraged we are encouraged in the word we're encouraged in Your Great Name in your great power father we're looking for great things to happen among us we've seen great things but we are looking for greater and by greater I don't necessarily mean more emotion I mean a greater manifestation of your person and when I say greater I don't mean dead a lot of folks consider greater with dead I don't think it's going to be dead I don't think we're going to stop worshiping we ain't going to stop praising we ain't going to stop singing we're not going to stop clapping our hands I think we ought to have a shout we ought to have the shout of the king among us now more than ever before because your word is manifesting itself amen Lord God prove yourself Among Us Jesus we've already seen you heal cancer we saw sister Ruth Garden Lord I believe with all of my heart here several months ago she lay there dear God lifeless but after prayer the spirit of God brought our sister back we've seen you do so many things among us already Lord God that only fertilizes our faith to believe you've got wonderful things if we can only stay small and stay humble Lord God help us I pray amen thank you Father how many wants that with all your heart amen friends let me show you the difference difference between some of the arrogance that goes around some of the message preachers I a god taken me to hunt this week and I almost missed the deer that the Lord give me because the guide hadn't called me and I thought well it's too late for me to go brother Daniel called anyway Fally worked it out where I could this guy I get in his truck and he's getting there maybe had even went a mile we've talked about the Lord he's a saved man been a Sunday school teacher youth leader things like that about 64 years old and he said D already told me said my my son's a pastor 32 years old and he said I can tell from talking to you you're a man of God your experience and handling the word what advice would you give to my son I thought as as I sat there m Jo my heart's I I I I was so sad because I thought of the message preachers that could ask their Elders similar things but won't even do it won't even come to Men of God that have labored in the word and already forgotten more than some of them will ever even know and won't even humble thems to come the Servants of God and say help me man of God I've got a burden on my heart to do this to do that do you see anything wrong with it do you see anything wrong in my Ministry look at me servant of God pray with me help me advise me yeah and I thought how sad I'm not sure if he was a Baptist or Methodist whatever but all I know is we talked about the Lord and hugged one another's neck and shed tears I thought how pitiful that a man like this that knows nothing about the message of Malachi 4 and yet but have more humility about him don't even know what I believe and some of the message people that have watched you for years and years yeah what'd you tell him brother Donnie I said my advice to him would be this stay humble stay little don't never become big in his own eyes and become arrogant and proud and I said if he will stay that way God will be able to use him he said 'w he's always been humbled and got a real good spirit I said that's great but I said tell him that I said to keep it because Solomon the man of God that built the Great temple of God when he got older he also built this Temple and that Temple and another Temple and another Temple for idol worship the very same man that built the house of God because he got arrogant and proud God God's blessed us and give us a nice place to worship don't we thank him for it than Lord but let's not get arrogant let's not get proud and say boy our church is Big our church is our church let's stay small and little and see what he'll do let's not ask people come and see our church let's tell them come and see our Jesus yeah amen amen come and see our Jesus don't come and see our pastor come and see our youth choir Bo I tell you why sister Emma is doing such a great job with our young people and our boy you ought to see our youth group my goodness brother Rob and brother Joe and this brother oh just just come and see our youth group let's tell them to come and see our Jesus are youth leaders can't change your heart I can't change their hearts only Jesus can change our hearts amen hallelujah sing something for us s praise the Lord you imagine what brother Brandon would be able to say tonight if he'd walk in this church and say my those of you that have been to brandham Tabernacle you know how small that it is how humble how little brother brandham wanted to build a bigger church but the people didn't want to and one of the brothers that was on the board said that after the people voted not to do it brother brandham told them that's what they think of my Ministry but because the church voted to do so he stayed right there but I've often wondered what it would have been if they would have been of the right mind you see a Visionary is always one of the most misunderstood preachers that there is in the ministry because most everybody just wants to keep his scrunch down don't grow don't do this don't do that oh no oh no it's our for and no more but the Visionary that says what about tomorrow if there is another 10 years or 5 years what will we do what are we going to do with our young people what are we going to give to them oh my we don't want to just give them a nice building we don't want to give you a place to play basketball we want to give you a place where you can be born again but I also want to give you a place where you can come together with your own and we can invite the youth from North Carolina South Carolina Georgia it's absolutely amazing the youth services that we've had I'm hearing from pastors I'm hearing from youth churches or youth leaders rather some of these other churches when I was here when brother Matt was here how many of the youth from South Carolina North Carolina Georgia sit outside and say thank you brother Donnie for letting us come praise God so you see this ain't just for us this ain't just for us hallelujah and it won't be if we'll stay little and stay small how many wants to be that way oh Jesus we love you Lord Jesus Use Me Jesus use me let's sing it together before we go I'm sorry I have you a little bit long tonight we say Brother Don but I'm not a preacher and I I've never even spoken tongues I don't get up on the floor and dance and I understand my little daughter that just stepped be on the curtain of time I never recall ever hearing her speaking tongues I seen her one time on a video where she was jumping can't recall that I ever saw her shout her higher down I can't recall that I ever saw her cast out a devil or do things that people think is great but I have never seen a lay member whose life touched so many people from around the world I just keep hearing about and I say Lord have mercy Lord have mercy you see the Lord told me months and months ago that we was going to see his glory and he told me that it would be marvelous in our eyes but I totally misunderstood what he meant I just knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and our dedication Services when all the saints of God was praying and Saints from around the world were praying I just knew I just knew beyond a sh of doubt she's going to jump out of that wheelchair and run over this whole place and we was going to tear this church down and have to build another one we all shouted it down but that wasn't what he me at all so you see sisters even you can be great just live your life for what the Lord wants you to be your brothers that'll never preach you never know who you're affected but brother Donnie everybody may not know me the way they do sister cuz she was your daughter I know that but what if you influence one soul and they come to the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet said that name that individual will be identified with you for eternity forever each of of you have a work for God do it do it let's sing it together come we just worship a little while we go dear I be your witness if you will help my weakness help me Jesus I know that I'm worthy Lord for the oh sing it to him now with all your heart by eyes face I [Applause] see upon upon the cross of

they found a a growth and she can't even get in to get a a second MRI with contrast up until January so she's having these things multiple times during the day and it's sort of like that she passes

inspired by somebody and we know inspiration comes from God so it was God inspiring that person to sing that you will be here with me so why are you singing hallelujah because we're gonna be there with him amen amen praise the Lord we are happy to be here tonight we certainly appreciate your pastor in his absence amen wonderful man of God we appreciate all of you to come out we bring greetings from back home in South Carolina from pastor and church family amen most of all Jesus is here how many brother liquefier with them now I don't believe in going to church without a fire hallelujah I believe in having a burning hallelujah I don't believe in just coming and sitting on the Pew but I believe in a burning we need to have a burn in the night man we need to let the fire loose in the place tonight hallelujah that's why we call me man to see Jesus amen and I believe that if we come in our attitudes of right God can't help but show up hallelujah so if you do your part he'll automatically do his part you're a prophet of God says that the signs and wonders automatically follow the believer you don't have to do that special they automatically follow you now I don't know about you but I got some I got some miracles behind me hallelujah I got some blessings behind me they just following me waiting for me to realize oh yeah what God is gonna do in my life let me let me read a scripture or something amen we started appreciating the worst of all man stop right there let's get into the word it man let's have a word of Prayer and then we'll get into the word tonight if you have an unspoken question you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand they may let's just pray Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you for the grace that you've given Lord knowing that we've done nothing to deserve it but it's all your choosing Lord and follow we didn't seek after you but you salt us because you knew who we were before the foundation of the world and Lord as you see each and every hand lifted most of all you see the hearts that I open unto you tonight father we pray that you fill our cups again fill us afresh Lord with your presence your power Lord God and and let the word find good ground tonight Lord that it will bring forth one hundredfold nor God and let the fruit in our lives Lord speak for itself and Lord I would just ask father you walk the house in this church like you've done so many times Lord and then all flesh get out of the way Lord for this service is about you and you alone and Lord many of us were here with vessels and we've been in church a long time but the service is all about you our lives are all about you but whatever we can contribute to the kingdom of God it's all about you so father we thank you Father for a chance to be used by you and Lord we just pray you have your way in us in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ forgive us our sins and trespasses in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that church say Amen Amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Romans the ninth chapter thank you brother Louie don't waste no time dude he must he must know what's about to happen hallelujah everybody can't fight with a jacket on Romans nine good the signal buddy brother Joel back there how they love you romans nine and um let's just read um they started verse nine Romans nine and nine and then we're gonna go to first Peter one Romans nine and nine the Bible says for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one when even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated a man first Peter one first Peter one familiar verses of Scripture to make a short let's stop reading at verse sinks first Peter one and six the Bible says wherein you greatly rejoice who not though now for a season if need be ye are in heaven is through metaphor temptation that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ they made me the Lord of the Blessed reading of his word you can have your seats and as you sit I want to turn over to Psalms 37 I want to read these verses of scriptures because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get back to him again Psalms 37 at verse 39 the Bible says but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble Amen praise the Lord you know we have so many precious promises that God has given us and I and I want you to understand that every promise that God has given is already ours amen then all we have to do is take God at His Word he meant you know because God will back up whatever he said and tonight I want to say it like this then I have something very tasty tonight hallelujah I have something very good for the believer tonight amen because when God starts dealing with me about it I just start smiling hallelujah you know ideas when God reveals something to you it just makes you feel good hallelujah sometimes you you can't explain it you just riding down in the car and you begin to think about what God is it's expressing to you and it's work and you just start smiling and the person in the next car they may be all mad going to work and they look over at you and they see somebody doing this because you're thinking about what God has revealed to you hallelujah and let me say it like this whatever God has revealed to you if his in his word it's a promise who a car accident can take it away a hurricane came take it away a blizzard came taking away my ice storm can't take it away if God promised it and he revealed it to you he's yours oh yeah and that's what we need to do is take God at His Word and you know tonight my subject is a man subject inspiration what if you want to call it take it out of you main but my sucker tonight is trouble huh Leah brings purpose amen and you know that we are people that don't like trouble we don't like to be tried we don't like to be tested but let me tell you something that's God's Way God loves to put us to a test God loves to bring trouble that way because the troubles in your life makes God come on the scene hallelujah and without no trouble God wouldn't be able to express himself hallelujah come on church I tell you I got something tasty for you tonight because if you going through something there's a purpose behind so we need to acknowledge this one thing everything every trouble that we go through every child we go through every situation every tribulation is always not the devil booyah we don't snatch it back from him tonight now I think some of you notice hallelujah I may have said this before but you know I had cancer in my brain whoo yeah and a very tender age and cancer in my brain but you know what the devil gets no credit because there was a purpose for that trouble coming in my life for the brand hallelujah amen it was a total devil to see how strong he was what cancer could do now there was one thing one purpose only hallelujah because when cancer came cancer was the only thing that could awaken the purpose of God [Applause] God's had to see glory God had to sin some trouble in my life why because there was a hidden purpose T oh yeah so I was all I wanted to be a football player hallelujah all I wanted to be a the next Herschel Walker whatever you want to call it holy you know a lot of us had dreams and we had aspirations and different things we wanted to do and God began to see his trouble in your life you know why because you were on the wrong path so God had to shake up your path he had to shake up your journey he had to send some trouble why because he had a purpose and I want you to understand hallelujah that there's something down and you that nobody else can see but God and it may look like this person is that person may have seen but no maybe God is doing something job look like hallelujah he had done something wrong to his friends but no God was up to something God sent that trouble hellooo and what I love about hallelujah God told the devil where to go no keep this up I might have a praise dance up in here [Applause] hallelujah but she knows attended it in church denomination way of thinking we think that when we go through something or people think that when you go through something this it's like oh why me he and hey why am I going through this and you know what I opposed to be your son because you are his son his daughter he sees the trouble because there's something called a promise call for me you something called adoption and you never get there unless you're proven you'll never get there unless you're tested you'll never get there unless God who you shows the enemy that you are a son you are a dog hallelujah so you know me in the hospital going through all that I'm going through and and I'm thinking you know at that time I wanted to play football and what's going on but God knew that there was something down inside that had to be awakened and cancer was the only thing that could trouble it wow that's some things in Darwin in his church tonight and God has sick some trouble to awaken was there ho and you know by that falling upon me and isn't it put my family under the stress and put my momma under the stress but there was something that was about to happen I see I want you to understand this church that when trouble comes if you are a saint of God with trouble comes if you are a saint of God what that trouble does that trouble is a challenge to the supernatural not only don't believe they don't believe the trouble are you gonna believe the supernatural God because the only thing cancer did cancer awakened a revelation that was down inside of me called Jehovah Rapha and without that cancer I'd never know he was a healer now what are you going through and what is God trying to awaken in your life hallelujah you know sometimes chaos is the will of God hooya sometimes when they look like things are completely out of oil in your life it's God doing something yeah and some of you looking like look let me like huh well let me ask you something who would you rather get that credit to God or the devil because if you give that to the devil what you're saying is that the devil has his hand on me huh and the prophet of God said if you have the Holy Ghost Satan can't make you do anything you have to surrender your will to him oh yeah then the prophet of god said if satan could make you do anything with you having the Holy Ghost he says he has to be your brother that me he's had to get back there where God at and say now I want you to do this but that's not according to the scripture according to the scripture hallelujah he says hey devil what you doing he say I'm going to and fro he says hey have you could still look at God sending the trouble he says hey have you considered my servant job and the devil says of course I have but you got a heads around him I can't get tall don't you know trouble can't get to you unless God allows it [Applause] cows can't come to your doorstep unless God allows it Tom okay come to your children trouble can't come to your wife trouble can't come to your husband Tommy can't come to your church your job your family whatever years unless God allows it you know we do we stupid Satan's power we're stripping him tonight because he's not as powerful as we made him to be only power he has is perversion and you know perversion is perversion is taking was already established and twisting it and just in case you didn't realize Satan doesn't even have his own vocabulary he has to take what God has already spoken he has to take what God has already spoken and twist it that's why he came to even say has God said because there's only one author of the word whoo yeah in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the word became fish Satan doesn't even have his own vocabulary he's a pervert and he comes and he says has God said if thou be in all these things all he's doing is taking what God has already presented he's trying to make trouble out of it but let's catch this one thing I want you to realize before you go from anything before you go through any test let's look at how God thinks about it let's look at job for a second before job went through that test oh yeah before he went through that trial Satan said yeah I wanted them I wasn't get to him but I can't you got heads around and then he says hey let me get a hold of them that this is what the trouble is all about he says let me get a hold of him and I guarantee you he'll crush you to your face now I wonder what you doing when you going through your trouble you could be failing the test by the way you act when you're going through your troubles now no we all act different hallelujah but you know hallelujah when I'm on the airplane I like to try to take that I like to try to take the the behavior or the make up of the pilot because they know what they bite the fly into think hear the radio they can hear from the on the tower all these different things about how far is gonna be out so when they get to the trouble they take up some time they out there playing English Connect for talk to being worried about the trouble because they have a destination and they believe they're gonna get there huh but you know for us some of us who are back there behind the seat those of us who are behind the seat when we get in that plane it I've even heard people call that Jesus in those times people that don't go to church people that anything about the Lord just a little bit of trouble there but those violence you know those pilots are doing they're just coasting on through they don't even put their hands on the control they keep it in autopilot and you know what our problem is some of us want to put our hands on the steering wheel but tonight I want everybody to put it back in Jesus hands let's put everything back on autopilot huh let's put everything back old dust head the Lord hooyah let's stop trying to do it ourselves and just say god I'm depending on you because faith is a very powerful element and you will never come through a storm if you don't have any faith oh yeah and you know Hurley the pilot may be flying the plane but once that door closes me and him got the same face y'all realize that once that doors close and everybody get up in there you got equal faith cuz the door is closed what's measuring the faith everybody's in the same vehicle everybody's going to the same place everybody's at the same altitude haruya so the pilot can come to me and say I got more faith in you I say prove it what makes it right greater than mine is it the stripes on his shirt no dang don't do it see according to the vehicle with the same now let me drop something on you Church hallelujah you know God sent us a prophet and God gave him a vehicle to preach call the Word of God oh yeah and you know there was a woman in Memphis Tennessee who said I'm just like that suit of mine now where is my Elisha she found her place in the scripture hallelujah where she could see one part of the word and she said if I'm this part of the world where is the rest of Who I am the Prophet said is the word seeing the word booyah she turns when you find yourself in troubles you need to find yourself in the scripture and what made that story so special was because the prophet of God said haruya that the shooter might and the Prophet Elisha were of the same caliber we were all the same caliber so let me let me say it t like this church the Bible says that the word came to a prophet haruya the word always comes to the Prophet is that not God's Way now hallelujah that's the said the law amen now the question is who does the Prophet come to [Applause] if Jesus comes to that prophet holy jesus is in that prophet earlier and then that Jesus in that prophet comes to people who's coming to you he's just a man we call William Branham but no is God manifested in the flesh holier and it's time for us to take our eyes off of man and realize that it was God doing something honey and you know church with a message like this I can just bet Harry I can really feel God breaking every chain and you know when you think about your troubles if you're a person that's bitter if there's something about your life that's not under the blood we're gonna talk about it tonight we go sniff it out tonight because a lot of times Dean was like to come to church in hide they want to sit in their troubles and be all miserable they want to come to tighten and start the growth of the atmosphere anything the ones that bother me doing the worship service the songs are up there honors this big old movie stream and you sit there like this [Music] we sing it we going up yonder there's something in your spirit that's not connecting with the revelation the inspiration of that song you're letting your troubles get the best of you when your troubles is supposed to bring you closer to God there's not a place in the scripture where the Saints were ever in trouble that it didn't bring God closer [Applause] you found me a place where trouble came in the believers life and they got for sucking my god every bit of trouble that ever came brought god I'm seeing huh and God loves to put us in the midst of chaos because it's scriptural the Bible says in Genesis 1 it says that the earth holier and God created the heavens and the earth and it was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep total chaos but what did that chaos do all of that darkness all that chaos he calls God to respond well all that voice I'm gonna make up a word voidness got into school teachers in here forgive me of course you can see that I'm I'm not politically correct I'm a different message preacher because I believe that the message is gone from just books and tapes I believe that the message now are a people the message is walking upright you know you laying on the table no more they laying on the shelf oh you don't need to see you play but the message got shoes on now the message got tires round the neck message got skirts on now this whole Poli the message got curls hallelujah cuz that what the Bible says is no longer written in the tables of stone but now it's written on the fleshly hearts of the believer you are the message hallelujah [Applause] yeah you know what yeah yeah I know you know it's been doors closed because I believed it but that don't bother me oh yeah we don't take anything away from a prophet when you believe the message came for you [Applause] again the word came to the Providence in the profit came to who me I don't know about you but it came to me and what did it come to do it came to separate me from my troubles so your troubles doesn't define you who you what defines you is how you go through the storm so how the bible says a righteous man falls seven times when he gets back up again see there's not enough trouble in his life to keep him down but there's something inside it says I shall rise I shall rise I shall rise I shall rise why because He is risen [Applause] [Music] hello some of y'all think he just too radical will leave me alone I like me in this way let me explain something to you I wasn't born and bred in a Pentecostal church when morning Barry the Baptist Methodist what you see is a direct product of the message of the some of you guys know the Word of God the message of the hour this is why I laugh and all these people who've left and now they say we're so free we're experiencing God's love we free what makes them free hallelujah what makes them free in their own eyes is simple they don't have to be hypocrite anymore you have to act like they believe something they didn't believe so now what they're saying I'm free to be a hog I'm free to be a pig I'm free to be a Jezebel the reason why they don't want this message is simple because it separates you from the falseness it won't allow you to live in the world and live for God there's a dividing line hallelujah so if you got a problem in your flesh hallelujah this message deals with it [Applause] hallelujah huh but when we look at the trouble that God bring chaos total chaos the Bible says it was without forming without boys he says he was darkness that's over the face of deep and so forth but then what did all that darkness and chaos and voidness do it calls God to speak I got a church in here tonight do I got a church in here cuz I got somebody in here who know what it means when God speaks hello to know that everything changes when God speaks no matter how dark no matter how messy no matter how stale when God speaks everything changes [Applause] and observed most of you are used to coming to church on a Saturday night amen brother Diggs we love Saturday and you come here because you're used to that's the wrong attitude see what I want you to understand y'all notice I brother Louie cut it off because God's presence is here God's presence is here and I want you to realize tonight honey if you come with the right attitude what you've been praying about can be a reality tonight that healing can be a reality tonight Polly I challenge you hallelujah be like John Ryan stand on your feet and say take the Lord for healing me she's our trouble holy his blindness thought God on the scene but in a supernatural way against all doubt hallelujah and it may have talked earlier several days hallelujah but God let the trouble go he let the trouble go knowing that there was a purpose in church what I want you to realize that this miracle was not only for the church people but the witnesses was in a barber shop [Applause] could it be what you going through hallelujah we'll help some silligan same ooh yeah you know your family members your unsaved loved ones they're watching you how you go through this trouble and Satan oh yeah he stands back he's thinking things I got the price I got nothing God sitting this God said they listened to him and then God reminds him he says because I let you and then Satan wants to use that he says okay okay you ain't got to show off okay okay I'll understand god I'm backing up I'm backing up I know you got all this under control but just let me have my moley and then God is sitting over here he's the same talking so what moment you ain't got no moment what you doing is what I'm telling you to do don't charge we ought to realize that whatever the devil is doing God has allowed it cuz there's the purpose holy the Bible says before a Jacob and Esau even born God loved one and he hated one why because of the purpose one had to be a size two huh Leah amen one had had to not have recompense for the reward but all of that was God's purpose why because in take earlier there was a nation so that was a certain way his life had to go he had to experience trouble why because it was a nation in size earlier and you know that that trouble hallelujah all the things he was experiencing was gonna name those boys you are a Reuben you are is it ha you are Joseph you are Benjamin holder there wasn't just names but those names but their adoption and God let all those things happen he let him and he he let Jacob uh uh run into trouble with his brother brother come everybody all right time is never on my side that's why I'm glad I'm not a creature of time I hope there's more people in here like me tonight because if you haven't realized we're in that span where it says and time shall be no more when he begins to sound he sounded so we should be living in another place when we come to church how many of us how many of us come to church and we and we drive a stake down and we say God ain't leave until you bless me we ought to mean business hallelujah this is not just some religious gathering some religious affair Church we have an audience with God he's wanting to respond to your trouble but let me make it real to you because of the way God dealt with me in my life my Bell or one of my greatest battles it's always my finances because I live by faith I'm not connected to oh you know I said money don't grow on trees boy I wish I had one brother I take good care that tree boy every time you see me I'd be out there watering that you making sure the sunlight shining down on it do whatever I got to do I run the bird I'd be out there with a pellet gun shoot get off my tree cuz that tree is important to me but you know church you know if you I just want you to step into my world for a second and you know the way God did this you know I didn't want to be a preacher I didn't want God knows I didn't want to be a full time preacher cuz you know what my problem was I was used to that forty hours a week I ain't need no faith for that I only had to do was show up do that both bill and I get bless any talk much faith for that regard you know what I want you to quit the job well god no is that you huh huh father so I think can't be gone tell him you could I got a family then the voice comes again I want you to quit the job Lord you gave me this job is a good job only work four days a week I'm off every Wednesday and Saturday hey mr. Church why quit God is stirring up the nest and it blows me away to this day even when you bring it for a fruit he'll purge you that you bring forth more fruit it don't matter who you is don't y'all think for one second that brother Donna don't get purged brother deeds don't get purged I broke my chair brother Terry don't get purged huh don't you think for one second because we're preachers are we will it look like we're in the will of God that there's no trouble got us in trouble because there's a purpose inside Ian there's something inside of you he's trying to get out hurry up so even when you're bringing forth fruit even when you're in the will of God God will make it look like you ain't in his will and you mrs. believers start talking about me he got his car broke down how can that be the will of God [Music] Danny up for you to decide what you see with your eyes don't tell the story oh yeah what tells the story is my end hallelujah hey so you can see me go through something that you can't explain look like it's off the scripture but it's God's will no I'm not advocating sin what I'm saying is what most of us need to learn how to do more often is shut up keep our thoughts to ourself if you ain't got nothing good to say don't say nothing at all but we're in a day where God didn't come to take away too long he came to magnify the law so instead of saying if you ain't got nothing good to say don't say nothing at all we're gonna magnify brother hair if you think I've nothing good to think don't think nothing at all walk around like a zombie [Applause] viewing and then good to think about we see people going through stuff and in media we start thinking negative oh oh she doesn't oh he doesn't oh the brothers just and the brother that you never thought about maybe God is in control Church so that the purpose of God could be fulfilled God let a little young girl go into prostitution her name was Rahab oh yeah God never going to prostitution why oh yeah because she had to meet a general in the army and from that zero they had to have a boy ass and from that boy they had to have a Jesse from that Jesse a Damon from baby Jesus [Applause] so God let her go through the trouble so she could be a blessing to us and you look at all the critics just seeing that below processing know she was one in the lineage of Jesus Christ and everybody else looking at her trouble but our troubles for purpose doctor Oh hallelujah even before they got to her you know the problem I'm feeling good now you like the prophets say I'm feeling religious don't blame it on me some brothers with me at the doing this and we gonna treat you to death tonight don't blame me blame them cuz that we're gonna pull oh yeah I said I'd like to be told don't see y'all talking my language but trust you look at hustling yeah the journey from the word of this I mean from from from Egypt to the promised land the Prophet said it was three to five days but then some people started complaining and saw all the miracles honey they didn't experience any oh let's back up before they got there before there was ever Moses what brought Moses on the scene trouble chaos getting whipped didn't beat ain't allowed the worship all that trouble and chaos what did it do it calls to church people who knew they had a promise to cry out and that trouble begins a crowd for a God of deliverance what is your trouble doing in your life I hope it ain't making you thinking about quitting church cuz that ain't the purpose of the purpose is to bring you closer the purpose is to help you experience the supernatural let me say tonight could that could what you goin through Holly tonight before this night closed this night for you to reach out and grab your blessing home like I said the devil he asked God for permission says let me mess up his finances but he don't realize the more he messes it up the more faith I have for growing - and I've been full-time evangelist for about eight years now and I ain't got it right I still you know it's just like why cross beat I get in a tight spot that tight spot right now I get it tight spot I'm like Laura what should i do what should i do and gods like shut up all this time I didn't bless you I don't have people come up to you and give you money and you asking me what am i what am I gonna do you don't do what you always don't believe me [Applause] just a couple weeks ago I'm gonna take your testimony for those of y'all for those of y'all who God put somebody on your heart you always say well bless this brother with $20 no that's too easy we don't start with a hungry here we start getting spiritual they don't look like they need none God he acts you that he likes you that remember he told the woman hallelujah pray for the baby and she's looking like no she's here for brother Brendan ray for the baby and God kept saying pray for the baby she's like no well you know what I give him my seat and she thought that voice is gonna live up she gave the woman in the baby to see and the voice still said pray for the baby God tell us to do something we start asking our questions God comes and say pray for sister saw pray for brothers saw so put something in brother song so hands and we like Lord you show is that you well that's clearly something I don't never wanna I don't never want us to wrestle with this again it's never listened to me it's never repeat after me it's never the gavel telling us to bless somebody we should never wrestle with that again because it's never the devil telling you to pray for somebody it's never to the devil telling you to financially bless somebody is devil the devil telling you to encourage somebody it's always God so we shouldn't have the Russell with that tonight always to do is be obedient oh just be honest to say God I don't want to have you do that you in trouble cuz I guarantee you whatever he tell you to do you won't enjoy it I can't I come up with my own little proverb I was I was thinking you know think about that and I just came for my kids and I was thinking and God began to deal with me something so I went on one of those social media things that I know that and then I went on then I put in something that's it and it goes like this put God first and he will bless you put God second and he will show you that he should have been first [Applause] I don't know about you but it's always worked in my life anytime I've ever put God second he showed me boy I should have been first time I've ever put him first I was always blessed even in the midst of your troubles hallelujah we got to run the garden prayer church I'm gonna tell your testimony I was a couple of weeks ago I went to church to preach and you know like I said it you know we live in my faith we living off the gospel we don't know what's gonna happen we just believe in God I don't I see a like one of them regular preachers like I think be hey yo I got script to say he owns a cat alone a thousand not one here of Thousand Hills when I still hold out of cattle so when I ask God for something I don't ask in a small room cuz he's a big God to me the image in my mind and my god oh yeah he ain't six feet tall he ain't seven feet tall he ain't feet tall he about a hundred feet tall he's a big God to me so I don't go to God's Way in Lord you know father I'm trying to evangelize and I just need me a piece of you get what you ask for then you get that piece of car and a car breaking down oh I saw sickness thought he gave me what you asked for you actual piece of car nobody gave you a lot I'm so sick of this apartment I just need me a little small house and you go get a little eight hundred square feet house and then you start saying I should have stayed in my apartment he gave me what you asked for don't you understand as the bride as children of God when you speak God listens when you speaking this sentence when you ask he does but you know I was somewhere preaching and Dean out the service you know means a couple of brothers are talking brother came up to me he said so I'm gonna give you just some change some change I need it and you know I ain't trying to hack off super spiritual like someone's do no brother I'm good I'm all right I'm sure I'm trusting the Lord brother brother I'm good you know we're good with that false humility trying to act humble know you in need that get on my nerves with all that false humility you come unto me saying the Lord the Lord told me to give you this you think I'm gonna say no brother I'm good I said a lot but god bless you brother [Applause] the Lord said told him to do that the Lord told her to do that and we with all those false humility you know I'm just trusting a little I'm praying about it God else in your prayers [Applause] anyway brother come up to me he says oh mama give us huh god bless you thank the Lord for you he says you know I'm gonna buy a truck tomorrow I sold all my other trucks I think you buy me another work truck or whatever kind of truck he was gonna buy he says but God told me bless you and that truck that calls 42,000 I let you get it for 10 see we should already be shout cuz I've noticed Oregonian good Oh y'all think i'ma tell you this but for me to say oh he didn't get no we know how God worked if God told you he was gonna do something he's gonna fulfill it so you know what church huh he said God told me get you this and here let me get that truck for ten thousand $42,000 oh boy here take some faith to believe God like that you know how much you know how much faith it take to believe God like Nike just do it that's the only thing if God is expressing himself just do it you got the Huff and pray Oh father ah diesel I need you to come on the scene come on down me like you got dueling all you gotta do is say Lord you thank you lord just do it he might not be telling nobody else to do it you do what he tell you to do and if he telling you to do something it ain't gonna cost confusion in the church oh yeah we had to get down without cause some people waiting to do something I put this on my heart mess up everything if God telling you to do it it ain't gonna cost confused because he's not the author of confusion [Applause] hallelujah so this brother he gives me some money and I said god bless you we hugging embracing everything he says now I just believe God he said the Lord told me to give you this and he was gonna let me get this truck for ten thousand so he says hey tomorrow when I go get this truck i'ma call you with the testimony I said all right so what I needed the money folks he got it so good the Lord no I needed the money for a certain thing so when I got the money I went in took care of business I had to take care of and as soon as I finished spending it he called me he said hey but these are you doing I just start smiling without doing good blasts highly favored too blessed to be stressed he's a saint remember I told you what the Lord told me to do for you I said yeah he said well you know what I wouldn't stop being on the truck he said we started bidding on the truck and the last bid was my being you know what it was it was $9,500 he said that after I paid the taxes it was even ten thousand just like God's sake now who go tell that brother that God don't keep his word if God ever moves in your life like that who's gonna tell you not to obey that voice and who's gonna tell a person like me huh that's telling like they're all alone that God will take care and you know it's a process and the reason why you know and I go through it over and over and over and over you know Stan Eagle I'm speaking to your standing knee but you know what God is doing Church for those of you who get sick and you get sick and you get sick and you get sick and you get healed and you can heal then you get healing in heal you know why because God is perfecting that revelation a lot of the Bible says earlier its business is he's a cannon oh joy we follow the dollars of things he said count your child more precious than gold tried in the fire go deity fire God so everything about this trial is God and what God does he lets us go through it brings us out go through it brings us out go through it brings us out what is he doing he's perfecting it and you know what I do know what I believe he's doing for me it's gonna get to a place where I ain't even gonna be thinking about my final I'll be like that's all you got God will provide he don't make me nervous it'll be know what I'm doing what I'm gonna do no he didn't done it so much tonight he's perfect it's like a person gets a revelation of healing see I'm there when it comes to healing ain't they own finances yet so there might be some areas you perfected and I ain't perfected yeah and there may be some areas that I perfected that you in perfecting yet but by God's grace we all gonna get there but when it comes to healing holy that's not a challenge for me they told me I coughs I said no I don't they told me I had diabetes I said no I don't got beans revelation and one day the devil had the audacity to try to sneak attack me - Nick attacked me when I least expected I'm going to renew my license and people say well you got to take a fields gonna keep your CDL in and take those things I'm gonna take the physical and people say you got high blood pressure doesn't walk just in case you let that means me that's like me high blood pressure so yeah you got a blonde say no I don't say yes you do I said no I don't and you know Satan looks they have a streaming match but I can get louder than he came when it comes to healing he says yes you do I said in the name of Jesus no I don't say yes you do how they buy stripes I'm healed no I don't and say yes to do ya say he's the LORD thy God that healeth thee from all thy diseases so the most Satan come the louder I get because I got no revelation so you know what doctor comes in Isis and reinforcements he comes in with his book and all the stuff he says well mr. deeds you got high blood pressure I said we got to do this again i say no i don't he says well this is what we can do I can give you a one-year card and you come back because you got high blood pressure or you can retake the test see Satan always want you to settle for less than what I was supposed to get was two years and you know what I told my saying we gonna take the test over I ain't afraid to put my guard on see I ain't afraid to say that this trouble has come to bring in the supernatural Oh God don't make believers out of the nurse out of the doctor out of the Clark even the people in the white room hello so she rolled me back in there hook the machine back up the thing start acting crazy in I'll do all kind of stuff trying to play with your mind I say thing you can huff and puff you can blow up I ain't got no high blood pressure you don't scare me with your tricks and your antics devil I got a promise and the promise says rise pipes I'm here now I don't have to do nothing to work that up God said that oh my god do believe it you know Tyler she hooked me back up she the things start going crazy then it settles out then she didn't it went out to the DD or whatever it did it went out then she looked at me and she says you're right you don't have high blood I say I've told you that from the get-go let's say like this church maybe all God wants you to do tonight is speaking maybe all the trouble is about putting you in position for the purpose of God to be fulfilled out of your life huh remember there was a prophet who will endure Wars one day and he was in trouble he's looking for hunting game and all these things he couldn't find it why was it so dry why was it so much chaos in trouble because God had put him in position to speak and then it was another day when he he was - on business he was gonna pray for somebody and all of a sudden a bull arose up trouble God put his prophet in the midst of that trouble why so he could see that he was a son God all right whoa I feel the Holy Ghost moving in here now oh yeah God put him in the midst of that hallelujah he didn't know the boy was gonna be there he left his gun in the car huh it was so much trouble the fist was too far away he couldn't run that so he's third day he said well I guess I'm a dying on that like a coward and just speaking that alone the presence of God came in the midst of his trouble the supernatural Oh shitty and you know right there I guarantee if he was he just say I didn't feel like I was in trouble you know why cuz God put him there see the pressure you're feeling you're not supposed to feel when you let God take over remember that was a blizzard the prism everybody else didn't read all other brothers run and guard to him stop go back God that a blizzard come so a prophet could control creation [Music] y'all see y'all good at holding y'all praise I can't do that I got to get mine out Lumi God will allow me to go through things so I can speak to it oh yeah some of us are too quiet God want us to speak to our trouble bring the supernatural in it's who you are first we can go on and on and on with this little mist of all your trouble no you clean us could it be God doing something you know look saul of tarsus just causing trouble havoc all over the place persecuting the church doing all the stuff you know what was going on God was pushing the word into other places so God had to send a man that was gonna persecute them so they wouldn't all stay in the same place but then he wasn't done huh yeah cuz he took that man hugger who was calling so much trouble put him in trouble knock him off his horse huh made him blind honey what was the purpose of the blindness now he has to look through the eyes of God I just love God's God has a sense of you you know and then you know the church people they don't believe God can save anybody they don't believe God could save her brother cadre deeds but I'm saved amen and don't plan on being unsaved no matter what trouble I go through I believe he's a keeper oh yeah and now that I'm looking through a different lens I have to look at my troubles my trials my situations as a blessing oh my one I challenge you tonight how many of us are sitting in here saying lord I thank you for my troubles and hard doing it scripture job how long will you continue to hold on to your integrity he says the Lord God giveth and the Lord God taketh away blessed be the name of the law Joe I'm just so sick Hollis you're going through and you just st. pay me no attention you bat me no jess is a nittany you just why don't you just curse God and die now that was his heart that was his partner and I see got trouble on her she calls him Oh pressure Joseph woman you speak it as the foolish women you expect to receive all good and no evil at the hand of the Lord you mean God controls evil too so the devil's own even control evil God turns it loose don't let that be a stumbling block now there'd be no evil if there was no God because evil shows his goodness if there was no sickness there be no healing if there was nobody lost there be no Savior if there was nobody bound there'd be no deliverer hallelujah so if there was no trouble there'd be no need for a mighty God so the prophet of God said holy all these things called out his attributes [Applause] now what attribute is he tried to express in the midst of your trouble now I don't know about you but in my case Jehovah Jireh I know you trying to give me more patient more patient oh I wish I just had a borrower patience I could drink get full office every time I get inside play a pack a patient every time I'm in pressure going down 26 I'm not cutting funny give me that

trying to run for me come you can get extra to get to a place where they start desiring it they love the taste of it hallelujah they see the benefits of it once against in a system dr. mighty Lord I wish I had bottles of the Holy Ghost I give some of you in tonight but I want to tell you I can give it to you but it's here if you only is here Bible says as Peter speak these words the Holy Ghost fell only he's here Church in my I'm about to go don't get nervous and I may say that three more times I said I was about to I didn't say I was sorry I don't have a lying spirit on me but you know when you look at your troubles and you look at what you're going through you think it's total chaos could it be like I said we back up and we see the children of Israel crying and they cried out they're here come on Moses that trouble brought o Moses on the scene didn't they stop holy Moses brought them out of Egypt big marches then somebody else started some more trouble I'm hungry had to throw up the whole church cuz somebody took my day hungry three day journey oh gosh slow up the whole church just to feed them not only feed them but get the momentum from heaven give them bread nobody else that ever tasted do y'all understand because this world Holly the church world was in such so much trouble that God stopped the whole church Hurley and pulls out a bride and gave us bread nobody else has ever tasted oh we never fresh from heaven no Catholic has ever tasted no Pentecostal has ever tasted no Baptists has ever tasted oh yeah no seven-day Infinitis has ever tasted no Muslim no way this know no man's ever tasted oh yeah green bread that hasn't even been in the stores it ain't even on the book sales in the Christian bookstores [Music] [Applause] you are special people you see what this trouble did this trouble pulled out God's oh and then we start marching he did some Oh trouble started somebody else I'm thirsty go ahead slow the whole church up again but this time he said you want something to drink I'm gonna give you water hallelujah that's never been in bottles I'm looking your water that's never been in a river hallelujah imma give you water that ain't coming from a whale I am give you water that ain't coming from a fountain i'ma give you water from me tell ya I'm gonna get water from the rock hallelujah drink up this water and you never thirst again Church I stand to be corrected but go back and look at it oh yeah after that oh you have a God getting water for the rock did you ever hit him back for water again he can fulfill your thirst but they they stop marching they stop complaining you know three days turned into 30 days 30 days turn into three years three years turn into 13 years 23 years do y'all realize they were marching in a circle and they kept coming to their way out but they kept complaining so he kept going in circles they kept coming back to the same old point and they couldn't accident but they kept complaining come to the same on point they couldn't exit but they kept complaining and some of us God has bought child deliverance but we keep complaining [Applause] [Music] let's stop complaining and believe God let the night be your victory that you won't look at your trouble like that anymore and why 40 years you know God was in control you know the purpose behind he said 40 yeah he wanted to kill all of you no it was more than that he had to be 40 years because if it was a three days journey of five days journey rehab wasn't ready she was a teenager so it had to go X amount of years so she could be born she could grow up she can get a house she can get into her thing and then she can hear what God was doing [Music] so a lot of times your trouble is there to bless somebody else you just got to go through it right listen I know I got a real cool cuz I know some of you ain't right no cult I didn t believe the message and told y'all I am the message I am the course holder the quotes in here we don't talk about that tomorrow [Applause] listen that's what a prophecy is he says the preaching of the Cross brings observation it brings troubles it brings stirrups and we can't expect to be immune from all those we just have to take them as they come because God has a purpose so I want you to look at your troubles as a victory tonight anybody going through something say praise the Lord that means God is doing something in your life well you might look at it but I go through I got an addiction I got this I got that I don't know what to do what I do turn it over to the Lord come a B he allowed you to go again allowed you to go through that sweet come on C remember he told his disciples he said see I'm trying to close but y'all pulling blame brothers again remember he told his disciples let us go to the other side and then he went to pray or whatever you went to doing I went up on the mountain to pray those different times you know he got the praying didn't went out there storm king trouble king water in the boat we go die that's the first thing we think when we get a little bit of trouble and then all of a sudden in the mist all that trouble become Jesus doing something in their life that they never seen before what calls Jesus to come like that the trouble it was a purpose behind that trouble hallelujah amen was a purpose behind that storm and you need cry now he's a ghost we go dies the spirit and Jesus said be not afraid I want you to kiss this church sometimes God allows things just to get you to pray cuz we had no trouble someone wouldn't even pray so God God let us let us go through things so we could find that secret place when I tell you it ain't nothing like that secret place when you get in there you know it ain't nobody there but you and God you know what in there ain't even no trouble in there it's over I want you to believe it's over the trouble is over tonight you can rejoice you were drivin your pool you can rejoice yeah amen and you know Jesus come walking on the water say he said be not afraid in his eye and do you Peter Tapia forgot about his trouble he forgot about his trouble he start to think on who God is see the winds and the waves couldn't stop his revelation of who God was your trouble shouldn't be able to stop your revelation of who God is oh yeah and all the trouble of the winds the waves all those things Peter say God if he's you pick me come all Jesus animals one thing come on that here in this trouble with me come on I'll show you how much power it is come on I hit with people jumped out the boat hugly I can see him hardly he probably was even thinking about the water one thing about net all he did was kept his eyes on Jesus he joked that during that water the water solid he started walking towards Jesus he didn't see any more trouble anymore all he did was saw Jesus and as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus everything was peace but as soon as he started looking at his trouble he's starting to sink he started to fall and he's darling Rita save me don't you realize he was i dead all alone and god grabs him and pulls him up as long as you keep your eyes on him the trouble have no effect on you amen either have no effect and you know sometimes god I put you in trouble because there's something inside he wants he let David commit premeditated murder adultery plus why he did all that why why he let David go through all that trouble so he can repent and he didn't get Psalm 51 out of create in me a clean [Music] Oh God and renew a right spirit within me that song would've never came with that that encounter with Bathsheba so God allow all that trouble so we could sing that song today cast me not away from that present Sokka take not thy Holy Spirit from me all that come from David's trouble cigar let David go through all that why cuz he had the Book of Psalms in the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's God's Way he allowed things to come so things and you can come out and don't you realize he allowed Paul to persecute the church why cuz he said he's a chosen fell so he let him go through all that trouble he was night and day in the sea I think he's I think you say he's whipped over five times he was thrown over the wall all these things bit by fire hey man all that stuff was going on why because there was a purpose you know what it was hallelujah the purpose was in power there was a book of Romans there was a book of Corinthians there was an emphasis there was a Galatians oh it was a Hebrews oh that was wrapped up in Paul so Paul had to go through some trouble so God can get it out there was a purpose church don't you realize half of the New Testament was written why powers in jail and then he says and by the way bring me my coat come on musicians I'm closing walk out of here tonight different look at your trouble and smile because God is doing something now it'll be hard if you start thinking about it don't think about it just believe that God allowed it we said doesn't know how did I get I don't know don't do nothing don't do nothing don't try to look at the outcome and when it's gonna happen just believe just believe like the Bible says this is what the Bible says listen to me good turn old man this is just so fresh this would be good now the Bible says trouble don't last always so yours could be ending tonight I don't know about you but I believe my I can in tonight my financial balcony tonight the Holy Ghost it's all about children tonight cuz I have a promise that trouble don't last always amen so let's look at things different God called Abraham when he was an old man why so he could show him the power of redemption so he could show him that the sickness and the deadness of his body couldn't stop the purpose of God and Sarah looking at the trouble she said oh I'm old and I'm dissing I can't I can't I can't imagine me in my lord hahahaha and God like what you laughing for always gonna happen it's gonna happen you might not think he's gonna have my Sarah it's gonna happen to you [Applause] [Music] and what if God is saying that to you tonight it's gonna happen and it's gonna happen to you cuz you believe because there's a purpose in your life in the midst of your storm there's a purpose the devil gets no credit it is no cream now we're gonna exalt the Lord you know cuz he loves to be worshipped Perley your brother God saying after the word is delivered that's the time to worship and you know sometimes in our seats as our hands are lifted the presence of God begins to follow us think about it your trouble brought you to a service tonight to hear your deliverance and if y'all don't mind there's a song I just love to see there's a song I love to sing and it just it just it

Stand Together what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together again today in the house of the Lord let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 11 if you would today I'm as happy to be a Christian happy to be given the opportunity to be able to serve the Lord in this day and all the things that he's done in this hour that we live 1 Corinthians 11:34 if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come 1 Corinthians 1440 let all things be done decently and in order the word order is taxi and arranging Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time do or write order orderly condition now this type of biblical order is not formalism it's just the way God wants things done so it's a post a rank or a position which one holds in Civic or other Affairs since this position generally depends on one's talents you'll find the prophet saying the same thing question answers 1961 he said I like to look and see what a person is professing God has called them to do because generally Works God works with his creature the way that he has made him so if a man claims he's called to preach watch how he interprets the word he says that'll let you know if God's already called him or not so this position generally depends on one's talents experiences resources character fashion quality and style Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though I be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order so Paul is not rebuking them for having the right kind of order for ISM now of course spirit of God rebukes that but this is the type of order that God wants so it actually made Paul so happy and he said even though he was not there but he was hearing through the reports back from the church at colossia what they were doing and they said um Bishops and all that sort of thing up in the church and they had deacons and people of position and Paul heard back and he said I'm not there but I'm with you in spirit and I'm joying and beholding your your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ I mean let to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we could be gathered together once again here today Lord in this building that you've given us dear Jesus we've seen you do so many awesome things in our in our midst and for that we will forever be grateful but as needy human beings we come again today we have different needs different desires petitions you saw the hands that were uplifted maybe a marital problem maybe a financial issue maybe a son or daughter away from God I pray whatever that request is that you'd be mindful of them Lord father we're asking you today also for those that are sick and needy some in our assembly fighting tremendous battles with their health they need Miracles father and Lord we're mindful also and thankful that you brought our brother Larry Elliott through his surgery was able to come home and recuperating and we're just praying for our brother that you'd continue to strengthen and be with him help me now Lord as I Endeavor to speak on the words of Life take the service take the word help me Lord Jesus help the people for it's the glory of God and the kingdom which is to come that we ask these things in Jesus Christ Christ name amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you again today by the help of the Lord on the right to be in divine order the right to be in divine order uh I'd like to go if we can back to when the prophet was out west and him and some of the brothers were on a hunting trip and he looked looked up into the Stars into the sky and he began to relate what he saw and I said somewhere in there I had it pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down to the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the second coming by the lion of the tribe of Judah I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it yet notice now it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible one day it was a Bible one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sits in the the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of the Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place every one of them keeps its time perfectly God's Great Army so he looking at the stars and of course at that time man couldn't not see where he's able to see now because of the equipment that they had in 1962 and it's like it's exploded um in this last day of what man has been able to see beyond what he could see at that time and it no doubt it would be overwhelming for the scientists in 1962 to be able to come back today and look through an observatory and see what scientist see now when they didn't even have the terminology that men use today they never use the word Parasect they never use certain terms the scientists have to use today to Define what they have seen and I Marvel at that myself because I find it amazing that science has been able to grow so much and understand so much more and yet when it comes to religion and church some people are still talking the same thing they talked for decades and hundreds of years ago they've not grown any in God their understanding is not grown they're exactly where their grandfathers were where their great-grandfathers were but aren't you glad God has allowed a people on the Earth in the last day to also grow with the time now when brother brandham looked up it must have been a great thing now remember a prophet sees things quite different than any the rest of us sees it so for him to call the Stars a great Army I mean know brother brand was not in the sense of a Hebrew scholar or a Greek scholar he uses several words down through the the years of the message but and he would take a Greek Lexicon but he was not one to use a lot of the Greek words and the Hebrew words so whether he ever even looked it up to be able to see what God said about the word host in the Old Testament which means an army I don't really know but yet he identified what he saw as an army of God and he saw them in a divine order and he believed according to what he saw that every one of them had a certain pass and if they stayed in that pass it would work exactly right but then he was puzzled and you can watch him as he talks about the earth and the the moon and all how it comes through and we'll jump down to paragraph three and I thought about that being God's Great Army there and I went to bed and I began to think that not one of those get out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them for a cause it will affect the Earth we just seen the results of it now from some of them moving into other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that Gra heavenly host that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order it throws the whole s out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit now notice he says the order of the spirit so the spirit of God has an order and that order is not formality that order is not dead and dry but it is a way by which God moves now according to Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven in that particular spot Moses does not use the plural form but God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and he called The Darkness night now the Earth is in the heavens too is it not but isn't it amazing that God separated the Earth out of the heavens and gave it its own special place in the heavens so it sort of reminds me of the people of God that we are in the world but we are not of the world so the Earth was identified in the heavens but yet called out from the heavens and given a special place if you wish to say it this way the Earth was Sanctified to the Lord God for a special purpose out of all the rest of the planets and the stars and as I quoted to you a couple of weeks ago that in the observable universe that there is estimated to be one septian Stars several trillion galaxies in those galaxies can be millions of stars and yet none of them does the bible call their name not another planet does the bible Call It by name you see when God calls something or someone by name and sanctifies them to himself it is a special choice voice and a reason that God is doing it now watch God now wrote this in the stars and God before he ever used the word election predestination choosing God wrote it in Stardust so God wrote The Mystery of predestination in the Stars God wrote that there would be a bride one day that would be separate from from all the rest of the church he wrote it in the Stars God called the Earth by name and wrote that in the stars that there would be a planet above all the rest and as we looked at it last Sunday that one little blue dot in the mass of all the universe and yet one spot that God chose to be in what scientists call the habitable zone so if the Earth was so much so many thousand miles closer to the Sun it would be too hot for life to grow if it was very much farther out away from the Sun it would be too cold for life to be able to survive so God placed it exactly in what they term as the habitable zone well you see that's the way it is with people some people no matter how much you and I pray for them how much we want them to be bride we will never even by prayer and fasting be able to make anyone bride only God can do that and if God never ordained that their life be in the spiritual habitable zone They will never be able to bring forth bride seed they may be good people they may go to church and they may wind up being saved as we would say but will never wind up being elect man is so interested in being able to get out there it's reading one day this week where Elon Musk is wanting to make a habitable place on Mars already planning it out with all the different things that they're doing and they want to make this community in Mars and I saw you know that that's the the the Mind of Men we've got thousands and thousands of acres in Texas in Arizona in Utah in Nevada in all types of places that aren't even habited by a human being now and yet instead of trying to figure out how to be able to bring water and this and that and the other on our own Planet they're trying to reach out yonder somewhere and put a community on Mars ain't nobody belongs on Mars but martians if there was such a thing but you see it's like man always wants to look beyond what God gives him so instead of being satisfied that God gave the Earth according to the Book of Psalms God gave the Earth to man not Mars not Saturn I don't care what they do they'll never find another planet that is special like the earth I don't care what the church does I don't care how much they despise the messenger and the message they will never replace the end time message in the last day they're looking for it here and they're looking for it there they can look all they want to look God chose Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 is the way he will do it is that right now that's God's choice but yet there's something in man that he's got to go beyond where God put him and find for something you imagine how many billions of dollars are wasting how much that they are wasting and people living their life for an absolute fruitless cause of something that will never materialize because the Bible says God gave the Earth to man so why shouldn't man just be happy where God put him you know it's the same way when we look at the spiritual reflection in the word that we've got people always no matter in every message that God sent to the Earth that there was an element of people that could never be satisfied living in the boundaries of the revealed word of their hour they constantly had to look and search for something new something different something that was just a little bit beyond what the messenger of their age said I hope somebody's sharing this morning and we find the same thing going on around the ranks of our message preachers always looking for just a little bit more than what God's Prophet said well he didn't exactly say it that way but he should have well he didn't exactly put it this way but if he would be here now he would say it this way well you know sounds like a martian to me somebody that's trying to move out of the designated area that God gave us as his people I said it years ago and I believe it's the same way if the Bible don't say it and the message don't speak it Heaven don't require it well come on somebody I don't care how many dreams and Revelations and visions that people have if it ain't in the word of God for the hour I personally don't have time for it and the church said you see the Earth is a part of the Heavens but Sanctified now look what does God give a man a wife for and whenever the Jews would get married in the Old Testament s of the Orthodox of this day they will say something like this I sanctify thee be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel so a woman then that would join up to a husband the husband takes that set aart woman and by setting herself apart from the rest of the world which means she'll have no more lovers no more boyfriends nothing like that she's Sanctified to this one man in this sanctification is what makes her joining or her Union to her husband and it comes from the man's mouth be thou th Sanctified unto me now this is what God has done in every age by the message of the hour that he's called to the elect and said to the elect be thou Sanctified unto me set apart from me don't dress like them don't act like them don't do the way they do but be thou Sanctified unto me and the elect of every age have done exactly that now the Earth could not make herself habitable how could the Earth be able when God the logos spun it off in the beginning and he Let It Drop for so many millions of miles and God designated the decreed path for the Earth how could the Earth do that herself how could the Earth pick out that I want to be in the certain spot in the solar system and I want to be there I want to be there the Earth couldn't do that it was decreed by the almighty God no more than you and I can make ourself any more than the Divine allocation of God God has given to us and would make our lives so much easier if we would just find what God's called us to be get in that spot work in that spot and stay in that spot for the rest of our life but there's always something about man and his curious nature that he wants to move Beyond because with a lot of people it's like they feel like they've got so many more talents and so many more gifts oh if they could just move Beyond this or that or the other and you know it as well as I do a lot of times that's nothing but the devil now as God then wrote The Mystery of the Bible up in the Stars before he put it on parchment then we can see in there that there's certain ones that are chosen to be in certain things I like the constellations remember when you look up and one night last week was supposed to been one of the clearest nights and it was absolutely a beautiful night and Carol and I was out after dark and we was able to look up into the Stars absolutely incredible and I told her I said think of it these are the same stars that Adam saw exact same constellation that Moses saw when he was here the very same ones that Joshua saw the very same ones that the Lord Jesus when he looked up and he looked up at his handiwork when he was here and not one of them has moved a million miles you know when you look into the belt of Orion or you look into the stars and you see that there's a Nova Supernova that's down inside of there and the light the from there thousands of years ago that's coming to the Earth and it was the exact same one that was there when Caligula was the emperor of Rome when Nero was there as the emperor of Rome they looked up and saw that same thing and it was written there in the stars and God wrote that mystery himself so we can learn by it can we not so God chose them and yet it's not like one night you look at and there was a star that was was in the belt of a ran or the sword that hangs down on the side and then the next night you look at it it decided it don't want to be there no more it's of been in the belt so it moves over in tarus which is the sign of the bull and then the next night you look over and it winds up being in Leo the Lion no it's only people that do that come on church it's people that get tired of doing this and then they'll move around in the spiritual constellation of God that's why we need to pray about where we go to church church is not like picking out a grocery store and remember once you find that spot where God wants you the devil will do everything he can to move you from that God ordained place because if he can move the man in the home out of the will of God it can throw the entire home out of the divine order of God and you men will be responsible for that just keep that in mind and it's the same way with a pastor of a church or a preacher if God can be able to call a man and gift a man giving them element of influence and then cause that man to get out of the divine order of God and then maybe affect hundreds of people and that man will be responsible for it is that right so you look that unlike the Stars which are ordained then they've got a certain past and no doubt there's an element of variance that's made in their past because we know even the moon itself being an average of What 293 M th000 miles something like that from the Earth to Sun being an average of 93 million miles and you know how it is that the sun can be brighter in the fall and the winter it'll about blind you if you're driving toward the East and the morning or toward the west in the evening is that right and it's actually closer to the Earth in the winter time by proximity be but because it tilts on its axis the Rays and stuff is further away and yet when you look at it God knew that the Earth in the beginning made it to stand up like this after the fall the Earth felt with it so the Earth felt to a tilt but God made it knowing that it would happen so there's an element of our life that the variables of degrees by which we have the perfect will of God and then we have the permissive will of God and all how each of us should seek and desire and hunger for that perfect will of God in our lives and the church said I personally don't desire do not want absolutely not the permissive will of God in my life I want the perfect will of God now watch let's look at Israel whenever God brings the Stars down on the earth and they begin to mirror the same thing because remember God told Abraham to look at the stars and then he told him to to look at the sand and then God tied the dust to the stars and the stars to the dust so he said so shall thy seed be on the earth so God and most even most people that don't believe in predestination we believe that Israel was the chosen people of God we believe that do or not so a lot of people that do not believe in predestination in the New Testament we believe that God chose Israel in the Old Testament I remember when the Bible was coming in the Old Testament God was mirroring what he was going to do after his deaths on the cross what's this in Exodus 19:3 and Moses went up to God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say unto the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself now what's what God is doing God is reminding Israel of their Exodus and what was their Exodus out of Egypt on an eagle's wings I many knows what that eagle's name was Moses now God used a prophet to call Israel out of Egypt and yet we know that were the Flesh of the Egyptian just the same as Israel's flesh yes as far as flesh it was but they were given a Divine promise of God they never chose God God chose them is that true and what did God do to cause this great Exodus he sent a prophet with a message now notice you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now God is going to separate Israel not only out of the land of Egypt but event you bring them to the land that was promised to their fathers and once they get there he is going to call them out from among all the rest of the nations of the earth he wants them to dress different you know God designated that so that whenever a Jew no matter if he was in Cyprus if he was in among the sirenians wherever the man was that they would be able to look at that man and know that man or that woman was a Jew because of the the way they dressed they would sit down and eat with them they would know that was a Jew why because of the dietary laws so they would see them pray they would see them as they would plant their Gardens and they would know that family was a Jewish family because a Jewish family was not allowed to seow diverse kinds of seed in their rows that have to have a single row of corn single row of peas single row of maters single row of ters and whatever more they knew that was a Jew because they could look at their garments and see there was not a mixture of wool and flax or Linen in the same garment now why would God do this because God is a god of Separation so by their language and they would have what was called a riband r i BB a n d a riband of blue on the bottom of their garment they would know they were Jewish so there was so many things about them that they could look and see why would God do that so people would ridicule them and make fun of them God wanted them separated to himself but can't you see how lead deia wants to be they want to claim the power of the Cross they want to claim Heaven they want to claim that they're going in the Rapture and the body change but they want to look like the world talk like the world act like the world come on somebody they don't want to be separated they don't want to be different they don't want to stand out from the world God's people have always stood out from the world I'm glad he's got some that still do today how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a pecul wow pecul treasure A peculiar treasure look at the word peculiar it means possession valued property peculiar treasure so peculiar treasure is a costly possession acquired with exertion and carefully guarded carefully reserved as the richest treasure among men even as The Treasure of princes consisting of gold and silver precious stones pearls and jewels now notice they did not choose God to be the pecul hey God we we want to be your peculiar people we desire to be your peculiar treasure notice where this is placed he chose them well let me just remind you today Word of Life you never Co chose God God chose you so in reality what I made up my mind I'm quitting uh your choice don't really matter Hallelujah God ain't leaving it up to me God ain't leaving it up to you he chose as himself now watch God said if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine now once again the mirror is taking place to where the stars the path of the stars is being reflected on the people on the Earth that are hearing the creator of the heavens identify them with Earth notice again in Exodus 19:6 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so now God is using the mouth of a prophet to relate God's special design and choice for the children of Israel and it comes through the prophet's message to help the people to see this now he never exactly told Abraham this he never exactly told Isaac or Jacob these words because the Revelation is now growing to what God wants them to be so who does he use the word comes only to a prophet not to a pastor not to a teacher not to an evangelist so God speaks these words this is the message of that day so God is letting them know that they will be a kingdom of priests now remember not a priesthood but a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God look at the word holy sacred Saint set apart a holy people saint that's amazing because the Hebrew and the Greek and the way this ties together this word is very very similar when it comes to the New Testament so it's really special to be called a saint of God a Sanctified one cesh which means one that is called apart from everybody else now keep in mind it's already written up there that little tiny blue dot the only one that has horses and cows and pigs and all this sort of thing by whom by God so God put it in the past so it could receive of his great benefits now here God is saying about a people I'm going to call you out to myself for thou art Unholy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself special possession peculiar treasure literally to be to him for a people of property a people his own his peculiar property you can see why typical Le toan will never be able to be this they're going to do what they want to do when they want to do it and there ain't nobody going to tell them no different now they want to go to church many of them do they're religious and they want to go to church but they don't want you telling them what kind of clothes to wear how they've got to do this and do that and the other all they want is a preacher that preaches greasy Grace and they can get by with anything and everything they want to do they don't want no dos and no don'ts come on somebody they don't want no you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't go here and you can't say this all they want is freedom to do whatever they want to do and then when they die they all go flying away to Heaven they live like the devil they acted like the devil they cuss they drink they lie they cheat they steal and when they die they all wind up going to heaven that is a lie you only walk down the streets of gold if you are living a life worthy of the Gospel praise the Lord now now God says now you imagine these adjectives that God is using thou art a holy people now this did not mean they were a sinless people or without mistake but they were called apart set aside set aside for God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people as the Earth is chosen above all the other planets it doesn't really matter if Mars is jealous or not it doesn't matter if Saturn gets M say well my goodness my name ain't even in the Bible Uranus can say my name is not even in the Bible Pluto say I'm jealous my name is nowh written in the Bible the Earth's name is the only planet written in the word of Goden well praise the Lord neither can Earth say oh look at who I am and look at what I am I am so special I am so loved and you are because God was the one who loved you neither can we go around with a stuck out chest and her head kick back oh my looking down on other people if you are part of the Bride you ought to be so grateful you ought to be so happy that God himself chose you above all people that are on the face of the Earth how many believes this to be God's word how many believes he's the same yesterday today and forever so it could choose people in the Old Testament and make them above all the rest of the people and then comes in the New Testament somehow Brother D and God got saved well when Jesus died God got saved and God got he really got you know worked over and really got changed and everything and now God don't practice that that evil thing of predestination predestination ain't evil in the first place notice in Deuteronomy 7:7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people so where's them great big things they did where's them great big things we do but because Hallelujah the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house AB bondman somebody ought to be praising the Lord with me that's the very reason the Lord God called us out in this last day not because we're great people not because we're wonderful people not because our human character surpasses everybody else if it was not for the grace of God many of you'd be out drunk this morning or trying to get some cure from a headache that you had because you drunk last night you'd be looking for another shot in your arm you'd be running around with somebody else's wife or somebody else's husband come on children let's have church today I'll tell you why you said here today if you love Jesus Christ with all of your heart it's because the Lord God chose you not because you're special not because you are good but because he is mighty He is wonderful and he gives Grace To whom he will give [Applause] it woo know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations Deuteronomy 142 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord hath chosen thee To Be A peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the Earth I'd like to say to Hamas the PLO the Brotherhood from Egypt I'd like to say to Hezbollah the Lord God chose Israel you can partner up with a r you can partner up with Russia Israel partnered up with God Hallelujah let the enemies of this message promote their lives let them write news articles let them get on YouTube and say what they will but the Lord God chose William bradam to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and there ain't enough devils in hell to shake the bride of Christ away from the message of the last days Hallelujah there ain't enough videos on YouTube there ain't enough articles in the newspaper you will never move the [Applause] bride Hallelujah I absolutely love this scripture in Deuteronomy 4:20 but the Lord has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance friends that's us we are a people of inheritance a people of inheritance now that don't just mean that you get one an inheritance it means you are one I know it's almost more than our minds can comprehend but the Lord God's inheritance is his people it's not the Stars it's not the galaxies or the universe but the Lord's portion is his people a people of inheritance Deuteronomy 9:29 yet they are thy people Moses speaking back to God now yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by Mighty power and by thy stretched out arm notice God delivered them by a stretched out arm and in the New Testament God delivered his new testament bride by stretched out arms Hallelujah Eli elast my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and Hell Rejoice no doubt prematurely because they thought that Miracle Worker that sign worker that man that could walk on water now he's died like any other man and the devil probably thought boys we have defeated did him until a knock come down on Hell's door and when the knock come down on Hell's door and the door was answered and they realized there was the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end oh Hallelujah who was it the same Lord God that brought Israel out of Egypt had now come down to deliver his people with outstretched arms Deuteronomy 328 when the most high this is absolutely amazing to me when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel it wasn't first come first serve it's Those whom he loved so you imagine the sons of Adam when God was dispersing them and sending them toward mishek and tubal and all the different places that God dispersed them God's divine order the measuring tape that God used was election the election according to Israel so from the naval of the Earth as Jews the Jews call Jerusalem the naval of the Earth from the naval of the earth God measured that way and that way and that way and that way it wasn't how big Russia was it wasn't how great Lisbon Portugal was it wasn't how great the Spanish were in Spain but God's measuring tape was the children of Israel hallu how much country you all need children how much room you need you said boy y'all y'all got y'all got a big altar here you got a big area yeah sometimes we need a lot of shouting room sometimes we need a lot of room for a lot of prayer line come on somebody don't you know how much the Lord God uses in the last day the measuring tape of the hour is God's word that he's measuring the people of the world by how much space do we need I'll tell you one of the Reas reason why that the life's day and the scientific things are the way they are because God knew we was going to need to reach the people around the world we couldn't just send brother Daryl on a boat the way that Paul traveled on but we needed the message to fall Hallelujah to be able to go and travel like a salt so right this morning people in friends are streaming this service people in Norway are streaming this service why God knew in the life I'm going to let science progress so my word can reach around the world that's how much my children need [Applause] it anybody say the devil which Dory went out of when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel Deuteronomy 329 for the Lord's portion is his people well I don't I'm telling you sometimes I feel like he got short changed you got to be kidding me I mean I'm talking about me you know some of y'all of course are better than I am but I'm talking about me I think man he sure got the little end of the stick as we say I got all I got from him and getting every day and still getting every day and my future is looking even brighter than my past and how much I got and he got me a flawed human being that was flawed from the time I took my first breath and will be flawed when I take my last and yet he said I want I don't want gold I don't want silver I don't want Stars I don't want constellations I want people and the prophets tell us and spoken words original SE that God predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God and you mean we are what he gets back wow you ever make a trade of a car or a gun or something like that you go you drive that car home and think I think I made a bad trade can I have my car back can I have my have gun back can I have oh man I'm but the way God looked at it God says no Donnie hallu I got the best part cuz he sees us as we really are Lord God for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance you got to be kidding me Moses would use him in his deceiver name Moses never even wrote his new name Israel Prince don't you say it magnifies the grace of God in his Jacob form God says he's mine Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and then the waste howling Wilderness that's where he found us was it brother Steve he leted him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye well I'd like to take them threes sometimes he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye this is a Hebrew idiom which is not an apple hanging on a tree but it's actually the pupil in your ey so it's not something external from yourself it's a part of you it's a part of who you are oh my I was standing in front of a mirror the other day and it was one of these lighted mirrors and I was combing my hair and as I I'd wash my hair and I'd combing my hair and blowing it dry and as I stood in that mirror I saw the reflection of that lighted mirror in my eyes so in my pupils were two square light Rings one in this eye and one in that eye and what I was looking at I saw myself but I also saw what was helping me to see myself and where was it reflecting not on my fingers not on my hands my skin because there's nothing there to reflect it but I saw what I was looking at in my eyes don't you understand why we needed a profit in the last days that God could bring the eyes back on the earth that the eyes could be able to say I no longer call you church but I call you bride Hallelujah and the eyes could tell us you were with him before the foundation of the world he loved you he called you by name and the more we look into that we can say daddy that's me that's me he found him in a desert land and in a waste howling Wilderness he let him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye First Kings 8 50 Solomon's dedication prayer of the temple and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all the transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have have compassion on them I found that so amazing and looking at that yesterday that Solomon not only prayed for the compassion of God but he prayed that God would move on the hearts of the other people that was against them that they also would be able to give them compassion as well for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou brought us forth out of Egypt from the midst of the Furnace of iron that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant unto the supplication of thy People Israel to hearken unto them and all that they call For unto thee for thou did US separate them from among all the people of the earth notice as God separated the Earth so he separated Israel to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant when thou brought us out our fathers out of Egypt oh Lord God my brother Donnie that was Old Testament Titus Chapter 2 verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and Our Savior Jesus Christ not one of the Gods but the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ one and the same who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works look at the New Testament word now peculiar that which is one's own belonging to one's possessions a people selected by God from the other nations for his own possession so you mean God did that in the Old Testament and God can do it in the new yes he can and he did and I'm happy for it he amen amen notice in 1 Peter chap 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation eclectus eclectus elect picked out chosen by God to obtain salvation through Christ Lord have mercy you mean to tell me we are chosen by God to obtain salvation Choice select the best of its kind or class excellent preeminent now this is Peter writing in the New Testament amen ye are a chosen generation ation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people purchase possession one's own property that's why the bride wants total obedience to the Lord if the Lord says don't go here don't do this don't dress this way don't act like that way oh my church said that don't matter are you married to your church are you married to Christ the word amen A peculiar people that should show Force the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness where to Into His Marvelous Light praise be to God oh I always as a kid whenever I was going to school I always loved looking up the meanings of words I don't know why I was a little illiterate Kentucky hillbilly I don't know why in the world I like the meanings of words maybe it's for getting ready to be a preacher years on but to me when I look up the meanings of this words it just adds so much to the word of God listen this that those of you that are called be so named to call aloud utter in a loud voice to invite to call by name to Bear a name or title among men we are not just saying we are bride but God called us to be bride God called us by name and gave us an identity Oh Glory to God which in time past were not a people but are now oh I like to preach sometime on that but now but now the people of God which is Loos tribe Nation all those who are of the same stock and language of the same stock and language how we going to know who the elect are they're going to say what the spirit has said and the prophet and the bride are saying the Oh Glory to God so they're from the same stock and they're talking the same language come on somebody they're talking like Father Talked oh my but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy List stand list that about one of the puniest hand claps I ever heard in my life surely you can give the Lord Jesus better than that oh my we were not a people but we are now a people of God go a tribe of the same stock of the same language yes sir all right remember them tribes in Israel and whenever there's going to be a certain code word that they would let them know that they was up on the message of the hour but certains of those people couldn't say that word so they'd say shth yeah or ciles now they knew now that's very close only one letter difference but when You' come up and they'd ask you for the word and you'd say Cil or shth they knew you were in the light of the hour cuz some people just couldn't say it well Glory aren't you glad you can say it aren't you glad you can say what God Said oh yeah you can say Oh Glory to God God sent Propet amen oh the Lord Jesus come and died for us that's well and good but you're going to have to get to a place that you can say what he said Hallelujah about you it ain't going to be enough to say what he said about the prophet of Malachi 4 for that Prophet said when the bride recognizes who she is the rapture will not come but the Rapture will gol and then brother Skippy says the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away sir how can a coming be a going how can a coming be a going so the coming of the Lord is a sudden secret going away so what you going to say on that ciles or shiles if God says I'm chosen I'm going to forget what I believed all my whole life I ain't no good I ain't no count I'm rotten I'll never amount to nothing come on somebody if God says I'm chosen I'm chosen if he says I'm a royal priesthood guess what I'm a royal priesthood oh but I don't feel like it brother Donnie he never said if you feel like it you are he just said you are well praise the Lord are we or not are we going to say what God says yes sir if you remember I told you years and years ago one of the greatest challenges the bribe will have in the last days is believing what God said about her or what she knows about herself and her humanity and some of you let the devil constantly beat you down and whip you down even make you question if you've got the Holy Ghost if you're born again and because there's something in you longing for more and you think you're longing for the Holy Ghost it ain't that that's all a part of perfection is in you longing for a perfect world a perfect walk and you're thinking God maybe there's something in me there's lacking there's something lacking in me it's not that it's lacking it's one of the best signs in the world that you've got it how could Perfection that was not in you long for perfection in another world thanks be to God hallelujah aren't you glad we've been called out of Darkness we've got a sister that's going to be baptized here today she turned in her testimony a while back she had been on drugs for many many years the Lord God delivered her thank you Lord she come right up here for prayer and sit right there on this side cuz she want to be delivered of something else she's dealing with she turned in the testimony here the other day the same God that took the drugs away from her took the thirst of smoking away from her that's God what an acenta we can't do it she couldn't do it herself Hallelujah what's it doing calling people out of Darkness them things that bound them and Satan thought I've got them I've got them and maybe some of our family and our loved ones we think Lord brother Donnie they've lived so often and they've said some of the aest things about the message ever was as long as they've got a breast in there there's a hope for them there ain't none of us got a predestinated magnifying glass where we can look and see if they're ordained or not God will give Grace who he wants to who are you and I to say they can't have it I've spent my whole life trying to get people saved I've spent my whole life trying to get people in church trying to get people closer to God I ain't giving up now I don't care if the sorest drunk that in Johnson City comes in here that man will come in and sit down this I figure this is one of the best places in the city for him to come and get saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost maybe your son maybe your daughter and all Brother D they've been away from God they're in terrible shape sounds like to me they need Deliverance sound like to me that our God can be able to move for them can you believe for them can you believe for your husband can you believe for your wife remember you are not only a people of inheritance but you've got one call their names call their [Music] names for such a time as this God's ordained you for this hour Hallelujah let's bow our heads together Lord God we're such a privileged People Help Us father Lord I know when the prophet read his text and gave his title is your the life worthy of the gospel and he talks about the last pool before the supper was to the blind the lame the halt the crippled well here we are Lord Jesus many of us been saved and in church for years and years help us not to be so Pious and so holy as we think we are sometimes that we'd be afraid to reach out our hand to some man or some woman Lord God they might not smell so good they might even be homeless may not have enough money to buy thems a meal but how do we know some of these homeless people around John City here might be the last one that'll come that's right help us Lord we don't have to hand them out a book we don't have to give them a seven seal book or a church age we could start with a smile we could start with a kind word as we go through the drive-thru and we order a Big Mac and they get us a fish Fil-A we order a Sprite they give us pumpkin juice now we can get mad or we can go through with the spirit of Christ and Let Jesus Express his love through the drive-thru the way he does in a message PE after all if the only good they're getting out of this church coming to church is what they have here and it don't live beyond here I am a complete failure we want Jesus to be on display on our jobs and our homes and our workplace Lord help us father A peculiar people a chosen people you purchased my right to be in divine order I believe I've been in my place for years I'm not really praying to get in my place but now I'm praying to stay in it help a lot of these people to realize it's not so much that they're trying to find it it's just staying where you've put them help us Lord Jesus I pray with every head bowed today I wonder how many of you would like to say God please help me maybe some of you're searching I know you are you come up for prayer some of our young people getting out of high school going into college whatever more and they're searching for their their place and what does God want them to be searching for a boyfriend a girlfriend a husband or a wife and they're searching for their position but some of you no doubt by the grace of God you've been able to find it but today your need is God help me that I'll stay there help me that I'll not get out of my place and if Satan comes to me with a supernatural offer which remember the prophet told us in Harvest time he would do that for those those of us who believe in the Supernatural Satan has all types of Supernatural offers that he will offer you to seduce you out of your position brother B said he may let you prophesy and it be contrary to the word he may let you speak in tongues not God the devil the devil offer you a supernatural offer to let you speak in tongues or prophesy and prophesy contrary to the word but because it would seem like a new planet a new place to start a new civilization a new world don't think your battle will stop just because you get in your place but it just begins in defending it and holding it how many of Christians say God help me keep me instruct me my hands are up Lord the Bible gives us warning If any man thinks he stand let him take heed lest he fall Lord God help me keep me Jesus keep me in my place Lord hide me oh God in the covert of your wings Lord I gave my teens to you my 20s my 30s my 40s my 50s way up now in my 60s how much every time I've got left Lord I want you to have every day I don't understand it but sometimes when preachers get older it's when they leave and get off the word Keep Me Jesus please Lord if you'd see some where I'd go to leave get off the word and be a stumbling block to your people if I'd get stubborn and hard-headed and can't be corrected take me out of this world father if you have to I don't want to be a hindrance to your people I want to help people Lord May the spirit of God move from the pulpit here to the back to the mezzanine to the nurseries to those that are streaming Lord may we realize our challenge in this day being a peculiar chosen called out people to be in our place and be identified with who we are oh how it must break your heart when some of you're redeemed and they think they're not even saved some who are sealed by the Holy Ghost and yet they're constantly coming to the Altar for the Holy Ghost help us Lord to recognize who we are yes Lord granted I pray father We Worship You Jesus Hallelujah can we who were not a people but who are now a people can raise our hands in the presence of God and let's just worship Him Now think of it some of you in those same hands years ago used to put a cigarette between them two fingers or a cigar or a pipe or marijuana or you take a needle in your hand and shoot something in your arm to try to bring you a little peace a little Joy satisfaction of life now can you raise those hands in the presence of God and thank him for what he's done for you called you by name remember I read it to you last week that he tell the Stars he knows the number of them and he calls them all by name and how much more value are you than they praise the Lord oh oh we worship you Jesus let's sing a little something he can we just spend a few minutes now before before our sister gets baptized just worshiping the Lord together now [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you who used to sing country music jazz blues rock and roll but now you can sing

dance praise be to God let's worship him together now oh jesusall we worship you Lord as I look across this congregation today as their Pastor knowing many of their lives and their past and their failures and their faults and many of them even after they got saved the horrible things they've been involved in Lord who would have ever thought we would have been called the people of God Amen but you reach down lord Jesus and you look beyond our fault and you saw a need Hallelujah and you made us the lot of your inheritance and before long we'll be gathering with the rest of the lot in the resurrection oh Jesus hasten the day we pray Lord God sing something for us har let's just close our eyes now Saints let's just worship him now oh praise the Lord Jesus oh Jesus Draw Me Close oh Jesus

was 17 year old in boot camp at Fort Sill Oklahoma and I remember that night they got us off the blessing way March they put us in line and took us into this building we had to start taking off her clothes and putting them in boxes to ship home and started giving us all the same uniform and then they marched us over they marched us over to the barber and they set this boy down you know he's one of these pretty boys and the farmer said how do you want your hair son he said just take a living off the side and kind of blocking across the back he said no problem yeah he filled him like an onion true story didn't bother me I didn't have much to lose but here we were all recruits but they turned us into soldiers by being taught to endure hardness the hardness that we endured in basic made of soldiers the officers instilled into us the Army's concept of discipline and obedience we endured hours of drilling endless parades nowrap marches constant pressure tasteless food guard duty without sleep bullying my sergeants lectures exposure to inclement weather the whole procedure was designed to toughen us up to make us ready for battle the Roman soldiers of Paul's day were the toughest the most discipline and the most efficient soldiers in the world and Paul in his mind it was reminded of that when he told Timothy he was a soldier of Jesus Christ he had been chosen picked up by God and he needed to learn to endured the hardness that a good soldier does he does not quit because he faces difficulty tasks or dangerous situations he knows that his life is expendable many a man has gave his life for his brother but jesus said no man has laid his life down for you oh yeah many of good men died on the battlefield saving his fellow soldiers knowing you must be prepared to lay your life down when it's required brother and said a little man and wife these two sing a song it thrilled me go something like this forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I follow if I fell let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time and the Prophet said I like that for eating good soldiers after get wounded or they're apt to get hurt buddy still a soldier it's got a purpose of something to fight for he'll rise and try again any soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and I say to you this morning maybe you've been shell-shocked maybe something in your life a shell sucked you and you've got amnesia that you don't know where you came from now you don't know where you're going but listen to the words of brothers also listen to Mary say being unto me look back into the word and see that God chose you for this army god bless you in his army remember who you are you may be a wounded soldier but you're still God's property rise up rise up let's fight again knock the dust off let's go keep on the firing line don't act like a civilian you're a soldier\n"}, {"id":

side let's just go to him in prayer father we're so thankful tonight for the truth Lord Lord each of us here tonight have a pass and it's filled with many facts but Lord there's a truth that it's already been settled Lord your grace and mercy by sending us a a message in this hour Lord transformed our hearts changed our lives Lord and we're here tonight not because of anything that we had done any Merit of our own but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let it get done

through all the nonsense Lord I'm going to C my way through tonight and receive from your [Applause] word see my senses tell me Well you feel bad come on Word of Life well I just don't feel like it well poor you man you look at brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer brain lungs throughout his body that man gets up there and un pukes his guts up the night before and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel like you never been sick and you say well I got a toothache I got a headache I broke my fingernail oh come on somebody it's is time that we get in and we lay into this word and we attend the services and let the new man or the inward man be renewed service after service after service with with a more determination to serve God like never before cut your way through the doubts right you know young people you got to cut your way through some things got to cut your way through some family strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight Church somebody will take that word and believe it's for me it's for my young person it's for my child it's for my grandchild that word is saved today church if it could sa re ball it can save your child oh it ain't got to end that way God is still on the throne he's still full of Mercy he's still full of grace brother Reed where are you tonight yes sir sir I Ed your testimony about 3 weeks ago and I preached the message believe are have faith and believe and I want to tell you this I wanted to tell you in the back but I'm going to tell you right now in front of everybody I showed your testimony yours and your brothers talk to your dad beforehand to get the permission I said he's a bigger boy than I am I got to get permission he mean he said he likes to do Waits I'm like woo I know how big your daddy is told the church he can bench press our church but I showed your testimony at our church and I was preaching on have faith and believe a young man came up at the end of service he said brother Jose this is my third chance so re don't you think your testimony didn't reach somebody already it's done Touch Somebody Satan said he was going down Satan said it was over Satan said he took his family out of the house of God say that he'll never amount to anything he's going down in destruction but by somebody's testimony of a god who's rich in Mercy that young man came and fell on my shoulders and begin to cry his way back to Calvary and he's now serving serving God I'm telling you it ain't got to end the way the devil think and it ain't going to end the way the devil thinks God is rich in Mercy he's still on the throne he's still saving he's still delivering he's still healing he's still oh Hallelujah he's still setting free tonight and he wants you to know Church no matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he knew where he come from he knew what his position was he knew what his purpose was he knew what his calling was what am I telling you bride of Jesus Christ I'm telling you got to know who you are in this to you got to know that you come from God and you're going back to God and no matter what you face down here it don't have no hold on you because it can't keep you because God has given you a position a holy position as the Bride of Jesus Christ and we find what we yield our minds to what we think on what we make meditate on what we generally just dwell on our actions follow you take

now they got a little baby little baby girl Abigail touch her brother Joe why are you telling us this I'm trying to give you testimony I know you've been hurt I know you been shell shot but I'm here to tell you it don't have to end that way God has got testimony after testimony after testimony of his Saving Grace of his miraculous power and he's still here tonight to do it for you church to meet your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed sometimes we we don't know which way to go but the truth is we're not in despair the facts is we're persecuted but the truth is we're not forsaken the facts are that we're cast down and many of us been cast down many of time but the truth is we're not destroyed we're still here Church we're still believing we're still plugging the law let me just tell you this when the devil is all gone and he's defeated you'll still be standing you'll still be here when when that healing is happened and Satan is defeated he's cast into that Lake of Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll still be praising God what did God tell job job where were you when I hung the foundations of the world where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Jo he was reminding job before the first Affliction before he lost his family before he lost his well that job you were in my thoughts and if you was in my thoughts there you will be in my thoughts now nothing can destroy you Jo this ain't the end of it I'm going to restore more and more unto you and I'm going to take Word of Life Church that God is the same today he's the same yesterday today and for forever church and whatever you have need of He's Able tonight to do it he's able tonight to meet your need He's Able tonight to heal your body He's Able tonight to save your prodical son he's able tonight to deliver He's Able tonight to do whatever

staring at it and he's looking at it and all of a sudden somebody may want to take that cell phone call Satan may be wanting to tell you something he's looking at this picture and he's in the L Museum and all of a sudden he says wait hold up a minute it's all wrong the curator of the museum came over there what's all this excitement about why are you so emotional he said the painting is wrong it's wrong get a hold of the author of the painting because it's title wrong the King has one more move what am I telling you tonight Church of God it may look like you're in Checkmate it may look like

Didn't I\n[8:20] run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you\n[8:24] when you call?\n[8:27] I walk right beside you just so you\n[8:32] would fall. And did not leave all of\n[8:36] heaven\n[8:38] just to die for your sins.\n[8:42] I searched until I found you and I do it\n[8:47] all again. Let's all stand. We'll sing\n[8:50] the second verse. Now she's talking to\n[8:53] her father\n[8:55] in a house I was once a home.\n[8:58] Said, \"My bills are coming to Lord. Six\n[9:03] days are not thy long.\" He hears a voice\n[9:07] so still\n[9:09] said, \"I move like that before.\n[9:14] I'll do this thing and I will give you\n[9:19] so much more.\"\n[9:22] And he said, \"I walk on the water and I\n[9:27] call the raging sea.\n[9:31] I swore to the wind.\n[9:34] Did I still I gave you peace? Didn't I\n[9:39] run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you\n[9:43] when you call?\n[9:46] And I walked right beside you just so\n[9:50] you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of\n[9:55] heaven\n[9:57] just to die for your sins?\n[10:01] I searched until I found you.\n[10:04] and I do it all again. I like this last\n[10:09] verse. He said, \"Do you remember\n[10:14] child where I brought you from?\n[10:18] Just take a look behind you\n[10:22] at how far you come.\"\n[10:25] And every time you ask me, did I deliver\n[10:31] you?\n[10:33] Oh, why would you be thinking that I\n[10:37] wouldn't see you through?\n[10:41] He said I walked on the water and I\n[10:46] called the raging sea.\n[10:50] I spoke to the wind.\n[10:54] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I\n[10:58] run to your rescue? And I hear you when\n[11:03] you call.\n[11:05] I walked right beside you just so you\n[11:10] wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of\n[11:15] heaven\n[11:16] just to die for your sin.\n[11:20] I searched until I found you and I do it\n[11:25] all again. Let's sing that last verse\n[11:28] again. He said, \"Do you remember\n[11:33] child where I brought you from?\n[11:37] Just take a look behind you\n[11:41] at how far you come.\"\n[11:45] And every time you ask me, then I\n[11:50] deliver you.\n[11:52] Oh, why would you be thinking that I\n[11:57] wouldn't see you through?\n[12:01] They said I walked on the water.\n[12:06] I called the raging sea.\n[12:09] I spoke to the wind.\n[12:13] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I\n[12:17] run to your rescue? When I hear you when\n[12:23] you call,\n[12:25] I walk right beside you just so you\n[12:30] wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of\n[12:34] heaven\n[12:36] just to die for your sin?\n[12:40] I searched until I found you. And I do\n[12:44] it all again. said, \"I walked on the\n[12:49] water and I called the raging sea.\n[12:55] I spoke to the wind.\"\n[12:58] It hushed and I gave you peace. Then I\n[13:03] run to rescue. And I hear you when you\n[13:08] call.\n[13:10] And I walked right beside you just so\n[13:14] you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave\n[13:19] all of heaven\n[13:21] just to die for your sins?\n[13:25] I searched until I found you. And I do\n[13:30] it all again.\n[13:34] Amen. Praise the Lord.

Lord, help us to do so.\n[16:44] Father, relieve it in you, not in things\n[16:46] of the world. God, you hear all the\n[16:48] requests. There's so many serious ones,\n[16:52] Father. And it's always that way among\n[16:55] your people, but you're always there to\n[16:56] help. God, we're asking right now, we\n[16:59] commit everything to your hand. We\n[17:01] commit the preaching of the word, which\n[17:03] strengthens us to go on during the week.\n[17:05] May you may you reveal your word to us,\n[17:07] speak to our hearts, anoint the minister\n[17:10] tonight. Help us, Father God, in this\n[17:12] hour for we love you, Lord. We just\n[17:15] we're just uh in a battle and we're\n[17:17] wanting to win. And may you help us,\n[17:20] Lord God. Please help us and be with us.\n[17:22] The desire is in us, Father, but you'll\n[17:24] just need to please help us, Lord. In\n[17:26] Jesus name we ask it. Amen.\n[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[17:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Kim, if you'll come at this\n[17:33] time, receive the tithes and offering.\n[17:36] gonna sing an old song from the Happy\n[17:38] Valley days that I tried to resurrect\n[17:41] during the prayer line, but I probably\n[17:43] should have practiced it before I tried\n[17:44] to resurrect it. Um, hopefully everybody\n[17:47] remembers it so I'm not the only one\n[17:49] singing. I appreciate all the\n[17:51] participation that I can get, especially\n[17:52] on semi- old, semi- new songs.\n[17:56] Let's sing this together.\n[17:58] [Music]\n[18:00] I may be troubled on every hand, but I'm\n[18:03] not stressed out.\n[18:07] perplexed about things in life, but I'm\n[18:10] not in despair.\n[18:14] I'm sometimes persecuted,\n[18:17] but I'm never left alone.\n[18:22] Cast down but not destroyed because I'm\n[18:25] one of his own.\n[18:29] I'm getting back up.\n[18:33] There's a race I've got to run. I'm\n[18:36] getting back up.\n[18:40] There's a battle to be won.\n[18:44] My feeble hands I'm going to raise with\n[18:48] my mouth going to shout his praise.

By\n[21:21] the blood of Jesus Christ I'm getting\n[21:25] back up. Let's go to that last verse.\n[21:28] With the whole armor of God I'm able to\n[21:32] stand.\n[21:36] The word of God is a sword that I hold\n[21:39] in my hand.\n[21:42] Oh, the shield of faith in front of me.\n[21:47] A helmet of salvation on\n[21:52] my lungs with truth in my gospel shoes I\n[21:56] have put on.\n[21:59] I'm getting back up.\n[22:02] Oh, there's a race I've got to run.

Let me tell you a little bit\n[36:25] of how blessed you are today.\n[36:28] I was sent a video today\n[36:32] from a church in Africa.\n[36:36] And in that church,\n[36:39] they were saying the name of their\n[36:41] pastor,\n[36:43] Jehovah Savior.\n[36:47] And then this name, this preacher, their\n[36:50] pastor\n[36:52] was their savior.\n[36:55] They turned in testimonies of healings\n[36:58] and miracles\n[37:00] that had happened through the power of\n[37:03] his name.\n[37:06] a message preacher so-called. I've stood\n[37:08] there and preached in that church.\n[37:12] I got another video today from the same\n[37:14] assembly and they were singing what\n[37:18] great power\n[37:20] that laid in the name of this pastor. So\n[37:24] they took the song there is power in the\n[37:29] name of Jesus.\n[37:32] except they said the name of their\n[37:35] pastor.\n[37:37] And here we are tonight knowing that\n[37:40] that is lies.\n[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[37:45] &gt;&gt; And there's only one name that's worthy\n[37:47] of praise.\n[37:48] &gt;&gt; You ought to be so grateful\n[37:50] &gt;&gt; that you're praising Jesus\n[37:53] &gt;&gt; and not some idolatry\n[37:56] &gt;&gt; and blasphemy.\n[37:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.\n[37:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's exactly what it is.\n[38:02] You say around the message. Yeah. You\n[38:04] say, \"Well, my goodness, brother Donnie,\n[38:06] why in the world would that be?\" Cuz\n[38:08] Satan wants to tarnish it. That's why.\n[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[38:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know the truth?\n[38:16] &gt;&gt; And the truth has made us free\n[38:19] &gt;&gt; from such stuff as that.\n[38:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, how are you\n[38:24] tonight? Good.\n[38:25] &gt;&gt; How many's fighting the devil?\n[38:29] &gt;&gt; We're good. Praise God. If none of you\n[38:31] had raised your hands, I was going to\n[38:33] quit.\n[38:36] &gt;&gt; Well, how many of you winning?\n[38:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you still working on it. That's\n[38:40] all right. Praise the Lord. You're going\n[38:41] to do it by the grace of God. Let's turn\n[38:44] tonight to Genesis chap 24 if you would.\n[38:47] Verse 54.\n[38:51] Again, our setting from the great\n[38:55] passage that has been written so many\n[38:57] thousands of years ago, laid there in\n[38:59] the word, of course, thought probably by\n[39:02] many just to be another speck of history\n[39:06] and the life of the patriarch Abraham,\n[39:10] but it was much much more than that.\n[39:13] Genesis 24:54.\n[39:15] And they did eat and drink, he and the\n[39:18] men that were with him, and terried all\n[39:20] night. And they rose up in the morning.\n[39:23] And he said, \"Send me away unto my\n[39:27] master.\"\n[39:29] Now, his message thus far has been about\n[39:32] blessings and been about wealth and uh\n[39:37] potentate, a man of great position and\n[39:40] all of that. But now his message comes\n[39:43] to this phase.\n[39:46] Separating time.\n[39:49] Separating time. Now watch what he's\n[39:52] going to say. Send me away unto my\n[39:55] master. And her brother and her mother\n[39:58] said, \"Let the damsel abide with us a\n[40:02] few days, at the least 10, and after\n[40:05] that she shall go.\" And he said unto\n[40:09] them, \"Hinder me not, seeing that the\n[40:12] Lord has prospered my way. Send me away\n[40:16] that I may go to my master.\" And they\n[40:20] said, \"We will call the damsel and\n[40:23] inquire at her mouth.\" And they called\n[40:27] Rebecca and said unto her, and this is\n[40:31] my thought for tonight, wilt thou go\n[40:36] with this man?\n[40:39] And word of life said,\n[40:42] &gt;&gt; I will go.\n[40:44] &gt;&gt; I will go.\n[40:48] Now, believe it or not, God's prophet\n[40:51] said, \"God\n[40:53] wants to hear you\n[40:55] say that.\"\n[40:58] God wants to hear you\n[41:02] say that. Maybe it was something similar\n[41:05] to that in the year 1904\n[41:10] when the Welsh revival broke out and\n[41:13] some missionaries from the Baptist\n[41:15] missionary service in here in America\n[41:18] went to India\n[41:20] and they began to spread the gospel what\n[41:23] they knew of it.\n[41:25] There was a man, his wife and two sons\n[41:28] in a certain village village in India\n[41:31] that received the gospel. They begin to\n[41:33] testify to others and the king of that\n[41:37] village had a problem because he was he\n[41:41] was really tearing that place up. So he\n[41:44] called him, his wife and his children\n[41:47] and demanded\n[41:49] that they renounce their faith in Jesus\n[41:52] Christ.\n[41:53] And the man said\n[41:56] he would not do it. These are his words.\n[41:59] I have decided\n[42:02] to follow Jesus.\n[42:06] &gt;&gt; So the king commanded his men with their\n[42:09] bows and arrows to kill his two sons\n[42:12] before his eyes.\n[42:15] So he said, \"I give you a chance to\n[42:16] recant.\"\n[42:21] He refused.\n[42:23] shot his wife.\n[42:25] She fell on top of her boys as they were\n[42:28] laying there twitching and jerking.\n[42:32] So he said, \"What do you say about it\n[42:34] now?\" He said, \"Though none go with me,\n[42:37] I will follow.\"\n[42:40] So now he says, \"All right, we're going\n[42:42] to take your life.\" So what will you say\n[42:45] now?\n[42:47] No turning back.\n[42:51] No turning back.\n[42:56] That song that you all know that's been\n[42:58] a hymn for many, many years. That was\n[43:01] the birth of that song.\n[43:05] So the man lays there dead, his wife\n[43:08] dead, and his two sons dead. It tore\n[43:11] that king all to pieces.\n[43:14] He said, \"How could anybody be willing\n[43:18] to do such?\"\n[43:21] He fell under conviction,\n[43:24] gave his heart to the Lord Jesus right\n[43:27] there.\n[43:29] &gt;&gt; The rest of the whole tribe got under\n[43:32] conviction and every one of them got\n[43:34] saved. Amen.\n[43:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.\n[43:38] &gt;&gt; Now I ask you,\n[43:40] was it worth four people giving their\n[43:43] lives to save all the rest of them?\n[43:46] Isn't it amazing? It was not their life\n[43:50] being lived that impacted the salvation\n[43:53] of others, but them actually giving\n[43:56] their life.\n[43:59] That song was sung in India. an American\n[44:02] artist here in America in 1959 took it\n[44:06] put put the orchestration to the music\n[44:08] and all that. It has been of course\n[44:11] recognized as one of the great famous\n[44:13] hymns of the church and birthed out of\n[44:17] such pain and death.\n[44:21] So I ask you again,\n[44:24] will you go?\n[44:29] &gt;&gt; If your mama goes, you will. If your\n[44:31] daddy goes, you well, if if your friends\n[44:33] go,\n[44:36] no turning back.\n[44:39] &gt;&gt; Though none go whispering, I will\n[44:42] follow.\n[44:45] Let's pray together, shall we?\n[44:49] Lord Jesus,\n[44:51] we're so thankful, Father,\n[44:55] that you can move on human beings hearts\n[44:57] in such a way that makes them so odd and\n[45:02] peculiar to the world,\n[45:05] but yet the love that they experience is\n[45:08] so phenomenal\n[45:10] that it can change other people's lives.\n[45:15] Father, that's what we want out of our\n[45:17] own lives.\n[45:19] Not just the way we dress and not just\n[45:22] certain things that we do and don't do\n[45:25] and places we can go and don't go and\n[45:28] all of that, but may it be our love,\n[45:33] truly our love that we have for you and\n[45:37] not only for you, but for each other.\n[45:41] But when you were here, you said, \"By\n[45:43] this shall all men know that you are my\n[45:46] disciples\n[45:48] because you have love one for the\n[45:51] other.\"\n[45:52] I can't wait to meet that man that day.\n[45:57] I think myself, had that been me,\n[46:00] instead of two boys, it been my two\n[46:02] girls.\n[46:05] while they laid their jerking and\n[46:07] quivering and life going out of their\n[46:08] bodies.\n[46:10] I believe I'd had enough courage.\n[46:14] And then if it was asked about Carol,\n[46:18] I believe I'd still had enough courage\n[46:20] to say, \"Though none go with me, still I\n[46:24] will follow.\"\n[46:26] I pray, Father, you'd help each one of\n[46:28] us here tonight to feel that way. Bless\n[46:31] our gathering tonight, Lord Jesus. We\n[46:33] ask in your precious name.\n[46:36] Amen.\n[46:37] God bless you. You may be seated.\n[46:42] That's one thing I really love about the\n[46:44] Lord.\n[46:46] He messes up your plans.\n[46:49] I was going to tell you that story at\n[46:51] the end,\n[46:53] but somehow another, he wanted it told\n[46:55] at the beginning.\n[46:58] Let me read this to you from possessing\n[47:00] the enemy's gates in 1959.\n[47:03] And the prophet said, \"Rebecca, which\n[47:05] was to be the mother of this noted,\n[47:09] promised, waited son,\n[47:12] when she was called, she had never seen\n[47:15] before.\" Notice now called to the final\n[47:19] test of a strange man she had never seen\n[47:24] before. Only she seen the working of the\n[47:29] Holy Spirit. Now remember, she never\n[47:32] actually saw any vindication from God\n[47:37] that Eleazar was telling the truth.\n[47:41] There was no signs, no wonders, no\n[47:45] miracles, no healings, no lame legs, no\n[47:49] blinded eyes, none of that. None of that\n[47:53] happened whatsoever. What did she have?\n[47:57] She had his word, but she also had a\n[48:00] personal experience that the angel of\n[48:04] God had given to her. Now, notice how\n[48:07] the prophet says this. She had never\n[48:10] seen before, only she had seen the\n[48:12] working of the Holy Spirit. And when her\n[48:15] parents could not fully decide whether\n[48:17] she should go with this stranger or not\n[48:19] to be the wife of a man that she had\n[48:22] never seen, she was brought to the final\n[48:26] test.\n[48:27] And we'll get the damsel and let her\n[48:30] speak. We'll hear from her mouth whether\n[48:34] she will go yes or no. That's the way\n[48:39] it's brought to all of the seed of God.\n[48:43] It's got to be your mouth.\n[48:48] &gt;&gt; God wants to hear from you.\n[48:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that awesome? It's got to be from\n[48:57] your mouth. Now, you may wonder\n[48:59] sometimes why whenever I'm preaching\n[49:01] things or other ministers will do the\n[49:03] same thing, I must say, what do you all\n[49:06] think about it? You all understand this?\n[49:08] You agree with that? Why am I doing\n[49:10] that? because God wants to hear it from\n[49:13] your mouth. And I figure one of the ways\n[49:15] that he can do it is for me to put it to\n[49:18] you in the form of a question. So I ask\n[49:22] you the question and then God is waiting\n[49:26] to hear your answer. Now notice it's got\n[49:29] to be your mouth. God wants to hear from\n[49:34] you. So when she was put to the test,\n[49:38] she never hesitated a minute. She said,\n[49:41] \"I will go.\" I like that. Not, \"Let me\n[49:45] make up my mind. Let me study it over.\"\n[49:49] She was fully persuaded. That's the\n[49:53] people that God can use. Praise the\n[49:56] Lord. When you're fully persuaded that\n[50:00] God will keep his promise, she said, \"I\n[50:04] will go.\" Now remember, Rebecca was a\n[50:08] type of the bride. So if she was then\n[50:12] she in her journey and in her decision\n[50:16] time and in the faith part of her\n[50:19] journey she had to experience similar\n[50:22] things to what you and I would be or she\n[50:26] could not be the bride type. Now, if\n[50:29] everything went easy for her and she\n[50:32] never had to have a testing of her faith\n[50:35] and maybe even a wondering on the\n[50:38] journey after the great pulsation of\n[50:41] faith had anointed her to speak this, it\n[50:44] might have been so reverberating out of\n[50:46] her soul and so powerful that it took\n[50:48] her by surprise. We know it's done us\n[50:51] that way at times. But we also know that\n[50:53] God will allow us to be tested then of\n[50:57] what our confession has been made out of\n[51:00] our own mouths. Now, if Rebecca was a\n[51:04] bride type, then I I I believe from\n[51:06] looking at that that Rebecca must have\n[51:09] had some disencouraging times going back\n[51:13] on this 450 mile journey on the back of\n[51:18] a camel. She is the type of the bride.\n[51:20] So if she was, she must have had some\n[51:24] wonderings and maybe some bewilderment\n[51:27] and maybe even some questions after that\n[51:30] she'd committed to following this man\n[51:32] that she'd never seen before until\n[51:35] yesterday. And he comes with this\n[51:38] strange message of a king or not a king\n[51:41] but of a great man by the name of\n[51:43] Abraham that was a wealthy man and he\n[51:46] supposedly had a son. She had no way to\n[51:48] Google him. She had no way to be able to\n[51:50] chat GPT and check him out, check his\n[51:53] credentials. She had absolutely no way\n[51:55] whatsoever. But yet, there was something\n[51:58] about what the man had to say, the man's\n[52:02] message. Now, if you haven't been\n[52:05] listening to Time of Decision, uh the\n[52:08] one in Chicago and also the one in Los\n[52:11] Angeles, it do you good to listen to it\n[52:13] cuz a prophet really goes into this and\n[52:16] reiterates this and I I love it. But I\n[52:18] went back through it again today and I\n[52:19] heard him as he come to the end of the\n[52:22] preaching part there and he said now\n[52:24] those of you that are here and you got\n[52:25] needs in your body. He said do you\n[52:28] believe my message? Do you have you\n[52:31] heard my message that I brought to you\n[52:35] from God? I thought Lord have mercy. So\n[52:40] here is the very answering to the type\n[52:44] of Eleazar in the Old Testament an\n[52:47] offering to the people in that day. Now\n[52:49] remember 1959 so the seals are not open\n[52:53] yet the revealing of the manifestation\n[52:56] of the son of man has not even come into\n[52:58] full view. It was already been\n[53:00] foreshadowed. Great things were\n[53:02] happening. But the word of God had\n[53:05] already began to call and God was\n[53:08] calling out. Now watch. He says what\n[53:11] happens here. Now he said, \"Let me make\n[53:13] up my mind. Let me study over it.\" She\n[53:16] was fully persuaded. That's the people\n[53:19] that God can use. And no doubt her\n[53:22] parents and her brother, which was the\n[53:24] spokesman, could have said, \"Come next\n[53:26] to yourself, Rebecca. Don't you think\n[53:29] that we might need to send a camel train\n[53:31] back or to try to find out if this man\n[53:33] is even to tell them the truth? We don't\n[53:35] even know. They didn't have phones. They\n[53:37] didn't have no no way at all to be able\n[53:40] to check the story. Rebecca, think what\n[53:43] you are. And remember, she was only 16\n[53:47] years old.\n[53:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[53:50] &gt;&gt; And going to marry a man that was\n[53:53] actually 40.\n[53:56] a man that was still mourning at the\n[54:00] deaths of his mother.\n[54:03] Now think, in one sense of the word, it\n[54:06] would look like a man that in one way\n[54:08] was kind of a mama's boy, 40 years old\n[54:12] and still living in his mother's tent.\n[54:15] Watch what your Bible says. Whenever\n[54:17] Rebecca went back, he took her into his\n[54:20] mother's tent.\n[54:22] And from looking they'd say, \"Oh my\n[54:24] goodness, what kind of man is this\n[54:26] anyway? And how do I know this man here\n[54:28] is even telling me the truth?\" So they\n[54:31] could have said easily, \"Rebecca, you\n[54:33] may never see your family again.\" And\n[54:35] I've told you before, she didn't.\n[54:38] There's no record that she ever went\n[54:40] back and saw her mother again or saw any\n[54:43] of her family.\n[54:46] Oh my. They could have said, \"Oh, this\n[54:49] is a very difficult journey and look,\n[54:51] you're totally outnumbered. You're going\n[54:54] and your and your maid Deborah, she's\n[54:57] going with you, your nurse. And then\n[55:00] there's a few foolish virgins.\"\n[55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.\n[55:04] &gt;&gt; That's going along with you.\n[55:06] &gt;&gt; Maids.\n[55:08] &gt;&gt; They were following the message, but\n[55:10] they never got to marry Isaac.\n[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they was going along in the\n[55:15] camel train, but they wasn't on the\n[55:18] camel the power that she was riding.\n[55:21] Now, Rebecca, you're outnumbered. This\n[55:23] doesn't even make sense. You've been a\n[55:24] sensible girl. And then we come to the\n[55:28] famous word that we looked at a couple\n[55:30] of weeks ago. Rebecca,\n[55:33] this could be a cult.\n[55:39] &gt;&gt; Let me read to you the meaning of cult.\n[55:42] You can read it with me. Cults are\n[55:44] social groups which have unusual and\n[55:47] often extreme religious, spiritual or\n[55:52] philosophical beliefs and rituals. But\n[55:57] you know what I find amazing about it is\n[55:59] that there are cults that follow certain\n[56:04] musicians\n[56:06] and cults that follow certain singers.\n[56:09] And I'm sure probably a lot of you all\n[56:11] have heard of the famous singer in this\n[56:14] day and age that we live in. Her name is\n[56:16] Taylor Swift. Anybody heard of her name\n[56:19] before? I'm sure you've heard her name.\n[56:20] Well, she has a cult following. Now, do\n[56:26] you know what those people call\n[56:29] themselves who are a part of that\n[56:32] following?\n[56:34] &gt;&gt; Swifties.\n[56:37] Yes.\n[56:38] &gt;&gt; So they take her name\n[56:42] upon themselves and they are not ashamed\n[56:46] and you know they dress like her and\n[56:48] they pay all kinds of money to go hear\n[56:50] her sing and uh they do all that sort of\n[56:53] thing and they are proud. They are so\n[56:56] tickled to death that they are part of\n[57:00] the Swifty cult.\n[57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.\n[57:03] Well, I'm very happy myself that I'm\n[57:07] part of the eagle one.\n[57:09] &gt;&gt; And we also are very swift. As a matter\n[57:13] of fact, we're fixing to be so swift,\n[57:15] we're going to move from this dimension\n[57:17] to the next one and faster than you can\n[57:20] bat your eye.\n[57:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Now, isn't it amazing\n[57:24] now that people will not get up in\n[57:28] churches and all that? Why? Because\n[57:30] there's pastors that are part of the\n[57:33] Swifty cult. There are Baptist people,\n[57:36] church of God people. I do hope with all\n[57:38] of my heart there ain't nobody here that\n[57:40] belongs to the Swifty cult. I'm\n[57:42] disappointed in you if you are. But yet\n[57:45] there was people that belong to the cult\n[57:48] of Elvis and the cult of ACC\n[57:52] and the cult of this and that and the\n[57:55] other. I don't know the modern ones, you\n[57:57] know, just ones that I've heard as as a\n[57:59] kid growing up and all that. And yet\n[58:01] they are not ashamed. They're not\n[58:03] backwards of it. And and people don't\n[58:05] think it's a terrible thing that they\n[58:07] collect every album. You know, there was\n[58:10] a cult that followed the group Kiss.\n[58:12] Many of you have seen that one. They\n[58:14] look like absolute demons right out of\n[58:16] the pits of hell. Why? Cuz that's where\n[58:19] their influence come from. But yet, why\n[58:22] is it that people want to identify a\n[58:26] group that just believes something\n[58:28] different than what they do or things\n[58:31] that they really don't understand or\n[58:33] that they've heard from gossip and yet\n[58:35] they want to treat you like you've got\n[58:37] the plague.\n[58:39] &gt;&gt; Right?\n[58:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I I took some of these things and\n[58:42] identified them from the professionals\n[58:44] who study cults. But there was one more\n[58:48] little aspect that I wanted to touch on\n[58:51] for just a little bit and it was this\n[58:53] one. According to the Cult Education\n[58:57] Institute, wow, what a name. Cult\n[59:01] Education Institute, CI.\n[59:07] There are specific warning signs to look\n[59:11] out for when considering whether a group\n[59:15] might be a cult. Cults are\n[59:18] characterized, now listen carefully, by\n[59:22] absolute\n[59:23] authoritarianism\n[59:25] without accountability.\n[59:29] Now, let's just take now some of the\n[59:32] teaching of what our prophet taught us\n[59:35] and see if his teachings line up with\n[59:39] this. Now, if they do, then I think we\n[59:43] as a church should look at ourselves\n[59:47] very carefully and say, \"Are we a cult\n[59:52] that's off the word?\"\n[59:55] &gt;&gt; Fair enough.\n[59:56] &gt;&gt; Boy, some of y'all's tore up, ain't you?\n[59:58] Yes sir.\n[59:59] &gt;&gt; Now remember complete authoritarianism.\n[1:00:03] So the leader of the cult would be the\n[1:00:06] one in charge.\n[1:00:08] Then the people won't have any say.\n[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Right?\n[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; They won't control. They won't do\n[1:00:14] anything. They will just do what they\n[1:00:16] are told.\n[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.\n[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't scared to look, are you?\n[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't because I know what the\n[1:00:23] answer is. Now watch this and you can\n[1:00:26] read it with me.\n[1:00:28] There is no one above the elder. I have\n[1:00:31] nothing to do with what brother Neville\n[1:00:34] does here.\n[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; What?\n[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Now, this is supposed to be the cult\n[1:00:42] leader.\n[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's saying to the church that he\n[1:00:47] started,\n[1:00:48] but brother Neville is now pastoring.\n[1:00:51] And the supposed cult leader\n[1:00:55] is saying that he don't have any\n[1:00:57] control.\n[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now listen, it goes on. That's up to you\n[1:01:02] and brother Neville. If brother Neville\n[1:01:05] wanted to preach Jehovah witness\n[1:01:09] doctrine,\n[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; that's up to him and you.\n[1:01:16] Oh no.\n[1:01:19] It's a bad sign. It's a bad sign that\n[1:01:23] brother Brandon wasn't the cult leader.\n[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz these people are spending the years\n[1:01:28] of their life now and then they'll fry\n[1:01:30] in hell like a pancake after a while on\n[1:01:33] lies.\n[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.\n[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Now notice if he wanted to preach\n[1:01:40] anything he wanted to. That's between\n[1:01:41] you and him. Now wait a minute. This is\n[1:01:43] one of the first principles of a call\n[1:01:46] that absolutism that the leader will\n[1:01:49] have and is not to be questioned.\n[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.\n[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Sure.\n[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.\n[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you guys that stream our\n[1:01:59] services, especially on Wednesday night,\n[1:02:01] you like like to pick what I say. Here's\n[1:02:04] another one. Now, either you line it up\n[1:02:08] or these things will condemn you at the\n[1:02:10] day of judgment,\n[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and I'll stand against you and watch the\n[1:02:15] angels of God commit you into the lake\n[1:02:18] of fire.\n[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,\n[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; so if you got truth, prove it. Amen.\n[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Right.\n[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And Word of Life said,\n[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; if the congregation votes for him in\n[1:02:35] there to preach that,\n[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; that's all right. That's up to him.\n[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's up to him. No, it\n[1:02:47] absolute authoritarianism that the cult\n[1:02:49] leader so-called was the one that had\n[1:02:52] the final say of everything.\n[1:02:57] The only thing I do is just owning the\n[1:02:59] property. If something another comes by,\n[1:03:01] like moving the pastor and they want to\n[1:03:03] take a vote on it,\n[1:03:06] you couldn't ask a deacon to do that.\n[1:03:08] You come and ask me. And I'd come down\n[1:03:09] and say, \"Well, if you want to move the\n[1:03:11] pastor, tell me why. Has he done\n[1:03:13] anything? Yes, we caught him drunk or we\n[1:03:16] caught him doing this or doing something\n[1:03:17] wasn't right. Have you got three\n[1:03:19] witnesses of it?\" Now notice here is the\n[1:03:23] supposed leader.\n[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Sure.\n[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; But instead of him saying, \"Oh, I'll\n[1:03:28] tell you one thing. I'll be in charge.\n[1:03:30] I'll whoop him. I'll do this, that, and\n[1:03:32] other. I'll do No, he's putting it right\n[1:03:34] back on the people that are making the\n[1:03:36] accusation.\n[1:03:39] Have you got three witnesses of it?\"\n[1:03:41] Yes, we have. Then witnesses must first\n[1:03:44] be tried. An elder. Notice you don't\n[1:03:47] receive an accusation against an elder\n[1:03:50] less it's by two or three witnesses. Let\n[1:03:54] them first be proved against an elder.\n[1:03:57] Then you have to swear.\n[1:04:01] This would eliminate a lot of gossip\n[1:04:03] that people accept on preachers if some\n[1:04:06] of you lay people would make them comply\n[1:04:09] to this.\n[1:04:10] You're going to receive an accusation\n[1:04:12] against a minister.\n[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; If you don't go by this way right here,\n[1:04:17] you're just as wrong as the person\n[1:04:19] packing and spreading the lie.\n[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.\n[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Now, notice they have to swear to it\n[1:04:30] that you saw it and prove it. Well,\n[1:04:34] sister so and so told me that they said\n[1:04:36] that they said that they saw it on\n[1:04:37] Facebook. Well, my goodness, that's even\n[1:04:40] more absolute than the Bible, ain't it?\n[1:04:43] That's the way some people look at it.\n[1:04:45] Facebook, Instagram replaces Matthew,\n[1:04:47] Mark, Luke, and John.\n[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Not to a believer, they don't.\n[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And then if you did, then that\n[1:04:57] sin is rebuked openly that it's wrong.\n[1:05:00] Then say, congregation,\n[1:05:04] what\n[1:05:06] you mean? The pastor does something\n[1:05:08] wrong and then they would call the\n[1:05:10] prophet down and he was all right. You\n[1:05:11] got to go up this way. You got\n[1:05:13] witnesses. Y'all, all right, you three\n[1:05:14] brothers stand. All right, now y'all\n[1:05:17] stand. What did you see? I saw brother\n[1:05:19] Donnie. He was out there. Lord have\n[1:05:21] mercy. Amber beer running out of his\n[1:05:23] mouth. And whenever he saw me, he\n[1:05:24] swallowed that could of tobaca. He got\n[1:05:27] choked and he spit it out on the bank.\n[1:05:29] Brother, are you willing to swear to\n[1:05:30] that? Raise your right hand. I swear\n[1:05:34] before Almighty God.\n[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Boy, y'all getting tired on a\n[1:05:39] tick tonight on me, ain't you?\n[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, friends. Either we believe\n[1:05:43] this or we don't. Do we believe it?\n[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; God has given us the way.\n[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And notice where it's put back on you\n[1:05:52] people.\n[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; My my Then they say, \"Congregation, do\n[1:05:58] you want to change your pastor? If you\n[1:06:00] mean the absolute authoritarianism of\n[1:06:03] this so-called cult leader is not going\n[1:06:05] to do it.\n[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; No. You know why? He did not have the\n[1:06:11] authority from God to do so.\n[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Right.\n[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Because the sovereignty lays in the\n[1:06:16] church.\n[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Not even in the prophet.\n[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.\n[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Well, come on somebody.\n[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Not even in the pastor.\n[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; So now I've been with you all what is it\n[1:06:27] now, Carol? Going on 38 years maybe.\n[1:06:30] This is the 38th year. So, how many of\n[1:06:32] you would want to go to work for a\n[1:06:35] company? You would give 38 years of your\n[1:06:38] life, your brothers that are\n[1:06:40] businessmen. So, you'd start a business\n[1:06:42] and you'd work and labor and sweat to\n[1:06:44] build that business. And then in 38\n[1:06:47] years, the employees decide to get rid\n[1:06:49] of you.\n[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Would any of y'all want that kind of\n[1:06:53] business?\n[1:06:55] How many of you would want to give 25 or\n[1:06:57] 30 years to some corporation and then\n[1:07:00] some of your fellow employees desire to\n[1:07:03] to get rid of you so they just vote you\n[1:07:05] out.\n[1:07:07] Now think about what a position that I\n[1:07:09] hold and other pastors around the\n[1:07:11] message. I give 38 years of my life\n[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; to being your pastor. And those that we\n[1:07:18] buried and those that have went on to\n[1:07:19] the Lord and all that so that I could\n[1:07:22] lose my position in this church, all the\n[1:07:26] labor, all the preaching, all the\n[1:07:29] physical work that I've done, everything\n[1:07:31] else right along with it simply by\n[1:07:35] majority vote\n[1:07:37] and I'm gone.\n[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how many of you would commit\n[1:07:42] your life for 38 years?\n[1:07:46] Anybody want to raise your hand? Well,\n[1:07:48] at least you ain't liars.\n[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Now, think.\n[1:07:54] So, you mean, Brother Donnie, you could\n[1:07:56] you could actually be voted out tonight?\n[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; I could be got rid of tonight.\n[1:08:09] Praise the Lord. Ain't this good?\n[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I love getting that devil in a spot and\n[1:08:15] just pushing him, slamming him right up\n[1:08:17] against that piano, taking his big old\n[1:08:20] head and sliding it right underneath\n[1:08:22] there until his ghoul hangs out his\n[1:08:24] tongue.\n[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; That's what the word does to his eye.\n[1:08:35] Oh my. If the congregation\n[1:08:39] votes forgive him, let him go on. That's\n[1:08:44] the way it has to stand.\n[1:08:49] So, somebody refresh my memory. So, this\n[1:08:52] is the way it worked with David Koresh,\n[1:08:54] right?\n[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; This is the way that it's worked with\n[1:09:01] Charles Manson.\n[1:09:04] This is the way that it's worked with\n[1:09:05] all the famous cult leaders and groups\n[1:09:08] that that the people themselves voted\n[1:09:10] the leader out, right?\n[1:09:18] Oh my,\n[1:09:20] that isn't that fair enough way to run a\n[1:09:23] church. That's what the Bible said. We\n[1:09:25] have no bishops and overseers and boards\n[1:09:28] and so forth. Moves this one and got a\n[1:09:31] lot of authority. There's nobody got\n[1:09:33] authority here but the Holy Ghost. He\n[1:09:37] does the moving. Now listen to this. And\n[1:09:40] we take him\n[1:09:43] as the majority of the people\n[1:09:47] the way the people go.\n[1:09:53] I guarantee you there's some people\n[1:09:54] around this message that don't do it\n[1:09:56] this way. But we ain't them people.\n[1:10:00] And there's people around the world that\n[1:10:01] do it this way. Why? Cuz that lines up\n[1:10:04] with the scripture.\n[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And somebody said,\n[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; \"All right, then where is the\n[1:10:10] authoritarianism that a cult leader\n[1:10:12] supposed to have?\"\n[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.\n[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Now notice this how this works even in\n[1:10:21] the majority. Then if one side wants to\n[1:10:24] do this and the other side wants to do\n[1:10:27] that and the side wins, the losing side,\n[1:10:32] what do they do about it? I can tell you\n[1:10:34] what most of them do about it. They're\n[1:10:35] going to cause a split in the church.\n[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Did you ever wonder why we don't have\n[1:10:41] any scriptures on how to split a church?\n[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Do you ever wonder why there ain't no\n[1:10:46] quotes in the message that tells us how\n[1:10:48] to split a church and set up another\n[1:10:50] church? You ever wonder why there's no\n[1:10:53] scripture and no quotes for it? Huh? So,\n[1:10:57] what do they have then when they do\n[1:10:59] that? And what are they building their\n[1:11:01] church upon?\n[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Not the word of God.\n[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.\n[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; My my. Now, watch how this one side and\n[1:11:10] other side thing works. And the other\n[1:11:13] side wants to do that and this side\n[1:11:14] wins. The losing side, what do they do\n[1:11:17] about it? They join right in with the\n[1:11:21] rest of them and say we were wrong.\n[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, boy, that right\n[1:11:34] there threw out some of you. Plum out\n[1:11:36] the door, did it? For some of you to\n[1:11:39] admit that you voted the wrong way\n[1:11:44] or some turpentine on your Kool-Aid. My\n[1:11:47] my goodness, I can't admit it. I will\n[1:11:50] not do it. Hallelujah.\n[1:11:53] Suit yourself.\n[1:11:56] You're not following the teaching of\n[1:11:58] this message.\n[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; G.\n[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what he tells them to do.\n[1:12:03] Join right in with the rest of them and\n[1:12:05] say, \"We were wrong. then we will go\n[1:12:08] right on cuz the Holy Ghost\n[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; has made that choice.\n[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; So, can we vote wrong?\n[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; I can.\n[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; But can after I've voted wrong,\n[1:12:32] can I go with it?\n[1:12:37] Well, let me share something with you\n[1:12:39] that a lot of the message people can't\n[1:12:40] do. Now, watch. The prophet goes on to\n[1:12:42] say like Democrats and Republicans, as\n[1:12:44] long as we stand as a democracy, as\n[1:12:46] Americans, if the Democrats is in, the\n[1:12:50] Republicans should push right on with\n[1:12:52] them.\n[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send this to Trump tomorrow\n[1:13:00] and then Chuck Schumer and all the rest\n[1:13:02] of them on the other side. Been nice\n[1:13:05] knowing you all cuz they'll hang me. If\n[1:13:08] the Democrats is in, the Republicans\n[1:13:10] should push right on with them.\n[1:13:12] Republicans in, the Democrat push on.\n[1:13:14] That's just exactly what makes us a\n[1:13:17] nation. Can't you see why we're in such\n[1:13:19] a mess?\n[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Whenever we break that, we break our\n[1:13:24] democracy.\n[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Boy, ain't that quote\n[1:13:30] fitting for the day we're living in?\n[1:13:32] That's right. Democrats say I ain't\n[1:13:34] going to do nothing Republicans is in.\n[1:13:36] Then we'll fall.\n[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a Kuckian. Together we stand and\n[1:13:41] divided we fall. So what does this do?\n[1:13:45] This cultism of this aspect. It hinges\n[1:13:48] on, listen to this church, the\n[1:13:50] encouraging\n[1:13:52] of maximum dependency\n[1:13:54] upon the leader. Then they don't know\n[1:13:56] what to do. They can't make those\n[1:13:58] decisions on their own. They've got to\n[1:14:00] have conser. And the leader wants it\n[1:14:02] that way. He does not want them growing\n[1:14:05] up. Listen to me. God wants you as your\n[1:14:09] pastor. I want you to grow up.\n[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; There will be questions that you'll have\n[1:14:14] in your life that you'll have to come to\n[1:14:15] me or other ministers. But I don't want\n[1:14:18] you relying on me to be your yes and no\n[1:14:21] and yes and no and yes and no about\n[1:14:23] every decision of your life. God wants\n[1:14:26] every one of you to be so full of the\n[1:14:28] Holy Ghost that you can go to him in\n[1:14:30] prayer and say, \"Father, should I do\n[1:14:31] that or should I do that?\" And you have\n[1:14:34] that walk with God. Amen. Don't let\n[1:14:37] somebody else replace that for God.\n[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. The socalled\n[1:14:49] cult leader,\n[1:14:52] Total Deliverance, 1954.\n[1:14:55] They was talking about building a new\n[1:14:57] tabernacle.\n[1:15:00] Frankly, myself, when they spoke of a\n[1:15:02] new tabernacle to me, I was against the\n[1:15:06] thought.\n[1:15:08] That's right. I said, \"We don't need\n[1:15:09] exactly a new tabernacle. I'll probably\n[1:15:12] be leaving here pretty soon as the Lord\n[1:15:14] showed me what what comes to pass. And\n[1:15:16] what do we need a new tabernacle for?\"\n[1:15:19] And we haven't got the money.\n[1:15:22] Then I come down there and I drug out\n[1:15:24] the red Kool-Aid. And I said, \"Everybody\n[1:15:27] that voted against me is a prophet of\n[1:15:29] God. Get in this line and drink this\n[1:15:32] Kool-Aid.\n[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You lying hypocrites.\"\n[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about you.\n[1:15:42] Put God's prophet\n[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; in such a status.\n[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.\n[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Now notice I come down and felt the\n[1:15:55] feeling of the church\n[1:15:58] that the church in the majority seemed\n[1:16:01] to want it. Then what did I do?\n[1:16:06] I sacrificed my own thoughts\n[1:16:12] and throwed in with\n[1:16:16] the church.\n[1:16:18] A cult leader,\n[1:16:21] a cult leader sacrificed his own\n[1:16:24] thoughts which would have brought his\n[1:16:26] own leadership into question.\n[1:16:30] So you mean, brother Benam, you're\n[1:16:31] secondguessing what you thought.\n[1:16:37] Why did he do that? Because he\n[1:16:40] recognized the body of God,\n[1:16:43] God wanted to speak through his\n[1:16:46] congregation.\n[1:16:47] And unless God showed him a vision or a\n[1:16:49] dream or gave him a direct word from the\n[1:16:51] Lord,\n[1:16:53] this is the way he chose to let the\n[1:16:55] church run. This is the way it ought to\n[1:16:57] be run this very day.\n[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Now then, what did I do? I sacrificed my\n[1:17:02] own thoughts and throwed right in with\n[1:17:04] the church. Sure, let's do it.\n[1:17:08] Wow.\n[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So, instead of standing at the door,\n[1:17:12] don't do it, Rob. Don't do it, Peter.\n[1:17:14] Don't do it, Lance. Don't do it. Here,\n[1:17:16] tell pass it around. Pass it around.\n[1:17:17] Tell everybody I said no to tell them\n[1:17:19] not do it. Instead, brother Brown said,\n[1:17:21] let's do it. Let's rally. The majority\n[1:17:24] of this church wants to praise God.\n[1:17:26] Let's do it.\n[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's a real Christian with the Holy\n[1:17:30] Ghost.\n[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Lord Jesus. That's the\n[1:17:37] way it was in the Bible time, the way\n[1:17:40] the church voted, the sovereignty, the\n[1:17:43] groups of the people, they came together\n[1:17:45] in unity, their strength. So therefore,\n[1:17:47] I said certainly if that's the way the\n[1:17:50] church wants, if that's what God is\n[1:17:53] wanting, he's got more of authority to\n[1:17:57] vote\n[1:17:59] amongst a whole group of people than he\n[1:18:03] has to me.\n[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.\n[1:18:11] My\n[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you something, Rebecca.\n[1:18:17] Can you follow a man like this?\n[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I can.\n[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I can't follow some of these dictators\n[1:18:24] in the message. No. Any preacher that\n[1:18:27] stand up in the pull pit and let people\n[1:18:29] worship him. I ain't got the time of day\n[1:18:31] for that bunch myself. I could not\n[1:18:34] follow a man like that to the dollar\n[1:18:36] store and back. Ain't no way I'd be\n[1:18:37] scared death something happen to me on\n[1:18:39] my way out. I don't want nothing to do\n[1:18:41] with such a thing. I cannot follow a man\n[1:18:44] that will not admit his humanity and\n[1:18:47] admit his mistakes. Every one of us,\n[1:18:50] every great preacher that's ever been\n[1:18:52] has had his faults and his failures and\n[1:18:54] his mistakes.\n[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact, the people of\n[1:18:58] God admire you more when they can see\n[1:19:01] you admit them and make it right before\n[1:19:04] God. And the people, they'll have more\n[1:19:05] confidence in you than they did before.\n[1:19:08] Everybody will unless they're making an\n[1:19:10] idol out of you.\n[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this now.\n[1:19:17] It's what God is wanting. He's got more\n[1:19:19] of authority to vote amongst the people\n[1:19:21] or the whole group of people than he has\n[1:19:23] to me because I have no vision.\n[1:19:26] No vision to say that it shouldn't be.\n[1:19:31] Praise God.\n[1:19:33] So, we throw in with the church and move\n[1:19:36] with the church and I'm behind it to do\n[1:19:39] all that I can to help out the church.\n[1:19:43] That should be the motive of every\n[1:19:46] Christian and every person in the church\n[1:19:49] is to unify ourselves and stick\n[1:19:52] together. Whatever the church votes for,\n[1:19:55] that's what we should stand for. Then\n[1:19:57] say for instance, they want to change\n[1:20:00] something in the church. Well, then the\n[1:20:01] trustees want to, somebody else want to,\n[1:20:03] the deacon, they want to change\n[1:20:04] something, come before the church. And\n[1:20:06] if our idea seems a bit a little\n[1:20:08] different, listen now, than the church\n[1:20:11] does, let's sacrifice.\n[1:20:15] Let's sacrifice that idea. Now, why was\n[1:20:19] he telling the people that? Cuz that's\n[1:20:22] what he did.\n[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.\n[1:20:28] He sacrificed\n[1:20:30] his idea. It's not a word from the Lord.\n[1:20:32] It was not a vision, but it was his\n[1:20:35] idea. He didn't want to do it. Oh my.\n[1:20:39] Because that's the only way we can stand\n[1:20:41] united. And if this church will go on\n[1:20:43] the way you're going right now and be\n[1:20:44] united together, listen to this,\n[1:20:47] children. It's unlimited\n[1:20:51] what he'll do.\n[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.\n[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; If we'll stick together.\n[1:20:56] Is it any wonder then Satan wants to\n[1:20:59] divide us? He wants to divide us as a\n[1:21:02] family, a marriage, home, our church. He\n[1:21:05] wants to divide us as a message\n[1:21:07] movement. The message community is so\n[1:21:10] split and divided. That's why Satan does\n[1:21:13] it is to keep the supernatural power of\n[1:21:16] God. Oh, we've seen God do great things\n[1:21:18] to me. Oh, it's a miniature thing. What\n[1:21:21] it could be if we could be united\n[1:21:24] together. Oh my. How many want it with\n[1:21:26] all your heart by the baptism of the\n[1:21:28] Holy Ghost? I ain't talking about making\n[1:21:30] a great big denomination. I'm talking\n[1:21:32] about unifying on the principles that\n[1:21:35] God has given us in this last day.\n[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us Jesus.\n[1:21:42] My\n[1:21:44] notice,\n[1:21:46] that's how we want to be so complete\n[1:21:48] with one another. Again, the Hebrew\n[1:21:50] says, \"By the way, while I'm speaking,\n[1:21:52] somebody around this country somewhere\n[1:21:54] is guilty of riding some cards to move\n[1:21:59] Brother Neville out of this pull pit.\n[1:22:02] You're going to have to settle that with\n[1:22:03] me.\" Uhhuh. He says, \"That's right.\"\n[1:22:07] Yes, indeed. Said something about the\n[1:22:09] deacon. The deacon board has not one\n[1:22:11] thing to do with that, pastor.\n[1:22:14] No, sir. The congregation in full has\n[1:22:18] the authority. A deacon board is just a\n[1:22:21] policeman here in this church to keep\n[1:22:23] order and so forth. But when it comes to\n[1:22:25] the rules, the whole church\n[1:22:32] has to say so. This church is built upon\n[1:22:35] the sovereignty of the local church.\n[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, if you don't believe in\n[1:22:41] going to church, I don't guess you have\n[1:22:42] no sovereignty or authority. Amen.\n[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I have nothing to say in\n[1:22:47] moving this pastor. What?\n[1:22:52] William Brandom,\n[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; the founder supposedly of this cult\n[1:22:59] had no authority.\n[1:23:08] I pray God strikes some of you people\n[1:23:10] that streams out here and conviction\n[1:23:12] will hit your heart while you're right\n[1:23:13] there in front of your computer.\n[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.\n[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord God, if there's one\n[1:23:19] that's redeemable, Father,\n[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; look at what you're saying versus the\n[1:23:23] very facts of what this man taught.\n[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And the preachers in the message that\n[1:23:30] don't do this, don't believe what he\n[1:23:32] said.\n[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:23:36] My I have nothing to do in moving this\n[1:23:38] pastor or putting one in. I own the\n[1:23:40] property. It's given to the church. You\n[1:23:43] all are the church. You are the people,\n[1:23:45] the one who control. You're the church\n[1:23:47] yourself. And the church, the holy\n[1:23:49] church of God is the sovereignty of the\n[1:23:52] Holy Spirit in that church. And the only\n[1:23:54] thing I do is own the property. Give it\n[1:23:55] over to this church. Give it over for a\n[1:23:57] church. And it's taxfree. And the church\n[1:23:59] elects their own pastors.\n[1:24:02] I have nothing\n[1:24:06] to do with it.\n[1:24:09] And the only way this pastor could ever\n[1:24:11] leave would be the pastor decide himself\n[1:24:13] to go or the majority of the votes of\n[1:24:16] the church would have the say change the\n[1:24:19] pastor. That's the only way. And word of\n[1:24:22] life said,\n[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; amen.\n[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; The trustees have nothing to do with it.\n[1:24:30] only repair the church. Oh my, they\n[1:24:32] can't do it. The whole trustee board\n[1:24:34] must meet and says we build this and we\n[1:24:36] do that. Then they have to ask the\n[1:24:38] treasur. They've got the money to do it.\n[1:24:39] Therefore, no one person has nothing to\n[1:24:42] do in this. It's the majority of the\n[1:24:44] people. Yes, sir. If 20 votes for him\n[1:24:47] and 21 votes against him, he goes or\n[1:24:49] vice versa. That is the sovereignty\n[1:24:52] of the local church.\n[1:24:57] So I can see her\n[1:25:00] by now they're\n[1:25:02] half a day out\n[1:25:08] and Eleazar just got there explaining to\n[1:25:10] her why he was not a cult leader\n[1:25:15] and she could say\n[1:25:18] that's a relief.\n[1:25:26] But can you imagine that little girl\n[1:25:30] as she now transitions out from under\n[1:25:32] the headship that she's known all of her\n[1:25:34] life.\n[1:25:36] And verse 58 says, \"They called Rebecca\n[1:25:39] and said unto her, thou goest with this\n[1:25:41] man, and she said,\n[1:25:44] I will go.\"\n[1:25:47] This one simple act of faith\n[1:25:52] changed her life.\n[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; She was changed from being a servant to\n[1:26:00] being a bride.\n[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; She was changed to being a little girl\n[1:26:04] that was unknown out in the backside of\n[1:26:07] a wilderness somewhere. Oh, hallelujah.\n[1:26:09] To being one of the great matriarchs of\n[1:26:12] the faith of the tribes of Israel.\n[1:26:16] changed from a position of loneliness,\n[1:26:19] hallelujah, in the world and no doubt\n[1:26:21] being a type of the bride. She always\n[1:26:24] was a misfit just like most of us in\n[1:26:27] this place tonight. Even when you were a\n[1:26:30] little child, you was a misfit. Why?\n[1:26:32] That seed of God down inside of you was\n[1:26:35] crying to be born. It was crying for\n[1:26:38] manifestation. And no doubt when she\n[1:26:41] began to hear this Harry, it was\n[1:26:43] something that rung down in her soul\n[1:26:45] truer than anything she had ever heard\n[1:26:48] in her entire life.\n[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; She is now changing from poverty,\n[1:26:56] from her poverty\n[1:26:59] to Isaac's wealth.\n[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.\n[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Now remember when she\n[1:27:06] accepted the rings, when she accepted\n[1:27:09] the tab, when she accepted that she had\n[1:27:11] become officially engaged as we called\n[1:27:14] it or betrothed is the Old Testament\n[1:27:16] word for her for for this servant man to\n[1:27:19] even be allowed to touch her hand, not\n[1:27:22] like today like they do, but for him to\n[1:27:24] be allowed, she allowed him to touch her\n[1:27:27] hand to put the bracelets on. Amen. And\n[1:27:30] the prophet says the earrings as faith\n[1:27:31] cometh by hearing and by putting the\n[1:27:33] bracelets on was the working of her\n[1:27:35] hands. And for her to allow him to do\n[1:27:37] that. She did not have to say I accept\n[1:27:40] your master as my husband. It was the\n[1:27:43] reaction of her hand. Can't you\n[1:27:46] understand why God wants you to clap\n[1:27:48] yours? Can't you understand why God\n[1:27:50] wants you to raise yours in praise?\n[1:27:53] There's something about the hands. Amen.\n[1:27:56] There's something about the hands. We\n[1:27:59] ought to use ours for the glory of God.\n[1:28:01] We ought to use ours to be able to\n[1:28:03] praise and bless and magnify the name of\n[1:28:06] the Lord.\n[1:28:10] Oh my\n[1:28:13] what what motivated her? Well, this\n[1:28:16] messenger\n[1:28:18] even though maybe she didn't have any\n[1:28:21] credentials\n[1:28:22] but she saw proof. She saw proof of the\n[1:28:27] wealth of the man he was talking about\n[1:28:30] cuz she could tell by looking at that\n[1:28:32] man that he himself, you know, he he\n[1:28:34] certainly was no rich man himself. This\n[1:28:36] decision she made would change her for\n[1:28:40] the rest of her life. Not only her. How\n[1:28:43] many people down through the ages for\n[1:28:44] thousands of years have been blessed by\n[1:28:46] hearing this sermon about Rebecca\n[1:28:48] preached? It's affected me. Hasn't it\n[1:28:51] affected you? This one decision. Think\n[1:28:53] of it, friend. She's not a preacher.\n[1:28:55] She's not a prophet. But this decision\n[1:28:58] of faith has affected people since the\n[1:29:00] very day that woman made her decision.\n[1:29:02] And some of you think, \"I could never do\n[1:29:04] nothing for God.\" When you make your\n[1:29:06] decision to serve him, and you're going\n[1:29:08] to press beyond all your faults and your\n[1:29:10] failure. You never know who's watching\n[1:29:13] you. You never know who's looking at you\n[1:29:15] and said, \"I know they're going through\n[1:29:16] a hard time. And if they can do it, I\n[1:29:19] can do it, too.\" It was her decision\n[1:29:21] that they rallied around down through\n[1:29:24] the ages and even Paul Meyer the writer\n[1:29:26] of Hebrews put her in the great heroins\n[1:29:29] of faith that Rebecca identified why the\n[1:29:32] decision she made. Will you go with this\n[1:29:35] man I will go?\n[1:29:43] 1 Peter chapter 1:7 that the trial of\n[1:29:47] your faith being much more precious than\n[1:29:50] of gold that perisheth though it be\n[1:29:53] tried with fire might be found unto the\n[1:29:56] praise and honor and glory at the\n[1:29:59] appearing of Jesus Christ whom having\n[1:30:01] not seen.\n[1:30:03] Look at the parallel between you and\n[1:30:05] Rebecca.\n[1:30:07] You've not seen him. You was not there\n[1:30:09] at Calvary. You were not there\n[1:30:11] physically at the tomb when he raised\n[1:30:13] from the dead. You have not seen him. Oh\n[1:30:17] my homing have not seen yet love. It's\n[1:30:22] no wonder that we seem so crazy and so\n[1:30:24] unusual to the world that we give\n[1:30:26] everything we are. Oh that poor man and\n[1:30:28] his wife and them two boys that gave\n[1:30:30] their life for the cause of Christ to\n[1:30:32] something that was totally invisible.\n[1:30:34] But yet the visibility become manifest\n[1:30:37] after a while, didn't it? when they seen\n[1:30:39] a life a man that would stand there and\n[1:30:41] give his life and all that he had.\n[1:30:43] Praise God for the very cause of Jesus\n[1:30:46] Christ\n[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; whom having not seen ye love in whom\n[1:30:52] though now ye see him not yet believing.\n[1:30:56] How many can say amen to that?\n[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've not held his hands. I've not\n[1:31:00] reached down and touched his precious\n[1:31:02] feet, but I believe anyhow. I'm waiting\n[1:31:05] for the day. I'm waiting for the day\n[1:31:07] when I'll be able to do that.\n[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.\n[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Oh my. Whom they\n[1:31:11] have not seen you love. And whom though\n[1:31:14] now you see him not. Repeats it again\n[1:31:16] yet believe and you sit around with a\n[1:31:19] mlly grubs all sad and low down and you\n[1:31:21] don't even clap your hands. You ain't\n[1:31:22] got a smile on your face in 6 months and\n[1:31:24] you're just poor little old me. Poor\n[1:31:26] little old me. Wowy wy woo. That ain't\n[1:31:28] what Peter said. But he said you rejoice\n[1:31:31] with joy unspeakable and full of glory.\n[1:31:35] [Applause]\n[1:31:37] Oh my\n[1:31:40] praise be to God. Oh,\n[1:31:44] thank you Lord Jesus.\n[1:31:46] How in the world I I whenever I I was\n[1:31:50] studying on this, I found where one of\n[1:31:52] the Bible commentators had made this\n[1:31:54] statement about her. She was thought of\n[1:31:58] before she knew it and was chosen when\n[1:32:02] she did not know of the existence of her\n[1:32:06] bridegroom.\n[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; She was thought of before she knew it.\n[1:32:13] And she, oh glory, she was thought of\n[1:32:16] before she knew it and was chosen\n[1:32:20] when she did not even know of the\n[1:32:23] existence of her bridegroom. And I ask\n[1:32:25] you tonight, Rebecca, when were you\n[1:32:27] chosen? The night you come to the altar,\n[1:32:29] the night your daddy talked to you about\n[1:32:31] the Lord before the foundation of the\n[1:32:34] world. And there ain't enough devils in\n[1:32:35] hell to break that everlasting covenant\n[1:32:37] with a bride.\n[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was betrolled and accompanied\n[1:32:42] the servant to the land\n[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; of Canaan.\n[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight with all your\n[1:32:53] heart?\n[1:32:55] Notice this. The prophet said, \"Then\n[1:32:56] there was another great decision that\n[1:32:58] had to be made after she was given.\" And\n[1:33:01] the parents said, \"Well, just let her\n[1:33:03] stay around about 10 days and let her\n[1:33:05] hang around the revival to really feel\n[1:33:08] whether she has decided to do it or not.\n[1:33:11] I haven't got much confidence in a\n[1:33:13] person to make a decision to wait even\n[1:33:15] until tomorrow.\"\n[1:33:17] Why the devil talk you out of it? But\n[1:33:19] the message, the message\n[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; had stirred\n[1:33:25] Rebecca.\n[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't you understand? This is\n[1:33:28] why people can walk away from this great\n[1:33:31] message. It never stirred them. It never\n[1:33:35] stirred them like the angel. Oh, glory.\n[1:33:38] Did Rebecca that day? Why? You've had\n[1:33:42] your hard times. You've had your\n[1:33:43] difficulties. You've had this that and\n[1:33:45] the other. And because people cannot\n[1:33:48] answer a few things about the message\n[1:33:50] and about this story and that story. I\n[1:33:53] told Carol the other day, I said, \"I\n[1:33:54] probably got more of them human elements\n[1:33:56] than any of these defectors. I've had a\n[1:33:59] file for years and years and years.\" And\n[1:34:01] she said, \"Yeah, and it ain't turns you\n[1:34:03] away.\" And I said, \"No, it won't because\n[1:34:05] I'm not looking at that. I'm not\n[1:34:07] looking. I I realize that we have been\n[1:34:09] called by almighty God, not by a\n[1:34:12] Kuckian.\"\n[1:34:13] [Music]\n[1:34:15] Praise be to God.\n[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.\n[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; She\n[1:34:23] was satisfied.\n[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; The message.\n[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Was from God.\n[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; So let the parents said, \"Oh, let her\n[1:34:36] stick around a while. She'll get over\n[1:34:38] it.\"\n[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; We still ain't got over it, have we?\n[1:34:41] It's just a little excitement. She was\n[1:34:44] over to that revival, you know. But oh,\n[1:34:47] the true servant said, \"Don't worry us.\n[1:34:49] Don't hinder me.\" A lot of the servants\n[1:34:52] of God has been hindered by put off\n[1:34:54] decisions.\n[1:34:56] Don't hinder me saying that the Lord has\n[1:34:59] sent me, seeing that he's been good to\n[1:35:00] me. Don't hinder me. Then they said,\n[1:35:02] \"Let her make her own decision.\" That's\n[1:35:04] where you stand tonight. Make your own\n[1:35:07] decision. Then they called Rebecca and\n[1:35:10] said, \"Will you go with this man or do\n[1:35:13] you want to stay around a little while\n[1:35:16] to see if you really want to do it?\" She\n[1:35:19] said, \"I will go.\" She was ready. Her\n[1:35:22] decision was quickly made. Amen.\n[1:35:26] Something had been leading her.\n[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say someone.\n[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; It was not the man, Elizer. It was not\n[1:35:35] her mama. It was not her brother. It was\n[1:35:37] the presence of God.\n[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:35:41] Now notice, she commits herself.\n[1:35:44] She commits herself.\n[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.\n[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; By accepting this message, this message\n[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; of this unusual person.\n[1:35:55] and she will live the rest of her life\n[1:35:59] in a different sphere because of the\n[1:36:03] message she heard and received.\n[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Now this characterized by the way she\n[1:36:11] done this characterized the faith of\n[1:36:15] Abraham\n[1:36:18] and she didn't even know him.\n[1:36:20] So, she's believing in the same way her\n[1:36:24] future father-in-law believed\n[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; cuz he claimed those things which were\n[1:36:30] not as though they were.\n[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And he didn't consider his own body now\n[1:36:35] dead, neither deadness of Sarah's womb,\n[1:36:37] but he looked at the promise of God. And\n[1:36:40] this is what Eleazar is looking for in a\n[1:36:42] bride to marry Isaac. A woman that will\n[1:36:45] be compatible with the revelation of the\n[1:36:49] message that the whole family was now\n[1:36:51] needed to be have. Now it said we\n[1:36:53] absolutely know that Esau didn't have\n[1:36:55] it. Others down through the same lineage\n[1:36:57] did not have it. But this is what he's\n[1:37:00] looking for. Those who can receive the\n[1:37:03] word.\n[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord. So when Abraham\n[1:37:10] notice was instructed to circumcise the\n[1:37:14] males of his household,\n[1:37:17] he didn't wait 3 days and let me pray\n[1:37:19] about it. Let me go on a fast now for\n[1:37:20] about 7 days or 10 days. But the Bible\n[1:37:22] says early the next morning\n[1:37:27] again after Abraham was instructed to\n[1:37:30] offer his son as a burnt offering early\n[1:37:34] the next morning. Don't you see why\n[1:37:36] Satan wants you to put off decisions?\n[1:37:38] And the spirit of God will speak to you\n[1:37:40] and deal with you. Quit this. Don't get\n[1:37:42] around that person. Stay away from them.\n[1:37:44] Leave them alone. Don't do this. Don't\n[1:37:46] do that. And you keep hanging on and\n[1:37:48] hanging on and hanging on and putting\n[1:37:52] off a decision. Oh, hear me tonight,\n[1:37:54] church.\n[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; But you see, Abraham did not wait. Why?\n[1:37:59] He knew his humanity. It would try to\n[1:38:02] talk him out of Brother Nathan. Why?\n[1:38:03] There's no way this can be sensible that\n[1:38:05] God would want me to act like a heathen.\n[1:38:08] The heathen Canaanites offer their\n[1:38:10] children as a burnt offering. God cannot\n[1:38:13] surely mean that. That ain't what God\n[1:38:15] meant. Maybe it was spiritual. Somehow\n[1:38:17] it was spiritual. I better take another\n[1:38:19] day or two and think about it. But he\n[1:38:21] acted immediately. Why? He was afraid.\n[1:38:24] That human element overwhelming. Come\n[1:38:26] on, don't sit there and look at me like\n[1:38:27] you don't know what I'm talking about.\n[1:38:28] How many of us have talked oursel out of\n[1:38:31] the will of God because we delayed and\n[1:38:33] we waited and we delayed?\n[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my\n[1:38:39] Lord Jesus.\n[1:38:42] Hallelujah.\n[1:38:44] So you imagine this is Rebecca's\n[1:38:47] disposition toward the message. Delayed\n[1:38:52] disobedience\n[1:38:54] only weakens faith.\n[1:38:57] So you keep putting it off. Well, I'm\n[1:38:59] going to pray about it and I'm going to\n[1:39:01] I'm going to do like Gideon. I'm going\n[1:39:03] to put out a fleece and then I'm going\n[1:39:05] to put out a pig and then I'm going to\n[1:39:07] put out a cow. What are you going to do?\n[1:39:08] Put out everything you got?\n[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Can you show me in the New Testament\n[1:39:14] where they done that?\n[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.\n[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And some of you make decisions about\n[1:39:20] your life and your family based on such\n[1:39:23] things.\n[1:39:25] Well, in the morning, if it's still on\n[1:39:26] my mind and I'm still breathing, I'll\n[1:39:29] know it's from God.\n[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; The devil will make sure you live at\n[1:39:33] least till 10:00.\n[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; He loves it when we get out of the will\n[1:39:40] of God.\n[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got a fleece before the Lord.\n[1:39:44] I've got a fleece. The Bible does not\n[1:39:47] say sons of God are led by fleeces.\n[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It says they are led by the spirit of\n[1:39:53] God.\n[1:39:54] Come on, somebody. Oh, somebody don't\n[1:39:56] like this shirt here tonight. Who is it?\n[1:39:58] I keep looking. I'll find you here in a\n[1:39:59] minute. Why did God give you the Holy\n[1:40:02] Ghost? Not so I'm going to put my coat\n[1:40:03] out tonight. If it's dry all around it\n[1:40:05] in the morning, I'll know it's the Lord.\n[1:40:07] Well, the devil had a bunch of angels\n[1:40:08] camping around all over it if he thought\n[1:40:10] he could mess you up and 25 more people\n[1:40:12] along with you. Come on, somebody. But\n[1:40:14] we got the Holy Ghost. We don't need, my\n[1:40:18] friends. We don't need to call this man\n[1:40:20] or that man. You got a word from the\n[1:40:21] Lord for me? Have you got this from it?\n[1:40:23] What about a dream? What about this,\n[1:40:25] that, and the other? As many as are led\n[1:40:27] by the spirit of God, they are the sons\n[1:40:29] of God.\n[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You see, when we delay our obedience,\n[1:40:41] 10 days can turn into 10 weeks.\n[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; 10 weeks turn into 10 months.\n[1:40:48] 10 months turn into 10 years.\n[1:40:51] And you've lost those 10 years of your\n[1:40:53] life for what?\n[1:40:56] Delayed obedience.\n[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord Jesus.\n[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Let me close with this here momentarily.\n[1:41:07] And they sent away Rebecca,\n[1:41:10] their sister,\n[1:41:12] and her nurse,\n[1:41:15] and Abraham's servant,\n[1:41:18] and his men.\n[1:41:20] Now as she leaves,\n[1:41:23] she is now the bride elect,\n[1:41:29] but her actual union with Isaac will not\n[1:41:33] occur\n[1:41:36] for another month or so.\n[1:41:39] So while she's going along on this\n[1:41:42] journey,\n[1:41:44] there's an invisible union that's being\n[1:41:47] formed in her heart toward this man that\n[1:41:52] the this servant is describing.\n[1:41:55] Now, you know, he didn't take all of his\n[1:41:57] time. As a matter of fact, brother Ben\n[1:41:58] said whenever he got there that he\n[1:42:00] didn't even have time to talk about\n[1:42:02] himself. He didn't talk about his\n[1:42:04] campaigns and how many people he had\n[1:42:06] prayed for and how many people got\n[1:42:08] healed and got that. and all the other.\n[1:42:10] He said he was so busy talking about his\n[1:42:15] master. Now, he knows that he has but a\n[1:42:18] limited time by pulling this girl out of\n[1:42:22] this scenario that she's in. 16 years\n[1:42:25] old, still moldable, still changeable,\n[1:42:27] and he's got a limited time. I don't\n[1:42:29] imagine he waited till they got about\n[1:42:30] 383 miles down the road. And then he\n[1:42:33] said, \"You know what? If only got a\n[1:42:34] little bit further, I better go and tell\n[1:42:35] her about the bridegroom.\" Imagine when\n[1:42:37] he got out, she started getting calmed\n[1:42:38] and relaxed and either she started out a\n[1:42:41] question and answer session or he\n[1:42:43] started just go ahead and preaching on\n[1:42:44] God and simplicity of the breach God and\n[1:42:47] simplicity breaking open the seals and\n[1:42:49] helping Rebecca to see who this man was\n[1:42:52] because he's got a journey not only to\n[1:42:54] pick the right one and a great\n[1:42:56] obligation to pick the right one but to\n[1:42:59] help her fall in love with this\n[1:43:01] bridegroom. Cuz remember, just heard the\n[1:43:03] prophet say today, whenever he saw her\n[1:43:06] and she saw him, it was love at first\n[1:43:10] sight.\n[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It was love at first\n[1:43:14] sight. So, it didn't have to iron them\n[1:43:16] down. Okay. What size is your feet? Let\n[1:43:17] me see. How long is your hair, your\n[1:43:19] eyes? What color is your eyes? I don't\n[1:43:20] like hazel eyes. No, no, no. You're I\n[1:43:21] don't like hazel eyes. She didn't have\n[1:43:23] to weigh him on a set of scales. How\n[1:43:24] much do you weigh now? Let me see your\n[1:43:26] father because you will become what your\n[1:43:28] father is. So, I don't know. Has he got\n[1:43:29] hair? Is he not got hair? You know, how\n[1:43:31] big is he? How big around is he? Well,\n[1:43:33] praise the Lord. But what I what this\n[1:43:36] servant had done had brought such drama\n[1:43:39] and such dramatics of reality to her\n[1:43:44] every day. Imagine she'd lay down at\n[1:43:47] night.\n[1:43:48] Oh,\n[1:43:50] I feel like I already know him.\n[1:43:56] Wow. I'm going to marry a man I've never\n[1:43:59] seen before. But somehow it's like\n[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; we've always been together. Like\n[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; it's almost like it's almost like I mean\n[1:44:10] like you know like that we we stepped\n[1:44:14] out of eternity together.\n[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I mean I I can't explain really what\n[1:44:20] what's going on here within me. I know\n[1:44:22] it's me. I'm changing somehow. And the\n[1:44:26] words that he keeps saying, it's like an\n[1:44:28] open book that just But the book is a\n[1:44:32] person. The book is a person. And every\n[1:44:35] page that he turns of this person's\n[1:44:37] life, I'm falling more in love not with\n[1:44:40] the messenger,\n[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; but with his message of introduction to\n[1:44:45] Isaac. The problem is friends, a lot of\n[1:44:48] the message folks, they fell in love\n[1:44:49] with brother Brandham more than they do\n[1:44:50] the Lord Jesus.\n[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; They want to talk about brother Brandham\n[1:44:53] more than they do the Lord Jesus.\n[1:44:54] Brother Brandham, this brother Brandham,\n[1:44:56] Brother Brandon, Brother Brandham. I\n[1:44:57] think we ought to give credit to the\n[1:44:58] servant of God what he deserves. But he\n[1:45:00] did not die for us. He did not raise\n[1:45:02] from the dead for us. He's not coming\n[1:45:04] back from for us. He was a sinner saved\n[1:45:07] by the grace of God. He is our brother.\n[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Say it again. He is our brother. We're\n[1:45:15] not here to worship William, Mary, and\n[1:45:17] Brandham. As a matter of fact, he taught\n[1:45:20] us against such heretic things in the\n[1:45:23] first place. We are here to worship our\n[1:45:26] Lord Jesus. But we do believe our Lord\n[1:45:29] Jesus has sent us an Eleaser.\n[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.\n[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,\n[1:45:40] praise God.\n[1:45:45] Now watch as she's fixing to leave in\n[1:45:48] verse 60.\n[1:45:50] And they blessed Rebecca.\n[1:45:53] and said unto her, \"Thou art our sister.\n[1:45:59] Be thou the mother\n[1:46:02] of thousands\n[1:46:05] of millions,\n[1:46:11] and let thy seed\n[1:46:14] possess the gate\n[1:46:17] of those which hate him.\"\n[1:46:22] Now, I marvel at this\n[1:46:25] because it wasn't over there in that\n[1:46:26] land\n[1:46:29] that the Lord God gave this message of\n[1:46:32] his seed possessing the gate to Abraham,\n[1:46:34] but it's when he come out.\n[1:46:37] I marvel that they knew about it.\n[1:46:41] Where did they hear this at?\n[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; So, they are saying something upon her.\n[1:46:52] their blessing upon her.\n[1:46:55] It's not even for them.\n[1:46:58] But God used them to pronounce this\n[1:47:03] on Rebecca.\n[1:47:11] sort of reminds me, Carol, dear,\n[1:47:14] of that Sunday morning that you and I\n[1:47:16] got married,\n[1:47:20] but we believed in going to church. So,\n[1:47:22] we got married Sunday morning.\n[1:47:25] We went to church on Sunday night.\n[1:47:28] My uncle, I never heard him preach on\n[1:47:30] predestination or election or\n[1:47:31] fornowledge,\n[1:47:33] but at the end of the service, I got up\n[1:47:35] to play my guitar and sang and all that.\n[1:47:38] And my uncle called Carol up, laid hands\n[1:47:41] on both of us and wanted to pray for us.\n[1:47:43] Start speaking in tongues,\n[1:47:46] prophesying.\n[1:47:49] Yeah. The Lord God say, \"I called you\n[1:47:52] before the foundation of the world.\n[1:47:55] I ordained you and predestinated you.\" I\n[1:47:58] mean, I'd heard of them words in the\n[1:48:00] Bible, but I didn't even know what them\n[1:48:01] meant. I was so ignorant of the Bible.\n[1:48:06] I'm not sure my uncle did. I don't\n[1:48:08] remember hearing preach. Did you? But\n[1:48:10] you know what they was doing? God was\n[1:48:12] using him. He was a good man. We'll see\n[1:48:14] him one of these days, Harry. Good man\n[1:48:16] that loved God. Hallelujah.\n[1:48:19] I called you before the foundation of\n[1:48:21] the world. I predestinated you to be\n[1:48:23] together. I mean, went through all these\n[1:48:25] words and we're just standing there. Oh\n[1:48:27] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,\n[1:48:28] Jesus. You see, that's one church\n[1:48:30] service I'm glad we didn't miss. Ain't\n[1:48:31] you Carol? Now, we could have went out\n[1:48:33] on our honeymoon. I don't think we could\n[1:48:35] have had any better honeymoon than what\n[1:48:36] we had right there. That night we heard\n[1:48:38] from eternity.\n[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.\n[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Notice be thou the mother of thousands\n[1:48:46] of millions.\n[1:48:52] And she was the\n[1:48:56] and the Israelites\n[1:49:02] both sprang from her.\n[1:49:07] Let thy seed possess the gate of those\n[1:49:09] that hate them. Exercise dominion and\n[1:49:12] authority over their enemies.\n[1:49:16] I do wish Hezbollah,\n[1:49:19] Hamas,\n[1:49:20] Syria, Iran, all the rest of them that\n[1:49:24] hate Israel.\n[1:49:27] I wish they'd read this in the Bible.\n[1:49:30] God has destroyed nations for that\n[1:49:33] little tiny place.\n[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; The land of Israel about the size of the\n[1:49:36] state of New Jersey. Just recently,\n[1:49:39] Syria was going to be the great mighty\n[1:49:41] power that was going to do this and that\n[1:49:42] and the other. Look at it today on its\n[1:49:44] knees.\n[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Look at Iran. It ain't been but just a\n[1:49:47] few mo months ago that our nation itself\n[1:49:51] was so concerned about what Iran was\n[1:49:54] going to do. And this very day, Iran is\n[1:49:57] almost on its knees. Even their\n[1:49:59] president saying they have no more water\n[1:50:02] to drink. You can't fight a war without\n[1:50:04] water now, can you? So what did God say?\n[1:50:08] I'll curse them that curse you. I'll\n[1:50:11] bless them that bless you. Now you see,\n[1:50:14] you want to marry a woman, brothers,\n[1:50:17] brother,\n[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; that God can say the same thing about\n[1:50:20] your wife that he says about you\n[1:50:23] sisters. You want to marry a man that\n[1:50:26] God can say the same thing to your\n[1:50:29] husband that he can say to you. God\n[1:50:31] could not have said this to a daughter\n[1:50:35] of\n[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Canaan.\n[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; God could not have said this prophecy to\n[1:50:40] a Canaanite.\n[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Why don't y'all come over and join us?\n[1:50:50] Why don't y'all Boy, y'all got some good\n[1:50:52] music. Y'all got some good preachers.\n[1:50:54] Sign your church in with us. We don't\n[1:50:56] want to be identified with them\n[1:50:58] Canaanite\n[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Woo! Lord have mercy.\n[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.\n[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And you just remember, you heard it from\n[1:51:06] an idiot. Okay. Somebody that did not\n[1:51:09] even graduate from high school, all of\n[1:51:12] those who stand against this bride, you\n[1:51:15] will be condemned.\n[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You will be judged.\n[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; That's not my words. That's the words of\n[1:51:22] Almighty God. All the price he's paid\n[1:51:24] for his beloved. All that he's done for\n[1:51:27] his beloved and for those who ridicule\n[1:51:29] her life at her, make fun at her. Oh, I\n[1:51:32] tell you one thing. I don't want to be\n[1:51:33] one of them. Do you?\n[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.\n[1:51:38] Let me close. You see, a preacher's got\n[1:51:41] a lot of doors open when he's preaching.\n[1:51:43] So you when you say, \"Brother Don, you\n[1:51:44] saying you've been closing?\" Well, I'm\n[1:51:45] closing one door after another after\n[1:51:47] another after another. I've had a lot of\n[1:51:48] doors open. our text. So I'm closed.\n[1:51:51] And Rebecca\n[1:51:53] arose\n[1:51:55] and her\n[1:51:58] damsels\n[1:52:02] and they rode upon the camels\n[1:52:04] and\n[1:52:08] what followed the man.\n[1:52:13] And the servant took Rebecca\n[1:52:18] and went\n[1:52:20] his way.\n[1:52:23] So what was his way?\n[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; God's way.\n[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing the last door.\n[1:52:33] I hear God's prophet say something like\n[1:52:35] this.\n[1:52:37] And you can only serve God on earth.\n[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. is God's servants that sent on\n[1:52:43] earth\n[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; interpret God's word\n[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; to you.\n[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Wilt thou follow this man? Now remember\n[1:52:57] it's twofold. It's Christ Jesus first of\n[1:53:00] all and then Christ Jesus sent us a\n[1:53:02] messenger.\n[1:53:04] I can say yes to both.\n[1:53:07] I have decided\n[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; I'll follow Jesus.\n[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; No turning back.\n[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; No turning back. I gave him my teens, my\n[1:53:20] 20s, my 30s, my 40s, my 50s. I'm in the\n[1:53:25] last year of my 60s.\n[1:53:28] Brother John, don't you regret going out\n[1:53:30] and sewing wild oats? No, I don't regret\n[1:53:32] sewing wild oats. I'm glad I sowed good\n[1:53:34] ones. The only regrets I have is the\n[1:53:37] mistakes I've made. I have no regrets\n[1:53:42] of giving my life to Jesus. As brother\n[1:53:44] Rem said, I only wish I had more than\n[1:53:45] one to give him. How many feels the same\n[1:53:48] way tonight?\n[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Has it been easy? No, that ain't been\n[1:53:51] easy, but I wouldn't want it to be easy.\n[1:53:54] I want to fall in the way of the Lord's\n[1:53:55] despised few.\n[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to sing the song that I\n[1:53:59] gave you the story of.\n[1:54:02] And I want you to think now, if you'd\n[1:54:05] have been there in the crowd that day,\n[1:54:06] would you have questioned Jesus\n[1:54:10] that Jesus allowed them two innocent\n[1:54:12] boys to be killed,\n[1:54:14] that innocent mother to be killed,\n[1:54:17] and then that innocent man, you stand\n[1:54:19] there said, \"How could that be the glory\n[1:54:20] of God? How in the world could God ever\n[1:54:22] get something out of that?\"\n[1:54:24] You see, that's the way it can be in our\n[1:54:26] lives, too. We look and think, \"I just\n[1:54:27] don't understand. I don't understand\n[1:54:28] it.\" No. and you probably never will,\n[1:54:33] but I've served him long enough to know\n[1:54:35] when I don't understand him, I trust him\n[1:54:38] anyway,\n[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; cuz he's God. And I know I ain't\n[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I know you all ain't\n[1:54:46] either.\n[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well just accept it.\n[1:54:50] He's the mighty God and we're little\n[1:54:51] nothings\n[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; without him.\n[1:54:55] So if he wants to take this from me to\n[1:54:57] make me this. If he wants to take that\n[1:54:59] from me to make me this. I wonder when\n[1:55:02] all them tribes people then you wonder\n[1:55:04] how many of them went out and witnessed\n[1:55:05] to others and they went out and\n[1:55:06] witnessed to others and they went out\n[1:55:08] and witnessed to others. I wonder how\n[1:55:09] many will be standing there the day that\n[1:55:11] day when them four people walk up there\n[1:55:12] and Jesus gives them a martyr's crown\n[1:55:16] and then they'll look back behind them\n[1:55:17] and they'll be all them people that\n[1:55:20] believed.\n[1:55:22] Not because they're long dress and the\n[1:55:24] long hair, but because they suffered\n[1:55:27] and they died.\n[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.\n[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to meet that family.\n[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I have decided\n[1:55:43] to follow Jesus.\n[1:55:47] Pick up the Lord.\n[1:55:49] I have decided\n[1:55:54] to follow\n[1:55:56] Jesus.\n[1:56:00] I have decided.\n[1:56:05] Aren't you glad you did it, brother Ben?\n[1:56:07] So many years ago, my brother,\n[1:56:11] no turning back.\n[1:56:14] Thank God.\n[1:56:17] No turning back.\n[1:56:20] Are you sure?\n[1:56:22] If none go with me,\n[1:56:28] still I will fall.\n[1:56:33] Oh, if none go with me,\n[1:56:39] still I will follow.\n[1:56:45] If none knows\n[1:56:48] me,\n[1:56:50] still I will follow.\n[1:56:56] No turning back.\n[1:57:01] What about young people? Have we\n[1:57:03] decided? Can we sing it together? I have\n[1:57:06] decided. I have decided\n[1:57:12] to follow Jesus.\n[1:57:17] Oh, I have decided\n[1:57:23] I'm going to follow\n[1:57:25] Jesus.\n[1:57:29] I have decided.\n[1:57:33] Thank you, Lord God. Thank you for\n[1:57:35] helping me make that decision so many\n[1:57:37] years ago. Lord,\n[1:57:40] help me, Lord, that your spirit moved on\n[1:57:43] me when I Lord, I didn't throw my\n[1:57:46] teenage years away or my 20s or my 30s\n[1:57:49] or whatever. Lord, thank you, Lord, for\n[1:57:51] helping me, dear God. Thank you, Lord\n[1:57:54] Jesus. Oh, Father, maybe some here\n[1:57:57] tonight they've still not made that\n[1:57:59] commitment. May the spirit of God move\n[1:58:01] on their hearts out here Lord that they\n[1:58:04] can make a complete surrender in the\n[1:58:07] presence of God.\n[1:58:10] Oh hallelujah.\n[1:58:12] What about it brother? If your children\n[1:58:15] are taken there in India that day are\n[1:58:19] you going to follow him? I have decided\n[1:58:22] to follow Jesus. No turning back.\n[1:58:29] No turning back.\n[1:58:33] Oh my, don't not go with me. So your\n[1:58:39] wife and your two sons are laying dead\n[1:58:42] in front of you and the spirit of God\n[1:58:46] speak these words out of you. Don't none\n[1:58:49] go with me.\n[1:58:51] Still I will follow.\n[1:58:57] Oh no. And now you're asked, I give you\n[1:59:02] one more chance to turn your back on\n[1:59:04] Jesus.\n[1:59:05] Will you turn away?\n[1:59:08] No turning back.\n[1:59:12] No,\n[1:59:13] I won't turn back. I have decided. I\n[1:59:20] have decided\n[1:59:24] I'm going to follow\n[1:59:27] Jesus.\n[1:59:29] Aren't you glad you have decided\n[1:59:35] to follow\n[1:59:38] Jesus?\n[1:59:41] Hallelujah.\n[1:59:42] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we worship you\n[1:59:46] tonight, Father.\n[1:59:48] Follow Jesus.\n[1:59:52] No turning back.\n[1:59:58] No turning\n[2:00:00] back.\n[2:00:05] Hallelujah.\n[2:00:09] Sing the camel train for us.\n[2:00:12] Praise the Lord. Before Harry sings,\n[2:00:16] I didn't hear all the requests that\n[2:00:18] Brother Louie had had made known, but or\n[2:00:20] or Justin rather, but I I know I'm I'm\n[2:00:23] aware of several folks in the church\n[2:00:26] that are sick and really dealing with\n[2:00:28] some really difficult situations right\n[2:00:30] now. And I'd like for us as believers if\n[2:00:33] we could just join together before we\n[2:00:36] sing this song. If you'd like to take\n[2:00:38] someone by the hand or lay your hand\n[2:00:39] over on the shoulder or whatever, move\n[2:00:41] out if you don't feel comfortable by the\n[2:00:43] person you're standing beside so we can\n[2:00:47] right now as the saints of God. The\n[2:00:49] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous\n[2:00:54] man\n[2:00:55] avaleth much.\n[2:00:58] And it's not just men either that God's\n[2:01:00] here. God hears the daughters.\n[2:01:03] If any two on earth agree touching\n[2:01:06] anything, it shall be done. If ye abide\n[2:01:09] in me, and my words abide in you, ask\n[2:01:14] what you will. Delight thyself also in\n[2:01:17] the Lord, and he will give thee the\n[2:01:19] desires of thine heart. Hitherto you've\n[2:01:23] asked nothing in my name, but ask that\n[2:01:27] your joys may be full. Knock and it\n[2:01:30] shall be open unto you. Seek, you shall\n[2:01:33] find.\n[2:01:35] Let's knock together. Let's seek\n[2:01:37] together.\n[2:01:39] Heavenly Father, just today, Father God,\n[2:01:43] we've heard of\n[2:01:45] different ones in the church that are\n[2:01:47] sick. Brother Keith's Lynch, at least\n[2:01:50] they were able to hopefully finally\n[2:01:52] diagnose, Lord, what he's going through\n[2:01:55] and facing his gallbladder to be removed\n[2:01:58] tomorrow, Father. And Sister Becky\n[2:02:01] Lynch, Brother Melvin had text me this\n[2:02:03] evening, Lord, and he had to take her\n[2:02:06] father in for medical attention as well.\n[2:02:09] And then, dear God, you hear this\n[2:02:11] precious little this little child. Lord\n[2:02:14] God, we're asking for her. Dear Jesus,\n[2:02:19] you see this situation and Lord, you\n[2:02:22] know the rarity of this thing that she's\n[2:02:24] been diagnosed with. But Father, it does\n[2:02:27] not change your power. Lord, others in\n[2:02:30] the church that are sick and afflicted,\n[2:02:32] some weary from fighting battles, and\n[2:02:35] some, Lord, they feel like their\n[2:02:36] strength is gone, and they may feel\n[2:02:38] distraught and heavy tonight. But Lord\n[2:02:41] God, as your children, we agree\n[2:02:43] together. Father, I really wonder what\n[2:02:46] our church what our church would be able\n[2:02:49] to see by your great hands if we could\n[2:02:52] have the unity that the prophet\n[2:02:54] described to us right here tonight. If\n[2:02:57] we would be able to just lay aside our\n[2:02:59] differences and our petty arguments of\n[2:03:02] this and that and the other and just say\n[2:03:04] we're brothers. We disagree, but but\n[2:03:06] we're brothers. We're sisters and we\n[2:03:08] disagree, but we're sisters and we we\n[2:03:11] want the same thing. I believe Lord\n[2:03:14] there will be a church. There is a\n[2:03:16] church already in the making, already on\n[2:03:19] the earth right now. Oh hallelujah. That\n[2:03:22] Satan will not be able to stop. Oh\n[2:03:25] father, I pray that you would help us to\n[2:03:28] be a part of that group of believers.\n[2:03:30] Lord, we agree together, Father, for\n[2:03:33] those that are hurting, those that are\n[2:03:35] needy, those that are sick. Father,\n[2:03:37] those dealing with oppression and\n[2:03:39] sadness and all the things that Satan\n[2:03:41] brings against your children, move for\n[2:03:44] them tonight. Lord, we believe together\n[2:03:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. And the\n[2:03:50] saints of God said,\n[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\"\n[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it for us. Let's sing it\n[2:03:54] together. Oh, praise the Lord. Right\n[2:03:57] before we get ready to dismiss, how many\n[2:03:58] can say, \"It's been good to be at the\n[2:04:00] house of the Lord tonight.\" Amen.\n[2:04:04] It was a day in early springtime by an\n[2:04:08] ancient wayside well. Eler\n[2:04:12] paused to rest his camel train.\n[2:04:18] He had found a bride for Isaac\n[2:04:22] the evening shadows fall for his weary\n[2:04:27] journey had not been in vain.\n[2:04:33] So he took the fair\n[2:04:36] dressed in jewels rich and rare quickly\n[2:04:41] to her waiting bridegroom far away.\n[2:04:47] Oh where Rebecca loved her Isaac and he\n[2:04:52] loved Rebecca fair. Oh it must have been\n[2:04:57] a happy wedding day.\n[2:05:01] Everybody now. Oh,\n[2:05:05] get ready. The shadows fall.\n[2:05:11] Don't you hear the alies call\n[2:05:17] for there's already been a wedding.\n[2:05:21] Greater joy will soon begin\n[2:05:26] in the evening when the tra comes in.\n[2:05:31] I want to sing it again now. Oh,\n[2:05:35] get ready. Demon\n[2:05:38] shadows fall. Aren't you glad you've\n[2:05:41] heard it? Aren't you glad you've heard\n[2:05:44] the ele?\n[2:05:47] Thank God there's already been a\n[2:05:50] wedding. Greater joys will soon begin\n[2:05:56] in the evening when the camel train\n[2:06:00] comes in.\n[2:06:01] [Music]\n[2:06:03] Now our blessed holy father\n[2:06:07] sent a prophet from above. He came down\n[2:06:12] to earth to find an elected bride.\n[2:06:16] Praise God for our Isaac over yonder has\n[2:06:23] prepared his tents of love and he wants\n[2:06:27] his fair Rebecca by his side. Everybody\n[2:06:32] now praise God. Oh\n[2:06:36] get ready\n[2:06:39] shadows fall. God bless you saints. I\n[2:06:42] love you the Lord.\n[2:06:49] already been a wedding. Greater joy will\n[2:06:54] soon begin\n[2:06:57] in the evening when the camel train\n[2:07:00] comes in.\n[2:07:05] Oh, get ready.\n[2:07:08] The evening shadows fall.\n[2:07:12] Don't you hear the alies call?\n[2:07:19] There's already been the wedding.\n[2:07:22] Greater joy will soon begin\n[2:07:27] in the evening when the camel train\n[2:07:31] comes.\n[2:07:36] Amen. Let's just sing this little song\n[2:07:39] as we go. with the only song I could\n[2:07:40] really think of that fit fit that I\n[2:07:43] could remember. Be no turning back.\n[2:07:45] Amen.

be challenges now appear to be blessings greetings one and all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I would like to greet the founder the Visionary leader of Al Tabernacle Christian College our Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco his sons Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Jude sister Abby and the Rosco family at large I am truly honored to be standing before you at this momentous ceremony the 20th anniversity of the best school in the world it's amazing how the two years given to us by the critics has spanned to become 20 years I have been privileged to be called to be what they call furniture of the school my mom says I literally begged to be at the school at the tender age of three thank God I was already party today and Glenn thank God if someone had told me that I would be standing here as an alarmist 20 years later I wouldn't believe you I can still see madal staring as she lowers her glasses and glares into your soul to say perform Jay or he brother Glenn laughing in assembly at to his own jokes my arms still remember the burn as M Teddy drilled us arms up sideways down just to get our attention or the weight in my B in my the weight of the bell in in my hand as I was the designated Val ringer this was way before the bleding sidon of brother Owen's horn was imprinted in my mind I can't forget the assemblies when we'd sing Story and run around the sanctuary the days we spend playing church church or open Gates on the grass or when we'd spot that car driving into the rco parking time Stood Still as we flocked to the driver's side door just to feel the warm embrace when the apostle would hug you I'm just reminded of the first award ceremony okay being a 4-year-old girl I was very young so this was too long the ceremony took way too long but I still remember M Sheila waking me up taking me by the hand and walking with me to the podium as I collected the first and only most popular award it was a good memory in my life I can go on reeling about the wonderful times I've had in this place but nothing can ever compare to the moments spent in in the presence of the Lord whether it be on a Tuesday during break when we would come into the sanctuary to pray or Friday morning when the minister would preach or morning assemblies when a tape would be played or the simple Act of reminiscing on the Sunday or the combined preaching the angel of the lord always graced us with his presence You Never Know What You've Got Till It's Gone I can truly attest to this whenever you having a bad day or feeling distressed if you would just knock on Heaven's Door he would answer you would walk in the hallways you would feel the presence of the Lord or you'd even bump into the Apostle or his sons and you just feel better while walking in the passages I just want to thank God for sending his servant our way for giving him a vision and the Zeal to see it through to fruition I personally don't know where or what I would be if it were not for these walls the safe haven against the evil World a place that not only nurtured us and fed us naturally but spirit spiritually the school hasn't only produced doctors accountants engineers and lawyers but it produced learned individuals who know who God is and where he can be [Applause] found I want each and every one of us to take a look around every brick every pillar every window and every door if you don't believe in the Supernatural you are sitting in a miracle that took 9 years I mean 9 months 9 months people to materialize when he laid the first four bricks appointing Michael Gabriel rapael and urel I believe that the Apostle made provision for everything that has transpired in these 20 years thank you Lord for sending your gift our way thank you Apostle for a vision that saw us through and thank you to the Rosco family that gave their father to us Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it thank you Lord for a place that taught us how to fly with both Wings God bless you K just give another beautiful [Applause] hand the next individual one of the first great 12s in 2005 the first head girl of el Tabernacle Christian College in the Year 2005 currently practicing as a chartered accountant can we welcome Jolene [Applause] ludik so I may be from the first class but uh I will say that I keep up with the time so excuse me as I just log in prudy um it's such an honor and a privilege to be here um I must say as I walked in I couldn't help but remember that first day brother Glenn and the small wall at the back there and it just became so real for me um it is an incredible honor and a blessing and a privilege to stand here and speak a little bit about the school and the impact that the school has had on my life so I just firstly want to start by acknowledging the man of God I I think that it goes without saying when you see a man's fruits and his works you cannot doubt that God is with him and I I couldn't help but remember I think it was in Petoria and prudy alluded to this when the Apostle actually announced his vision for this church and the school came with that Vision as well and I remember the Apostle saying that this school will become one of the greatest Outreach mechan mechanisms of the ministry and you know today as I sit here and I think and I look at the faces that sit before me and the ones who have sat in the seats that you now occupy so many Souls that have come through this ministry we can't but thank God for a gift in this [Music] ministry and the and I think it would be a great miss if I do not acknowledge our leadership Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Sister Abigail the rosow [Applause] family I remember even sister Sheila the first day and when I came into the ministry I was still a young Christian a very young Christian uh when I came into the school and theila was so instrumental in helping me understand a lot of things and I just want to acknowledge her as well and then I think to just end off my introduction I'd like to just appreciate the teachers of e Tabernacle brother Glenn brother Owen all of the teachers each each one I think that you are handpicked you are chosen of God to cross paths with so many lives and make a difference you may never know the impact that you have um in our lives and I think each of us can attest to a special moment that we share and we carry that with us it's it's those Eternal moments that carry us when we don't feel like we can carry on so thank you to you may God bless you in your efforts as you support the man of God and as you continue this great work so I've been called upon to speak a little bit about the school and uh that includes me as well brother Glenn I when I started I remember with the open day I was very determined to um be in a good good school and overambitious um always wanting to be in a space that I know I'll be able to do well and do my best so because of that and not knowing much about the school it was the first year my mom had arranged for me to have a one-on-one with brother Glenn and uh I I asked brother Glenn I remember sitting in that back classroom brother Glenn you may not remember but I do and I sat down very serious face and I said brother Glenn I just want to make sure you know that this is the right place for me you know and I'm going into matrick and this is an important year and I really just want you to give me that assurance and you know brother Glenn uh gave me that expression which I think many of you can relate to it's a change in the face and it's it goes very serious and you know he you know so I came asking him that and he just turned around and he became very serious and he said to me my sister this is the best place the best school in the world and I have no doubt that you are not going to make a mistake to be in yel Tabernacle and I just took that and I accepted and I walked away and I said you know what um I'm going to give it my all and starting from day one my heart was overjoyed I was like bursting out of my seams because I was so excited to be in a place where I could be surrounded with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith coming from a a outside school I I just want to give you the short testimony to the young children and Learners City here today um attending an outside school with the dress code a long uniform I remember countless times brother du coming to my home and trying to encourage me to stand despite whatever the obstacle was and those things kept me but when I walked in here it was like home and it wasn't like home I was home and I just want to say to you that the time that you spend here is so critical I have only had the opportunity to be here for one year but I must tell you that this one year was enough to change my life forever I could never be the same after that and I think if I were to just cross over and speak about the school we know that you know the fundamental pillars of the school is to fly with both Wings spiritual and academic and what makes the school so successful and so great and so unique is the spiritual element as I mentioned before I was really young when I joined the school and I needed a lot of help and when I joined the school the thing that always captivated me was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'll let you in on a little secret here I know my brother is here you'll probably laugh but just before we join the ministry I um we attended a Pentecostal church and I was so desperate for the holy ghost that I was saying to them you know I really want to change I really want to live right and by then we weren't in the ministry and the the minister is going and he's pushing and uh I was so desperate and then he says raise your hands you know and people start like falling you know in the spirit and then I didn't know the Holy Ghost and I also thought you know what this is the way so I just threw myself on the floor you know like also acting and my brother he was standing next to me with two stoter so um he looked at me and he kicked me saying Joe what are you doing get up you know and um so when I came here I could freely experience the Holy Ghost you know the one thing that I really wanted was that and God afforded me that [Applause] opportunity and I think some of the experiences that I just want to share with you is you know coming out of sister chenel's classroom the classroom was right on the top here on a Tuesday I'll never forget we were fasting and praying and I looked out firstly in the morning the apostle was right here um actually kneeling at the EHR minia and he prayed saints that whole day and the anointing that filled this place I remember being so fascinated and I'm sorry but even as I think about it it's it really touches my my heart and I stood at that window and I looked down and I remember saying God as the man of God sits and lays before you may you place him on my heart on his heart and the Apostle continued to pray that entire day to witness something like that is beyond words it's beyond AC IC achievement it is beyond anything your mind can ever comprehend and I remember thinking that what kind of a man is this that he will sacrifice everything he has for us and because of that I always said God help me that I will keep the hands and arms of the man of God up [Applause] I also remember many times um sitting in the classroom and the Holy Ghost will just pour out it was lifechanging to say the least and for many reasons we can praise the school but I don't think there is a single amount of words that or accolades that that can come remotely close to the impact that the Holy Ghost has on our lives I also just you know in my day-to-day experiences here at the school I think we were privileged to see one another grow brother Glenn um we grew we made mistakes um you know as I stand here and look at the youngsters we made many mistakes but there there was one thing that really resonated with me and it's something I took from the Apostle it's the perseverance I spoke about this brother Glenn you reminded me at my matrick bank with such a simple principle perseverance diligence um Pastor Jonathan once said to me that diligence is the drive to wake up every day and Chase your vision own your destiny and I always kept that with me no matter what and as I begin to speak about academics and corporate you know uh path I really want you to remember that if God could do it for me he can do it for anyone and I I remember when the school just after we met articulated uh the Apostle called us and he wanted us to say what we were going to study and this again I mean you ask yourself on the face of this Earth what kind of school is consistently checking into this day on where their Learners are what they doing and I remember the Apostle um asking each of us we were only nine in matrick and I had U mentioned I wanted to go into education and I remember the Apostle's face he didn't say anything but he just looked at me and something in me told me that I that's not what God called me to do and I went with my passion and thankfully brother Glenn happened to have walked that road before me and so not knowing anything about accounting guys and that's why I want you to if anything take away that in this ministry The Impossible is possible it is possible so as I I matriculated I asked brother Glenn um advice I actually registered for the wrong degree and brother Glenn said to me no Joe you you need to change your degree which I did and I want to thank you brother Glen and I went on to study part-time and I was working and studying which is really hard um the values that the school instilled in us as Learners to work hard to persevere and to never give up and I say this with a reason because it took me 12 years to qualify as a chartered accountant and I woke up every day um and I wrote it on my Bridge uh when I got married one of the first things I wrote I really would I want to be a chartered accountant and at that time it was such a big dream for me in my head in my ability it was very impossible but I am so thankful that throughout my journey I was privileged enough to have the Apostle Pastor Jonathan the leadership of this church and specifically Pastor Jonathan very instrumental in guiding me throughout the journey journey and the gift in this ministry is beyond measure sense I hit the roadblock where I couldn't pass one subject and it was really difficult I told myself this is it I'm giving up and I remember saying to pastor jnan this is it I'm not I can't this is I can't go further than this Believers Pastor Jonathan actually said to me why are you answering a question like this this is how you must answer it and believe it or don't believe it it's my experience it's my testimony and you won't believe it saints that was the exact method to that subject I I did not do something [Music] else so to be found in a place where you are surrounded by God men men of God that are ordained and that have our best interest at heart is the greatest blessing I could ever asked for and I want to close by saying that yes I may have attained the ca I may have attained I attained my goal but I've also been taught don't be satisfied and so as I continue my journey journey I hope to inspire the young mind sit standing and sitting before me here and say and leave you actually with these words Pastor Jonathan once also said that um the more salt you get the thirstier you become and the more you drink and the salt are those challenges it's way when you are most weak when you can't see your way out Pastor Johnson says that's the time when you need to actually use that to own your destiny so I really want to encourage you and say today as I stand Here I Am the general manager of finance Global for a big multinational uh Health um equipment and devices company and I don't say this for my Accolade I only say this to show the power of this ministry the power of the vision of the man of [Applause] God and I want to close with this phrase Pastor Jude said in when he preached Miracles he said you have two choices you have a choice in life life where you choose to say that there are no Miracles and the other way is to say that every day is a miracle and for me today is a miracle it will always be the first day I stood at that war brother Glen was a miracle in my life and it will always be and we know also that time gives you things it's also something that Pastor Jonathan always says time gives you things and as we reflect on the 20 years I thought about it this morning brother Glenn God gave the school many many blessings many many blessings but may it not stop here may God continue to bless you bless the school bless the Learners bless our leadership and I just want to say thank you to my Apostle I want I want to salute you and I want to thank you with everything within me thank [Applause] you JY just give sister Jolene another beautiful hand the likes of sister Prudence a beautiful hand at this time I'm going to welcome brother Jal Augustine a grand son of our Apostle and the visioner of the school just to give us a synopsis on the history of the school can we just [Applause] welcoming [Applause] amen esteemed guest teachers parents and and cherished members of the AL Tabernacle Christian College family I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's a great honor and a privilege for me to stand in front of you this morning I also can't believe that the the school is 20 years today um at this moment I'd like to greet our Senor Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Pastor Edgar Jor and the Rosco family at large and in her absence Mama Sheila who touched our lives and the lives of countless students and will forever be in our hearts her dedication to the school was unmatched as you saw in the clip how she rang that Bell amen and most of all last but definitely not least I'd like to greet God's Apostle Apostle edgil [Applause] Rosco they say you truly can't Savor a meal without recognizing the chef Behind The Culinary Masterpiece they say you can't grasp the essence of a novel without recognizing the author who crafted its Pages they say you can't embrace the beauty of a garden without appreciating the hands that meticulously planted and nurtured each Blossom they say you can't truly feel the power and Grace of the sculpture without acknowledging the sculptor who skillfully chiseled life into stone so this morning before I speak to you about the history of the school allow me to acknowledge and show appreciation for the one that God gave a vision to to build a school in Walkerville this morning just allow me to show some appreciation and acknowledgement to the founder the Visionary the leader that built and shaped Al Tabernacle Christian College to what it is today Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco amen as I look back in all my Years of Living never have I found a man that is so unwavering so dedicated so hardworking so zealous for God Apostle as we look through this 20 years of Al Tabernacle Christian College we can truly say your loving was not in vain what you truly stand for an embody is found in the core and the foundation of the school never have I been with the Apostle and God is Not on his lips never have I spoken to the Apostle without wisdom stepping to the Forefront so this morning when you look at the school you know the foundation of the man that built it it was not only to educate but to save it was not built to empower only but to protect it was not only there to create professionals but to create Holy Ghost filled professionals the heart of the school is Holiness Holiness unto God so let's just take this time to salute God's Apostle for creating a god- centered environment where our children can thrive in the Holy Ghost Apostle we salute you this [Applause] morning [Applause] amen so this morning I was tasked to just give a brief synopsis of the school's history on this momentous occasion celebrating two years two de Decades of unwavering dedication and a Relentless pursuit of Excellence let me take you on a journey that began in 2005 defying the naysayers and the Skeptics who D to question our very existence the naysayers said the school will only last a year maybe two at most but Al Tabernacle it's 20 years to today by the grace of God the school is still standing amen while other pastors were playing the fool Apostle Rosco was building a school in the face of uncertainty Apostle Edgar Hil Rosco's Vision birthed not just the school but a testament to the miraculous power of faith and vision from the the decision to start grade R to 12 simultaneously in 2005 to the groundbreaking achievements of our first grade 12 class of 05 securing 100% pass rate Al Tabernacle set the stage for a legacy of Triumph Against All Odds a paradox the school achieved numerous 100% Pass rates in grade 12 multiple distinctions and Bachelor passes throughout the 20 years I've also been so privileged to count myself amongst the L Tabernacle alumni I started in grade one in 2005 and so happens that my grade one teacher is here today amen and I matriculated teacher IRA and I matriculated in 2016 and like I heard prudy said you only realize something when it's gone amen and I must say you realize the impact of the school once you walk out those doors you just feel and know you cut from a different piece of cloth amen and that leaves an indelible Mark in your life that can't be erased in 2016 we embrac the future with open arms ushering in a digital era of teaching and learning the introduction of tablets not only revolutionized education but became our Lifeline during the unprecedented challenge of covid-19 showcasing the foresight that defines our institution our graduates now scattered across diverse Fields many of medical doctors mechanical engineers electrical engineers Advocates teachers numerous qualifications in the biomed and forensic field Chartered Accountants investment bankers and bom graduates Galore are living embodiment of Excellence master's degrees have been earned distinctions celebrated one of our students achieved distinctions in all his subjects in grade 12 and the spirit of Al Tabernacle is imprinted in each and every success story amen yet beyond the academic accolades our journey is etched with divine intervention the spiritual front of Al Tabernacle is unparalleled across the 20 years over a thousand Learners baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ students enveloped in the presence of the Holy Ghost the school as a scent of Outreach is unmatched True Discipleship is to bring someone into the presence of the Holy Ghost the school fulfills that quote the school helped many Learners in their spiritual walk one just needs to listen to the ex pupils testifying proudly about the AL Tabernacle Christian College Heritage to scratch the surface of what Al Tabernacle Christian college has done with our walk in Christ as you heard prudy and Jolene they only scratch the surface of what Al Tabernacle Christian College done in our spiritual walk in the ground tapestry of apostle Rosco's Ministry the spiritual achievements of this institution stands as The Pinacle of what the school stands for a testament that Faith perseverance and divine grace not only sustained us but propelled us to become a beacon of inspiration so as we look back at the past 20 years let us remember that Al Tabernacle Christian College is not just a school it's a place we call home a place that changes our lives forever a place God is found thank you God bless can we give by the j a beautiful

wave to the church [Music] amen amen I just want him to come and wave [Music] amen just wave to the church there [Music] amen these are our young preachers amen may God bless them as well amen God bless are you happy to be here the greatest Miracle is the building you standing in to have attained this building 20 years ago is a miracle then to have the church in this building is also a miracle and then to have the visioner of this great building and this church is a miracle and to have a school around this building just the brick work alone is a miracle that had to be built and then to build a school in the building there two different aspects is also a miracle and then to still have it standing after 20 years is even a greater [Music] Maro I um must say that during the time of Co we really went through a hard patch with the school and the man of God never wavered or said anything we thought we're going to hit a bad spot but we survived Co we survived low student turnout and right now we sitting here in this Tabernacle with the opening of the school which is a supernatural school there's lot of schools but to have a supernatural one it's an honor to see it with your eyes this is a miracle Upon A Miracle on upon a miracle and I realized you can leave the school you can finish your career you can leave the school but the school won't leave [Music] you it's a school of academic achievements and the spiritual achievements cannot be compared to anything that you know or that anybody knows we want to thank the teachers that has been here for 20 years I just want to give them they also a [Music] miracle they are great Mir I think you can give them [Music] a I saw brother Glenn very emotional to see his ex- students but he's not supposed to focus on the ex students he must focus on the current students at because what we did for them we have to do for these that has come amen and even more amen want to welcome all the parents all the EX matriculant may God bless you I will not be a long time is going on and we still have some speakers behind me amen so I like to read the scripture just say something and then we'll go on because we can be here the whole day and still not get to the bottom of it all amen um the Book of Genesis 28 I want you to remember that December was a great convention the Apostle preached a very great sermon here for the two meetings but then I realized that the church was before the school so that 20th convention we had here with what the Apostle preached made I have a jubilee as Al Tabernacle not the school just Al Tabernacle 20 years in this building was also a great miracle today is the follow on of their 20 years I don't know if you with me this morning oh it looks like you forgot that there was a convention and you forgot what was preached there was nothing ever preached like what was preached at our 20th year and I thank God that I was here to hear it and you were here to hear it now the scripture I'm reading is just in light of what we are seeing here Genesis 2811 and he lightened upon a certain place so there's lot of places but there is a certain place and I want you to know and tell the one next to you this is a certain place it's not any place it's a certain place L Tabernacle is not any place you bringing your child to the school it's not any place it's a certain place it's a put out Place ordained by God so we are standing in a certain place you didn't come here by accident God brought you to a certain place this building was built because it's a special place there is no other place like this certain place called Al tacle you are standing in a certain place out of all the places you know this is the certain place it is even better than the house you live in this is a certain place this place is ordained of God for the time we're living in so you don't know and I don't know but this is God's certain place it's a special place of worship you cannot worship ship God anywhere you need to find the certain [Music] place are you in the certain place I want to ask you how did you get here did you plan it did you work it out God brought you to the certain place this eighth Road God put out before the foundation for you you see how those ex matriculant were singing and dancing and being in the spirit they had to all come and leave where they were to the certain [Applause] place and he tered all night because the sun was setting and he took stones of that place and made it his pillow for 20 years we made this our pillow we made this place our resting place we made this place a place where we say I'll rather be a doormat in Al Tabernacle than to be sitting at [Music] home this is a certain place and this is a place where we can rest and have a Sabbath and a rest and and he laid down in the place to sleep and the Bible says he dreamed the dream and I realized we all were in this dream of Al Tabernacle and I want to ask you my brother my sister since we in the school and in L Tabernacle don't wake me up from Hall this dream Don't Wake Me Up To See God moving every week every Sunday every Wednesday I don't want to be woken up because this dream is a wonderful dream called Al Tabernacle why it's a certain [Music] place it's a beautiful place it's a place where you can feel God it's a place where you hear God and it's a place where you can see God this is the miracle of this place don't wake up because the dream we're having here is been fulfilled in front of our [Music] eyes we always says where is God and where's the right church and is there a place where you can meet God I want you to know you in that place and some of you have been here for 20 years is and still you need to be convinced that this is the [Music] place oh but I want to tell Lucifer I want to tell our critics I want to tell all the court cases where to go to I want to tell the old Midville Council this is still the [Music] place we had to go to the high court but this is still the place they wanted to close the school but this is the place there is no place like Al [Music] Tabernacle and why do I say so open your eyes and look it's still happening after 20 years just look I want you to look look around you no you're not you you're not doing what I'm telling you open your eyes look around you and tell you we still here and we still in the place let's give a lord of [Music] shabat oh my brother my sister you know sometimes you got to wait 20 years sometimes to see the miracle but I saw every year a miracle and you know where was that Miracle on the stage every year there was a miracle a some child made it through and they still in the place they finished school but they still here and their children is here and their parents is here why it's the [Music] place don't look for another place we found the place we found God we found a letter and God on top of the letter and God has come down here every time not one s not one cent that we spent to build the place and not one cent that we spent in 20 years can match one of the souls not one Soul could be bought with all the money we spent it was worth it all I want you to give the Lord a Shabbat I want you to jump where you are standing I want you to scream to the Lord show the devil and tell the devil th th th th th is the place why because God has a man in this place God bless you h oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] he [Music] h [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] amen as you welcome our Apostle this [Music] [Music] morning [Music] give me just raise [Music] our because because [Music] he how I love [Music] J oh how I love [Applause] J How I Love Jesus give [Music] our love to [Applause] be he is so he is so wonderful [Music] to he is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so J Love [Applause] [Music] that reminded me of the night of nights when I met the greatest man that ever [Music] loved the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ they [Music] sang the song and it was like a brand new song oh how I love [Music] Jesus from that moment I have never lost my [Music] love for Jesus king God [Music] we um greet you in his wonderful name I need to apologize I I see everybody's got Ties on and suit on and and the founder of this Bolding in this organism you know looks like this but I've got the colors [Music] [Applause] on so um I thought we just going to sit around and and um and celebrate it cannot be rubbed out it cannot be brushed underneath the table neither can it be ridiculed that this could have only been [Music] [Applause] God for a black man like me to have had a vision like this is unheard heard of a vision that don't end here a vision that's growing as the years flies by it'll go into [Music] eternity because there people that decided young people that come to this school that has decided that they're not going to die the death of an unrighteous that Vision has gone far beyond the grave to the other side of the Ring where the king of glory is waiting for them therefore we didn't have a vision like Mandela had for the put South Africa South Africa that's been cursed by the Jews and the curse is short coming you'll hear tonight what I have to say I'll rather be a Zimbabwean now than to be a South African because a curse is thrown over us whosoever curs Israel God said they will be cursed amen so your vision is not for a struggle I mean we've been in the struggle I've been in the struggle and we thought that the ANC is going to take the struggle away but I'm in a worse struggle now than when I ever was before I'm still struggling therefore these kids hasn't had a vision of thec and Mandela they have a vision of [Applause] Jesus we are not Muslims and we're not Jewish we don't follow mammad to Muhammad and we don't follow Moses we follow the greatest man that ever lived and his name is Jesus and that's what we bow the school on yes sir and that's what we're going to fight for and that's why we're going to stand for the time we have down here might not be very long so I'm sorry that I I look like this casual and uh but it's not the clothes that makes you something what in [Applause] here so may God Rich you bless you you know there's nothing you can do against fruit I don't have to say anything yeah I mean it's been displayed what this is all [Applause] about you don't have to guess what fruit is here you can see it with your own eyes you want to know who somebody is if you want to know who somebody is don't look on how popular he is and all that look at his [Applause] fruit if he steals money and bankrupt a country then what fruit did he bring he stole and fruit is stealing and sto stealing so our fruit will carry on I'm so happy when I saw the ex great 12 a whole church do you know a much [Applause] that act grade 12 as doctors and lawyers and just what you saw yeah and you want to tell me that's not fruit the school has proven itself and that's only the natural side the spiritual side over the the Christmas weekend at our convention was the greatest time I had for my 57th years of serving God in a Ministry that God could give me the keys Stone Revelation in the spiritual realm there has never been messages preached like what was preached over that [Applause] weekend we could clearly and honestly say and I I make no bones about it because I think my job is done yes that we have angels in [Applause] attendance and for the people that had trusted me when I opened the school some of your children is here and they have children now you saw them up here they were children but now they mothers and they they fathers they got children your investment has come to the for today to show you the money you spent it's not worth one of these Souls that was on the spit [Applause] for so it is one of the greatest things that could ever happen in South [Applause] Africa so I just got a few comments to make and uh I don't have to talk you know talk becomes very cheap when you see things like this because the fruit overwhelms it the proof of the pudding is in the eating I only realize after many years what a school entails the beginning of a plant or a seed in the hearts of a child to prepare him for the future the beginning is the school where you plant that seed and that seed is actually there for the future of that child what that child is going to be in the future you planted it right here the mothers and the fathers only have a couple of hours with a child but the teachers is there all the time with a child planting sees either of discrepancy or seeds of Eternity we made it sure that you're not going to have an educated sinner well educated but morals gone we made sure that they're going to be educated but they will have models that no other school will [Applause] have we make sure that what we planted we won't be sorry tomorrow when we see the fruit coming standing here after 20 years I planted that seed way back there with the teachers that was with us and after 20 h I can stand right here now and see the fruit that that seed is producing amen and here they are the husband and the wife come from the school and they are married and they brought for children and that children that they brought forth will be exactly the way they are because the seed don't change if it's a apple it's a apple if it's a pear it's a pear it's a bring forth after its kind and these little guys here has seen today what God has planted 20 years ago May that seed go into them and they do the same thing and become the same fruit of that very very teaching of the [Applause] teachers I wouldn't topel the fight that we had because in intimity I was going to read two verse 15 study to show thyself a proof and that's what we told them study study and here we had on the platform people that took that little bit they studied to show themselves approv today they can take out their certificates and say I'm this and I'm that and I'm that why they studied to show them themselves approved right here today in front of your eyes I am this now and I am that now and I am that now they are proven testimonies of the seed that we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] planted and as I said it didn't go without a fight we had to fight through it I thought Lord how are we going to make it in the covered because the school was closed and we still paid the teachers while they weren't teaching for 2 years now who carried us through not this way there's somebody that's supporting the cause from heaven and we didn't skip one month to pay the teachers and that was in the critical times that was in the bad times that was in the times when we were in the boom backs that God still come behind us and say man it is enough money to pay them and I'm sure that if there's anything ahead of ush that he wants the school if he didn't want the school it had to be closed down but he wants the school and the school will go from strength to strength uh from Victory to Victory from overcoming to overcoming and we'll fight for [Applause] it I will say that we had hard time because you can only judge the good times through the hard times I like what my old sister used to tell me says Edgar when you hit the devil hard watch how hard he's going to hit you then you know whether you're hurting and I'm sure today he hurt because they gave us one year that school only last one [Applause] year uhh it's not what he said it's not what he [Applause] said I'll admit that there was times that we felt like throwing in the towel and those were the times when the plun needed to be pruned so to cut off we to cut off here and cut off there so that the main thing can grow and friends we cut off if we have to cut off we cut off because we know when you cut and you prune more fruit will come after that and because of our cutting more fruit comes from there I will stand here if I have to cut or cut if I have to prune that seed I'll prune it if I have to get rid of the dry Twigs I'm going to get rid of the dry Twigs because I need a living twig uh because the Twigs must love uh I shall not die but I shall love to praise the Lord [Applause] amen and you know after the Twigs was cut off and the dried Twigs was gone I see the people dancing in front you and now you little boys here look at them did you see how they worship they already had that seed in them Hallelujah said hey I must go down and praise the Lord I am not here because of me there's somebody within me that's holding the rain there's something within me I cannot explain there's something within me that gives me strength to carry [Applause] [Music] on so the hard times was the times we went through the wall of critics we were boycotted from all the churches but we carried on we were in the Hall of [Applause] critics but now we out in a Hall of [Applause] Fame now our Fame is growing that even other schools wants to steal our teachers that's the worst thing when you become famous they offer your teachers something better there is no something better than elet because here you have the spiritual side which no school has the spiritual [Applause] side you have god with you and you have education with you how can you lose you can't [Applause] lose I'm glad for God for the job he gave me he he pays me amen and he makes me win souls hallu where can I get a better job than that I'm not leaving this job even if Raposa said he's a Hamas I'm a Hamas you be a h is your business ra but me I'm a Christian I belong to Jesus [Applause] amen it was sure a vision but a vision without hardship without hard work that tries to block it from happening is there no vision you can have a vision is good but a vision is fought because the devil don't want that thing to be made manifest it's going to be critical against his kingdom yeah when the prophet says Jesus will be born they killed all the young children BOS said they kill the young they kill they always kill the young children when Israel was in Egypt did they kill the young children because that young child if he don't have the right seed will grow up a terrorist so kill him while he's young kill the thing they've been killing children all the time through the Bible so therefore we thank God that hardships goes with a vision you can only know a great vision if you see how many hardships you had to fight boy did we fight hardships the government came along and says well we'll give you 200,000 a month but then we have half of what you got anything in a school half belongs to and that's not even the wages we pay and I said man it would have been a help but I do not want the government in here and for 20 years no government funds NOC funds no Raposa funds is in L Tabernacle this thing is funded by the kingdom of heaven [Applause] [Music] [Applause] 20 years is a lifetime when they say they're giving you life and that's 20 years and up it's a lifetime so there's some people here that gave up their lives to make this a success what I like about a vision God gives you a vision before the foundation of the world but he gives you people that will help you to fulfill that Vision you never know why you had to go and go study to become a teacher but God knew he watches watches you he says I want you in my school I want you to be a teacher in my school I want you not only to bring education and bige headedness I want you to bring amen Holy Ghost educated uh angels of God uh so I'm going to direct you here's my sister from Zimbabwe amen amen God directed her she had to come through Amen to South Africa she can't understand it but I think now she understands it she had to come here and support the vision amen and keep the hands up uh that tries his best uh to bring forth a school uh that is actually the best school in in the south [Applause] oh my oh my oh why he always raises up wonderful workers for his ministers and do we have wonderful teachers [Applause] and I assure you the schol is going from strength to strength because in my bones there's no relaxing Hallelujah in my bones is is I'm never [Applause] satisfied we will go on [Applause] improving and let the dogs bark they bark on this side they bark on this side but the Caravan is moving Al tabacal Christian College is moving [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know in hard times you have no support because failure is a lonely orphan nobody likes failure it's too lonely to be in a group that fails but in that hardship you find people that's got H they don't look here they look down there and down there there's a light in the [Applause] tunnel and I thank God for these teachers that Jonathan than that stood with us in the hard times anybody can come to a nice Church anybody can come to a nice school when everything is nice and all the problems is solved but nobody comes to a place where there's problems and heartaches it take Faith than inivision to be able to stand and see the thing through and I thank you for standing with us in the time of trouble and in the time of me I had had my back covered and today I can for sure say just what you saw on this platform a whole church a whole church came out of the school worshiping God being born again having the peace of God in their hearts amen and having one thing in their mind is to serve God and serve God only and the young people that shows the old people that hey we have found the price uh the pearl of great price and we're not turning back amen we are holding fast uh we have saw the vision uh and we are following the vision uh and we get Victory through the vision uh and the vision will see us through and boy God God Amen isn't the Sur Vision look around you isn't the a vision they say are you going to build a church like this you're a colored man or you're a black man where are you going to find the money only a white man can do this no my brother I've been in the conference of God I've been in the presence of God and he said P it [Applause] [Music] and here you [Applause] are and it's just growing and growing so thank you very much it's so nice to have worked with you for these many many years how many 100% passes did we have JL rolled it out so apply and so good and today even the schools outside says there is no models as good as the children that comes from El Tabernacle I want to say this in closing sometimes I walk the shopping malls and as I walk I just see somebody runs up to me Apostle Apostle T I don't know there there's too many people in L Tabernacle I'm so glad that uh we can call one another brother and sister and not names you understand because I'll never be able to know all the names I was walking there pushing the groceries in the trolley and this guy said to me uh hang on Pastor hang on I'll push this trolley for you and then uh I hang on and he pushed the trolley and I thought let me ask you you know uh where do you come from I said brother which church do you come from said I come from your church it shows you how it grew and I walk in what you call it and somebody walk up to me and he says well I'm I'm a is so and so Mrs du or whatever it is and uh I said yeah he says yeah well U don't you remember me I said I said no and she says uh All My Children went to school at your school which is the best school in all of South [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] AF and my heart jumped within me if she didn't watch me out of dance because there's a testimony there there and it could never ever happen if God didn't direct you teachers footsteps to this place to make it [Music] happen I was saying in Victoria I appreciate my job so much that I said not even Mandela know I'm called higher than him cuz God tells the prophet going tell aab the king I say thus sayeth the Lord you don't repent the dog dog will eat his wife's flesh he's higher than a king a man of God a man of vision a man that comes from the Throne of God a man that has God's words in his lips a man that comes back and bring a keystone Revelation

[Music] okay and I and I love my [Music] work I just I just love this job 36 years I'm doing this job and I still love it and if there's another 36 years I don't know amen I just love it this morning I I I sure didn't have much time with this message I I forgot to look at the program and brother Paul phoned me Friday night and then uh uh I had the wedding and what have you so u i um had to jump in quickly and draw this up and um I pray that you pray for me that God would bless it amen amen and uh as you know now that uh these videos goes all over and I cannot take no chances so um I have to make double sure because there might be a soul in stake somewhere and it'll help that soul and uh when I get over there I don't want to be empty-handed you know I want want some souls to my name [Music] amen if I should entitle this message I'd entitle it cometh the hour cometh the man cometh the hour then cometh the man in every hour that God has predestinated for anything to happen you'll have a man to go with it so come at the hour cometh the man and I would like to take my thought from this quotation that I gave you Church Ages page 246 and that's the reason I wrote those scriptures they cried Hosanna hosana because that was the hour and that was the man [Applause] but in the case of Luther God's time was ripe come of the hour for a definite move he says but in the time of Luther the man God's time was right right the hour for a definite move that that would be the beginning of the restoration when the hour came God had the man and God don't work any other way that's the only way God works and he doesn't break his pattern when the hour comes God will have the right man at that hour to do the work that heaven can do only he says in Luther God's got a man then God's time was right for justification so cometh the hour so cometh the man if the hour hour comes then it's automatically God has the man [Music] [Applause] automatically God has the man when the hour comes amen because we can only serve God through a representative there is no other way that you can serve God you have to make sure that you get the representative and that representative is proven by God and that's the only way that we can serve God Amen is by that representative if you do not accept the representative then you do not accept God because that is the ambassador of Heaven to you and when you you don't accept that Ambassador you cannot be saved and I want to say this this morning if God has an ambassador in this hour and that's the only way that God is going to work through God is going to lift up that Ambassador God is going to show everybody that that Ambassador is the right Ambassador because cometh the hour cometh the man amen if the hour is here the man must be there [Applause] Hallelujah because we can only serve God through a representative amen and Jesus said in St John 20:21 he says as the father sent me so send I you amen praise God God did not not only send me Jesus Christ but God send me amen so that I can send you to be an ambassador at the right hour at the right time this is my time now because the father sent me but there's coming a time where the father's going to send you to be ambassadors and workers for the kingdom of God for when the hour comes amen the man cometh to amen you can't have the hour outside of the man if the hour is here the man is here for I send you Hallelujah to preach the gospel and raise the dead amen [Music] [Applause] hallelujah as the father sent me so send I you amen how did the father send him to preach Deliverance Amen to bring the Holy Ghost Terry he in Jerusalem until you endured with power from on high amen and brother Here We Are Tonight today we are in the same same commission that Jesus Christ had because he sent us amen and when you receive us you receive him and when you receive him you receive his kingdom and when you receive his kingdom you receive the Holy Ghost and when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the comforter and when you receive the comforter you receive the Dove and when you receive the dove amen it leads you into the promise of God [Applause] hallelujah and when God send that man man he is never received he is never never received cometh the hour cometh the man but the man never gets received amen everybody will be against him everybody will speak against him when Jesus Christ came they couldn't receive him amen they call him a wine Bubba they call him a glonous amen they call him a a man that's born out of wedlock amen they didn't like him they call him babab amen the king of the Devils but cometh the hour cometh the man God send him and there's nothing nobody can do amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah they didn't receive him they rejected him they criticized him the Pharisees was against him the churches was against him amen the preachers was against him but God didn't change his mind because they were against him because this was God's Ambassador this was God's representation upon the Earth and God stood with him amen because cometh the hour cometh the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and if the man is there he's never received why a prophet is not known in his own country Matthew 13 verse 57 a prophet is not known in his own country and if God send a Prophet uh and God a prophet is a new testament preacher even in this message they won't receive him because he's not known amen they just look at him and says well that's so and so and that's so and so because he's not accepted if they accept him that churches will be empty if they say that that man has the word of God that churches will be empty so they've got to be against him amen jealousy comes up in them because God gave the man a gift amen and that gift is without doubt amen that that's the hour and that's the man cometh the hour cometh the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man and Jesus said amen in Luke 23:31 he says if they have done this to a green tree how much more shouldn't they do that to a dry tree amen if they done that to me they will do it to them that I sent to amen and brother I'm so glad that I'm one of the ministers that can say they did it to me but here I stand because cometh the hour cometh the man and there's nothing nobody can do about that God in heaven will back up that man regardless of how many split away from him cometh the hour cometh the [Music] [Applause] man [Applause] [Music] if he is accepted then he's not the man if he is accepted then it has broken every scripture amen why because every time God has a man he's rejected everybody that likees likes him that's a bad sign amen it's a bad bad sign if everybody likes that man that's a bad sign that's not the man because right through in the word of God they hated the prophets they killed the prophets amen but how could you be a man of God and everybody loves you it can't be that way amen when they even hated your God Amen they even spoke bad about your God how much more shouldn't they speak bad about you that's a true sign that you are not called that's a true sign that God never called you look for a man amen that everybody hates uh everybody speaks against everybody loves to love to hate him that's the man and that's a good sign [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] that's a bad sign if everybody loves him amen because the word of God says for so persecuted they the prophets which were before them in Matthew 5:12 so persecuted they the prophets amen that was before them they hated the prophets because a prophet amen don't compromise a prophet amen will tell you Black is Black and white is white amen a prophet puts the thing down amen a prophet is somebody that speaks God's mind and not the people's mind and not the preachers mind and not the church's mind and not that up and Up's mind they speak the mind of God and what God wants amen so persecuted they the [Applause] prophets [Applause] he says in Matthew 23:29 you build the tombs of the prophets and gares the seul of the righteous not only the prophets but even the righteous not only do they kill the prophets but the righteous that comes behind the prophet and say exactly what the prophet said they like to kill him they like to garnish his tomb when he dies then he want to say what a great man and amen he had a give brother they garnish the tombs of the righteous the man the man he's always rejected evil spoken of criticized hey man but whenever they criticize him God just blesses him all [Applause] that's one of the true signs one of the true signs that he is the man of God Amen when they reject him and criticize him and look fault in him that's a true sign one of the true signs the other sign is amen he always tries to run away from the job when they try to choose him he runs away that's another sign then he sticks to the word of God that's another sign then he anoints the word of God that's another sign then he lives the sermon that he preached that's another sign then he has three pools in his life healing preaching amen and speak the word and it manifest itself amen then you have the man then you have the man then you have the man Hallelujah then you have the Mind [Applause] Glory Jesus Jesus had three pools in his life amen he three steps in his life and in his ministry his first step he came and he healed the sick his second step was he preached the word of God and they hated him for it his third step was was he went down into hell and preached to the prisons to the people that was lost here at three pools and every man that is called of God must have three pools in his life not only preaching he must have a gift of healing not only healing he must speak the word only and it must go out like Thunderbolts of lightning then you have the man then you have the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't only look for a man that preach one sermon and then you fall for him no brother amen he must preach every time the Holy Ghost must be there amen he must heal the sick through the power of a Mighty God he must be an ambassador on the earth he must LIF the life amen praise God Amen then we have the man that's the man you got to look for don't give your soul over to anything else he must have his qualities he must have the Holy Ghost he must have the word he must have signs wonders and miracles he must have the three pools amen then you have found the man then you have found God dark [Applause] man come of the Hour come the [Music] [Applause] man and you know what brother every man

man Hallelujah you have had met the man that has the qualities amen that the word of God said you have amen hallelujah because if you work against Power you'll burn amen when you work against Power you burn when you take the wrong wires and you connect it and you switch it on it'll blow up amen because you're working against power but when you work with power the lights goes on and when you work with the power of God in a God man there is God man man that's trained by God God trained man but this is the hour and there must be man that's train Hallelujah to take the word of God further

[Music] Amen. It's good to be here this morning [Music] to give God the honor and the praises &gt;&gt; for what he's done. &gt;&gt; We are so glad to be here. Pastor John the Apostle [Applause] [Applause] apostle wanted to be here this morning and um we thank God that we could be here. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've come to fill up our vessels. Amen. picking up our cups &gt;&gt; because that's what we have need of &gt;&gt; in this later hour. &gt;&gt; We just want more of the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the requirement of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to say, Lord, we're not going to give our oil away. &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing to us &gt;&gt; for this day and this our way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we have need of. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, &gt;&gt; did you enjoy the singing? Don't you appreciate the the choir musicians? [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. We want oil in our lamps. Amen. To keep us burning &gt;&gt; till the break of day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Can we turn to um Matthew 6 verse 8, [Music] Revelation Ians 3 verse 17. Amen. If you got Matthew 6 verse 8, it says, well, let's read from verse 7. But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think that they shall be heard, for them much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He already knows what you have need of before you ask him &gt;&gt; because he's your father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are people that's needy &gt;&gt; of him. &gt;&gt; That's why that song says he looked beyond my faults. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he saw my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And uh Revelations 3:17 says, \"Because thou sayest, I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing. And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning just for a few minutes. [Music] I think the worst thing that God can hear come out of our mouths is we have need of nothing. Amen. The Leodian church age told God that we have need of nothing. And yet God says you are miserable. You are naked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are wretched. You're poor. You are blind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you say you have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; But God knew that they had need &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of all these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says in the exposition of the seven church ages, I have need of nothing. Now when anybody says I have need of nothing, he could very well be saying I have everything. When you say you have need of nothing, you're actually saying I have everything. Or he could be saying I don't want anymore as I'm full. Now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent. &gt;&gt; She is satisfied with what she has. She either figures she has it all or has enough. And that is exactly what we find today. Amen. They feel they have it. Amen. That's why those foolish virgins slept because they felt they never needed any oil. &gt;&gt; But I thank God. God will have people that says, \"Lord, I need more.\" [Applause] &gt;&gt; David wasn't satisfied with the full cup. He wanted his cup to overflow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. And I think that's the worst thing you can tell God is I have everything. I don't need anymore. But Lord, we want to say we need more oil. Amen. With this oil, [Applause] we so scarce and you can't find it. There's only a little bit left. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we I thank God for health tabernacle. I thank God for a ministry &gt;&gt; that's not satisfied.

We don't want to be satisfied. We don't want to say we have enough. &gt;&gt; But we want to say, God, we want more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We definitely need more. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother Brandon says, \"Hallelujah. The God of this evil age.\" So God be with you. I'm sure that there's one that will be with you. That's Jesus Christ. And he can be. He's the only person that's omnipresent. And he's also omnipotent. So he can supply your every need. And omniscience also knows your need. Ne needs of what you have need of. So he knows because he's omnicient.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says the God who is rich in mercy. All that I I'm all that I ever hoped to be, I have derived from his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; I was wretched. I was miserable. I was poor. I was blind. &gt;&gt; But by grace, he has healed me. &gt;&gt; And I'm strong and healthy. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God, I have got eyesight. I have eat, drink, I have whatever I have need of. &gt;&gt; He never promised to supply my wants. &gt;&gt; But he promised to supply my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will supply your need, not your wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He promised it and he's more than able to give it to us. Amen. He says in the fallen a part of the world and they prayed for a Messiah. They prayed for a messiah. &gt;&gt; But here's what I want to say. If he would come, would we receive him or would we do like they did? &gt;&gt; Would we refuse him? &gt;&gt; Do we know what we really need? Sometimes we want pray for our desires. &gt;&gt; And sometimes our desires is not our need. We must realize that we do not understand what we need. We think we do, but God promised to supply our needs. And that he'll do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll do that. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you will pray for your desires. You pray for your wants, but God will supply your every need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't supply your wants, but he will supply your needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the exposition of the seven church ages, there are those who would not take the Holy Spirit. They won't take the Holy Spirit. If God opened the heavens and showed them them, showed them a sign that it's time for them to take the Holy Ghost. Even if God shows them a sign, they won't take the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, they all they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all. They tried to prove out there that they have it all. They got the word. They got this. They got that. &gt;&gt; But we realize, amen, that they don't have everything. &gt;&gt; Or they have enough. They say they have enough. Yet, is that the truth? Compare this 20th century church to the first century church. Go ahead, do that. Where is the power? Where's the love? Where is the purifying church that withtood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus? Where is the unity? You can't find it. If this church has it all it has all it needs, why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; Though they didn't have it all, and yet they had far more than they have today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Acts had far more than what the church has today, but they cried out for more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say they have it all, but the book of Acts. Amen. He said, \"Lord, we don't have enough. &gt;&gt; We want more.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell them that I've come to tell you this day that there is more of God. If you want more or need more of God, there is more of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be satisfied. Don't be satisfied. Say, \"Lord, I need more. I need more. I need more. I need more.\" Hallelujah.

See, what you need today is the good old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost to preach to preach the people eternal life in Christ. For he lives just the same today as he was then. What good does pretty feathers and intellectuals getting them little pallets all dressed out here and things like that? Do you realize you're heading for the pan? And how many people is heading for the flying pen? The feathers are nice. They're intellectuals, but they're heading for the flying pen. Amen. What good does it do?

They cut it off, but we want to say we need it. Amen. Hallelujah. We need it more than ever before. [Applause] Let us hear what the prophet says. What will they need for today? Let's hear what our prophet says, what we need for today. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm just going to concise it out of all his sermons. What he says, what we need for today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

The promise that he made here. That was his promise here. He would pour out his spirit. Now he has promised it again in the last days. And what he would do. Amen. And that's what we need today. &gt;&gt; He says in perseverance, what we need today is a house cleaning from the pit all the way to the janitor and they starting over again and get some genuine faith into the people.

That's what we need today in W of Bethlehem. He says what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts of the people. That's what we need today. In the token, he says, \"What we need today is a refreshing of baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit back in the church. Not a celebration, but the falling up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.\" He says the world is falling apart. What we need today is not educational systems. It's not it's not it's not lectures. What we need today is the gospel handled by the power of God to vindicate the word of this hour. Amen. We need the Holy Ghost to vindicate the word for this hour.

It's upon a man anointed. Anointed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; and the anointing came mightily upon him. that he told &gt;&gt; the Bible says immediately the spirit came mightily upon the land &gt;&gt; that this little boy &gt;&gt; when the bear camel &gt;&gt; when the moody came &gt;&gt; he says I took out my slingshot &gt;&gt; because this little boy says I fear no evil because the anointing of the prophet is upon me.

Hello. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my Thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, &gt;&gt; Mama Bonnie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. Yes. [Applause] [Music] I thought um two weeks ago we will I wanted to come to Moapani and then we had a funeral and every time I want to come something falls &gt;&gt; and um I waited [Music] And um that the other day I told Jonathan and Jude &gt;&gt; this one day you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] are. So, we made it. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; I think we've been blessed already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you getting a triple blessing? [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Pray that God bless you father. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; As I said with the last combine now &gt;&gt; Jacob [Music] wasn't so much worried about the birthight. &gt;&gt; He was worried about the blessing of the birthight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The trouble, the trouble came in with a blessing &gt;&gt; and not with a birthight. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And then when he had the blessing, &gt;&gt; he wasn't satisfied. And he bumped into the angel &gt;&gt; and he told the angel, \"You better bless me again.\" &gt;&gt; And the angel blessed him again. &gt;&gt; He blessed him so much &gt;&gt; that he changed his name to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God says, \"No, because you blessed twice. I'll call your homeland Israel &gt;&gt; because it's a double blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the blessing &gt;&gt; on the birthright. Everybody's got a birthight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk about the Holy Ghost wherever you go. But that's just a birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're looking for the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That don't cease. &gt;&gt; It's there in every service. Is there we come together and uh it never ceases. &gt;&gt; So I greet you again. Nice to see the temple there. Amen. [Applause] I thought if I come over here, I want to preach on something and this is the thing I would like to preach on or maybe just try to speak on it. And um it's a thing that I feel we have to be careful, very careful. It's um maybe just a warning &gt;&gt; for everybody that's in here of tabernacle. And it's a thing that God don't pull back on. &gt;&gt; You can play around with anything else. [Music] But with this thing, you don't fool with it. And I would like to take scripture in Psalm 92 verse 10. If you have your Bibles with you, but my horn shall thou exalt my horn. Whatever little power I have, &gt;&gt; you will exalt it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Like the horn of a unicorn. I shall be anointed with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; I shall be anointed &gt;&gt; with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; And then we know Matthew 25:3 says the foolish virgins took no oil with them. Let us pray. Father, as I also have to be careful with oil, I pray that you'd undertake for us this morning. Bless your word, anointed. [Music] May it go from here to the uttermost parts of the earth as a warning. Lord, let us once again value our values and not let it slip. I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Amen. [Applause] If I if I should entitle this message, I'll entitle it the lost anointing. The lost anointing. Now, when you lose something, it means that you did have it before, &gt;&gt; but you lost it. Something happened that you don't have it anymore. And I do not think there is a church upon the face of the earth that can boast like we do &gt;&gt; of having the anointing. What was that? We are warned not to lose it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says, \"Anoint me with fresh.\" It doesn't mean you weren't anointed. &gt;&gt; It means you were anointed. &gt;&gt; But something happened with your anointing. You lost it in some way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And because you lost it, you need a fresh &gt;&gt; anointing. If you lost 50 rand, it means you had a 50 rand &gt;&gt; but something happened &gt;&gt; that you lost it. If you had the oil and you lost it, it means that you were experienced of having the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh Bathe of oil &gt;&gt; for a fresh anointing. [Applause] This means the oil on the old anointing. That means the old oil either dried up or you lost it or some wise crack. maneuver you &gt;&gt; away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you don't have it &gt;&gt; what you had &gt;&gt; before. &gt;&gt; Like Esau, Esau had it. It was his. It belonged to him. and he didn't value it &gt;&gt; and he lost it. &gt;&gt; Samson &gt;&gt; was anointed of God, &gt;&gt; heavily anointed. There was nobody that was anointed like him. &gt;&gt; And yet he had it, but he lost it. Somebody stole it from him. &gt;&gt; A deceived church. [Music] &gt;&gt; Some intellect got the oil away from him. And he lost it. Eli the priest had the anointing was the high priest &gt;&gt; highly anointed from a prophet &gt;&gt; and yet he lost the oil and the Bible says it was kabot Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Means the glory of the Lord has departed from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had it, owned it, but he didn't appreciate it. [Music] Week after week, month after month, Wednesday after Wednesday, convention after convention, Easter after Easter, we have the anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It was ours all the time. [Applause] But friends, have we still have it like we always had it? &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; before you leave home and need to be in the church of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; that hey, I want to serve God? Is there stood an excitement that hey I'm a son of God? Is there still a joy unspeakable that I'm a daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Or did we lose our anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to clap your hands? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? Is it too hard for you to say amen? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to put on some dancing shoes? &gt;&gt; Or did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; This is the hour of a lost anointing. [Music] [Applause] Samson lost his anointing. The foolish virgin lost the oil. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she went to look all over to get the oil, &gt;&gt; but she couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; She lost it. &gt;&gt; Bonnie. Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't let us lose the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every service, every prayer meeting, every prayer that you put up, every callers that you say, every hand clap that you clap your hands with, say, \"Give me oil in my land. Give me burning. Give me burning to The lost anointing. You hear it from church to church. You hear we have no anointing. The church is dry. There's nothing in the church. The young people, the young girls, the young boys says it's monotonous &gt;&gt; to go to church. &gt;&gt; You know what? &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Church of today, you lost your oil. an elaborate &gt;&gt; while I'm here. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one drop of oil &gt;&gt; that's going to be spilled [Music] [Applause] all. [Applause] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It means that you once had it &gt;&gt; but you lost it. &gt;&gt; Some slick preacher, &gt;&gt; intellectual preacher, &gt;&gt; eloquent speaker &gt;&gt; talked you out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now you sit in a church &gt;&gt; where God left long ago. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You had it before. Hebrews 6:4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says they tasted of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; If ever there was a church that tasted of this heavenly gift is us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Very tasty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; Didn't it taste good? &gt;&gt; It tastes so good. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That we don't want to stay out of church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that we dragged our Torah to the church. It tasted so good that we made our husbands and wives follow us to the church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that our neighbors is in the church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is it fullfasting good? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and were partakers of what? &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Partakers of what? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You were a partaker. [Music] You are not a &gt;&gt; spectator. &gt;&gt; You are conceded. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You clapped your hands. You spoke in tongues. your love of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are the partaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, for that person that's a partaker of the Holy Ghost, for him to fall away, &gt;&gt; for him to lose it, it's nearly impossible to be. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? because it's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Let us not lose &gt;&gt; our anointing. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Look where he is. When Esau When Esau lost his anointing, look where he landed up. The word of God says he went to go look for it. &gt;&gt; He went to go and search to get it. &gt;&gt; He went from place to place to try and get repentance, but the Bible says he didn't find it. &gt;&gt; He lost it. He lost it forever. &gt;&gt; He could never get it again. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was gone. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin when she lost it, when there was nothing oil left nowhere, Brother Bram says she went to go look for it. And uh the wise version told uh the the foolish version, you going to buy &gt;&gt; and they tell you must love. Where was the love then? &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; It's time for oil. [Applause] And the Bible says And the Bible says that the foolish virgin went to go look for oil and brother Bruno says they didn't find it &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Look what happened to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Open the door.\" &gt;&gt; And the voice says, \"I know you not. I don't know you, &gt;&gt; you know, just just because of oil, &gt;&gt; but Lord, I got the lamp. I got the word of God. I've got I've got the mechanics, Lord. I've got it here. He says, I know you're not. &gt;&gt; Mechanics is only the word of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit. The spirit brings the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lamp is no good. &gt;&gt; We rode to church this morning. &gt;&gt; And how many people has gone to church and they got big Bibles &gt;&gt; in their hands and going to church? And I said, \"My God, look at that. That's only lamp. &gt;&gt; But where's the oil?\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's only the worm. Where's the oil? &gt;&gt; Many a many end time believer has gone to church this morning with a spoken word in his hand and the Bible in the other hand. Amen. And they go to the church and there's no oil. &gt;&gt; Then what good is the spoken word? &gt;&gt; What good is the Bible? If there's no oil to make it alive, [Applause] &gt;&gt; look where Samson landed up. &gt;&gt; He says, \"Let me die now. I got no anointing.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at Eli the high priest landed up. He broke his neck and Kabot came over. Friend, as you sit in this church and you search yourself with oil and there's any wicked way in you, &gt;&gt; why don't you get rid of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any wicked way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look on Zedekiah and Micaiah. Zedekiah said, \"Micaiah, where did the spirit of God go when he left me?\" &gt;&gt; That means once he had the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now he don't have it. &gt;&gt; Lost anointing &gt;&gt; to somebody now. Who's up? [Applause] &gt;&gt; It shows you that you got to keep on filling up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. shows you you can't take a chance to stay out of church, &gt;&gt; brothers. You might lose a cup of oil. &gt;&gt; It shows you that when it is here, &gt;&gt; you grab it with two hands. &gt;&gt; You valued your family. [Applause] Oh my God. So Jude quoted one little Bethlehem. What do we need today? A fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. Fresh oil. Fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to act like mad people. [Applause] That's [Applause] &gt;&gt; what a fresh anointing will do. &gt;&gt; Samson. Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed of God. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed &gt;&gt; of God. [Music] killed a thousand men, stroking them with a jaw born of an ass. &gt;&gt; Samson, could tear the mouth of a lion like you put a hot knife through butter. &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could coin a riddle. from his own testimony &gt;&gt; that nobody could answer. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; oh Samson, &gt;&gt; he could pay his debts to 30 Philistines just like that &gt;&gt; because he promised them if he knows they're little, he'll pay them 30 pieces of &gt;&gt; garments. And he paid them Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could take 300 foxes. One man catches 300 foxes. So anointed is a man and tie their their tails together &gt;&gt; and send them into the fields of the Philistines &gt;&gt; with a burning torch on it. Mhm. &gt;&gt; One man could do that. &gt;&gt; How many foxes is in the pulpit today that tell tales, Amen, to the congregation until they lose their anointing. Until they found out that the oil is gone, they tell tales. Amen. [Applause] And it's strange. He catches foxes. And when somebody say you're a fox, that means you're a scall. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, \"Could tell Herod that fox. [Music] &gt;&gt; We got too many foxes that lost their anointing &gt;&gt; in the pulpits today. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no oil coming from the head &gt;&gt; from the pastor &gt;&gt; down into the skirts of the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. My &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. &gt;&gt; When the anointing was fresh on him, &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. When he felt the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit was upon him, &gt;&gt; a thousand men meant nothing to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the anointing breaks the yoke. [Applause] Samson, &gt;&gt; when you walk down the street, &gt;&gt; the people will notch one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There goes Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty one. &gt;&gt; He could even walk down the very streets of Kaza. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a guazians will say, \"Leave that man alone.\" &gt;&gt; Because if he's anointed, &gt;&gt; he can kill thousands just like that. &gt;&gt; That's when the anointing is fresh. [Applause] Samson was untouchable &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; They have to they have to stand back &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you &gt;&gt; that hell knows &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That not one demon &gt;&gt; could come and take a chance &gt;&gt; because the yoke gets broken by the anointed. [Applause] And that's when the oil was still fresh on Samson. &gt;&gt; But when he gave away the secret and the secret was they brought in some dead worship. Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; that was a secret. &gt;&gt; Did you give away your secret? by formal &gt;&gt; dead worship. Sure. &gt;&gt; And the minute he gave away the secret, the minute he gave away the thing that's supposed to keep the anointing, the minute he gave away his wedding garment, &gt;&gt; the anointing left. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The oil left. Then he had a lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you know the pity and worst part of it all, the Bible says he knew it not &gt;&gt; that the anointing left. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say the Bible says when that anointing left him, you know what Samson cried out? You know what he cried out? He said, \"I'll go out like you like all the other times. I'll go out &gt;&gt; and I'll avenge myself like I avenge myself when I killed a thousand of them. &gt;&gt; I'll go out myself.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll do it again. And the Bible says you would not that he had a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; Samson was relying on the God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Right there now. The now God wasn't vain. They give God glory for what he has done yesterday when he killed a thousand men. &gt;&gt; And they give God glory for what he's going to do. But Samson, where's the now God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Samson replied &gt;&gt; on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it didn't help him a bit &gt;&gt; to rely on a God of history. &gt;&gt; It won't help you a bit &gt;&gt; for realizing last week you had an anointing on you. W. &gt;&gt; How does it look now? [Applause] &gt;&gt; They said in the message circles we'll have a restoration of your glory. God. &gt;&gt; In other words, we'll go out again one more time and we'll show the world that that anointing is still with us. Amen. The people will dance. Amen. The pastor's wives will fall in the spirit. Amen. We'll show them again once more time that there'll be tongues. Uh we'll show them once more again that the will walk. We show them once again that angels will walk in the pillows and baptize the people with the Holy Spirit. We'll show them once again. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And when they went out to show us once again, &gt;&gt; there was nothing. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. [Applause] [Music] Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; what we had. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young man, don't lose &gt;&gt; that which you have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young golf, young sister, don't lose &gt;&gt; what you have. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They came to the end of 20 years and then only found out it's gone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now they wake up. &gt;&gt; We'll go and get it again. &gt;&gt; It's just like Katie's beneer. When they got to Katie's beneer and they rejected it, they lost it. They gave it up. Amen. And the spies actually brainwashed them. They were better preachers than Joshua and Caleb. They preached the people under the table. They couldn't listen, amen, to God's voice in Joshua and Caleb. Because when a man of God speaks, that's the voice of God to them. [Applause] They couldn't even pick up &gt;&gt; who's got the voice of God. So the anointing left them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they said, \"Man, Moses, we realize now we made a mistake. We realize now that there's something short here in the church. We realize we've got the Ten Commandments without the palire.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll go back and we're going to take the land again. And Moses says, \"Don't go.\" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just God said we must go. He said no God is not with you. &gt;&gt; He rejected it. &gt;&gt; You lost the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't go. &gt;&gt; And they went back and they died like flies under the spray of doom. [Music] &gt;&gt; One thing God hates when you reject the land and try to go get it back again. They hate you. &gt;&gt; It kills all of them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Because it's the lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's nothing as sad as to see when a man lost his anointing. It was so sad to see the de J lost his anointing and he gave it over to his daughter. And how can a woman carry the anointing when God says she's not supposed to be in the boost [Music] anointing? Then you find out after 20 years, my brother, after 20 years, they only found out that the glory of God has gone. &gt;&gt; It'sot. &gt;&gt; Can you go on all the time and not pick up that the Holy Ghost is gone? &gt;&gt; Yes. When the ark left &gt;&gt; Israel and it roamed around in the Philistines land and miracles happened in the Philistines land where gods fell to their faces in front of the ark. Israel still went on as if they've got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happening. And it's not going to happen here. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Father, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the deal gloria was gone. Though they come after they preached and they preached and they preach and they come to the end of the sermonate and they see there is no &gt;&gt; glory and they try to sing songs to bring the glory and the glory still don't come they only become Pentecostals &gt;&gt; when the glory is gone That's when they sang. &gt;&gt; I didn't know &gt;&gt; though when they come to the end of the sermonet and they try to pump and pump and pump and pump. And when they finish pumped, there's no water flowing. &gt;&gt; It's dead. &gt;&gt; The glory of God has departed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When they come to the end of that preaching and they beg the people, why don't you? Amen. Why didn't you say hallelujah? Clap your hands. Then the people clap their hands for 2 minutes and it's gone. There is no anointing. There's a noise with no anointing. &gt;&gt; There's a noise [Applause] with no spirit. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The glory of God. &gt;&gt; You look at guys like Masam. They left here. Come visit their church. Come. They don't see if the glory of God did leave them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen, they know it &gt;&gt; because they already tasted it. &gt;&gt; They come from the place where they taste it. [Applause] Samson said, \"I'll go out like other times.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's like brother Benham says, as I said, he relied on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, God. has done it. &gt;&gt; Killed a thousand men &gt;&gt; yesterday. He could tie 300 foxes tails together. Yesterday he could kill so many people that you can't count them yesterday. But Samson, can you kill a thousand today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; that god of yesterday that killed a thousand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can it kill it today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or is it the lost anointing &gt;&gt; of a bunny &gt;&gt; or the second story? &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody rob it from you. Don't let anybody rob this feeling. Get some pani from you. [Music] [Applause] And when Samson lost &gt;&gt; the anointing, &gt;&gt; watch it. When Samson lost the anointing, the first thing he heard, Samson, the Philistines are upon you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The minute you lose the anointing, &gt;&gt; the Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; Is the song on you? &gt;&gt; Have you trusted the song GMA more than Jesus? [Music] &gt;&gt; So can't do nothing. He uses everything God does. &gt;&gt; He tells you to take the boat. Who made the boat? &gt;&gt; He tells you, \"Stand there. Let me throw the bones.\" Who made the bones? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He told you to drink this mine. Who made the m [Music] Now I serve the god of the mut. What does God make? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know why you go to a sangoma? It's because you've got a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; the first thing you &gt;&gt; Samson Samson Oh, Samson. Samson. The Philistines had upon you. &gt;&gt; How did they get in? How did the Somas get in here? &gt;&gt; I tell you, you trust the Soma more than would you trust God. Why don't you strive to trust God the way you trusted the lying &gt;&gt; dirty Soma? And maybe God can do something for us. &gt;&gt; Bring back those happy days with a fresh anointing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The pathetic part of it all, Joel. The pathetic part of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The worst part of it all. Who's cleaned that the Philistines have upon you? Who's cleaned that? &gt;&gt; His own church. Jezebel. Jezebel told the pastor, &gt;&gt; \"The Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; The congregation is now telling the pastors, &gt;&gt; you got no anointing. &gt;&gt; Their own congregation, &gt;&gt; their own churches &gt;&gt; say there is no anointing in this church.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Since a young man I was worried I've read years ago when deceived church brother Brandham that's the the problem when you push and play you get all the things amen from the tape and on the tape brother Brandham cries out in deceive church he says banam tabernacle the Philistines are upon And I tried to find out the place where he retrieved that. He never fixed it up. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if it is still like that. &gt;&gt; I just wonder [Music] what &gt;&gt; as long &gt;&gt; as this man is here. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] I really don't care about your tradition. &gt;&gt; I don't care about the salute tradition. I don't care about the su tradition. I don't care about a perry tradition. I only have one tradition and that is thus saith the Lord. [Applause] Can you wave your Bibles to the Solomas? [Applause] Can you wave your Bible to the Somas? This is our tradition. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was laughing from Bkari. She's a dun &gt;&gt; and a tun died and uh &gt;&gt; her elders came to her and the elders says mkari rearing your two and tomorrow today you have to come with us down to the graveyard. She says for what? He says no you got to get into the grave. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And um she says, \"And when I don't do it,\" she said is,\" they said, \"Then you're going to die very, very soon. Maybe in a year's time.\" She said, \"Well, I'm not going.\" And she didn't go. I asked her the other day, but I was 4 years now. The other day, I says, \"Um, how long was your she said, Four years?\" I said, \"Now, what are you doing here? A bunch of liars. [Music] [Applause] There's a sister in Joelberg. There's a sister in Joelberg. She's in the church now. But before she was in the church, she she liked to go to Soma. Every little penny she has, she runs to the Soma. And she asked the sun about the job. So the sun said, \"No, amen. Just kill a goat.\" A goat belongs to God, but he makes it as if it's his. And you take the skin and you tie it around your home. &gt;&gt; Now the minute you put this, it's like handcuffs. You're cuffed with this one, &gt;&gt; but you tie it up skin. Yes. &gt;&gt; And after she did that, she told me the says, \"You'll never lose your job now.\" &gt;&gt; I says, \"Oh, yeah. Did he say that?\" Yeah. She says, \"So I'm secure. I'm losing my job forever.\" I came back 2 weeks after that. She's not there. I got a hold of her. I said, \"Sister, I don't see you there at a job anymore.\" \"No, I got fired.\" I said no. I lied. &gt;&gt; How can we listen to him? &gt;&gt; That's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; And Samson, &gt;&gt; you can't even fool the young people anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the internet. &gt;&gt; And then I ask another brother. He says, \"No, you must pay laba, man. You must pay laba.\" I said, \"Oh, yeah.\" I said, \"Oh, no. You must pay, you know.\" So, you want the papi? Well, fine. You must pay. I said, \"But dad, uh, have you finished your laba?\" He said, \"No, I still owe after 30 years.\" &gt;&gt; What nonsense is that? You stole all Labola, but you want the guy to pay Labala. &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense. We only have one tradition. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Samson &gt;&gt; lost the anointing. Hallelujah. when his hair grew back again for a fresh anointing in Judges 16:30, the Bible says, \"So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. When the fresh anointing comes, &gt;&gt; then you kill more Philistines in your life. [Applause] Oh my. When the locks close again, &gt;&gt; when the seven thunder locks close again, then you only have one cry. You only have one prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me die with my enemy. that fresh anointing comes, you're going to say, \"Lord, is there any wicked way in me? Let me die. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, then you die. When the new revival comes and the fires are burning, then you die to false teachings. &gt;&gt; You die and you claim &gt;&gt; because all the Philistines are dead in your life. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that? Amen. &gt;&gt; A fresh alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it get away with &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that goes with the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; that lost their anointing. Can I preach on [Applause] &gt;&gt; Judges 16:E 19 &gt;&gt; and this sounds like Matthew 25. It says, \"And she, the church, Jezebel, made him, Samson, sleep upon her knees.\" &gt;&gt; He fell asleep. &gt;&gt; On the knees of a deceived church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; fell asleep until Revelations 10 was made clear. [Music] &gt;&gt; And it woke up the church once again &gt;&gt; because he says the seven thunders wakes up the bride. Revelations 10 wakes up the bride. &gt;&gt; We were sleeping &gt;&gt; in the lamp &gt;&gt; of Jezebel churches. &gt;&gt; Pastors. Hallelujah. Sleep until she forgot to get full of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Sleep until the enticing knees of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the loser locks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sleep church till the power of your Nazarite vow gets exploited by Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Sweep until the Philistines creeps up suddenly and they don't know how the Somas came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. My my my &gt;&gt; run. &gt;&gt; Sleep until they bind you. Bind you with goat skins. Bind you &gt;&gt; hand and foot &gt;&gt; down at the ankles and here with goat skins. [Music] sleep until you grind in the prisons of false doctrine. [Music] Sleep until the soul must eat your last &gt;&gt; s. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sleep on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sleep until the tribulation get a hold of you. Yes, Lord.

By that saying, we want to greet the Rosco family, our leadership. Amen. We can read Acts Acts 12:1. Amen. Acts 12. Amen. It says, \"Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church, and he killed James the brother of John with a sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.\" Then were the days of the unleaven bread. And when he had appre apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four portions of shoulders to keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people, but therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. Like we are praying every Sunday. Amen. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two shoulders bound with two chains. And the keepers before the door kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him. And the light shine in prison. And he smoked Peter on the one side and raised him up, saying, \"Arise up quickly.\" and the chains fell from his hand. And the angel said unto him, \"Guard thyself, and bind on thou's handles, and so he did.\" And he saith unto him, \"Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\" And he went out and followed him. and worse note that it was true which was done by the angel. But though he saw a vision, when they were passed the first and the second w, they came unto a iron gate that leadth unto the city, which opened to them of of his own accord. And they went out and passed through the streets. And forth the angel departed from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, \"Now I know of situ that the Lord have sent his angel and have delivered me out of the land at the hand of Herod and from the expectation of the people of the Jews.\" Amen. And the question is, Amen. Hallelujah. Yesterday we were free. We were put free. But what did make us free? Who did made us free? Amen. As we read also Deanomium 15 that the apostle read yesterday. At the end of every seven years thou shall make a release. And this is the manner of the release. Every creditor that landed out unto his neighbor shall release it. He shall not exect it from his neighbor for of his or of his brother because it is called the Lord's released. Amen. And we are released this morning. We are free this morning. That's why we are here to tune in. Amen. But the question is, Amen. Who released us? Who made us free? Praise the Lord. Amen. And there's one thing that I knew. Amen. It was not a man that freed Peter. Praise the Lord. But something freed him. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord that came upon Peter. Amen. And last night, praise the Lord. It was not a man that freed us, but it was the angel of the pulpit, amen, that freed the people, amen. And that's why we can say we are free this morning. It was not a man's doing. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord. Amen. And what I liked about this angel, he didn't just free Peter, but he walked with Peter. Amen. Hallelujah. That angel walked with Peter through the wats. Amen. Hallelujah. And when they came at the iron gate, Amen. Hallelujah. The iron gate opened themsself. Amen. Hallelujah. This is the time. Amen. Hallelujah. To walk with the angel of the Lord. Amen. After the chains fell off. Amen. After you are freed. Amen. Hallelujah. That's not not good enough. Amen. Hallelujah. There's an angel that wants to walk with you. Amen. Hallelujah.

He walks with you through the critics. Amen. Hallelujah. He walks through you. Amen. Through the prison houses. Amen. Until you are free in the streets. Amen. Hallelujah. So it was not a man yesterday. But it was the angel of the Lord setting us free. Amen. Hallelujah. It was like a vision yesterday. We couldn't understand it. It was like a dream. Amen. We couldn't understand it. Amen. Hallelujah. But when we realize, Amen. We are free this morning. Unless we came together this morning to worship Jesus, King God. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. We are free this morning. I just want to read Acts 16. Amen. 25. Amen. And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed. Amen. Whenever there is something to be set free, it's just a prayer that's going out. Amen. Hallelujah. And this morning, we going to pray. Amen. At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and they sang the praises unto God in the prisons and heard them. Amen. And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were open and everyone's band were loosened. Amen. Last night we started to sing. Amen. Last night we started to shout. Last night we started to praise Jesus King God. And it felt like a earthquake in here. Amen. Hallelujah.

Amen. We were set free last night. Amen. And I thank the Lord that I was here yesterday. Amen. Hallelujah. You cannot be set free if there is no angel of the Lord. There must be an angel. Amen. There must be an angel of the Lord on the earth. Amen. To set you free. Like Michael, Jesus, King God. When that angel come came on the earth and hang on Calvary, he set us free. You cannot be set free outside of the angel of the Lord. Whenever there's a exodus, there must be an angel, amen, to take the people out. Amen. Whenever there's exodus, Amen. When Moses came on the scene and he had his exodus to take the people out of Egypt. Amen. There was a angel in the land. had a burning bush experience. The angel was in the burning bush and the angel took the people out of Egypt. Amen. And when Moses couldn't go further, well, they exalted, Joshua took over. Amen. And there was the angel, the captain of the Lord's host. Whenever you are set free, there must be an angel. Amen. And we have our exodus. We are here. Amen. We're going to vacate the premises. We're going to go home. Amen. Hallelujah. We have our exodus and we're going home. Amen. So we must have angel of the Lord here. There must be angel and we are set free from sickness. We are set free. Amen. Hallelujah. Whatsoever sickness it is, we have been set free. We have been set free from problems. We have been set free from prison houses.

[Music] When Daniel saw a vision of that, he said, \"Though that they do wicked shall do wickedly in the last days, but they that know that God shall do exploits in the last days.\" Speaking of this time know what exploits is. Exploits of faith will perform signs and wonders, but the wicked will continue to do wicked. said they'll run to and through and knowledge shall increase but said close up the book.

That birth right is what I'm going to have to get a hold of. Amen. That is what we need is the birthight. Amen. Because we're going to do exploits. Amen. That day on Calvary. Now notice greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer. Cast out devils by prayer but to impart the eternal life to the believers. The Holy Ghost was coming and given unto the hand of the church to impact impart life. That's what Calvary meant. He took, he stooped, regarded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Spirit to be obedient believers. Men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. So the Holy Ghost is not just here. Amen. I will heal our bodies. Amen. Hallelujah.

And God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both father and son, holy ghost, the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now to the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in the church. The preeeminence all that was he poured into Christ and all that was all in Christ was he poured into the church. The believer not a denomination. We'll get that in a few minutes. Everything that was in God, he poured into Christ. But everything was that was in Christ, he poured into me. And that's why we'll do exploits. And this morning, don't think about the possible. When you play, think about what's impossible. Think about the signs and the oneness. As we go [Music] over, as we hold our hands together, pray Jesus King God.

We don't doubt this morning. We are believing this morning. While the world is getting themselves ready for big things, the world is getting themselves ready. We are also making ourself ready for good big things Lord for the prophet says Lord that once again Lord the world will hear directly from God. Amen. The bride has made us ready. God's apostle has preached something in us. God's apostle has put something in us. What did he put in us? The greater works. The greater works is not just to heal the sick but is to give eternal life, Father. And everyone that walked to that door received eternal life, heavenly father. And nothing can take that eternal life. Nothing can take that eternal life away from us. The Holy Ghost, what was the Holy Ghost sent for? The Holy Ghost was sent for to furtherance the work of God. And surely the work of God was furtherance. Hallelujah. And that Holy Ghost gave us eternal life. Uh hallelujah. And once again the bride of God, the church of God, the true believer will have the word of almighty God in his mouth. And Lord we can wait heavenly father to say let there be heavenly father when we can't receive nothing from the world. When the world won't give us anything, we will have something in us. Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet said, \"Amen.\" Hallelujah. Wait till that day. Amen. When that little dog is pushed in a corner, when that dog is pushed in a corner, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And that dog don't know which way to go. Then you will see the power that is in that dog. Amen. And one day, the pride will be pushed in the corner. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And when we are pushed in that corner, when we have a little squeeze, Amen. Hallelujah. That power will come out of us. Amen. Hallelujah. That Holy Ghost power that is in us that we think that isn't there, but is somewhere there. Amen. Hallelujah. There was nothing around God. There was nothing around him. He was there in his loneliness, in the darkness. Amen. Hallelujah. But there was something in him. There was a vessel of the Lord in him. And he said, \"Let there be light.\" Amen. And one day when we don't know which way to go, when it's all dark around that mama, when there is no food in that cupboards, when there is no money on the table, when that mama is in the corner, that mama will only add one thing and is thus sayeth the Lord. Let there be. Amen. Hallelujah. We can wait, Lord. We know it's here, Lord. Hallelujah. Pastor Jonathan said, \"Hallelujah. Pench yourself and see if you're not changing.\" Hallelujah. We are busy changing. Hallelujah. Nature can feel the change. The heavens can feel the change. So the church of Almighty God can feel the change. Amen. Hallelujah. Then we will do great exploits of faith. Uh we will do signs and wonders. We will speak limps into existence. The blind will see again. The couple will walk again. Death will be raised. And is already happened in El Tabernacle that the blinded eyes has opened. The bride will have great exploits of faith. Hallelujah. We're not scared this morning. As the apostle says, God had to take us the long way so we won't turn back. Hallelujah. Jupiteration. We don't turn back to Egypt. But you took us the long way. And yet, Lord, in the long way, we found something. We found the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We found the captain of the Lord's host. We found the angel of the Lord. And the angel of the Lord took us through Jordan. The angel of the Lord took us through the Red Sea. The angel took us through the Philistine and the Sedestine and all the enemies. He took us through. Amen. Hallelujah. When there was no water, he gave us water. Hallelujah. Oh, we thank you this morning. When when Samson fought the Philistines and after he fought, he was tired. He said, \"Lord, are you going to let me die here?\" Amen. And there the water came out of the ground. That is where we are. We are in a time of the supernatural because no church can move outside of the supernatural. We will have thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. In a time where nothing, God don't care if it's the ground, whatsoever it is, the waters shall come out. And this morning, I am here. I am here. this morning not to do the impossible not to ask the impossible. What my five senses can do. No sir, we come from God. Hallelujah. We come from the impossible. Lord, I'm here to ask the impossible from you, Lord. We are Lord is the believer that will do exploits of faith. Amen. And what is a believer? A believer is when there is nothing. He believes there is something. And I don't care how far deep your children is in the world. I don't care how many people don't believe they can't come out of the prison house. A believer will say, \"One day is one day, amen, me and my house will serve the Lord.\" A believer don't believe today and the next day he don't believe anymore. But the true believer is like Joshua that says, \"Me and my house will serve the Lord.\" Joshua said, \"I don't care how many giants is in the land. I don't care how big the walls are. I don't care, but I know my redeemer loveth. I know the walls must come down.\" Joshua asked for the impossible, and the impossible is here. We come out of the impossible. We're not asking, Lord, today for something that the five senses can get, but we ask something today. Hallelujah. that the six sense can get. We ask something today. We want to step into faith. Amen. And virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and godly kindness and charity. The baptism of the Holy Ghost and want to go into impossible. What we think our hands can reach. There is another hand that can reach it is the hand of almighty God. Amen. We don't care the iron pass. We don't care the shackles on our feet. Uh we don't care this morning. We don't care this morning. The angel of the Lord is in our months. The angel of the Lord is in the camp. The angel of the Lord is with us. The angel of the Lord is with this people. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't you open your mouth speaking? You have so much faith. You can speak your own world into existence. so much of the Holy Ghost and you got one love on it. When nobody can find you, when no problem can find you. Why don't you tell that mountain to move? Why don't you tell that river to open and walk my brother and walk my sister and walk my brother? This is the time to deliver. Whenever the angel of the Lord is there, the people are delivered. The people are set free. The people are set free. We are set free out tabernacle. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We are set free. Our souls are free. Our children are free. The ministries are free. Everything is free. Hallelujah. Nothing can bound you. Why don't you take it? Whatsoever it is, your hands is open. Your hands is free. Take that drop. Your hands is free. Whatsoever you need, you take it this morning. You go into it. Doesn't care how many Philistines you go into that land. You go into your land. You know what is the difference between the people outside there and you? The difference is you are in El Tabernacle. The difference between the people there you walk and you you are in tabernacle. You are walking with angel. You are walking with angel. We are walking with angel. Lord don't leave us Lord. Lord you said you will never leave us. You will never forsake us. You will never leave us, Lord. You'll never forsake us. This is the time for the angel to be seen. For 400 years, there was no angel. 400 years they were nothing. But when the exodus start, he has stepped the angel forth. And Lord is our exodus. We're going to leave this place, Lord of Texas. We got to leave this world Lord. And when we leave this world, there must be angel leading us. There must be an angel. [Music] This church is not a church for the possible. If you can do it, it's fine. Do it. But Lord, I can't do nothing [Music] wrong. Lord, I can do nothing, Lord. Jesus said, I can do nothing over that. What my father has showed me, Lord, we can do nothing, Lord. Lord, we tired to do things, Lord. We tired, Father. Give up, Lord. We can't do nothing, Father. We can't do anything, Lord. Lord, we give up, Lord. Lord, we give up, Father. And Lord, we know when we give up, when you stop trying to do something, when we stop trying, Lord, still to do something is where you come in, Lord.

Lord, if there's somebody here that the doctors gave up, they said they can't do nothing. Lord, there is where you come in, Lord. Where the hands, they throw their hands in the air. They say this young man will never come right. They throw their hands in the air. When they say are so sick, they can't do nothing for you. When they throw their hands in the air, they can't do nothing. Is when you step in, Lord. It's when you change our lives, Lord. is when you healed us, Lord. It's when you delivered us, Lord.

Roscoe asks the question:\n\u201cWill Los Angeles go this year \u2014 2026?\u201d\n\nIn this address, Apostle Roscoe expounds on his feeling about Los Angeles and the year ahead, staying true to the Word of God and The Message of William Branham, substantiating his words with quotes and Scripture. \n\nAnyone with a desire for Christ and a yearning for His return is called to watch.\n\nMay God Bless You.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nHe's coming back. &gt;&gt; On a silver cloud of glory. &gt;&gt; He's going to take me away. Take me right away. &gt;&gt; I'm looking now at the sign of his returning. Won't be long. It may just be today. Jesus has gone to prepare for me a mansion way up on Glory Avenue. I'm standing firm on the promise that he made. Where I am, you can be there, too. He's coming back on a silver glory. He's going to take me away right away. &gt;&gt; I'm looking now at the sign of his returning. Won't be long. He may just be there. How many times have I dreamed of disappearing when he will take his bride away? I'm making plans to attend that marriage supper on that great eternal wedding day. He's coming back. Coming back. He's going to take me away. I'm looking back. Won't be long. He's coming back. He's going to take me away. I sound return today. He's coming back soon. He's going to take me away. I'm looking now. Won't be long today. Well, he's coming back soon. He's going to take me away. I'm looking at the sign of his return. Won't be long. I greet you again and again and again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our savior, our king, and our god. I um really didn't think I'll be on stream and uh busy again uh so soon this year. But uh things happens and then you just have to fall in. And this is one of those things that just happened. And uh it caused a question and what I said on New Year's Eve, a message, I never had it on my notes. I never thought about it. I never felt inspired to go this way. But I just found myself saying, I pray that Los Angeles should go down this year, 2026. And that made some ears pop up in the church. So some brothers ask about it. And now I'm telling you what happened there. It just it just came up while I was speaking and or preaching and then even brother Gus picked it up and uh we had uh a lengthy confident conversation on it and we were shocked what came out of it because he on the other side went back check up a few things and some of the things I'm going to mention Yeah. And it um really blew our minds. Um and that's the reason I thought I'll just come and speak to the church. And I want to make it pretty clear this is for my church. So um I am responsible not for the outside world but outside of my church I'm responsible for my church. So if something happens I need to tell them because Paul says I didn't shun to declare all and that is actually what I want to do. whatever is in my heart and whatever comes up I need to let uh the church know about it. I think that is scriptural and it's also ethic and um I know that uh this heading that we put up is quite shocking. Could Los Angeles go down this year? Uh now I know that um uh it causes ripples uh a title or a heading like this and uh I know there's many ministers that would never do a thing like this. And um I I'm not different. I'm just a human being. So, um, if you really check the heading, and I want you to please note what I'm saying. could. Not God said could or I said on the tape or I pray that Los Angeles should go down this year. I don't think that is rational for anybody to even say a thing like that. But uh I think Paul felt the same way the rapture will take place and he will change and brother Brandham also and that's why brother Brandham says and says this is the time there is nothing wrong in probing checking up things God wants us to check up things search he says and that's what we are doing and I'd like to saying you look at a message you preach on coming storms of judgment it's not that judgment is here I can see it comes on at the same time he preach on flashing red light of his coming not that he has come this is what's going to happen before he comes and u you find the guys every day have weather predictions It's not that the weather is like that when they start the predictions. They said tomorrow it will be rainy. So rain is coming tomorrow. So it's a prediction. It's a feeling. It's something that's coming. And uh brother Banab speaks about when a boat goes down or when a earthquake comes that animals all runs and stands once in a group they know. And brother B says now if animals knows oncoming storms of judgment how much more us. So now that on that premises I I want to speak to you that I feel like those animals like the predictions that this thing is coming and um I um would like to go into it and you can make up your mind how you feel about it. But uh this is the way I feel and that's why I said uh I know it's not a rational thing. Uh it is really controversial in a sense. Now I would like to say point number one we know she has to go down. It's been prophesied been prophesied by Nradamus, Ed Galaci, William Mariam Brandon. The scientist says even up till today she can go down in 5 minutes or in 5 years. So it has already been predicted and it's already said she's going down and the Bible also said she's going down in Revelation 16:18. So the fact of those angels was going down is inevitable. Everybody knows she's going down. There's been films made also that she's going down. So are we in that environment or in that space now that it is logical for her to go down? I like to talk about that environment to you El Tabernacle. have we come into that sphere that you could go down. Um so it's prophesied already. Now it's only time and season. The prophecy is done already. It's only is it time or is it season? Now we need to realize that it is already determined. Time is already there. The scientist says in 5 minutes was any time or within 5 years. It's anybody's guess. The season is the problem that's left to anybody's speculations. Is this the season? We know the time is ripe for it to go like Paul, everybody was shaken because it it didn't happen. But it only didn't happen because it's not season. It's the right time. She's cracked up already. Even the scientist says they don't know what is keeping her up. So the time I haven't got any problems but did we enter the season for her to go down? We know how perfect God is even with brother Brennan. You know, if a head is out of place, it could be time. But if it's not season for that thing to be that had to be on the right place and that human's got to sit in the right chair, nothing will happen. So we have everything just have we work out is this the real season for her to go. So um uh so my speculations and feeling and pray and dream is could you go 2026? I hope I'm wrong. I hope I'm wrong. I hope my feeling is wrong. I hope my season is wrong. But if it isn't, then we are in great great problems. Is because is there enough desperation like Daniel when he saw there was two years left, he went straight into desperation. And the same thing should occur to us. And therefore when I spoke on that, you can go listen to the tape. I also said um the handwriting is on the wall for it to go. I mentioned it on there. And I said, if you don't feel that way, there's something wrong with you because you still want to mess around in this vomit of this life. Brother already preached the world is falling apart anyhow. So all those things comes up and builds up the season. You see they asked Jesus what will the end be and then he gave them steps before it's going to happen. Matthew 25, before the door shut, there's steps. Certain things needs to be fulfilled step by step before the door could close up. So that's what we want to get to. So let's go straight into 1956. The handwriting on the wall preach by the prophet William Marian Brham. Now listen, it's 56 when he preached and this is what he says. And 2 years ago in California, he says, \"Two years ago, he made this statement.\" Now, if you remember, I preached the 70th Jubilee. And I said, \"There's two years to it right here.\" And we didn't realize how quick that two years has went. And the chronologist says it won't go past 2026 from the time we preach this. We said two years. Watch the two years. Daniel, two years left. Now two years. And brother Brandham comes with handwriting on the wall and it says two years ago in California which is Los Angeles when we was at the cow palace where the in California in a meeting. Why? I happen to think that Pentecost is 50 years old. 1956, it's been 15 years old this year. Now, he done calculations and there was a reason he done it. Now, watch what he says. This year in America. This year in America. Look. Revelations 13. And writing on the wall. America 1956. This is what he says. This is 50 year Pentecost. 50 years ago. The Holy Spirit fell the first time ever since Pentecost. 1956 for the first time 50 years ago the Holy Spirit fell first at Yuzuza which is Los Angeles. So Los Angeles is hooked in with the Holy Ghost the oil. The Holy Spirit fell first at Yuza Street and the old Yuza Street mission in California. So here's points here and I want to draw your whole attention to this quote. Two years ago, we spoke about it here 2026 and he preaches the handwriting is on the wall. That means what is on the wall is Pentecost and the Holy Spirit in California if you are spiritual. So the first time the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost started 1906. There was the first time it fell. But it was in Los Angeles. The Holy Ghost fell and it's Los Angeles that gets the earthquake. A black brother started it. The Holy Ghost to fall in Los Angeles. And right now in 2026, we have a colored guy. Every second word out of his mouth is the greater works, the Holy Ghost, receive and give. Nobody ever underline it as he did. Psalm We have Trump says nobody can make war against the USA. I want to get into something. But the United States proved once again that we have the most powerful, most lethal, most sophisticated, and most fearsome. It's a fearsome military on planet Earth. And it's not even close. And I've been saying it for a long time. Nobody can take us. Nobody. We don't want to have it. We don't have a discussion. But you read all and you see everything else. Nobody could have done that. Nobody has our weapons. Nobody has the quality of our weapons. The problem is we don't produce them fast enough. We're going to start producing them much faster. We're going to be very tough on the companies. We have the best weapons in the world, but it takes too long to get them, including allies. When allies want to buy them, they have to wait four years for a plane, 5 years for a helicopter. We're not letting that happen anymore. We're telling our defense contractors, you're going to start building faster. Pharaoh says, \"No army will dare to make war against Egypt.\" Babylon felt the same. Rome felt the same. On the battlefield, no nation can touch them. Trump says that inequivocally no nation will dare to come against us. We're too powerful. So I notice the minute they say a thing like that, then God steps in and he destroys that nation with natural disasters, plagues. They can't fight it with swords and shield. America, Los Angeles, they can't keep up with all the technology. Yellowstone will erupt and they can't stop the blast. Will that bring her on her knees? Now, why do you go to America? Because it first fell in America. Revelations 13. All this builds up that atmosphere that God wants to destroy you. Now I want to say again, will Los Angeles be down at the bottom of the ocean and Yellowstone erupts and the atomic bomb finishes up this year. So now the Mets is scary on that quote as brother Brandham does the calculation 50 years he calculated. Now, if we do the maths on that thing, the first time the Holy Ghost fell was 1906, which was when Pentecost broke out in America, 1906. We're in the year 2026. This is this year. Now, watch. Let's do the maths. 1906 and 2026 will give you 120 years. Now thing starts happening. 120 years. The message preached 1956 handwriting on a wall. If you minus it by 50, you come out to 1906 Yiza Street. Now from 1906 to 2026 120 years scary calculations that the Holy Ghost is now here for 120 years. And here comes a guy after 120 years and he says the oil is gone. And now after the oil is gone, the door is shut. So he brings in Noah because Noah preached 120 years and the door was shut. Are we in that environment for Los Angeles to go 120 years this year? Says the Holy Ghost fell. Luke 17:28. As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when he comes, the doors get shut. I didn't know why I preached that. I didn't know it's going to fall in like this. I didn't know the 120 years is up and here it caught us with our pins down. And that made me so scary that I could jump in and come and tell you. You've been in these series of meetings. Go check this book up and all the dates here to 2026. And here we back here in 2026 referring us back. There is now 120 years. So 2026 the Holy Ghost is here. Then the Holy Ghost oil is taken away like in Genesis 6. My spirit will not strive. And immediately after that 120 years is given and God destroys the earth after he preach 120 years is the door shut my brothers and the Holy Ghost is taken away this year 2026 he takes his spirit in Genesis 6 and lock the war. We said two years ago that there's two years left. Now we found out with the street and the earthquake. So is it possible according to this calculation that this could be the year? I don't know. I hope I'm wrong. I'm only human. I also have feelings. I believe Paul and them had feelings. I have feelings too. All right. Check out is this the season? It's so much look like it with a calculated years. Now at 120th this book at 120th Jubilee the prophet and the chronologist says the rapture must go. And they said it can't go further than 2026. I didn't say so. That's what brother Brandham says in Daniel 70s. That's what the chronologist all of them say. The 120 years is up this year. And the 70th week actually goes right in to Daniel 70 weeks with the 70th jubilee. It all ends this year. So that's the reason I said we have to come into the season. These are the things that makes me think this is the season. So because 120 jubilees from creation the creation was 44 to 2026 is 120 jubilees exactly. song is that why it just came in to me to say it without knowing this. We only found out this when we went back and good search. That's why I said it's it's it's my feeling that the season is right for her to go. And 120 jubilees, if you times it 50 by 50, 50 is jubilee. So if you multiply 120 * 50, you get 6,000. And we're now 6,000 years on the earth. And men was made on the 6th,000th year, the sixth day, which is 120 jubilees. So how could it be so perfect? So man is on the earth for 6,000 years. 6,000 years of sinning this year. And God on the sixth day made man. Is God going to make a new man, the statue of a perfect man for the seventh day which is millennium? The meek shall inherit the earth. So anything after this speak about the Sabbath, but it must be Los Angeles to open up. Now we went through all this in Matthew when the earthquake came, the graves open and the dead raised. So we know what this mean. Is the wise version going to be called to enter the door? It's scary times. Maybe they know what I preach. Enter the door with an earthquake. Noah's day the fountains open. In Genesis 7:11, the founders of the deep was open up. What was that? The earth can't just open up. It had to open up with the earthquake for the water to come, the underneath rivers to come up and then also the atomic explosion or waiting for America. So could it be that at the 120th year of the Holy Ghost and at it's funny at the end of the 120 years here's a man crying and shouting and preaching about the Holy Ghost the atomic bomb in Noah's day too. So it looks pretty. So Jesus said it, nobody ever speak such a lot about peace like Trump. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go now uh to Mara Lago where President Trump is ringing in the new year tonight with festivities at his Palm Beach uh mansion. It is a star-studded crowd tonight at that event. our own Libby Dean. Uh she is there as well. And just a short while ago, she had a question for the president about his resolution uh for the new year ahead. Take a listen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a New Year's resolution? &gt;&gt; I have peace. Peace on earth. Peace on earth. &gt;&gt; Peace on earth. Before uh the celebrations began and Trump wished uh for world peace, there there was work to be done. It was &gt;&gt; every time he says and talks, he talks about peace. And the Bible says they'll speak about peace, peace, and sudden destruction will heed them. In 2026, America will be 250 years old this year. 1786 * 250 is 2026. Trump is already planning a big party. &gt;&gt; My campaign for president, I pledged to give America the most spectacular birthday party the world has ever seen for America's 250th anniversary on July 4th next year. Already, we've had big celebrations to commemorate the 250th birthdays of the Army, the Navy, and the United States Marines. But there is much, much more to come. We're going to have a good time. As we ring in 2026, Americans across the nation will see the iconic Washington Monument illuminated with festive birthday lights to honor the start of this historic anniversary year. Then from June 25th to July 10th of next year, we will host the Great American State Fair on the National Mall, featuring pavilions from all 50 states, highlighting breathtaking innovations and celebrating America's exceptional history and culture. Frankly, you'll never see anything like it, and you'll never see anything like it again. In the fall, we will host the first ever Patriot Games, an unprecedented 4-day athletic event featuring the greatest high school athletes. one young man and one young woman from each state and territory. But I promise there will be no men playing in women's sports. You're not going to see that. You'll see everything but that. As I first announced in 2020, we will build the National Garden of American Heroes featuring statues of alltime greatest Americans. And we will build a triumphal ark as we celebrate 250 years of American freedom. We are the only major city. We are the only major capital. We are the only major place without a triumphal arc. A beautiful triumphal arc. One like in Paris where they have the uh great a beautiful ark in Paris. They call it the arc the triumph. And we're going to have one in Washington DC very soon. Construction will start in the very near future. And next spring, we will host a major prayer event on the National Mall to rededicate our country as one nation under God. We're not changing that. There are a lot of people would like to see it. It'll never happen. And on Flag Day, we will have a one-of-a-kind UFC event here at the White House. It'll be the greatest champion fighters in the world, all fighting that same night. The great Dana White is hosting and it's going to be something special. But all of this is just the beginning. 2026 will be a celebration of America like no other, honoring our nation and all of its glory. To help carry out these exciting plans, we have created a new public private partnership. It's called Freedom 250. Working with states, companies, and organizations across the country, we will renew the patriotism, pride, and pioneering spirit of America and lay the groundwork for the next 250 years of independence and freedom. This will be a time like you've never had in your lives. America 250. Thank you. I love you all. Just like bel you back to handwriting on the wall. They had a big big party that night. And what was it all about? They were the greatest. The walls were so thick nobody can penetrate it. They didn't worry about using security on anything because they felt so secure. And here the handwriting on the wall was that there's another nation that's busy going to take over. And now he puts handwriting on the wall. What is the handwriting on the wall now? What do you read? What's on the wall now? Only thing that's on the wall is modern events. America, America, America. That's all that you read about. And he's going to give a big bash. And while they were drinking and going on, the enemy struck. Could it be while the big party is going on this year for a celebration of 250 years of America? Can that thing happen while the party is on? The FIFA World Cup Soccer Tournament look like one of the best spectacles world the world will ever witness. All the world will be represented there and all that I said let the coliseums of America open and the games begins and sudden destruction hit them. What a season for it to go down. What a time while they were partnering for it to go down. While the whole world is watching, I don't know how many billions is watching. She shakes and she sings a tenth part of the earth right at her party. Then we have the king of England is already planning a trip to the USA. Another special occasion. The whole thing this year is a celebration. Will God then use this celebration like he does it right through in the Bible to shake Los Angeles. I feel that the atmosphere and the season is so right right now for it to happen. Is this opportune time for the earth will give way and a tenth part will lay beyond the ocean. you in this message as you listen to your listen to me it's supposed to shape you if it is like that where am I standing how can I keep my peace but preach Matthew 25:10 and the doors were shut and the earthquake is going to rock the world and the graves will open and the dead in Christ will rise and we that's alive will be changed by the oil the quickening power to meet the Lord in the air. Now Rome the Pope has closed the doors of Jubilee for 2026. Also, &gt;&gt; this is the final stage marking the end of the Catholic Church's Jubilee 2025. On Tuesday, Pope Leo I 14th closed the holy door of St. Peter's Basilica. Before bringing the celebrations to a close, the pontiff recited the prayer of thanksgiving for the holy year. This holy door is closed but the door of your clemency is not closed was the formula provided by the right. The actual walling of the door will take place privately later in about 10 days. This will bring to a close the jubilee of hope inaugurated by Pope Francis in December 2024 marking the first time in history that a jubilee year was presided over by two popes. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that. I just walked in and preach and the door is shut and closed the door too. And the world sees the pope or whoever it is closing the jubilee jubilee pentecost door 120 years up now how can't I say these things when I see these things how many things did I mention now that actually points to one and one thing only that she's got to rock down to the bottom of the ocean. She must. The sixth vision of William Brham, a woman will rise in the USA. And then he says, well, it might be Rome. Two women and I told you two years ago, the other woman Rome. And I said, \"Will Trump spiritually be that other woman Rome?\" I ask you if Trump will portray that woman that William Brandham saw the Roman Catholic Church. And I just want to go through this and I can close. Revelations 13:3. Revelations. We know that's America. I don't have to go in there. You heard me preach on it. And you in the message know it's America. Now, in Revelation 13:3, it speaks about the dragon and the beast. Two of them. The dragon and the beast. The dragon roam. Revelation 17, the beast. America, Revelations 13, two of them, America and Rome, or Rome and America. That is already fulfilled. The two of them, it's fulfilled before eyes. Revelation 13:4 it says, \"Who is like unto the beast?\" Trump says, \"Who in the world can compare with America?\" You heard it. How many times did you know Revelation 13 verse 4 was fulfilled? Right there out of his own mouth is fulfilled. So now we have Revelation 13:3 is fulfilled. We have Revelation 13:4 is fulfilled. Especially now when he went in there to Venezuela, he says it just took us so long. We didn't lose anything. &gt;&gt; Late last night and early today at my direction, the United States armed forces conducted an extraordinary military operation in the capital of Venezuela. Overwhelming American military power. Air, land, and sea was used to launch a spectacular assault. And it was a an assault like people have not seen since World War II. It was a force against a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracus to bring outlaw dictator Nicholas Maduro to justice. This was one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history. Not a single American service member was killed and not a single piece of American equipment was lost. We had many helicopters, many planes, many, many people involved in that fight. But think of that. Not one piece of military equipment was lost. Not one service member was more importantly killed. The United States military is the strongest and most fearsome military on the planet by far with capabilities and skills. Our enemies can scarcely begin to imagine we have the best equipment anywhere in the world. All Venezuelan military capacities were rendered perilous as the men and women of our military working with US law enforcement successfully captured Maduro in the dead of night. It was dark. The uh lights of Caracus were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have. It was dark. and it was deadly and everybody is shaking. The second thing of Revelation 13:4 is who can make war against her now? Is that what he says? There's nobody, no army in the world can compare to America. They too advance. When they went in there, they switch off the lights of the whole country. Nobody know how they done it. But is that Bible? That's Bible. Nobody can can fight her. She stops wars and she causes wars. She make law and she break the law and nobody says anything. I do not know if you listen to the news last night, yesterday when Macron and uh the council of Germany and uh uh that English guy spoke. They asked him straightforward questions. Was America right to go into another country and take over? None of them. None of them actually owned up that it's wrong. They all dived away. Why? Because who can make war against her? Brothers, there is somebody that's watching these things. There's nobody in the message that preaches these things and look at these things in L tabernacle. We don't only preach evangelistical stuff and so forth. We want to know what's happening now. What is modern events now? And nobody says anything. But now you'll know that Revelation 13:4 is fulfilled. Trump's fulfilled it. Then we got Revelation 13:5. He's given a mouth. The Bible says he's given a mouth. Who's got a bigger mouth than Trump? Everybody speaks about his mouth. Hey Who is more braggadocious than that mouth? Don't you know that that scripture he's given that mouth? And I don't have to say nothing here about that mouth. They say it every day over the radio and over the TV. He likes to yap and he goes over time when he speaks about anything else that mouth just goes like that and you sit there and you don't know that scripture that is Bible and that is also fulfilled. This scripture is also fulfilled. Verse six and seven will come to pass. This is his first term. In his second term, now verse seven, it says power was given him. He's got so much power, not even the UN can stop him. He ignores the world courts and justice courts. He doesn't get taken up. Putin go into a country, he takes it over. He is now a war criminal. He goes in, nobody touches him. &gt;&gt; The foreign minister of Greenland, she said a while ago in a press conference in the embassy of Denmark that she made very clear in the meeting that happened here in the White House, what are their limits? She also said that it was a very respectful meeting. Um, are those limits going to be respected? Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland. We need Greenland for national security. So, we're going to see what happens. Uh they're going to brief me on the meeting right after this conference. &gt;&gt; In fact, the sooner I get you out, the faster I'm going to know exactly what happened. But we have a very good relationship with Denmark, as you know. We'll see. But, uh you know, we're doing the Golden Dome. We're doing a lot of things and we really need it. Uh if we don't go in, Russia's going to go in and China's going to go in and there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it. But we can do everything about it. &gt;&gt; There's no more than what they can do that. &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to see. I mean, look, we're going to see what happens. Uh, but we need it. You know, I'm not the first one. This was talked about in by President Truman and 40 years before President Truman, they were talking about it. They've been talking about this for 100 years. This is not anything so new. A lot of people don't realize that, but this was a hot subject. Probably not as hot as it is now, but it was a hot subject for a long time. We need it for national security and that includes for Europe and I spoke with as you know Mark the head of NATO and he really wants to see something happen on NATO right now it sounds like you are saying that you would potentially acquire Greenland by force that would be a NATO country united are are you saying that would you do that &gt;&gt; you're saying that &gt;&gt; would you acquire them by force you're telling me that that's what I'm going to do you don't know what I'm going to So what are the options? Your network doesn't know either. The the Danish foreign minister said that there's still fundamental differences after the meeting with Rubio and with the vice president. Are you willing to uh leave the NATO alliance in order to get what you want with Greenland? What are the options right now? &gt;&gt; I won't be telling you what I'm willing to do. Certainly. I'm not going to give up options, but it's very important. Greenland's very important for the national security, including of Denmark. And the problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland. But there's everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela. There's everything we can do about things such as that. Not going to happen. Uh we're not, you know, I can't rely on Denmark being able to fend themselves off. You know, they were talking about they put an extra dog and they were serious about this. They put an extra dog sled there last uh month. They added a second dog sled. That's not going to do the trick. &gt;&gt; Denmark fought alongside the United States in both Afghanistan. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. I appreciate it. I have a living relationship and we'll see how it all works out. I think something will work out. &gt;&gt; What power is that? &gt;&gt; The G20 shake under him. They say we can't do anything until Trump comes. That scripture fulfilled. Never was there a man that had so much power and power was given him. So right behind him there stands the dragon. This is also fulfilled. Revelation 38. Look at all the world trembling before him. presidents run after him. It's only the bride William Brennham had called out. The wise virgin will not fall for the beast and the dragon. Revelations 13, Revelation 17. We can play you the clips that all the presidents shake before him. This scripture also fulfilled. Thank you, Prophet William Brennham. Revelation 13:11 got two homes like a lamb Christianity. He gives Israel back Jerusalem. Nice. A lamb Christianity religious horn adhorn political play with politics like a cat plays with a mouse. They can't catch him on politics. He walks over them. Is that your two? But you see exactly no politician stands against him. So, Revelations 13 verse 11 also fulfilled. Revelations 13:12 and the all the world saw future saw exercise all the power of the first beast before him. He will lead everybody back to the dragon. Most of his cabin is Roman Catholic. We gave you that already. Kennedy is the biggest one. His wife is a Catholic. His children is Catholic. And here's a pig that he looks like the Pope. Catholic. deadly womb which the Protestants afflicted is healed now. How is it healed? She's got American pope. So that healed the wound. America heal the horn. Now you got an American pope which is the dragon. And you got an American president who is the beast. The wound is healed. There's nothing against her. Revelation 13:13, he does great wonders. He makes fire come down from heaven. Is that fulfilled? He makes fire come down from heaven. Did we see how he took over with playing the clip? How the fire came down from heaven when he took Venezuela? How the fire came down and took the boats out? Fire came down in Yemen. Fire came down out of heaven and finish off Iran. And everybody is shaking. Every other president is shaking. He can come in any time and take over and there's nothing you can do. Here is the fire that comes down from heaven fulfilled. Revelation 13:16 and 17. Receive the mark of the beast. Oil gone. Seal of God gone. But now mark of the beast. Not out of Rome. the dragon revelation 17 by the mark of the beast come out of revelations 13 America comes the mark of the beast now what is the mark of the beast so that you can't buy or sell who brings the boycott who says you're not going to sell oil to that place you're not going to do this unless we say it who does that the buying and the selling now not Revelation 13. Unless you carry his mark, unless you agree with him, you can't make business anywhere in the world. He says we put a boycott on China, Russia, South America, Africa. She takes them all. And isn't that exercising the power of the first beast? Who takes them in a time of Jesus? Rome. Who is this fulfilled? Revelations 13. We will give you page 218 of this book. It must be 120 jubilees to 2026. And on page 162, birth of Jesus, 3 and 4 AD, 4,000 years from creation. From that another 2,000 years to 2026, 70 jubilees all together 120 jubilees. The 6,000 years is over. We need a Sabbath. Then he brings in the fig tree 1948 2028. And if we should go to Matthew 24:32 as I close. the fig tree when his branches is yet tender when she's still young and put forth leaves when it's still young. You know summer is nigh. So likewise when you see all these things the tenderness know it is near then he comes back even at the door. This was angelless even at the door. Not it's near, it's even at the door. When the door open, it's finished. Truly I say unto you, that generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled. If we take 1946 when the angel told William Marian Brham, Israel is a nation and we do the maths of it. 1946 to 19206 is 80 years. 80 years this year, that's two generations. And Jesus says one generation. This is not tender branches. She's not attended little nation anymore. She's a world power. So already we in the second generation. Could this be the time for Los Angeles to go down? I leave it up to you and each one of us has a feeling and this is my feeling that she without doubt is in the right season to go. I pray that there's such a lot of people that don't have the Holy Ghost and I don't know where they're going to get the Holy Ghost from. And the door is shut. How they going to make? Now not only outside there right here in our church al tabernacle if you have missed it while sitting in tabernacle there's not much we can do for you. We have run after the backsliders all these years and uh they didn't come. We can't run after them anymore. We can only help them that wants to be helped. So I want to ask the deacons to check out which of them wants to go into the door. God bless you. Thank you. The Bible says there were 120 gathered in the upper room according to Acts 1:15. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said, \"The number of names together were about 120.\" Now we are 120 years down the line after the Holy Ghost came at Isuza Street, Los Angeles, California, 1906 to 2026 equals 120 years. Watch that 120. Could it be this year? An exposition of the seven church ages. Nine. The Leodysian church age. The name Leodysia which means people's rights was very common and was given to several cities in honor of royal ladies so named. This city was one of the most politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor. Enormous amounts of property were bequeathed to the city by prominent citizens. It was the seat of a great medical school. Its people were distinguished in the arts and sciences. It was often called the metropolis as it was the county seat for 25 other cities. The pagan god worshiped there was Zeus. In fact, this city was once called Diopoulos, city of Zeus, in honor of their god. In the 4th century, an important church council was held there. Frequent earthquakes finally caused its complete abandonment. How fitting were the characteristics of this last age to represent the age in which we now live. &gt;&gt; That's solemn warning. We don't know what time and you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean. Oh, Capernium said Jesus, thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell. FOR IF THE MIGHTY WORKS HAD BEEN DONE IN SODOM AND GOMORRAH, it had been standing to this day. And Sodom Gomorrah lays at THE BOTTOM OF THE DEAD SEA, and Capernium's in the bottom of the sea. Thou city who claims to be the city of the angels, WHO'S EXALTED YOURSELF INTO HEAVEN, AND SENT ALL THE DIRTY, FILTHY THINGS OF FASHIONS AND THINGS TO EVEN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES COME HERE TO PICK UP OUR filth and send it away. THROUGH YOUR FINE CHURCHES AND STEEPLES AND SO FORTH THE WAY YOU DO. REMEMBER, ONE day you will be laying in the bottom of this sea. You're a great honeycomb under you right now. THE WRATH OF GOD IS BELCHING RIGHT BENEATH YOU. HOW MUCH LONGER YOU'LL HOLD THIS SANDBAR HANGING OVER that when that ocean I enter a MILD DEEP WILL SLIDE IN THERE, PUMP BACK TO THE SALT AND SEA. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE WORSE THAN THE LAST DAY OF POMPEI. REPENT, LOS ANGELES. REPENT THE REST OF YOU AND TURN TO GOD. THE HOUR OF HIS WRATH IS UPON THE EARTH. FLEE WHILE THERE'S TIME TO FLEE AND COME INTO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; The ancient Roman city of Pompei was a wealthy tourist city that sat on the coast near the Bay of Naples. In AD62, an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude demolished the city of 20,000 people, killing more than 2,000. The damage extended to the city of Herculanium, and the destruction was as extensive as the tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia in the 2000s. Due to an inability to communicate immediately, Rome was unaware of the earthquake. And on that same day, February 5th, the port of Austia in Rome was hit by a tidal wave caused by the Pompei quake, destroying three ships containing a year's supply of grain for Rome. The city of Pompei experienced extensive damage. On August 24th, AD79, Mount Vuvius, directly outside of Pompei, erupted for 24 hours, creating a bigger disaster than Pompei had already seen more than 16 years earlier. The eruption was accompanied by two different phases. The first was that of pummus fallout in which a rain of lightweight pellets of pummus and ash fell from the sky burying the city in 2.5 m of debris. Plenny described seeing the plume of ash that rose from the mountain as an umbrella pine that gradually fell over the surrounding areas. The second phase was the pyrolastic surge, a 100 mph cloud of poison gas and pulverized rock that poured down the mountain, engulfing everything in its path. The first part of the eruption produced total darkness, filled with some electric charges, and engulfed everything in Pompei and Herculanium. This killed numerous people. The Roman city of Pompei, 1st century AD, an affluent, vibrant, and progressive hub near Naples. With Mount Vuvius towering over the city, inactive for centuries, the people of Pompei had no fear of the great volcano. But deep inside Vubuvius, molten rock had been leaking from the Earth's crust, a thick plug of rock in the volcano blocked its exit, and explosive pressure slowly grew inside. On the morning of August 24th, 79 AD, Pompei was about to meet its fate. The volcano finally erupted, sending molten rock 15 km into the sky. The day turned black as the hot rock mixed with the air over Pompei, blocking the sun, cooling and falling on the city as pmis rock, ash, and rain. 4 billion tons of material would fall on Pompei within 24 hours. Ash and magma collided in the air, triggering volcanic lightning. As the eruption continued, the magma chamber eventually emptied and collapsed. The first pyrolastic surge towards Pompei begins. These are groundhogging avalanches of hot ash, pummus, and volcanic gas that rush towards Pompei at 100 km per hour. The first surge falls just short of the city, but asphyxiation from toxic gas and ash killed many. 16 hours after the first eruption, the volcano column completely gave way. &gt;&gt; Pyrolastic waves smashed through houses, leaving victims instantaneously encased in blankets of ash and pummus. The city and its people were frozen in time. Mount Vuvius buried Pompei in 25 m of volcanic rock and ash. Pompei was rediscovered by accident over 1500 years later in 1594. Amen.

As we are about to enter into our prayer session, can we just go into the word like to turn to Matthew chapter 21:3 and he said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves. The house of the Lord is called the house of prayer. And we have someone who has taught us how to pray. So without any further ado, we're going to thank him. We're going to worship him.

Oh Lord God, my God. But here, oh father, is the church. Here is the ministry where they hearkened unto the voice of the hour when it said, \"Hurt not the oil and the wine.\" Uh father, we did not hurt the oil and the wine. Uh in fact, we are the church, oh Lord, uh that has taken the lamp with an extra vessel of oil. Oh God, uh we are the church that took the lamp with the extra vessel. Oh father, we are wise. Oh father, though, oh lord, the other churches, oh father, may see us as foolish people, oh God, uh oh lord, but though, oh father, I may be a fool in their eyes, uh I am wise in Christ, uh because I have found a placeh and I have found the man where the spirit of truth dwells. Uh what manner of man is this uh in whom the spirit of the Lord dwells? Lord my God, my God, you have made a way for my brother, you have made a way for my sister to come into the house of prayer, to come into the house of worship, to come into the house of praise. Oh father, we can't help but worship. Oh Lord, we can't help but praise you. Jehovah, we can't help but shout. Jehovah Rosco, we can't help it, oh God. Just as Moses couldn't help but name a certain place after you. Uh just as Jacob couldn't help but name a certain place after you. Uh just oh Lord like Abraham. Oh father couldn't help but say Jehovah Gyra. We say Jehovah Rosco because we have seen the man. We have handled him. Oh Lord. Oh God. We are wrestling with the angel. Oh father. My God. until the break of day. Uh keep me burning. Oh father give me oil in my lamp. Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning till the break of day. That light oh father is the very life of God. And in order for that life, oh father, to shine in my lamp. I need oil, oh God. And I found a place, oh Lord, where the oil is dripping. And it's coming from the head downh. And it's coming from the head down. Oh Lord my God. Uh after this after the Holy Ghost is come we will receive power. And we have gotten power. Oh God power in prayer.

Oh Lord God. Uh oh father, my God, my God. Uh what can we say? Oh Lord. Uh for we have a man uh who gave us the six months for knowledge. Oh Lord. Uh we seen a man who said in 6 monthsh something is fixing to happen. My God. And oh Lord God we are past those months. Oh Lord we are past those months. Oh father. And as the days go by, oh Lord, oh father, we find ourselves walking in the king's highway. Uh we find ourselves walking in the light of God. Uh because we have a leadership, oh father, a leadership, oh Lord God, uh that holds us accountable, oh Lord, uh a leadership, oh Father, in whom, oh Lord, we have a shepherd and we know his voice, oh Lord, uh a stranger we shall not follow. Uh a stranger we shall not follow. Thank you for the leadership of Yahweh. Oh Lord God. Oh God, they are sheep. They are wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh father standing at the pulpit this morning. Oh God they are quoting your word. Oh God they are quoting the spoken word. Oh God they are saying this. Oh God they are saying that. But we can say, \"Oh, father.\" We have a man and he's come around and he's called my name. Amen. We glory. Glorios unto the King of Kingsh. Glorios unto the Lord of Lords. For you have given us a leadership, oh Father, that has the oil dripping from the head down. My God. Oh father, flying with both wings, oh Lord. Uh it's not just the mechanics, oh God.

We can, oh father, rejoice, oh God, for our cups are running over. We are drunk with the wine. This day, my God, this day, Jehovah, this day, my God. Lord I pray therefore for each and every brother and sister my God. Oh Lord God I pray for each and every family. Oh father let us oh God not get any comfortable not get too comfortable. Lord God but let us always find ourselves desperate. Oh father let us find ourselves on our knees. Oh father calling upon the name of Yahweh. Let us find ourselves, oh Lord God, drunk in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh father, when we come into this house of prayer, may we get as much oil, oh father, into our lamps, oh Lord, as much as we can, oh father, Lord, my God, my God, in our houses, oh God, may the desire, oh father, to watch the storehouse be there in and no desire, oh Lord God, oh father, to prioritize other things about you, my God.

You have given us the opportunity oh Lord to top up on the oil to top up on the oil every month. My God may each and every family member from the head of the house of father to the children thereof. Oh God, may we, oh Lord, find ourselves sincere with thee. May we, oh Lord, find ourselves, oh God, at the altar, oh father, may we, oh God, find ourselves on a Wednesday, uh, oh, shouting and jumping and praising the Lord. May we find ourselves as close to God as much as we want to. Oh God, my God. Oh Lord, my God, there are the young ones, oh Lord, and there are those who are old, oh father, who do not have jobs, oh God, I pray, oh father, that you come their way, oh God, for the joy of the Lord is our strength, oh God. Oh God, how can I have joy? Even the joy of the Lord if I don't worship how can I have joy if I don't worship if I don't get under the Holy Ghost how can I be filled with oil how can I be filled with wine how can I go about being drunk in the spirit having joy and eternal emotion therefore my God may you bless the young ones and the old oh God who want to make a living. Oh Lord, may you bless their businesses, oh God. May you bless their jobs, oh Father. Are you bless them with a job, oh God, uh that they may be able, oh father, to be without an excuse, oh God, uh to come unto the house of the Lord, uh and to glorify your name, uh in all of their substance, uh in all of their virtue, uh with all of their heart, my God, uh I ask of thee, oh Father, because they are, oh Father, the pride of the Lord.

The right path of god where we can find ourselves in the right hand of Jehovah. Thy right hand oh God is become glorious in power. Thy right hand oh God had dashed the enemy into pieces. is my God. Oh Lord, oh God, we are partakers of the land. We are not like them who wanted to, oh father, just dwell outside of the land because it's ideal for them and their livestock. We don't want to be like their fathers who give a bad report about the Holy Ghost. We don't want to be like them. Oh Lord, but we want to be like Joshua. We want to be like Caleb. Oh Lord God, we want the land. We want the land. And you have given us the land. Oh father that flows with milk and honey. My God that has the vineyards. Oh father where the wine, oh father is that has the mount of olives. Where the oil is. Oh God, my God, my God. Uh, oh father, my God. Where can we find a ministry like this? Uh, there is nowhere else. Oh father all the places oh God be it in the oh father the United States be it oh Lord God in Europe be it in any part of the north my god oh lord you won't find this placeh you won't find this people you won't find this leadership oh father you will only find it in our tabernacle may it be written in our hearts. And may we never forget it, my God, that we may always find ourselves here. That we may always come here, my God, Lord. My God, we need you more than we need the sunshine. Lord, we need you more than we need the rain. Lord, we need you more than we need the morning, my God. For Lord God, you are the everlasting father. Lord, people come and go, friends come and go, but you are the everlasting father. And oh Lord God, in John chapter 14, behold, you sent the comforter our way. Behold, you sent the spirit of truth our way. Behold, you sent, oh God, the five-fold minister to the five-fold ministry, and you have given him an added gift of wisdom. Oh father, that all things may be made plain unto El tabernacle. Oh Lord, we know about the keystone revelation. We know about evolution, my God. We know, oh Lord, about the oil and the wine. We know about the exposition of the seven church ages. Uh we know about the cloud, my God. We know about the cherubams, oh Lord, that Paul could not speak of particularly. Oh my God, my God. Uh we know, oh father, uh be cause, oh lord, uh you sent a man our way. Uh a man who knows more than we do. Uh a man, oh God, oh God, uh who can never be deceived. Uh oh man. Oh Lord God. Uh oh father who prays. Uh 2:00 a.m. in the morning for my soul. Uh for my soul for my mother's soul. For my brother's soul. Uh for my sister's soul. Oh God. Oh God. Uh the royal priesthood. Adonai. Adonai. You have sent oh father into the area of South Africa. My God. Behold how good it is. Oh Lord, for brothers to dwell together in unity, oh father, and we dwell together, oh God, because there's oil in the camp, my God, the shout of the king is in the camp, Jehovah, the shout of the king is in the camp, my God. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, we thank you, oh God. We thank you, oh God. We glorify your name. We glorify your name. We give you all, oh father, the honor and the glory, oh Lord. I pray that you preserve, oh Lord our God, the life, oh father of the leadership, oh Lord. Oh father, from the head, oh God, unto the lineage, oh father, unto the children's children, oh Lord. Father, we need the roster family. Oh Lord, I pray, oh God, that you preserve their life all the more for us. Oh God, oh Lord God, as you have given Israel, the Levites, surely you give El Tabernacle, the Rosco, my God, and we thank you, oh God, for the Rosco family, oh Lord. Father, they have given us, oh Father, the opportunity to share, oh Father, my God, the apostle with them, oh Lord. Oh God, had it been for them, oh Lord, they could have just lo for themselves. But oh Lord, they don't have an eel spirit. My God, they have a giving spirit. Oh father, and they have given unto me, oh Lord, they have given unto me, the man of the hour. For cometh the man, come at the hour. And in this hour, oh Lord, on a Saturday night, just like last night, oh father, if I was not here, had not a man come around, had not I heard a voice, I was probably going to be in the filth of the world. I was probably going to be in the red districts. Uh I was probably going to be uh in the drinking sessions. Uh I was probably going to be uh oh Lord, where the world music is, my God. But on a Saturday night, on a Saturday night, here comes a manu. A man, and he knows my name, and he knows my name. And he knows my name. And I will be caught up just like brother Brennham was caught up this word. I was caught up into El Tabernacle on a Saturday night. Uh and the blessings of the Lord uh came down not just the birthight but the blessings of the birthright uh because we wrestle with the angel. We wrestle with the angel. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God we wrestle with the angel. Uh and blessings are come upon us. Oh Lord. Oh Lord, we thank you for the man that has taught us how to pray. Oh Lord, oh God, this Bible could just been a story. This Bible could just been a story, my Lord. But now, oh father, the bride, she sees the love letter. She sees the love letter of the bridegroom. She sees the mysteries of God while the world does not see you. Lord, we see you face to face. While Moses could only see the back parts of your mind, the back parts of your body, my God, we see the bosom of God. For you said that you will be with us and in us forever, my God. Not just now but forever my father. So Lord God if they say that we are cults. If they say that we are brainwashed then we oh father are the members of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then we if we are brainwashed we are washed by the blood of the lamb. I'm better off being brainwashed by the blood of the lamb than being brainwashed by the filth of the world. Oh God. Oh God, what good it is? What good is it? Oh father, if I go to hell with a Bible, oh father, what good is it, oh God, if I go to hell still knowing all the commandments? What good is it, oh God, if I open my eyes in hell and all the days of my life? I was quoting brother Brennham. What good is it, oh God, if I don't have the oil? What good is it, oh father, if I don't have the oil? Oh God, my God, give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning till the break of day. Keep me burning till the break of day. Oh my God. Keep me burning till the break of day. Oh Lord my God. You provide the fire. I'll provide the sacrifice. I will open s inside. My God. I will open up inside. You provide the spirit. Oh God. Thy word is a lamp to my feet. Oh Lord, I need oil. My God, I don't want to open my eyes in hell like the rich young ruler because Oh God, he kept all your commandments, my God. He kept your statutes, my God, you love him, oh God, but he didn't have blood. He didn't have the life in the blood. It didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh God. Oh God. My God. This hidden life in me that's stepping out. This perfect man in the image of the Lord God Almighty. This child of God that is within me is stepping out. And one of these days, one of these days, we will be sweeping the sky. But as long as I'm on the earth, my God, may I b myself. Oh God, worshiping you all the days of my life because it's the only thing I can do. Oh foolish virgins. Oh God, they seek to please you with their eyes and their lips, but they never rendered out their heart. My God. Oh God. Oh God, how fortunate is El Tabernacle? How fortunate am I to be a written apistl? Because I opened the eyes of my heart. I opened my heart unto you and the spirit of the Lord came in. I opened my heart unto you and the spirit of the Lord came in. Now when they ask oh God and they say which king is ruling your life I will say oh my god the hope of glory king Jesus God the god king himself the king of kingsuh he is the ruler of my life because I opened the eyes of my heart and I see him in the compartment of my heart there is oil there is oil in my handh There is oil in my lamb. There is oil in my lamb. Because oh God, thou tabernacle is wise. Thou tabernacle is wise. Oh God, my God, we didn't just take the lamp. We took the extra vessel. Lord, while the world Oh God, they rejected the extra vessel. Oh Lord, while they rejected the extra vessel, while they were satisfied with the light the lamb had, we weren't satisfied. The wise was not satisfied. We couldn't help but take the extra vessel. And the extra vessel, he stands every combined right behind us. And he gives out the oil. And he gives out the oil. Oh my Lord, my God, how can I say? Oh, how I can say like David said, oh thou, oh God, anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Oh goodness and mercy, goodness and mercy, goodness and mercy. They follow me all the days of my life because oh God we are not the ones who are sitting in the seat of the scope. Lord my God we are the ones uh oh God. Uh who excites you who entertains the angel. Oh God my God. They didn't want to entertain the angel. They rejected the colored porter because of the color of his skin. But the wise virgin, they took the extra vessel. Because the extra vessel is the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they rejected that container even though they wanted the content there in. But you can't separate the gift from the man. You can't separate the gift from the man. And so we thank you for the man cuz we know, oh God, when the man comes around, something is left behind. Something is left behind. My Lord, eternal life is left behind. The Lord's release is left behind. Oh my God, the workings of the Holy Ghost is left behind because you sent an angel before us. You open the year of 2025 with sending the angel before us to keep us in the way. Because oh Lord, nothing happens unless the angel comes down. And oh God, it is recorded in your Bible. Oh Lord, that the angel of the Lord always comes down. That the angel of the Lord is always in pious skins when he comes down. Oh, how Gideon says he has seen the face of God. Oh my Lord, how Manoah and his wife say, \"Oh, we have seen God face to face. You are the same angel that sits under an oak tree. You are the same angel that stood next to Brother Prenam, God, and heal the people. You are the same angel that we see, oh God, every month. Oh God, every month, oh God, how can we be silent? How can we be silent? How can we sit in the seat of the scornful when we are in the midst of angels? How can we sit in the presence where the oil is dropping down? Oh Lord, oh Lord, may more of the oil fall upon us till we are so slippery, oh Lord, uh that the devil's hands, oh God, they can't even get us, oh father, so slippery with oil, oh God, that he complains and says you lay a hedge around them, oh God. Oh God, keep us, oh God, in the righteous way. Keep us, oh God, in the way of holiness. How can we be holy without the Holy Ghost? My God. You only want to see you, my God. You only want to see you, my father. That's why we plunge beneath the blood, my God. That's why we cover ourselves with the blood, my God. Because red through red makes white, my God. And now, oh father, because the token is applied, the atken, the the atonement is made. The rain, oh God, the letter rain is fallen on us now. Oh God, we have fellowship. Lord, the blood of bulls and goats, they had their time, oh God, it was not enough, oh father, it would just temporarily cover it. Oh Lord, but the blood of the lamb washes me entirely. Behold the saints of God. Though their sins be scarlet, though their sins be crimson, Lord, you washed us whiter than snow. Because you have given us the Lord's release. You have given us, oh father, the workings of the Holy Ghost. Because what is the Holy Ghost given for? Oh Lord God, what is the Holy Ghost given for? That's why we thank you, oh Father. We thank you, oh Lord, for the adoption. Oh Father, we thank you, oh Lord, for the Holy Ghost, my God. We will say it over and we will say it over and we will say it over and over again, my God, because this does not cease. This cannot die. This cannot die. Father, we see how the other movements, oh Lord, uh, how they died off, my God, because the letter killth, my God, but oh father, oh Lord, my God, may those, oh father, who will look, may they behold just like a milliel, will be held and said, uh, if this is of a manuh, it will cease, but if this is of God, it shall not cease. And we have received of the Lord. Uh because we don't just have a man of God. We have a God man. Uh we have a man that is sent our way. We have oh God a mighty angel that's come down. We have oh father the workings of the Holy Ghost. Oh father where we have enough oil to live the life. We have enough oil to love my God. We have enough oil, oh father, to speak life and peace, oh Lord, my God, the blessings of the birthright uh is upon our tabernacle, my God, uh may you equip us well, oh father, with the understanding, oh father, of cherishing the Holy Ghost uh that we, oh Father, may not underestimate, oh Father, what we have, my God, uh there's nothing better in this world, uh than what we have, my God. There's nothing better in this world than the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh because when we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, uh Lord, anything we ask in your name, anything we ask in your name. And so, oh Lord, like the songwriters say we will speak Jesus. Uh oh God, because uh we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh we have the author of the Bible. Uh we have the oil himself. Uh we have the anointing. Uh we have the Christ. We have Jehovah Rosco. We have Jehovah Gyra. We have Jehovah Ni. We speak Jesus. We speak Jesus. Uh I speak Jesus for my family. I speak Jesus for my brothers. Uh I speak Jesus for my sisters. Uh I speak Jesus. Uh I speak Jesus. Uh I speak salvation. Uh I speak deliverance. Uh I speak healing. Uh I speak power. Power from on high. The power of God is in pure skins. The power of God is in pure skins. So much so when the praises go up, the glory comes down. We bend the heavens like a bow. We bend the heavens like a bow. And the years of Jehovah, they come down. The years of Jehovah, they come down. The angels of the Lord encamp round about the premises and camp around those that fear him. the angel of the Lord and the host thereof, all the multitudes and multitude they come down because you have given us uh the authority to speak Jesus. To speak Jesus I speak Jesus uh for the blind. I speak Jesus uh on the lame. I speak Jesus uh for the weary. I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus. I speak Jesus uh I speak Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord my God. We speak life into that which is dead. We speak life uh into that which is dead. We speak life uh to a sad marriage. Uh we speak life uh to a parent home. Uh we speak life uh to the left of the lame. We speak life uh to the eyes of the blind. Uh we speak life uh to the heart of the ignorant. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. We speak life. I speak healing. I speak healing. Oh Lord. The healing in the mind. My God. The healing in the flesh. My God. The one who needs healing. May they lift up their hands believing with all of their heart. Believe it with all of their heart. that. Oh my my They speak Jesus. They speak Jesus. They speak Jesus. May we speak Jesus in the trials of our lives. May we speak Jesus. Oh my God. Your name is healing. Your name is power. Oh God, you are holy. My lovely one. Oh lovely one. Lord, had it not been for your grace, I could not stand. The disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved? Who then can be saved?\" Oh God, because the rich young ruler, he valued all the other things instead of the sacrifice himself. But here comes a man saying, \"You can have the whole lamp, but if you don't have oil, he will open your eyes in hell.\" Oh God, I'm thankful. I'm thankful Jehovah. I'm thankful Elohim. I'm thankful Adonai. I'm thankful Hashem because I am one of them who can say I am wise. I am wise because I have the oil. Oh God, my God, as we are about to close, oh father, this wonderful prayer service, oh Lord, I pray that your spirit continues to move even after this all over the face of South Africa. Wherever the streams are, may they speak Jesus. May they speak Jesus, may they not miss their blessing. Oh God, may they not miss their blessing. Oh father, may they catch it through the streams. May they catch it through the streams. Uh may it not be like that sister in brother Brennham's time where she missed the angel because she decided to not entertain the angel. But may we in entertaining the angel receive that which we need. We always need something from you. We always need something from you. Oh lovely one Lord. Oh precious savior, we glory in your name. We glory in who you are. We glory in the name Yahweh. We glory in the name Jehovah Rashco. We glory in who you are. We don't want to see ourselves anymore. Gone is seek. Gone is seek. Gone. Oh father is oh father this person who's of the world but born again is the son of god born again is the son of god anointed to prosper and strong born again is the daughter of god and you have given us power may we go out with power you have given us power the anointing is upon us oh father From the head down. From the head down. Lord my God, the foolish virgin does not know the cost of my alabaster box. My God, the foolish virgin does not know. But my brother and my sister, they know the cost. They know the cost. My God. Therefore, with all of our strength, with all of our heart, with all of our mind, with all of our substance, my God, may we serve you. May we be the living sacrifices. May we be, oh my, oh my, the Christ in the me many membered body. May we be the sons and daughters of God uh walking all over the face of the earth doing the exploits whatsoever we will oh Lord according to thy desire and according to thy will oh father you direct the path oh father for many a man a plans a man has in his heart but you my god you direct the path and you have directed the path of thy tabernacle you have directed the path of our hearts. You have directed it, oh father, into the king's highway. You have directed it, oh father, into the morning. My lord, we are walking in the light. Oh father, behold, we have our yer. Behold, we have the lord shining his face upon us. Lord, Lord, we are not foolish to be buying oil, oh God, at the time when we should be having it. Lord, we are not like the foolish virgin who's going about looking for a false anointing who is going about looking for the riches of the world, but we are like the wise for we find everything in the bridegroom. We seek the kingdom first and we know the rest shall follow. Lord my God, let the one oh father who feels defeated this morning, let the one who's going through the hardest of trials, let the one who has a problem that he's not talking about, let the one who's got an issue that he won't speak out, may those ones uh may they be the ones uh who speak power right now. Uh may they be the ones uh who call upon the name of Jehovah right now. May they be the ones uh to be wrestling with the angel right now. May they be the onesh who are going to get up the eighth time after falling seven times. May they be the sons and daughters who gets up the eighth time and say uh son and moon stand still until I win. May they speak like Stephan. May they have the power like Joshua when he had a victory over the kingdoms that were against the house of God that were against Isaiah. Oh my my.

thee and strengthen me I pray thee just once more Lord amen as we go to the throne of God and approach him as the Apostle taught us how to pray prayer is not to bring God down before men but to take

elections.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\ngood evening El Tabernacle and um listeners around the world that's going to listen to this clip that I made that I'm going to make and um we greet you in the name of our King God the soon coming Messiah to the Jews but first to the Gentiles the Lord Jesus Christ we are actually forced to make this clip because there is still people around going and saying that I prophesied that the Lord is coming and um I think brother Kurt told us not the other day another brother told him and then when the brother went to go check up he saw that I never said a thing like that and he had to phone C back and apologize not in our church in another church the r will also told me a brother told him that and then he told the brother I was in that meeting can you tell me where on that tape does he make that prediction that you're talking about and the brother couldn't answer him so I um I just fell to save God uh our church because I'm not send to these guys in the message you know and I I I have a responsibility uh for my church and uh that's why brother Branham laid hands on me and Prophet visit South Africa because he saw that I would have a church or churches and I will be have to be responsible for them and I will actually preach exactly what he preach or say exactly what he says or prophesy again what Revelations 107 has brought forth so that's why we are just recapping um uh the uh Jubilee message that I preach which has gone around the world everybody heard it and um it wasn't done in secret I preach it all over the world uh I let it go all over the world and uh uh but you know people when you are a Target they try to get any little thing to put on you and make you wrong that's why Jesus says blessed are they if they speak all manner of wrong things lying you know for my name's sake blessed are ye so we thought about recapping just for Al Tabernacle sake and uh I got to a place where I don't care about anybody else if somebody wants to know something I will have all the patience in the world to sit with him if they haven't got to arant Spirit and if they come from other church and try and do my best to show them where we stand and uh without trying to steal Souls but uh time has gone by and uh you don't find people wanting to know more about God they um seated in their churches and their doctrines so that's why I said I I have to care just for El tacle now we have to recap a few things here for a couple of minutes and because people are going around saying I said the Rapture is going to take place last year 2310 2024 last year was 49 years so they were wrong they were lying you know last year was not the 70th Jubilee last year was 49 years you know wedn they were be 50 years but they said I said last year and that just shows you that they do not understand uh the 70th Jubilee and the dates and stuff like that that's why their pastors don't understand it and their pastors can't preach on it and now because I preach on it and I made sense to it I must be attacked and stupid guys would come and you said no don't say that well uh brother Paul says in Galatians who has bewitch you you foolish Galatians you know so were and foolishly attack me and when I said man hey uh 2023 is not the 70th Jubilee then everybody backed off you know and uh it showed me that they didn't understand a bit on what I was saying therefore it is for my church and we don't care what anybody else say about it so they lied about me saying the rapure will take place last year you know and last year was not the 70th Jubilee now this year 2024 which is Wednesday coming is the 70th Jubilee and the changed the tune and said I said the Rapture will take place Wednesday which is another line I have never said a thing like that and uh I cannot understand they call themselves The Bride but they're lying like this they call themselves well we got love but they like like this you don't find love in untruth love rejoice in truth you must speak truth that's love but these all these guys are lying they're a bunch of liars you know and uh to me don't come and preach love to me you know because none of you Sayes it and I proved it What Love Is Love is a baptism of the Holy Ghost full stop nothing more nothing less so that's why we put the clip on social media what I said it's on it's on there for months we checked it up it will be a year and a couple of months that we put the clip up there to explain the whole thing you know and yet they go on for the whole year so how would you miss it if I put the clip on there for the whole year so I got to come back again now and do it again you know so that they could be judged on their lives with their pastors and all second point I invited pastors of other churches to be in that meeting and all our preachers because brother Brandon said said um don't say I said that 1977 the Lord is coming he said he three times in uh Daniel 70 weeks and yet look how the media went on that brother BR prophesied now we're not prophesying I never prophesied and I never said thus say the Lord you know on the 70 weeks of Daniel there nothing like that and brother Bram says he never said it is thus sayth the Lord so uh but they finish him up until we came out with the 70th Jubilee and showed exactly that brother B was right 1977 was a start of the 70th J cuz 1974 it started to 2024 so uh required him down praise God that we could be Protectors of this wonderful message this is the clip we played for months or one year and yet pastors are lying I never change anything it's told the 70th week 70th Jubilee Wednesday coming it cannot be changed you can't shift it because that's the amount of time given to the Jews so nobody can change it it's the 70th Jubilee so this is the club that we played for a year is there a time that men will be cut off according to God's Bible when will the 70th Jubilee be the expected time the desired time for God to come not the desired time that Edgar Rosco said because everybody said something the 7even day Adventist also had a date and it failed the Jehovah Witness had a date and it failed because it was their date but the 7th Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's date that's the difference Lord what will the end be go your way there it's concealed until the time of the end when you see a preacher preach on maratha then it sounds for you what will the end be that's why he says it will be the aering in of the Millennium because the 6,000 years is finished we moving into the seventh Hallelujah the only thing that can change that date is the long suffering of Christ nothing more my spirit shall not always strive with men cut off time have you realized that such a short time left in the short time God in the short time amen Los Angeles has to go down in the short time that woman has to raise in America and 2024 is the USA elections again could it be the date that that woman will be elected that will cause America to go down yes B believe yes you will see them going down Los Angeles we are not here forever there must come an appointed time for God to come and close isn't there an appointed time for men on the earth yes there is you have prayed maybe five times a day like the Muslims maybe three times a day like to choose but now you have to pray without ceasing so there you have it we played this for over a year and how could you misunderstand it is my problem it just shows you jealousy and it just shows you that they are looking to get something thing on me so uh I just want to clear it with my people I don't care what the other people say about it I want to clear it with my people which I did so uh that's the clip now the big question is now who said that the 70th Jubilee is the rapture and the ushering in of the Millennium who said that I never did it doesn't come from me then who said it now let's welcome brother brandham to the podium to play Daniel 70 weeks tape now mark down in your book a little scripture here I want to give you Leviticus 25 beginning with the eth verse God called a jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was a jubilee we know that yeah we understand that from the first Jubilee of Leviticus 258 and 1977 will be the 70th Jubilee making exactly 3,430 years amen hallelujah Jubilee means going up amen Rel oh we're watching for the coming of that glad Millennium day when our blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting briway oh the world is growing crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of jubilees amen and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the Jubilee of the going up of the Gentile bride and the return of Christ to the Jews am when they go out of bondage amen because Jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration ation that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and Usher in the Millennium so now I'd like to ask you now who said the 70th Jubilee is the rapture me your Prophet said so so you want to say that I am wrong I don't got it from the prophet yeah you read the prophet said so so blame the prophet if you if you say no no no it doesn't and you got all these other excuses say you against your own Prophet you're talking against your own own Prophet I only quoted what he said it doesn't come from me Paul says that the word of God come out of you or did he come to you this word came to me from brother brandham so brother brandham said it is the rapture not Ed garos so get your facts straight I am quoting your prophet and you can now go against it he'll meet you at the Judgment bar there is make Believers in this message Great Pretenders that they believe the message but they can't even take a quote like this how could they be in the message so you either know the message or you a foolish version in the message or you a great Pretender you're only pretending that you believe the Bible says so BC 538 Gabriel came to Daniel and spoke to him about it the chronologist with a many books says so and now the prophet William Brenham said so July the 30th of the 8th month 1961 said so and I edar Rosco underline it when is the 70th Jubilee 77 is the beginning of the 70th Jubilee because the 70th Jubilee started in 1974 so he said in 1977 we're in the 70th Jubilee so I clarifi that thing so regardless of what you say it's the 70th Jubilee so you going to ask brother Brandon what you want to ask brother brandom don't come and ask me I will speak to my church on Sunday on Saturday at the combined meeting I said it's not my date but it's God's appointed time he can change it in in his longsuffering like I brought it out on that message but in the longsuffering all the times that examples I gave no soul got saved so think about after Wednesday if you don't understand him then it's your baby and your pastor's baby you are trying to too hard to find me wrong and God protected me oh Edgar osar said he's greater than brother brandham he is the eighth messenger is Jehovah God now he said is the rapture is going to take place he's messing around with human like Rin Thompson said he's not that boy in Propet visit South Africa and no proof I ask you please on all those points send me the tape where I said those things is now for how many years you guys cannot produce the tape where I said these things so you will work it on with God very soon at the day of judgment I explained this next Saturday at our combine I'll be and I said in a clip it'll be an ordinary day I would like you to write it down or make an indelible mark on your mind what I'm going to tell you you'll see the 23rd will come it's on the Wednesday I will be here but you'll see it's going to be an ordinary day it's going to look as if nothing has happened yes Mark that [Music] down they'll still have church Elders there's still going to be alter calls there's still going to be people that wants to give their hearts to the Lord the surely is going to be weeping and crying but it's going to be too late for Tears [Music] you mark that down because in that [Music] Dimension it's going to be all [Music] over Israel when God told told them to take the land they didn't and God wanted to destroy them immediately and and Moses begged and he says I won't destroy them but they still going to die they went on for 40 years serving God crying having a prophet eating Mana but they were cut off they died all of them but in the [Music] natural it looked all right and if I am right which I very much doubt I'm wrong I don't know why all the ministers are calling some are calling and some are dying [Applause] it is like that already how is it going to be when the thing is cut off completely in the message World it will go on the same like it goes on every [Music] day but if you're spiritual if you're in this prophetic class [Music] I'm sure you already saw [Music] things so all that I told you to make a mental note and a note in your Bible because it cannot be moved it cannot be changed the time Factor runs out the 23rd one of the Jewish Rabbi said we won't forget the 23rd of October and going to read Daniel 70 weeks God told Daniel there's only 70 weeks allotted to the Jews 70 weeks and not more time they were given 70 weeks that was that time that God was going to take away all transgressions that means that I'll be back with Israel [Applause] read okay that is um what I said in the 70th Chile now the camia ER quote we were first to point out that that quote speak of two women a natural woman that will be chosen vice president and then president and the Roman Catholic church so either Camila or Trump choosing will be bad Trump can bring in the Roman Catholic Church money prosperity and Camila can bring in that woman that will destroy America I said it from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus sayith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 20 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quot is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two human that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes wi the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so World should put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out so the you have 70 weeks 70 Jubilee and also Camila all speaking about the End Time season is Right 70 weeks 70 Daniel is going to be settled on Wednesday and then the elections we're waiting to see which one comes in to bring in one of the two human you know and a person wonders about the Roman Catholic Church Revelations 17 very very much you worried about it but both is a worry But the irony of the thing the bottom line the colel is that we are at the end the ceiling will go on the regardless of what happens the ceiling is going to go on so I would like to on Saturday show you what brother Brenham says what's going to take place if these things fall in line it's only the elections in front of us and then he says something and I feel sorry for the Brethren that's in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost and actually gone for a Baptist way of worship I feel sorry for them after Saturday you'll see what a mistake they made I can't but help bringing this up and I know I said that I will never mention him again but I think about Raymond Thompson about 15 20 years ago with a h Revelation and I was walking up to him and ask him you see the Holy Ghost never came so the Holy Ghost never came in 1979 when it fell in El Tabernacle and then went over to America and and uh many other places so uh he was very very rude and I'm glad that angel of God was there he wrote everything down he will meet one another there and he said uh you preach what you want to preach we preach what we want to preach and um then that thing didn't work out because it was a bunch of nonsense third phase worship and all that was all nonsense you know so that's why I just wonder if these guys didn't bless from the Holy Ghost and now it's too late to get it I watch them every now and then their services especially when they preach and I don't feel no Holy Ghost there so um we have come to the end it's going to be worse because God is now going to go extra mile with Israel and I want to bring it out next week on Saturday to show you exactly what's going to happen then so may God bless you and um brother the B says in the token this is what he says the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy oril that is that time when the bride went in and the rest of them was left here did you ever think what happened they went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting Soul saved and everything and did not know it they knew nothing about it the Church of War thinking souls are being saved and everything else and the church is already the bride sealed away don't know it certainly that's exactly what the scripture Noah went in the ark God seal it out truly and the time will come when men and women will cry to God and even think that they've got something when they haven't it's exactly right the scripture speaks that amen there you have it that is what's going to happen they'll go on with the church services already we know God is gone we already know it everybody knows it all of ministers knows it that God is not there so we need Scripture to back us up there's a quote and I brought out most of the scriptures on Saturday night in uh Dar to show you how God cuts off the holy ghost from the people so you have all those quotes to go with us quote and uh we write at the end it is finished you'll be sealed up with whatever you have I remember years ago brother Raymond Thompson used to like to say in our church be careful what you're doing whatever nonsense you catch on there's going to be a time that the Holy Ghost is going to seal that nonsense in you and you'll never be able to overcome and I want agree with that that is what is going to happen after Wednesday but as I said it already happened we see one another on Wednesday and then Saturday as well and uh we right at the end when the cup of the amorites Wednesday will be full and I'll tell you why I said it will be full God bless you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]\n"}, {"id":

I wonder this time where we are in as we stand. We're going to welcome brother Y to open the word this prayer meeting in a word of prayer. As we bow our heads and we close our eyes, we all bow and close eyes of Jesus, King God. Heavenly Father, it's truly an honor and a privilege, oh God, to approach your throne of grace, your throne of mercy this morning. Oh God, what can we say after a service like yesterday's? Oh God, we are truly blessed, Lord, to have a leadership, oh God, a man of God sent by you, oh Lord. We thank you for him. We pray that you may strengthen him, oh God. You undertake for him. May you guide him in every step of the way. May you just strengthen each and every bone, every fiber in his being. You go before the Rosco family. May you be with him. Keep them in the palm of your hand and my savior. Please, Lord Jesus. May you be with the tabernacle this morning. You fill us with the Holy Ghost. Lord God, we lift up our vessels toward you, oh God. We submit ourselves to you, oh God. Lord Jesus, King God, in everything that we do today, may it all come together in order to give you all the glory, the honor, and the praises. Lord, we ask this in God's name. Amen and amen. Church, don't you just appreciate God's apostle for the powerful message he gave us yesterday? Then you turn around in your homes and just give God, your neighbor, a wonderful hug. Say, \"I love you. I appreciate you.\" Just tell your loved one next to you, \"I appreciate you with my whole heart.\" as we sing. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. [Music] Sing it with me. Sing holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. [Applause] The other angels bow the redeemed worship. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Sing with me. Say holy, holy, holy are you Lord. With your hands raised, holy, holy, holy are you. Holy angels. The redeemed worship you. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. because you're welcome to minister. Oh, holy you Lord. Singing holy, holy are you, Lord. Oh, the earth angels b the red worship you. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Can we give God a handy praise? [Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So good to be in his house this morning on the Sunday sunrise morning. Many people didn't wake up this morning but we thank God that we could see another sunrise, another morning where the sun has risen in our lives. the son called Beth, the son of the living God. We want to say thank you to Jesus, King God, this morning for waking us up and how blessed we are after this combine to hear God's servant to hear the apostle preach a masterpiece. And I could only think last night about of how he threw out theology, threw out tradition out of the water. And it just shows you that if you a son and a daughter of God, if you come from God and you're going back to God again, there's no tradition, there's no situation on earth that you can say this is the way I am. But we've learned the character of Jesus Christ. We've learned the nature of Jesus Christ through a ministry, through a vessel, through an apostle. And I just want to thank God this morning for true leadership because it shows you that there's only one garment. It shows you there's only one way to enter in, and that's through this ministry. Hallelujah. And this morning I just want to start off with a quotation, two quotations and two scriptures before we go into the prayer. It made me think of prophet visit South Africa. Um brother Brandham says during another meeting in Johannesburg, a young boy about seven or eight years old was called up in a prayer line. A prayer line. A prayer line. But the Brandham spoke to the boy for a few minutes explaining that the weak heart which he had was caused by demon oppression. And the apostle said a while back he said that to know the depths of God, you need to know the depths of Satan. And I thank God for an apostle that knows the depths of Satan, that took us out from all our demonology, that showed us the way. Hallelujah. He told him that he would be delivered someday would be preaching and he would be preaching the exact same gospel that was being brought to the people of South Africa. Suddenly, brother Brandham turned to the audience and during a few minutes or moments of silence, it was evident that he was seeing a vision of something over the audience. In other words, the weak heart of the apostle. It's something that he knows the stories we've heard growing up. He knows the underworld. He knows the other side. And I just want to thank God this morning that we have an apostle. We have a leader. We have someone that can take us out from where we came from, from all the things we believed. It just shows you that we have the right ministry. And this morning, I have a grateful heart, a thankful heart. And just one more quotation before I read the scripture. The world is again falling apart. They have a refreshed anointing, anointed word of promise for this age. And he is always the word. If God sent us an anointed promise word again for this age, in other words, you cannot have an anointed age, you cannot have an anointed man, you cannot have an anointed word without the oil. You need the oil to anoint the word. In 1946, he would be the same as he was when he come in the beginning, the anointed word for the age. And El tabernacle, we've got the anointed age. We've got the anointed word and we've got the anointed man. We've got the oil this morning. So, right there in your home, may you reach out this morning. And I believe there's no ministry like this. It's evident that we have the token. Hallelujah. The word of the Lord says in Luke the 18th chapter and he said and spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not faint. You always got to pray. You don't have to faint this morning. saying, \"There was in a city a judge which fearth not God, neither regarded man, and there was a widow in the city, and she came and said unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary, and ye would not for a while, but afterwards he said unto him, Though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continually coming, she worry me. And we were taught that whatever you ask God in prayer, you ask and you ask and you ask until God answers that prayer. And this morning, we want to wear him this morning. We want to ask God this morning. We want to plead our case this morning. Hallelujah. One more scripture before we go into the prayer. Judges 16 verse 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samuel Samson made sport. And Samson called unto the Lord. He prayed and said, \"Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee the strength and strengthen me. I pray thee only this once, oh God. He asked for a once more, Lord. And this morning, we want to ask for a once more, Lord. Because I believe that in this house, there is someone in this house that standing between the pillars, the vessel of oil. There's a pot of oil in our house this morning. And I believe we have the right pot of oil. We have the right vessel that can answer our need. Just there in your home, wherever you are. There's no moment like this moment. There's no moment like the present time you're in right now. As the apostle said yesterday, he said it's about the today. It's a fresh anointing. So why don't we pull down that fresh anointing when you go to work on a Monday, on a Tuesday, no matter what moment you're in. The fact that we saw the sun come up this morning, it's a new day. It's a new chance. It's a new opportunity to show the Messiah that we are alive. As we bow our heads this morning, gracious eternal heavenly father. Lord, you are wonderful. Lord, you are God, Lord. You are the mighty conqueror. You are the prince of peace. You are the lily of the valley. You are the bright, the morning star. Father, this morning we humble our hearts to your throne. We thank you that we could feel the brush of angels wings. We thank you Lord that we know which kingdom we belong to. We thank you this morning Lord that we know that our answer Lord is found in you oh Lord Father. And this morning we want to say that we love you. We appreciate you Lord. Lord as your people has gotten up this morning Lord to plead their case Lord. We realize Lord that we are in a ministry father that has the answer Lord. Lord we are in a ministry Lord that we know that we know that we know that you have made a way for us. Oh Father Lord you have called us oh Lord. Lord you have washed us Lord. You have made us whole Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Thanking you Lord that you are not just a God that we do not see but we feel you Lord. We see you Lord. We know that you are there Lord. And just to know that we have the opportunity this morning that we have the opportunity father Lord to come into your courts Lord with thanksgiving and a joyful heart. Lord, we are so grateful this morning because you are our God, Lord. Lord, we do not believe in fables, Father, but we know that there's a land beyond the river called somewhere, somewhere somewhere, Lord. And we want to say thank you this morning for your house, oh Lord. We want to say thank you this morning that you are God, Lord. Lord, you are so wonderful. You are so kind. You are so gentle. You are our savior. You are our king Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Knowing Lord that our strength, knowing that our joy, knowing that a brand new touch is in stock for us this morning, Lord. Lord, and we cannot sh to declare that you are with us, Lord. Lord, we cannot help ourselves this morning because we realize, Father, that you made a way through it all. Through it all, through it all, Lord, when we were at our lowest, you came our way, Father. And this morning, we want to say thank you, Lord. We want to lift you higher. We want to lift you even the more because you are a good God, Lord. Lord, and you are a wonderful God, Lord. Lord and you are a blessing in our lives, Lord. Lord, we do not want to just leave you one side, Father. But we want to embrace you this morning. We wanted you to come and kiss each and every heart in each and every home. May you come with a fresh anointing. Lord, may you come and visit El Tabernacle this morning, Lord. Lord, we want to say you are God. You never changed. We want to say that you are our Lord and you never change, Lord. Lord, you are still the same this morning. You are still the same God in our lives. And we want to lift you higher this morning. We want to give you the Tahilas this morning. We want to give you the toas this morning. We want to say, Lord, even so, come Lord Jesus. Because in you there's life. In you there's another chance in you, Father God. There is there is there is something Lord in the nothing. Oh Lord, there is always something in nothing, Lord. Lord, you are always there when we least expect it, Father. Lord, and your people this morning, we want to say we are your people, Lord. We want to say we love you this morning. We want to say we appreciate you, Lord. We want to say you are God this morning. Lord, we do not want to replace you. We know that you are a jealous God. Lord, we know that you are a jealous God. Lord, let us not put anything in your place this morning, but let us come with a made up mind that we know that we know that we know who our creator is, who our father is. Lord, you said ask and it shall be given unto you. You said knock and I will open the door. You said walk through the Red Sea. I will make a way, Lord. And this morning we know that there is a power from on high. We do not need a song this morning. We do not need anything from this world, but we have the answer. We have the oil. We have the anointing. We have the brush of angels wings. Father, this morning we humble ourselves. We speak the word, Lord, and we taking a positive step in the right direction, Father. Lord, may you forgive us where we fail you. May you try us out even the more, Lord, because we love you, Lord, because we want to be right, Lord. Lord, you said in your word that a Christian falls seven times. A righteous man, he falls, Lord. But we know the answer, Father, this morning. We know that we just got to get up again. We know that we just got to dust ourselves off and you will step in, Lord. You will bless the upkeep, Lord. You will bless the man of the house, Lord. As we look to your servant, Father, as we look to this ministry, Lord, we know that the hope that we have, it make us not ashamed. This morning we know that we have a hope. This morning we know that we have the answer. This morning Lord, there is no devil in hell that can keep a child of God bound because we know where our power comes from. We know where we come from and we know where we are going to this morning. Set the people free this morning. On the Sunday morning. on the Sunday morning, on the S O N. Lord, may you walk in our lives. May you ride in our lives, Lord, as the son of righteousness with healing in his wings. Lord, if there's someone this morning that needs healing this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs a touch this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs your heart to come to them this morning, Lord, may you open up the windows of heaven, may you open up the windows of heaven this morning, sister, my brother, may you touch the hem of his garment. He's not too far. He's not too far to hear your heart's cry as you touch him this morning. My sister, my brother, he's there. He's there. He's there. Lord, if there's someone this morning that needs a brand new touch, may you touch them even the more. May you come their way. Lord, if there's someone that needs a job this morning, Lord, may you come and may you intercede, Father. May you open up a company for that person, Lord, because you are still a creator, Lord. You are still a provider. You are still Jehovah Shabba, Jehovah Ni, you are still God this morning, Lord. I pray if there's someone that needs a brother and a sister, Lord, and doesn't know which way to go, may you help them to find you on their knees, Lord, as you reveal to them in prayer, Lord. May the signs come through. May the signs and the wonders come through because what God has put together, let no man put us under, Lord. You know who that brother and that sister is. May you be Lord with every brother, every sister that has a mind battle this morning, Lord, Lord, that doesn't know where they are, Father. May they make up their minds. May they look to the cross. May they look to the strength, Lord, in that Holy Ghost dove. Lord, may you open up heaven for them this morning, Lord. If there's anyone that's afflicted with demon oppression, with demon oppression this morning, may you come their way, may you be, Father God, the powerhouse this morning. Because Lord, we know where our power lies, oh Lord. Lord, we know which kingdom we come from. We know that on Saturday night, Lord, you went down to hell, Lord, and you kicked open the door, Lord, and you took the keys of hell, death, and the grave, Lord. There is no devil. There is no demon that you haven't seen before. Lord, there is no demon in hell that you do not know. Lord, when you were on earth, you came, Lord. And the demons cried out. Have you come to torment us already, Lord? They know you. They know you, Lord. Lord, and I know they know us, oh Lord. They know the power in this church. They know the power in this man. They know the power in the vessel because there's only one vessel of oil. Lord, may the oil. May the anointing break the yoke as the anointing breaks and it breaks and it breaks, Lord. May you break it this morning, Lord. Whatever they going through, whatever they facing, may you break the yoke of the enemy in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's only one name. There's only one name, Lord, that shakes, Lord. And we know, we know, we know, we know that you've come down. You've come down. You've come down to bless us, Lord, to commute with us, Lord. You've come down, Lord. May you bless your children. Bless El tabernacle. Bless us even the more because we know where the power comes from. We know it comes from the head, even the head of Aaron, the high priest. I pray that the blessing may flow Lord from this priest Lord the apostle of God Lord your vessel for this hour your messenger your messenger of the latter rain there is coming another ball there is coming another message bleeding eagle and Lord we are loving in the manifestation of the prophecy Lord our eyes have behold Lord, our eyes have beheld. You have come down. And we want to say as El tabernacle, Lord, you've called us for a time like this. You've called us for a man like this. You've called us to stand upon the promises of God. Lord, if my mother doesn't want to do it, if my uncle doesn't want to do it, I will stand. Lord, Lord, we're not looking to the left. We're not looking to the right, but we are holding on to the promise of God because we know where the power comes from. Lord, may you set free. May you set free this morning. May you set free. Set free. Set free in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We love you. We love you. We appreciate you. We thank you, Lord, for a vessel. We thank you for the oil. We thank you for the house. Lord, we know that we have found someone that can stand between the pillars. They can stand between the pillars, the seven pillars, the seven thunders, Lord. And he knows how to handle the word. Lord, we want to say thank you. We want to say thank you that in this house there is seven pillars. We want to say thank you that we have the pot of oil in the house. We want to say thank you that we know who we are. We want to say thank you that we are not shaking. We are not shaken, Lord, but we are standing on the promises of God. May you come and deliver the young people this morning. Lord, may you come and set them free. May you come and do something exploits in their lives. Lord, may they know that they know that we are not just soul, but we are an army. We are the sons and the daughters of God. May you bless the church. May you bless every brother, every sister. Lord, we love you this morning, Lord. We appreciate you this morning. You are our God. Lord, in you there's life. In you there's another chance. In you there's a sweet anointing. In you there's a fresh touch. In you there's hope. And we want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you. We want to say thank you once more, Lord. Just once more, Lord. Just once more, Lord. As Samson cried out, Lord, just once more, Lord. A fresh touch, Lord. A new anointing, Lord. Just once more, Lord. Just once more. Just just just once more. May you be with us. May you touch us this morning, Lord. As we feel your anointing, as we feel the presence, Lord. It is not something that we can wake up. It's something that's within us, Lord. Something that's pushing out, Lord. It may push out this morning. In every home, in every situation, may the angel of the Lord push through. Push through. La just push through the mud. Just push through. Push through. Just push through this morning. You just about to see the sun. You're just about to see the sun. Why don't you push through this morning? He's all you need. He's all I ever needed. He's a wonderful God. He's the mighty conqueror, the prince of peace. We love you this morning, Lord. We appreciate you this morning. We want to say thank you, Lord, for the Holy Ghost. We want to say thank you for the vessel this morning. We want to say thank you that you've come our way in the good times, in the bad times. Lord, we feel like Job of old, Lord. Job, Lord, no matter what he was going through, no matter what happened, Lord, he said, I know that my redeemer loveth, Lord, and we know that we have a hope this morning. We know that we got a hope this morning. We know there's more that's found in you, Lord. No matter what comes our way, no matter what the enemy puts in front of us, we are not going to deteriorate this anointing, Lord, we're going to keep it, Father. There's just a little oil left, Lord. Lord, may we embrace it this morning. May we kiss it this morning. May we embrace it even the more, Lord. We found it, Lord. It has found us, Lord. Lord, we are your people, Lord. called by your name, Lord. And in your name there is hope, Lord. Lord, we want to say thank you this morning. Thank you for your anointing.

Can we turn to Psalm 1919? If you add it, the heavens declare the glory of God, his handiwork. Day unto day utter speech, and night unto night show with knowledge. There is no speech nor language where the voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth and the words to the end of the world. In them as he set a tabernacle for a son wishes as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the end of it, and there is nothing from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. &gt;&gt; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing his heart, the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgment of the Lord are true and righteousness altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is thy servant worn. And in keeping of them there is great reward. &gt;&gt; Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from presumptions of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight. Oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a beautiful psalm. Hallelujah. If you have a need tonight, there's elders while they prepare themselves. Let's just wave our hands. &gt;&gt; We have a shepherd tonight. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; He goes before me. &gt;&gt; Just wave your defender behind me. Defender behind me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I won't fear. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing. &gt;&gt; And my cup's overflowing. My love's overflowing. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me. &gt;&gt; Oh say I want thee. We sing hallelujah. I alone. &gt;&gt; He's my comfort. He's my comfort. [Music] &gt;&gt; He always guides me. You always guide me through mountains and valleys and [Music] his joy is refreshing. [Music] &gt;&gt; He restores my soul. [Music] Oh, mercy for &gt;&gt; mercy and [Music] shy. [Music] Heat. Heat. Oh, [Applause] [Applause] heat, heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sing your spirit. &gt;&gt; Your spirit lives within. &gt;&gt; So I &gt;&gt; walk in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Your spirit lives within. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; spirit. your spirit with me. So I walk [Music] [Music] I need I need I need [Music] My victory say my victory mighty mighty say hallelujah. You might [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hold me close. [Music] Just sing it with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my comfort. [Music] as we &gt;&gt; well. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We can clap our hands. We can tell him he's wonderful. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. What an atmosphere. What a house. It's good to be in this house and we look forward to our father speaking to us. So, let me do my part. Get out of the way so we can all be blessed tonight. Please allow me greet every brother, sister in the beautiful name of Jesus Christ. Please allow me to read the prayer request. We give God a wonderful hand. Then we read a prayer request. We pray and get out of the way. Thankful. God bless you saints. I would like to thank the Lord. Uh this night I made my request known to God before the saints. I was writing this week from Tuesday until today. On Sunday, I submitted a prayer request for God to undertake for me since I was scared and panicking. The Lord is good. All these four days, I could come out of the test room with an hallelujah in my heart because he was there to see me through. Sister Michelle, greetings, saints.

Please remember in prayer my neck and shoulder and body is full of pains. I believe when the saints begin to pray, God will heal me completely. your sister in Christ, Sister Felicia Lane. If you have a request, if you have a need, I can only remind you that early this morning, our friend went in and he prayed for us. And I just come to be a little better behind him. So, lift up your hearts, lift up your hands, don't be weary. know that we have a friend. A righteous man's reward is with our friend. Let us pray. Kind one, lovely one, beautiful one. Lord, thou art our God, our father. We come to you in confidence. We come to you knowing that you are alive. We come to you Lord knowing that in this house you are a present tense God. You are not a God of history Lord but oh God the testimonies the living testimonies are walking amongst us Lord as the angels has touched many and even tonight the angels are walking up and down the aisles touching your children. Oh God, our prayer is Lord, manifest what your apostle prayed for already this morning. Lord, as I lay my hands on the request that I've made known, doubtless thou art our father and I believe, Lord, may they come back with a testimony, giving glory to you, Lord, bless your apostle, our friend. Lord, energize his body tonight, oh God, as he brings the unsearchable riches of God to us. Lord, bless also the house of Rosco. Bless the priesthood, Lord. Bless from the youngest to the oldest in the household of Rosco. Bless your children, oh God. As we come together in this house to bring glory to you, may the praises go up higher and higher and higher tonight, oh God, in the name of Jesus, King God. Amen. [Music] Oh my appreciate our elders tonight. Hallelujah. Do you feel like going on tonight? Hallelujah. There's no place like El Tabernacle going on. Oh, I feel like like going on. Don't you feel like that? Though trials come on every man I feel love. I wonder this time we can welcome our senior pastor Jonathan Rosco. Oh, I feel &gt;&gt; I feel [Music] [Applause] I feel [Music] Do you feel like going on? [Applause] [Music] You ought to forget about your trials. You made it to the house of the Lord. [Music] Amen. [Music] Brother, sister, you may be seated today. [Music] Praise the Lord. We um just want to tell the church about four testimonies that God has done in this time which is resounding beyond explanation and it's just gives us faith to believe no matter what. God is in charge of everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a policeman in Bora. Do you know what's his name? High ranking policeman. Amen. Can you stand to your feet? I saw him come in earlier. God bless you. I was supposed to give this testimony. Thank you, my brother. We were in Ptoria. The man of God was pressed by the Holy Ghost to get to Ptoria on a Tuesday night and he was dealing with cases and the atmosphere was resounding. It was God in the house although the church was not there but God was at the church. And my precious brother came in, heard that the apostle was in the house of Al Tabernacle on the hill. [Music] And the doctors checked his heart and he was supposed to get a booking to do something on the heart. And the man was shook up because they checked them all the time because in the police force they check them and he was getting himself ready for an operation. But they the devil lost out because the doctor was at the church [Applause] and he said, \"Uh, I don't know how am I going to get this booking. There's no place to get me a booking.\" He got the booking and the doctor checked him and he says, \"You got a baby heart after the apostle prayed.\" [Applause] From a problem to a miracle. It was an instant miracle. [Applause] I know he'll never be the same again because that was God. [Music] He believed that if the apostle he came to the house and he knew the apostle was there and he knew if the apostle pray for him, he won't need an op. And God gave him a baby. The doctor was confused and he's still here. Amen. Am I right, my brother? There's a man with the testimony. Amen. Then brother Daniel, the electrician wife had to go for ops and the last op was quite serious with the cancer. Came for prayer. God made a way. You will ask and God will give it. Normally when the cancer spreads in the woman, it goes to the organs. It goes all over. But God made a way. Then the devil wasn't happy with the testimony. Then brother Daniel was busy grinding to make a carport at home and the ladder swept out under him and the grinder cut him here near the juggler pipe. When he got to the hospital it was already bubbling here. The doctors could not believe the man was alive but there was a god in the house. Instead of a funeral, instead of the juggler pipe, God stopped him to die and bleed to death. The grinder cut him, but God was in here. And God saved him. God made a way for him. And I want to tell you tonight, he can make a way for you also. You just got to believe in a man. All things are possible. Praise the Lord. But the strike foster phoned me to say his wife needs to go for an operation. They detected cancer in her breast. And I told the apostle, the apostle told me, \"Jaw.\" The apostle calls me Jaw. It's my house name. &gt;&gt; Jo. She'll be all right. I just said it to him. The apostle told me she'll be all right. Now, I'm here tonight to tell you she went in the Tuesday, the Wednesday, she was home. All things are possible if you believe there's a God, a doctor, a physician in this house. God bless you. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and you can go home with an answer as well. [Applause] [Music] We should be running around this place. Hey. Hey, Dr. Los. [Applause] [Music] Somebody say hallelujah. Somebody say hosana. [Applause] [Music] Woo. [Applause] We just want to use this opportunity to welcome all the visitors in the house of Rosco. There's a very special gentleman, Mr. Desmond Gil. He's one of the top golfers that plays with the morning stars in our midst. We want to acknowledge you and we want to welcome you and may you enjoy yourself. [Applause] [Music] This is your father's [Music] Oh my [Music] god. [Applause] Holy [Music] Ghost might [Music] be.

I want to say good evening &gt;&gt; wherever the streaming goes right around the world. &gt;&gt; Just want to tell you This is the night and the day &gt;&gt; when the King of glory [Applause] &gt;&gt; cried out, &gt;&gt; \"It is finished. Lord, I am finished. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Redemption pay. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're glad you come from the east and west. You come from lands of far. &gt;&gt; You fly in, &gt;&gt; you bus in, &gt;&gt; you train in, you taxi in, you coober in to one place to be here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, we together again &gt;&gt; just praising the Lord. And if we have visitors here &gt;&gt; and you don't understand why we're making such a lot of noise, &gt;&gt; we just want to tell you, &gt;&gt; we're excited about that man. We uh we came back a little late last week after the party and then I relax and I put on football. Uh that's my my weak spot &gt;&gt; and uh yet Chelsea and Liverpool &gt;&gt; was playing. And brothers and sisters, it was it was chaos. It was total madness &gt;&gt; because a little Brazilian on the last minute scored the winning goal. &gt;&gt; And when that ball went in, I sat back. I said, \"Now I want to see the spectators or the bartakers.\" I didn't see any spectators. I only saw bartakers. They were jumping. But &gt;&gt; but don't tell J I was one of them that was jumping cuz I'm glad those guys lost. [Applause] But the thing hit me again once more. They could jump like that for a piece of leather. What about us? Why can't we jump? [Applause] and especially &gt;&gt; to the one &gt;&gt; that conquered [Applause] &gt;&gt; hell, &gt;&gt; dead, and the grave. [Applause] Bullmont. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Jonathan told you about those miracles that took place. &gt;&gt; But I heard about Father Kirkwin's wife, Mercedes. &gt;&gt; She had a very, very bad kidney problem and they wanted to put her on dialysis. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when she went, I think a week or two ago, they checked her up and they can't believe it that the kidneys is more stronger than ever. There's a God in this church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I thank God for the healing &gt;&gt; and um I just like to thank the um trustees wives and that when I come to church there's some coffee for me behind in the minister's room. Now I don't have a buffazi. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So when I come most of the time they come through but when I come here I get a nice cappuccino. God bless you as you go out of your way. If I am a man of God, &gt;&gt; now listen, &gt;&gt; listen. I'm here 62 years. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. I can look at every woman straight in the eye here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman. &gt;&gt; 62 here. &gt;&gt; And you guys that's got some money in the bank. I know all of you. I never one time knock at your door for money. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So I also didn't come for your money. But I came &gt;&gt; to see you Hello. Ready? [Applause] And then it's brother Julian. Yeah. Julian Bolton. Julian who move you to after 8 you know I just hope that uh that's not backsliding you know I want to thank Julian and brother Charles's wife for the printing of the books I never even read these books so next week you know I've been very very busy &gt;&gt; so next week I have to sit now look how thick this book is. And this is my ministry. My heart is aching to go into this book. And Julian, I would like to know what is this book going to cost? We want to see if we can't make it available to the church at a reduced price. But everybody should have this As you know, all the books that we have printed and all the tapes that I made, over 3,000 tapes, I didn't get one cent from it. I don't get the money. [Applause] We put it back into the works of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then he made another book, the trumpets [Applause] which I didn't have an opportunity to get into it. And I think there's another book So, normally I knock these things off quickly so that they get printed, but they've been waiting on me. I've been in the pulpit most of the time, but I hope next week I'll be able to go into it and we'll tell you what it's going to cost and what we're going to reduce on it. So, I want to thank you, brother Julian. Amen. That concludes my announcements. And now let's get into business. &gt;&gt; Why we are here tonight. I would like to read two scriptures. Matthew 25:10, Revelations 4:1. And I had phone calls from all over &gt;&gt; just on what we already preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what we preach here &gt;&gt; is not preached anywhere. Psalm. Let us read the scripture of a message from the Lord. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you can help me to read Matthew 25:10. Let's read. [Applause] Watch that. &gt;&gt; They went into the marriage &gt;&gt; and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; That means just before the door got shut, &gt;&gt; the door was open. And they went in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Went in with him. &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom &gt;&gt; went into the marriage with him. and the other five virgins was outside the door. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So that means right there the oil change their bodies [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; otherwise they can't go in &gt;&gt; the quickening power &gt;&gt; change their bodies. so that they can go in &gt;&gt; with the lamb. &gt;&gt; So before we go in, &gt;&gt; we need the oil, the Holy Ghost to quicken our bodies to go in. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other scripture, Revelations 4:1, read come up where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, the door was open &gt;&gt; and she come in. &gt;&gt; Same like Matthew 25. [Applause] What a thing. &gt;&gt; Now I want to say this. Let us pray first. Father, we are just nothing in front of you. &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and will have &gt;&gt; was because of you. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would undertake for us. Bless the people. &gt;&gt; Let us come this Friday night to be assembled together. &gt;&gt; We have church on a Friday night. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it all happened on a Friday. &gt;&gt; May you bless the word and may we go out here more wiser. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, each one of you is here tonight, &gt;&gt; whether you on the streaming, &gt;&gt; whether you're in England, America, wherever this broadcast goes, &gt;&gt; whether you're on the streaming in South Africa tonight, &gt;&gt; each one of you, &gt;&gt; every one of you, &gt;&gt; each one of you here in the church, today. &gt;&gt; Every one of you [Applause] &gt;&gt; that came to church today, &gt;&gt; you just accepted an invitation of God. So give yourself a hand clap. &gt;&gt; You just accepted &gt;&gt; an invitation &gt;&gt; from the greatest man. that ever learn &gt;&gt; because he told you come unto me all he that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. come an invitation and you came tonight accepting the invitation. Hallelujah. Bye. [Music] As you see that day approach on Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; see that you assemble together because it's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Assemble together. You accepted the invitation. &gt;&gt; Let us make full use of it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus, King God, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; never turn down an invitation. You invite him, &gt;&gt; he'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; He'll come. &gt;&gt; And now we say the same thing. If you invite us, &gt;&gt; we'll be here. and therefore &gt;&gt; I chose &gt;&gt; and entitled this message &gt;&gt; the greatest &gt;&gt; message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Hallelujah. and for inspiration, the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; in Matthew 15. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't have a message &gt;&gt; unless you have a messenger. [Music] [Applause] And I know that there's a lot of messages. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preachers &gt;&gt; in the pulpit tonight &gt;&gt; and tomorrow &gt;&gt; and Sunday. &gt;&gt; A lot of preachers. And as I told Daniel that year, I said, Daniel, you know, there's a lot of lot of preachers, &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; and in the denominations &gt;&gt; and in the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they put there &gt;&gt; and that feed them garbage. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So if you have a preacher &gt;&gt; that feed you garbage, &gt;&gt; then you have just you just got yourself a higher killer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is in the pulpit &gt;&gt; for ulterior motives. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to kill the church. &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to better himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And they are hired killers. Amen. &gt;&gt; They kill the children of God. &gt;&gt; And you say, \"What do you mean, brother Brandham? Preach a message. I indict this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\" And the Bible says there where Jerusalem, they who the hire killers crucified the king of glory. Who crucified him? Priest &gt;&gt; hired killers, &gt;&gt; but an eel tabernacle. There is a man I can turn on the light. Say amen somebody. So, &gt;&gt; we did explain &gt;&gt; with an interview with Edgar &gt;&gt; the prophetic insight &gt;&gt; and why we're going to preach on &gt;&gt; the greatest message &gt;&gt; ever preached. Now before preaching this message, &gt;&gt; we will need tonight &gt;&gt; to have an introduction into it. &gt;&gt; It's too great and I can't I can't wait &gt;&gt; for the next meeting when I'm going to go into it. &gt;&gt; But tonight is just the introduction. So 40 years ago, I told you El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that I do not go into the study go looking for a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I go into the study, I already have my message &gt;&gt; because your message comes from God. &gt;&gt; It's a inspiration from God. &gt;&gt; I already have a message. &gt;&gt; But when I go into the study, &gt;&gt; I write down my sermon. And when I come to church, I deliver the sermon. But the message come from God. &gt;&gt; That's why we sang. There is a message &gt;&gt; from the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A message unto you. This pooper dreams. So &gt;&gt; I need to remind you &gt;&gt; that the prophet calls all the other messages outside of Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear any minister preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And neither you're going to get it from a Bible school, &gt;&gt; neither from a university, &gt;&gt; neither from a professor. They don't touch Revelations 10 and they don't touch Matthew 25. But here we're in the University of eternity. And the prophet says in Revelation series 19:16, organizations and their flowery messages &gt;&gt; won't shake the devil &gt;&gt; over the head. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is flowery messages. &gt;&gt; People come in just the way they go out &gt;&gt; and they go out just the way they come in. &gt;&gt; Why? That flowery messages is doing nothing. &gt;&gt; We don't need flowery messages. We don't need intellectual speeches. But we need the Holy Spirit to enter in to the message and bring a shaking that it'll shake you and shake you and shake you until you get up. All that you hear on TBNN, all that you hear on the television, all that you hear right there on the radio, all that you hear in the message groups is little flowery messages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That tickle the flesh &gt;&gt; and don't stir the soul. We don't want our flesh tickled. We want our souls to be restored for it restore my soul on tbn. Maya man everything of that woman is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her hair is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her lipstick is demonic. &gt;&gt; Her trousers she wear is demonic. But the people flock there &gt;&gt; and let Edgar Orosco tell you turn tonight. &gt;&gt; If you dance with the devil, [Applause] &gt;&gt; listen, &gt;&gt; if you dance with the devil, &gt;&gt; then you just escorted yourself to hell. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you go with those ministers and dance with them, then you just escorted yourself to hell. That's why this will never die. This is a message from the Lord. This is a man of God here. [Applause] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We dance with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't hear anybody preach on Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I done? &gt;&gt; I shut my ears a long time ago &gt;&gt; with what all the critic says about me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I watch my fruit of my ministry. &gt;&gt; I make my calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; So you close your ears &gt;&gt; to the clinics &gt;&gt; that says you look like a Omar &gt;&gt; with your long dress. We don't listen to clinics anymore. We pass. &gt;&gt; I don't listen to critics anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather. Unlike the weather, &gt;&gt; the weather don't take no nonsense &gt;&gt; and notice &gt;&gt; from the critics. &gt;&gt; If it rains &gt;&gt; and the critic says it's too wet, then it rains on. &gt;&gt; It doesn't listen to the critics. If it's hot and you say it's too hot and then the sun starts burning you, it goes on shining. It doesn't listen to clinics &gt;&gt; when it snows &gt;&gt; and it's cold. our ears. And now we got one of the best churches in the message because we close our ears. [Applause] [Music] And today they even lie in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; You hear them saying, \"Can you feel the anointing? &gt;&gt; Then there is no anointing. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. They had thousands and thousands of people &gt;&gt; right up here with that big church. &gt;&gt; They even had to close the road and they were pulling for money all the time. &gt;&gt; And just 20 minutes preaching. &gt;&gt; And after they preached, the pastor came up. Can you feel the anointing? Yeah, you only anointed their pockets to get their money, &gt;&gt; but the anointing of God wasn't there. &gt;&gt; We don't preach money here. We preach the word of Almighty God. [Music] You don't have to say, \"Can you feel the Holy Ghost? Can you feel the anointing?\" &gt;&gt; That's not Bible. &gt;&gt; This is what happens &gt;&gt; when the anointing is there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Close your eyes and say, \"Lord, seal me. Lord, feel me. This is your night. This is the light for you to feel the anointing. [Applause] [Music] Oh, wait. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. [Applause] You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost. You can be sealed away. Hallelujah. You can grab a hold of the altar tonight. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Forever I visitation of the angel in South Africa. Here he is. Yay. Brother Brandham did not have to come back. The angel has come back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The angel is here now. Close your eyes and say, \"Lord, seal me. Lord, fill me.\" This is your night. [Music] Amen. So, nobody can tell you, \"Can you feel the Holy Ghost?\" If you don't see this there, then he's lying in the pulpit. He's lying on a holy place. He's lying before God. If you don't see this, there is no Holy Ghost. There is no anointing. This is S. Amen. And and the Bible says in Acts chapter 2 when they came from the upper room they couldn't sit still. They couldn't sit in their chairs like those people couldn't. That's what happened in the day of Pentecost. They got up and went into the street and they were drunk. Amen. Hallelujah. Where is that? [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that tonight? Look at it here. Look at it. Look at it. A bunch of drunkies here tonight. You don't have to tell them. Can you feel the anointing is you know that's not Bible Bible is in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 verse two readise [Applause] When the glory comes, the preacher cannot preach. When the anointing comes, you don't have to say it here. It comes. Uh it don't come from a church. It don't come from an organization. It comes from heaven and it calls the church. The fire of God. You don't have to say it. You can feel the fire. You can feel the heat. Can you feel it tonight? There you go. Neahhemiah &gt;&gt; Neahhemiah chapter 8 and nine 8 five and six &gt;&gt; read &gt;&gt; Hold it. &gt;&gt; When he read the word, what did the people do? What does Elan do when the Bible gets read? &gt;&gt; I would rather stand up in respect to the Bible &gt;&gt; than to stand up. with the anthem of South Africa. &gt;&gt; When the word gets read, we stand up in honor. and lead on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you say amen? Is because it's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; When they finished read the word and they heard the word and the word of God was preached, the people got up and said, \"Amen.\" Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. Thank you. Could we read on? &gt;&gt; No. What? Worth lifting. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Where do you see that? &gt;&gt; I see it in E Tabernacle. I don't see it in TBNN, but I see it in Eel Tabernacle. People get up, shout, \"Amen.\" Amen. Raise up their hands. You are in the Bible. You are in the Bible. You are in the Bible. Full obedience to the word. And they worship God. &gt;&gt; And nobody told them to do it. &gt;&gt; They done it automatically. &gt;&gt; I never told you to do it. Then why are you doing it? &gt;&gt; There's a supernatural being in you. I said, \"Come on, put up your hands. Come on, dance. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Oh my god. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] USA. [Applause] Heat. Heat. All right. Yes, you don't have to tell the people. It's automatic. A super. When you ask the people to say amen. When you tell the people man can you feel the means that they don't have the supernatural being in them. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to ask them. But if they have the supernatural being in them, [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh my. Yes. [Music] I know the service is over. I want to push on a little. Brother Paul, if you have to beg the people to say amen and you tell the people say amen. And if there's anyone that don't amen, then he just lost the opportunity to gladden God's heart. When you don't say amen, you don't gladden God's heart. Why he writes says amen, brother Brennham. And said, thus saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord. It gladden God's heart. And you say amen tonight. It gladden God's heart. Oh, hallelujah. The fire is going Heat. Heat. Let me settle. Lord, this is too much. Go on. Glad is glad in his heart. Glad his art. Go on. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to ask them. It's automatic. Just something inside said clap your hands man. Just inside in you say dance man. Inside of you said cladding my heart with a amen. [Applause] Oh god. &gt;&gt; Oh my Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; brother Daniel, we don't care what the critics say &gt;&gt; because me, &gt;&gt; I don't cry over spilled milk. [Applause] I don't care about split milk. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for another cow. &gt;&gt; No spo [Applause] milk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my [Music] Peter &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 never told them &gt;&gt; to be drunk. &gt;&gt; They automatically were drunk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter on the day of Pentecost &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never told them to speak in another tongue. &gt;&gt; Their tongues just flip over &gt;&gt; and they spoke in another tongue. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; They spoke in another tongue. Peter never on the day of Pentecost said, \"Make a noise.\" &gt;&gt; He just said it was noise abroad. &gt;&gt; I never told you make a noise. But wherever Jesus is, there's a noise. Is there a noise here? And Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is here. I'm still &gt;&gt; just busy &gt;&gt; with my introduction. [Applause] [Music] Now [Applause] &gt;&gt; the introduction to what? &gt;&gt; To the greatest &gt;&gt; message. that was ever preach introduction. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's called that day on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Can you read? &gt;&gt; Hold it. &gt;&gt; What? The world won't see me no more. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin won't see the oil no more. The message group don't see me no more. &gt;&gt; I'm not there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Read on. &gt;&gt; Now that scripture &gt;&gt; is in &gt;&gt; supernatural being in you. [Music] That's why you can't keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Read on. power in the church. Not only was the hands of the church and brought the Lord [Applause] us. &gt;&gt; What is Eel tabernacle? &gt;&gt; Giving out eternal life. That's the greater works.

And if there's anybody here that's not saved, we have it in our hands to give you eternal life because it is the greatest message that was ever preached. I feel like fainting yet tonight. You mean in El Tabernacle? Yes. The Holy Ghost is in your hand. Do you know who you are? Oh, Hey, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost was coming. It is here. and given &gt;&gt; into the hands &gt;&gt; of the church. &gt;&gt; Which church? &gt;&gt; Which church has this? [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on out of America.

[Music] We like to use the opportunity to [Music] welcome senior pastor, Pastor Jonathan Rosco. Let's give him a wonderful hand. You love our precious muscles. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's very quiet in here. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] In 1979, the message of the hour was in a graveyard. There was no hallelujah. [Music] There was no Holy Ghost. There was no people shouting on the top of their voices. But I want you to know 1979 came and the message is still trembling today because of 1979. That's why I say it's a bit quiet in here. [Music] The devil knows that 79 the silence was broken and it will never be silent again. Hallelujah. And today, [Music] Satan, right in this moment, it's 79 again. That's why I say it's very quiet in here. It's very quiet in here. After all that singing, after that the morning when the sun came up, Satan, it's 79 [Music] again. When God's house will never be quiet because when the man came around, he broke the silence. The man came around [Music] Hallelujah. If you still waiting for something, just shout. You still confused what where you are, just open your mouth and [Music] [Music] Wherever Jesus [Music] You'll hear a lot of noise. So, I want to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm so glad that the apostle invited me to his [Music] birthday. Me, the least of all, he he invited me to be here. And what makes it worse, he asked me to say something. Oh, I feel honored. Out of 8 billion, I made it. [Music] Yeah. Same as [Music] somebody. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to [Music] say to this body that carries the power of God. Happy birthday, man of God. [Applause] [Music] I have a saying to my father every now and then when I look at him when I saw him say when he was 60 when he preached crossing the line he said I'm an old man but now I don't believe he's an old man there's a young man living in this [Music] Morning. Hallelujah. And I keep saying to the apostle, do me a favor, Daddy. Just keep on breathing. When CO came, I said, \"Oh, God man, just keep on breathing.\" And I'm so glad it is here with us today. words runs out when it comes to Apostle Ros. You can't say enough. It doesn't do justice to the work that God has done in our [Music] tabernacle. I just want to read a scripture or two. I don't have much to say. [Music] And the Bible says in Job 42:12, so the Lord blessed the letter of Job more of his blessings than what he began. The letter part of Job was blessed more. And I can see it and I'm a witness of it that the latter part was more blessed than when Job was blessed. So in blessing, God has blessed this man. Are you a witness of the letter? [Music] And just before that, the man that accused him of sin, God told those men, if that man don't pray for you, you're in trouble. And I'm so glad he prayed for all of us and we are not in [Music] trouble. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh my my my my. Can I just say something quickly? Paul says, \"Ye are all partakers. You are all partakers of my grace.\" And I am a witness today that today and this Revelation stand series and crossing the line, we are all partakers of God's apostles grace because God gave him grace. We are here. Are you here? I can't hear El tabernacle. [Music] Hallelujah. Grace has come our way. [Music] And we want to say thank you to the Lord. It's quiet all over. The message, the internet, the preaching, the moving of the spirit has gone quiet all over and it's getting quieter. But in El Tabernacle, there's a man [Music] [Applause] Now in the book of Genesis, I'm not going to be long. I pastor Jude will be come after me [Music] today. And while I'm on that point, he asked tomorrow to preach for his father. So, we'll be broadcasting tomorrow cuz it's our father. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Although there's many rostals around, but at least it's our father. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Before I finish up, Pastor Paul made a wish to the man of God. And he said that at the latter time he brother Bam say he'll choose to come to the earth to help God's people. I feel we already helped why why why the god man gave you the greatest thing that any man could give you. The greatest thing in the world he gave to our tabernacle. Can you tell me what is that gift that he gave? So if he has given you the Holy Ghost, you can't give him a greater gift back. You receive the greatest [Music] gift. Hallelujah. And I was thinking in the book of Genesis, there was a man whose name started with a E. He was the seventh from Adam. And it was in the book of Genesis. There was a man whose name started with an E. And the Bible says this man walked with God. [Applause] And when I heard them sing that song, I can't even walk unless he holds my hand. I realized God has another man whose name starts with an E and he walks with God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] My father flies pigeons and he can see every bird in the kit at his age without glasses. I can't see who's behind in the church, but those dove eyes still sees better than his son's [Music] [Applause] eyes. And Enoch walked with God and he was not. that I believe in Revelations 10, there's another man with a ear. Revelations 10:8 and he also walks with God. Pray for the man of God. Love him more. Appreciate him more. Do what he says. And like he said, don't follow us. Follow that dove. Happy birthday to you, my father. I really love you. You've been more than a father to me. And thanks for coming every time for my soul. I'm a preacher today because he allowed me to keep his mic. This will never be my mic, but my father allowed me as a preacher to keep his mic. We love you pastor Apostle and we know that we'll understand it in the by and by you. Many a day wanted to leave this church but you are back here this afternoon. There's something in this place that's holding the reigns. May God bless you. Happy birthday daddy. God bless you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] We can do much better than that, church. Thank you, Pastor Jonathan Ross. Let's give him a shout. Hallelujah. While we welcome our precious pastor, Jude Rosco, let's give him a mighty, mighty, mighty hand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We greet each one in the name of the Lord this afternoon. [Applause] God is so good to us that he sent a gift our way in this hour. [Applause] And so what's so nice, he made the 21st of March a holiday so that we could be here this afternoon. [Music] [Music] [Applause] In 1946, on 21st of March, God brought a gift to the [Music] earth to help you and to help me. Amen. And the amazing thing is we are still very happy that God's gift is still with us. Amen. And leading us on. Amen. [Applause] [Music] I told the apostle in the week I met him at Mall of the South by chance. I said I the the fasting day I listened to silence part two. I said even if somebody could have those notes they wouldn't be able to preach it like that. Even if you listen to it and try to copy it, you won't be able to preach it like that. It was meant to come out of one man's lips. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. And what's so heavy is the anointing on those messages. [Applause] No matter how you feel when you put it on, devils and demons runs. Amen. [Applause] That's why I say like Pastor John, it's an honor to say [Applause] something at our apostles birthday. You don't know what to say. Words like Pastor John says fails you. There's so many things to say. And uh I think sometimes words doesn't make justice to what has been put in to this ministry. [Applause] And uh I always wondered what my mother meant when she said, \"You know, Edgar, me and you, we die with our boots on.\" Hallelujah. We work until we die. And it was so funny when she was in the accident and thrown out of the car, her shoes still stayed on her feet. She was trying to tell us, \"I died with my boots on.\" Amen. And I want to tell her on the other side, my father still got his boots on. We we don't wish him anything because he already has what we want to wish him for. Amen. [Applause] I just want to read two scriptures. Psalms 90 verse 10. The days of our years are three score and three score years and 10 that 70 is allotted to men. And if by reason of strength they be four score years even they four score years 80 years. The Bible says yet is their strength labor and sorrows. When the apostle reached 70, we thought it will be smooth sailing. But even if him living up till now, it came with labor and it came with sorrows. But I thank God that it's Revelations 10:8. Sweet in your mouth, butter in your belly. But what I like of our apostl, he doesn't care about the bitterness. He concentrates on the sweetness. Amen. And I can say that song is fulfilled in his life. We'll work until Jesus come. We'll work until he comes. The apostle is working. Amen. And we appreciate him for that. Amen. That's why we are here this afternoon to come and celebrate his birthday. [Applause] Amen. That's why I'm nearly there. Zechariah 4:7 says, verse 6 says, \"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, this is the word of the Lord unto Jerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but my spirit, say the Lord of hosts.\" He never came with might. He never came with power. But this apostle came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You don't overcome by power. You don't overcome by might. God says, \"Not by power, not by might, but by my my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.\" [Applause] Amen. And the spirit did come and the Holy Ghost did fall. Hallelujah. Here's the Here's the witnesses. Each flag the Holy Ghost fell in every country. Amen. Over 40 countries the Holy Ghost did come. [Applause] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Jerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace. Oh hallelujah. I thank God that the headstone came spring grace grace the mercy seat. Amen. For you and for [Applause] me. Grace. Grace already came. But we have double grace. If a man lives after 70, it's grace. If he lives to 75, it's grace. If he lives beyond 75, it's double grace because grace is number five. Five and five. Amen. That's why we thank God that the headstone cried grace, grace to El Tabernacle. [Applause] That's why we say apostle age is simply the number of years that the world has been enjoying you. We have been enjoying you. The world has been enjoying you for 79 years. El tabernacle. Have you been enjoying God's apostle? [Music] [Applause] Amen. You might be enjoying him for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. But before that some people has been enjoying him for the his young age and all the world has enjoyed him for all these years. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. As the CRS leader comes up. Amen. Getting old is like climbing a mountain. Hallelujah. I thank God that this man was climbing permit mountain. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] The older he got, the higher he climbed, the wiser he became. The higher he climbed, the further he saw. The higher he went up the tower, the further he could see. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Y tabernacle. Can you say praise the Lord? Y tabernacle. [Applause] The older he got, he must have got out of breath. The higher he went. [Applause] The higher he went, the slower he might have gone, but as long as he went [Applause] higher. The higher the eagle goes, the further he [Music] sees. At 79, we want to tell the devil, he went higher and he looked further. [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, the better the view is. And we want to say, Apostle, enjoy the view. Apostle, tell us what's going on on the other side. The further you see, Apostle, tell us what's going to happen. the higher you [Music] go. Daddy, we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for all your labors. We thank you, Lord, for not giving up on us and fighting the fight. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, Apostle Take us with you. Pull us with you higher and higher. God bless you. Amen. Oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you appreciate Pastor Jun Rosco? No, we can do better than that. [Applause] [Music] just for a short while just give him thanks. Thank you Lord. Thank you [Music] Lord. Thank you for our pastor Lord. Thank you for keeping him Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, happy birthday, my apostle. There's a lady, a special lady that we would like to call the granddaughter of the apostle, the daughter of our senior pastor, Jonathan Rosco, Sister Esther. If she can come, let's give her a wonderful warm hand. [Applause] God bless you saints. We are gathered here today to honor a truly special man, a true man of God, a legend. A man, a man known in the heavens and known around this world. On behalf of the Rosco grandchildren, I'm truly honored as your first granddaughter to deliver a speech to our phenomenal grandfather. Today we the grandchildren have hearts full of gratitude for a man who has not only been our grandfather but also our apostle who has been a guiding light and a pillar of strength in our lives. Our grandfather is not just any man. He's a man of God. A true shepherd. A true shepherd who has dedicated his entire life to preaching the gospel, leading his flock and living out the word with unwavering faith and dedication. Through his sermons and his prayers and most importantly his example, he has shown us what it means to walk with God. The Bible says in Proverbs 13:22, \"A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children.\" Many measure inheritance in material wealth. But our grandfather has given us something far greater. The inheritance of the Holy Ghost, the good news. He has shown us that the greatest gift a man can pass down is not riches, but a life rooted in Christ. A legacy of faith and the power of the Holy Spirit working within us. Growing up under his influence has been a blessing beyond measure. His wisdom has shaped us. His prayers covered us. His love has given us strength to live each day with God on our side. Whether through a kind word, a firm lesson, or a simple moment of laughter, he has always reminded us that faith in God is not just something we speak about, but something we live by. Grandpa, your life has been a testimony of faithfulness, perseverance, unwavering trust in the Lord. You have taught us that no matter how difficult the journey, God is always in control, you have shown us what it means to serve with humility, love without conditions, and lead with a heart full of grace. Our family is blessed with many cherished testimonies that continue to deepen our faith in this great, glorious ministry. I too have a testimony. after countless persons to a few doctors. It was only through your prayers, grandpa, that opened my womb, leaving doctors confused and amazed, that I suddenly got to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see. And for that, I'm so thankful, Grandpa. All as a daily reminder that God can do miracles. [Music] The power of God has moved throughout our lives, each and every one of us in this family, pinpointing to the fact that God truly walks with you, grandpa. And we cannot deny it. [Applause] [Music] On behalf of all your grandchildren, we want to say thank you. Thank you for always thinking of us, your grandchildren. Thank you for this great and glorious ministry you've built. Thank you for building a school, a safe haven that molded us. Thank you for all the praise that is keeping us for your wisdom, for your love and for your and for your spiritual legacy you have given us. All we have is because of you grandpa. We are proud to be your grandchildren and we pray that God continues to bless you with strength, good health, and the joy in the Holy Ghost. The 79th birthday, thank you for everything, Grandpa. No amount of words or actions will truly describe what you mean to us. It's because of you that we can be who we the people we are today. We love you, Grandpa. We salute you. May God bless you abundantly and may you enjoy your special day with love from your grandchildren. God bless. [Music] I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words you don't let. I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm just trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus in [Music] God. Words have come from man no Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be true. And I'm trying to leave something behind in the foot of Jesus. Oh, the money is free and the holy smoking [Music] [Music] behind in the forest of Jesus. This whole world is a war. We swallow the moon, but we don't know why. the case but we know I'm trying to something of Jesus I believe we are all I've Heat. Heat. of Jesus. Now there is a ten Yeah. Heat.

can mark the only one that can set you free foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] well [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign we are surely pleased with King Lord Jesus for giving us the opportunity again to be here in London I came down years and years to Cape Town and I never dreamed that one day I'll be coming to langa and Jonathan told me that it's steadily growing a minimum of people about 16 that's without hermanus I am I'm pleased to God as I said week before last walls dedication I said I nail down a peg when everything seems to go wrong and all the lies that has been told and if made people believe those lies I hit down the pig and I look at that pig Wherever I Go that Prophet visits South Africa page 80. when I stood in front of brother barana [Applause] and he laid hands on me [Applause] now now there's no other minister in South Africa that can say that it's only me [Applause] and then I hit down another Pig as I told the ministers up in joburg it's when bully Paul wrote me a letter and told me brother Roscoe I don't listen to anybody just my father and you I hit down that page [Applause] then I hit down another page with brother higginson the head deacon or brother or Branham Tabernacle came and visit us with brother Brown and after the service I could speak to him but during the service he told the people he says the last time I felt the presence of God like this is when brother Branham preached on this day the scripture is fulfilled that was a loss I felt it until now [Applause] now who's going to stop me who's going to stop me Nigeria Ghana Zambia Cape Town can't stop me I'm ordained from a prophet [Applause] and all the positives all of them can't say what I'm saying now [Applause] so so I didn't come down here Taking Chances I don't take chances because I know who I am I come down to Cape Town many years and I and the people in London came in because of the tapes and that made me come down here I come down here just to pull out some seeds because Billy Paul told me he said brother Roscoe I deserved you and you got one of the best spirits of all the ministers he said to me he said to me he he gave me a gift after I told my dad don't go to Cape Town if the angel of God told you not to go to Cape Town then don't go and he said that please the angel to wake me up to see the angel so I do not know why the angel didn't want to come down to Cape Town I think it's because they rejected the Holy Ghost and bless him did so I'm just looking for someone that will go with me [Applause] to my father's house [Applause] so we are here not by chance we are here to come encourage the ones that's walking with us in Cape Town they will never have what you have never [Applause] on the oldest guy in the message now brother Beckett and them all came afterwards when brother Becca left joburg he didn't even preach he was not even a preacher I learned the preaching I was here teaching him so how can he teach me how can I learn from somebody that don't know as much as I know he doesn't know what I know and I'm getting old and I don't like nonsense anymore I don't play church or churchy and I do not play with people's Souls so I bring greetings to El Tabernacle Johannesburg Victoria storm he bloomfontein the people that has called in from the USA Brazil Swaziland leidenberg mobile planning Cecil bug [Music] polokwane and uh and all my Pentecostal friends it's on the streaming may you be blessed two Pentecostal Brothers two weeks ago pastors walked up to me I said brother Roscoe we're following you on a stream although we painted coastals but we silent Believers in here I greet you my brothers your Baptist is listening to me I greet you I look forward to one day share the Holy Ghost with you [Applause] and over in Vendor may God bless you as you streaming tonight and I hope that the streaming will just make you walk closer to God that's all that it's all about as I said the storehouse we'll try to put the details on for years that don't have the details to sign on we'll put it on after the service and tomorrow morning and uh we hope that all those tapes I preached over 3 000 tapes so this will never run dry [Applause] now bully Paul and Joseph Brennan can tell all the ministers to switch on and press and listen to the tape but they can't tell me that brother Graham says this boy will preach exactly what I preach [Applause] brother Branham says I must preach [Applause] and I can't listen to them I must listen to brother Brennan [Applause] so may you be blessed and the few families in the USA that's listening in may God just come your way to another as you listen to it this broadcast so let us preach I hope you're going to have patience with me tonight I must see how far we get I do not know I got comments to make before I preach and if you've got a pen and PayPal write down what I'm going to say go back home we're going to check it up don't go to your pastor because he's gonna lie to you go look it and they came unto the brook of s call Brokers where the water flows and cut down from cinch a bunch with one cluster of grapes they bit off a branch just with one cluster of grapes that was not the whole branch that was part of the branch that they broke off and the Bible says and they bear it between two upon a staff two guys had to carry that bunch of grapes it was so heavy one couldn't two had to carry The Grapes of the Promised Land God doesn't change and they brought off the pomegranates amen and of the figs three types of fruit in the Promised Land have your church got this fruit in their church have you got these fruit in your church I'd like to take another scripture I'd ask you to be patient with me right Galatians 5. now that's the fruit of the land and the land is the Holy Ghost now if your pastor preached on the Holy Ghost and that fruit is not in his ministry then he's lying to you then he is a Baptist trying to pull wool over your face if he hasn't got grapes in his ministry then he's not called Galatians 5. and verse 22 but the Fruit of the Spirit let me say but the fruit of the land because the land is a spirit so the two scriptures goes together am I right is love joy now they say love love love love but love is only a fruit of the spirit the spirit don't come out of love love comes out of the spirit so get the spirit first because you say brotherly kindness brother don't come and tell Edgar Osco that because Edgar Osco want to see the holy ghost first then the fruit of the spirit love [Applause] otherwise he is not loved that man and out of love joy they love love love love love love but there isn't no joy in the church the pastor never danced around the pulpit yet but he speak about love and he's got no joy brother we have joy we have love and we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen did you catch that I'd like to take Romans I didn't I didn't give this to you Edgar I just thought I'm gonna throw it in the air and read the scripture Romans 8. verse 23 first Romans 8 23. and not only then but ourselves also which what now what is the first fruit of the spirit love the Bible don't contradict itself then why is the pastors contradict themselves why does Bible Tabernacle lie like that let's take another one eight same Romans 8 I think verse 9. focus on this is already too much but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit it's so be that the spirit of God dwells in you not if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his you don't even belong to Jesus even if you in Bible Tabernacle if you don't have the spirit you're none of his he's going to say turn around I know you not and they never had the Holy Ghost in Bible Tabernacle they never had an outpouring in Bible Tabernacle they never had a dance in Bible Tabernacle [Applause] that pasta never danced Hallelujah can you imagine brother Becca dance [Applause] but I saw brother Brennan dance [Applause] [Music] that's why longer stay where you are stay where you are [Applause] [Music] I think and the only one that can correct back it but he can't correct me amen I can show you where he's wrong let me tell you this just this before you said we went Florida and Bob Browns Church and brother Beckett only preached porber holiday like he now recently just preached van diyao and sing with dry Baptist Methodist songs that's why please give me a monster [Applause] and it was so dead in that church after Beckett preached brother Becca preached we went to the hotel and brother Becker threw himself on the bed he says you know brother Roscoe my church is dead but this church is deader I said Angel just write down what he says now [Applause] this word catch him just after he died just after he died that will come to him out of his own mouth his church is dead I went same thing happened church is dead he went on the Sunday morning was was he fell asleep I went in the evening and I made them laugh I made them I made them loose [Applause] and when Bob Brown's church was loose you know you sat right in front here every time you finish preaching don't close the meeting you don't say nothing what you preach you just turn around to the people and say you dismiss that was Beckett's right-hand guy that that was brother Beckett's Colonel of a guy I said I look at brother back and I said no what is this people with hats on but Beckett will go after that nonsense and thus is recorded in heaven and when I was finished and they were laughing and they were free I put in the Holy Ghost there [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so can brother Becca tell me anything out of his own multi-cities church is dead nobody can tell me anything I was here before they were again okay that's enough of that if I should entitle this a message tonight or to tell entitle it the fruit of the land the fruit of the land I have never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land the pomegranates the honey the figs and the grapes all speaks about the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] he told Israel when you get in the land that's what you're going to get amen let's buy our heads father I've traveled a thousand miles or kilometers down here not to waste any time but to be glad to be able to work for you and not doing you a service but do everything that I do to show back into the Bible [Applause] may you a father look at the heart and please give us something to think about I ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated [Applause] now as I said I've never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land because the land's got fruit and he told them it's got fruit and we want to check that fruit up but before going in there I just got something to say before I start preaching I'd like to take Point number one and now let's see how many has discernment discernment is to be able to discern between two things right and wrong virgin or foolish virgin God or not God see if you got discernment quote but manifested quote it's good to quote but he said quote manifested in your church so I want to see as this gets streamed out who's got discernment where is the discernment it's to match up two things the right thing and the wrong thing so just for a couple of minutes let's see if Cape Town has discernment are they taking what their pastor says or what brother Branham says are they taking just a quote and not a manifested quote amen if you have your paint pins and papers to it right around the world I would like you to write down these quotes the first one is the middle is festered manifestation of thy Resurrection to the people of this day listen to that brother Brahm says there I can hear a noise a noise do you hear a noise in the churches in the message in Cape Town but brother Brown says I hear a noise I can imagine the poor blind beggar said it's this noise all about why does el Tabernacle make a noise what is this noise all about [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now listen you know he tells us you know well I'm in Bible temp I'm in that Temple I'm in that type of and and I'm in you know but he tells you do you know that say that you're in the message you know usually where Jesus is there was always a little noise [Applause] foreign [Applause] it upsets the Baptist because brother Beckett comes from the Baptist um it always upsets the Baptist if there's a noise and I heard they said the last time I was here you can't you can't shout all the time who tell you you can't why do the cherubims shout day and night all the time [Applause] get behind me Satan [Applause] it's a little upsetting they get upset the Baptist in the message they get upset and you know for 57 years that I'm in the message they got upset but you think they could change me I had a pet down I had a peck done [Applause] couldn't stop me can't stop me will never stop me I will dance like David does [Applause] [Music] amen then he says why why a lot life comes in life what what brings a noise and you say you got life and there's no noise you're a liar because brother Branham says life brings a noise [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] churches get out of that synagogues of Satan get out where there's a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I believe the prophet and not Bible Tabernacle no I told you to have discernment could Bible Tabernacle take this quote [Music] then when you miss one word you're going to hell one word with all the Nigerians and whatever it is in your church you're going to hell miss this quote now when I like to say this I said discernment between the right and wrong now if you take the opposite of this good he says where there's a noise there's Jesus Jesus is there where there's a noise now the opposite if there is no noise is Jesus there [Applause] [Music] do you believe the prophet do you believe this quote then why don't they do it [Applause] I wonder can you do me a favor you turn around to one another and tell one another wherever Jesus is there's a noise [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] my God [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see I got a very little blacks from up ethical way Congo Zambia all very few I all got local blacks here because I got local black blood in there thank you shame on you you can't even give God the glory you sit there like a pope get out man get out [Applause] let us just say this did I just say this when light comes in life brings a noise now tell me is Jesus life is that what he says in Saint John 14 does he say that I am the [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that was a quote in 1954. in case you want to know where it is it's your write you down so when a devil come to you I tell you don't make such a lot of noise you show him this quote [Applause] do you want another one let's take number two simonian Church 1960 1206 money in church look what he says I like a good now this is what your Prophet likes is not what Bible believers Baptist Prof uh Pastor like this is what the prophet William Branham likes he likes this he says I like a good what just hold it there the power of God Must Fall it mustn't be that the pastor goes up and he says let's worship God and then our theme and when he gets tired the whole church is tired it dies down no it falls and automatically there's a shouting there's a jumping that amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] through spruce man Bruce for tell me oh yeah but the prophet fellow do you like what the prophet likes [Applause] then you won't like Bible Believers you won't like that church if you like what the prophet likes and he likes when the Holy Ghost Falls not when he comes let's worship and when he gets tired everybody gets tired and assume there's no Holy Ghost that's not the Holy Ghost that's a Strange Fire amen we need fire all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says where the power of God is falling what does he say further can you read it for me holy I thought you must be quiet like brother Beckett you must be quiet no no no no no no no no no not evgar Roscoe I'll scream I'll shout I'll praise God I'll dance Hallelujah why the prophet light say it [Music] and you like it and you like it and you like it [Applause] [Music] some guys were sent to Elijah and Elijah says you'll go back go tell ayab Elijah is here you go back you can tell Beckett the good old schools here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it says you are screaming shouting praising God doing what langa are you having a good time foreign [Music] you preachers and now watch what he says but you but we you can't hear amen hardly anymore it's our man and back at you well Abraham says that's nonsense it's her amen it's a amen what's some feeling in it that's what he says [Music] can you give the devil a nice amen can't hear you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's where this end time Church is this is only my commands I'm not preaching the message yet I'm too full [Applause] foreign number three the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals well you know 1963. write down write down could you imagine Peter and James and John and then in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost like they say in Bible Tabernacle we've got the Holy Ghost we've got the Holy Ghost now but maybe we better keep stall a quiet Holy Ghost brother said maybe they they said we've got to have a a holy ghost without emotions there is no quote like that anyhow but Beckett and they made it a quote with valyria teeth but there is no quote like receiving the Holy Ghost without emotions I blasted that thing they don't even use it anymore and yeah brother Branham comes back he says you've got the Holy Ghost and you see we must keep still you don't have to be so excited you're making too much noise if you get a holy ghost my friend you're going to make a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we should keep stall listen to brother Branham brother says brother in other words Hey Brother in Bible table Miracle brother wake up you're in the wrong place you're keeping stole while the chatterbombs is crying holy holy holy holy and you keeping stop [Applause] and this is in the seals what did they do through Windows imagine they climbed through Windows after receiving the Holy Ghost so emotional they were they went through the windows they went through the doors and everything they needed to go out and make a noise [Applause] they went out into the street [Applause] you think brother Beckett can do that he can't even do it in his church because he don't have the Holy Ghost I will stand at the day of judgment and judge him for rejecting the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will be his judge [Music] play with fire play with your mother than to play with Edgar Oscar [Applause] they went through everything out into the streets doing what I don't hear you did you read it thank you I don't hear you that's that's viable Tabernacle act like a bunch of drunks then what are you doing there he says that's what the Holy Ghost does so if you don't act like a drunk man amen walking up and down and blubbering hey man he published you can't even hear him and his brother is hallelujah [Music] speaking in tongues a drunk man [Music] [Applause] just read that for me again acting can they still be in the message can Bible but Tabernacle still be in the message how many quotes did I give you that they can't perform struggling for 53 years since I'm in the message 57 years in fact and they will never get it if your pastor don't have it the church won't have it if the pastor can't be drunk how can the church be drunk if the pastor don't have it he can't give it but come to a pasta come to El Tabernacle come here where we have the dynamic Center mechanics [Music] [Applause] this is thus saith the Lord [Applause] because it's the quotes [Applause] how does he end this how does he end this quote can you end this quote for me [Applause] I don't hear you [Applause] so that's the real Holy Ghost not the quiet back at Holy Ghost that's Holy Ghost with a shouting and a jumping and a good time in the Lord and a joy unspeakable and full of glory and a half has never yet been told Amen brother a dancing Holy Ghost amen that's the real Holy Ghost thus saying the prophet not thus Saiyan brother Beckett thus saith William Branham [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus don't know it but I know the prophet but brother when he says you can know the prophet you can pay your tithes you can come to church you can quote call Will quote brother Branham he said but still you need the token if you don't have the token you'll die if you die because you're none of his [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] church church here in London just finish this quote again for me now there's only one baptism not true not Bible Tabernacle and El Tabernacle one of the two must be wrong who's wrong I don't hear you I don't hear you and who's right Tabernacle propose the quotation [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that's that's the appeal that's a Real McCoy man how do you say in xhosa for real ESO so Indiana [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you want more that's not my message it's my comments but it's more powerful than brother Beckett could ever preach when we're in a platform back again to sit at the back of me because I'm The Real McCoy because I bring the real genuine Holy Ghost the one that President speaks about foreign [Applause] I'm an apostle I need to straighten out those false Brothers amen that's what I'm hearing langa for I'm straightening out somebody [Applause] with that quiet Holy Ghost [Applause] amen sister with a scarf on Amen you feel the ripple from the holy of holies [Applause] let's take the next one uncertain sounds this is my one you can take this quote to any church and you'll find out they're not fulfilling it they don't have it they can't do this because they're not the real Church that's why I like this one uncertain sounds page 53 I think it is just read me that first sentence just as far as that brother France for springster theater reference amen you Nigerians better wake up you say you believe the prophets what can you take this quote [Applause] I don't care about brother Beckett I'm gonna tell you why the quote says can you read it further sorry just stop there human Mary of the Catholic Church what's drunk my brother bakeries are not drunk he is he's never been drunk he doesn't know how the wine tastes he was not in the promised land he never carried the grapes amen the real fightful Ministry carried the grapes why should God let the real preachers come with grapes you make wine from grapes so the land is full of wine so God don't want any sober people he wants strong people he says in my land Allah [Applause] they drunk they carry those grapes staggering as they came hey man they stick it on at it brother Branham say you need to be drunk were you ever drunken Bible Tabernacle you say anybody ever drunk not with the Teaching Ministry but otherwise her teaching Minister he can't give you the Holy Ghost and check all her teachers they never got the Holy Ghost and they never gave out the Holy Ghost because brother Branham said so Becca is a dry preacher maybe he saved me just to tell you could this be the reason why the angel didn't want to brought brother Abraham to come to Cape Town they rejected the grapes the bishop rejected the grapes and the angel said Prophet you don't go there oh why Why did Why did why why didn't he want him to come here but he says get to Johannesburg there's a little boy there I want you to lay hands on him because he's my Apostle he's going to make this quote love and shake the world [Applause] can I pick Afrikaans proud foreign [Applause] he goes on the Virgin Mary like she was drunk staggering staggering means walking like this did you ever want to see brother Beckett or anybody I'm an arrow amen all those dead aim and Baptist in brother Packard's church ever walk like this but he says Mary did and they say they got the Holy Ghost you're a liar if you have the Holy Ghost you'll stagger you speak in tongues you will dance you will shout with a life of Jesus Christ [Applause] brother Beckett I am the apostle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] why because my fruits tell me I am [Music] where is your fruits [Applause] staggering under the power of God and all of them like older all 120. oh brother the record used to say well we all not made the same you know we got different what do you call that temperaments amen you see our temperament is not like yours brother Roscoe we've got a quiet temperament you're a liar man he says all of them he says all of them like that every one of them your sinking temperament if it's not like this then it's not God's temperament [Applause] [Music] a certain white preacher a certain white preacher told me brother Oscar you see you're a black guy your temperament and we white temperaments is two different things if you dance shout and all that which we don't condemn you it's your temperament but we want to be quiet check all the white churches they quiet I got off from I said this is your liar he says what do you mean I says when Elvis Presley cleaning and he made like this [Music] I said your woman got so mad amen they put their underneath clothing and threw it on they were shouting and jumping I said in a soccer matches sir Amen in England amen when when they score a goal those guys jump up but you'll come to the message we whites shame on you [Applause] same on you you lying [Applause] laughs [Applause] no I highlighted this I want you to read that highlight now that's the way that the church is ordained that's the way the church started Now read on his Bible his Bible Believers that kind of a church do they Shout do they scream with a life behind it they justify Sanctified but they never enter the Promised Land they got the Ten Commandments the 10 seals and all that but without the promised land they died in the wilderness and all in in Becca's church is gonna die because they that don't have desperate that brother pranam says is none of his not some good at temperament and others got that temperament don't work that way you want another one oh my my time is gone the Easter seal I believe that Pentacles began without an ending [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the Indian s Bible Believers Tabernacle it ended there because he said a couple of years ago about 30 years ago he said he'd rather be a baptism a Pentecostal but here brother Brahm says it started without an end it's going on in langa right now [Applause] [Music] I believe it's to be to every creature all times all times all times now tomorrow Damon 100 years at 200 years 2000 years amen 3.5 billion years it's all the time Pentecost [Music] [Applause] all the time at all places the boats will be all over Ali Becca do you know why Ali placa do you know why Aldi placa but all in US is [Applause] [Music] all places that Pentecost should always remain yes they're in trouble Bible Believers is in trouble brother Beckett is in trouble [Music] [Applause] should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people keep it upon the people keep Pentecost all the people amen don't ever take it away don't quench the Holy Ghost don't throw water on the Holy Ghost don't quiet the people down if they live the life then they're going to shout for victory [Applause] oh my I don't know what to do said the last one day okay let's go it's only my commands the sign of unbelief when God gave Solomon a great gift of discernment and all Israel rallied around it oh wouldn't it be a great day today if all the churches would rally around God's great gift the Holy Spirit would you not be wonderful if we just forget our differences and denominations and just realize rally around the greatest gift that God gave ever sent to the Earth the Holy Spirit his son died that he might come could you read the other one the holy spirit is greater and the Bible and Hugo on the prophet says the prophet said the prophet said the prophet says the Holy Ghost is greater than what the prophet said because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible [Applause] it says you speak one word against he says you can speak against the word it will be forgiven him but speak against the Holy Ghost it will never be forgiven here [Music] by Christ came the spirit when they called him Balsam up he said you say that against me the son of man they quote the scripture I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come and does the same thing one word against it will never be forgotten forgiven in this world not the word to come and George Martin calls falling in the spirit they fall like monkeys when they dance they dance like Michael Jackson one word I don't care what you're saying the invoice it's goodbye No Redemption and how many words did that two guys speak against the Holy Ghost the minute they die they have to face this for what they said against the Holy Ghost it's one word against it will never be forgiven in this world not the world to come and this is a greater day than that was just a day now when God has poured out his spirit from Johannesburg right down to Cape Town right overseas it's a greater gift amen giving out the Holy Ghost over 40 countries people is under the spirit it's a greater day this day when he poured out his Spirit according to Joel 2 and I'll pour out my spirit at All Flesh it's a greater day than when brother pranam was here amen because the Holy Ghost has gone right around the world Amen and baptizing people amen the way brother Branham says the Holy Ghost is jumping and shouting and emotions thank you the Holy Spirit working universally in his church universally 40 countries it never happened with anybody that's stupid right here took it around over 40 countries I think I'm gonna close give it another one there's another one yep the Seal of God that's the way God does when he he sends his power down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he moved in right there and Away went the message Hallelujah and they shouted and screamed you mean when the message went down they shouted and screamed and spoke in tongues and went out there and that was the mark that God put upon the people that was the mark shouting and screaming that was the mark that God put on the people did he put it on you [Applause] then why are you so quiet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] could you read the next line for me is that right when when you've been here in langa you mean right now that kind of a mark [Applause] do you understand why the shouting and the jumping is here and the speaking in tongues and loving the word not quoting the word and not be years of the word but doers of the word that's really the other lines the same seal what was the Seal of God shouting jumping screaming is that the seal if that angel come down here and he's here you're shopping and jumping and he seals in amen because that's the type of a seal there is no Baptist Bible Tabernacle sale two different seals there's only one seal and this will produce jumping and shouting and being drunk in the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] you can clap your hands it's all right [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] what type of seal is this Lord I do not know why you gave that girl the greatest thing in the Bible to complete the baptism of the Holy Ghost they try to tell me the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost without emotions I couldn't take it until one day I got the quote and I quiet the whole world [Applause] and I still they don't say it anymore why because don't tell them Edgar Osco is here [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

[music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're together again. It was so beautiful. I was sitting in the car and I watched all the sisters was trickling into this place and it's been such a beautiful scene for Hey, [applause] [applause] they they look like angels. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; moving to a specific place and I said to myself, it had come it was not in vain. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; My loving is not in vain. &gt;&gt; I I thought as the marched in here. I thought when the devil look over the benister of his domain and they look at them, I wonder what does he think? I'm sure He must be jealous, you know. [applause] Because this is just a different bunch. Not the same people. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So um tonight this question and answer is not so much preaching. Sometimes wonder why we have things like this but they sang the song. Yeah. Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And we are the question. We got so many questions. So I'm so glad that he is the answer. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Because before there could be a question, &gt;&gt; there had to be an answer. [applause] So, the university students threw up some questions that we're going to answer tonight because we believe that he is the king of El Tabernacle. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; and he wants to answer you. So let us just bow our eyes and look towards him. Our heavenly father, I think it's Paul that says he's the greatest, the chiefest sinner of them all. We come to you if we failed you during the course of this day. May you forgive us what we thought and whatever we done that don't satisfy you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; in thought, word, and deed. Forgive us. We are here tonight because there's questions. Lord, for every question [applause] there's an answer because Jesus is the answer. [applause] I do pray that you would bless your children here, the ones you washed in your blood. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; that we could come out on a Thursday night and have church. So we love church Lord. May you further undertake for us [applause] in Jesus name. You may be seated now. We sorry for the brethren that stands around the hallway. Yeah.

He asked the question and when I look down here I can't see this. God like to ask questions. He asked a question in Genesis 3:9. And he says, \"And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou?\" Question. I know where I left you, Adam. I left you being behind holiness. But where are you now? And I wonder if God isn't asking that question a lot in our time. My son, where are you? You find people that has been with El Tabernacle, but you can't help to ask the question, where are you now? Question. Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, \"What is this that thou has done?\" Question. And the woman says, \"The serpent beg me and\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2025-10-25%20-%20Special%20Saturday%20Evening%20Service%20%2025%20October%202025%20-%20Unknown%20Speaker.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2025-10-25 - Special Saturday Evening Service  25 October 2025 - Unknown Speaker.txt\n################################################################################\n\nSERMON DETAILS\n========================================\nDate:     2025-10-25\nTitle:    Special Saturday Evening Service | 25 October 2025\nSpeaker:  Unknown Speaker\nChurch:   EL Tabernacle Ministries\nType:     Full Sermon\nDuration: 1h 30m\nLanguage: English\nURL:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-5IA4pqVII\n========================================\n\nDescription:\nDon`t forget to subscribe to the Storehouse for this and all other services.\n\nhttps://storehouse.eltabernacle.co.za\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nat the place.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time we had last night. [applause and cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to thank brother Stefford and Abigail, my daughter, &gt;&gt; for raring men of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And now they could plant back into the church. [applause] &gt;&gt; All the years of turmoil and struggle, &gt;&gt; sweat, &gt;&gt; and tears &gt;&gt; and labor. &gt;&gt; It's worth sitting &gt;&gt; under something like that. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; We surely we surely &gt;&gt; proud of you young guys. [applause] &gt;&gt; God sent you in here to push the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; I would also start where my grandson started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Same quotation. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We don't have it on that one. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I want the world to see it. Can we read it? &gt;&gt; Can we read it? &gt;&gt; And so &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope that his voice auth Even I [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] love you. [applause] [cheering] There there has never been anything like that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; There's never been anything like that &gt;&gt; in the end time message. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So, it's so good &gt;&gt; to be able to &gt;&gt; not only quote Bible &gt;&gt; but to manifest &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We could even say brother Burnham didn't have the opportunity And uh this weekend you didn't only come to a service, &gt;&gt; you come to this day. &gt;&gt; The scripture [cheering and applause] is to [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; But what's happening now is far more greater than this quote. [applause] &gt;&gt; Why? [applause] Why? Because Jesus says a son &gt;&gt; and a grandson and a grandfather, &gt;&gt; but I got two sons and I've got two grandsons. So it's bigger than this. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I have already preached with my sons and grandsons. But I just felt in my spirit, &gt;&gt; I like to preach with my grandsons. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And it's far more greater than President Mandela. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There's something more greater than President Mandela [cheering] because he's got no sons that can follow him. I have and not a kingdom of South Africa, the kingdom of heaven. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So we come to manifest &gt;&gt; that scripture. &gt;&gt; Such a lot of scriptures has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Makes sense to the word is fulfilled. The token bearer &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; One that has the dynamics. It's &gt;&gt; fulfilled. Another Ephesians is here fulfilled. [cheering] Turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal faith. It's from F. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Somebody will come one day &gt;&gt; and blaz evolution [cheering] fulfall [applause and cheering] will come. It's fulfilled. [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] A little boy will come and preach exactly like the prophet. Same message. [cheering] It's fulfilled. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:8. It's fulfilled. [cheering] Revelations 10:37 thunders uttered their voices [cheering] fulfilled. Matthew 25 fulfilled [cheering] [applause] the gospel trumpet fulfilled. [cheering] You sit in a church that fulfills scriptures. [cheering] [cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; we together again &gt;&gt; and when we together &gt;&gt; then hell shakes. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We give out eternal life &gt;&gt; to men &gt;&gt; that got nearly 200 years in prison. &gt;&gt; We gave them eternal life. The year turn [cheering] &gt;&gt; fulfilled. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham [applause] got one prisoner off the hook &gt;&gt; and they gave him a medallion or something for it. El Tabernacle. We can't even count that. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] [applause] And &gt;&gt; just before going into the sermon, &gt;&gt; we have at last &gt;&gt; broke the backl of the Durban church. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; So yet again, [applause] there's another church that's gone up. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We were just speaking of the guys that gave towards this church, Brother Eddie Muhammad and them. &gt;&gt; And yet here it stands. And the blessings, Brother Eddie, is not going to end. &gt;&gt; Look at it now. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; So I greet you &gt;&gt; my friends. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Good evening friends. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [cheering and applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be with you again. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Last night when Joe finished preach and nearly simultaneously me and Jonathan told him, \"Um, him and his brother Joel, man, if we get a little more older, &gt;&gt; don't put us out of your church, okay?\" Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; So don't put me out of this church. [applause] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go. &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; So I greet all of you. I wish we could have been under one roof. I see where it's full next door. And the tent is also full. &gt;&gt; And uh but uh as long as you a couple of feet from the anointing, &gt;&gt; you will still feel &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now tonight we have a mixed crowd and I have to cater for a mixed crowd. I have to also preach ABCs around &gt;&gt; the band here &gt;&gt; and uh um to reach everybody and um therefore I'd like to go to what I'm busy with &gt;&gt; Matthew 25 If your Bibles with you, [applause] &gt;&gt; we turn to Matthew 25. &gt;&gt; Just one verse. Matthew 25 verse two. [crying] And five of them were wise and five were foolish. Half of the church &gt;&gt; was foolish. And I'm not going to speak about the wise. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the foolish church. &gt;&gt; The foolish church. It's quite strange that God &gt;&gt; will put two churches &gt;&gt; right in the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; right at the time &gt;&gt; when Messiah comes. &gt;&gt; Right at that time &gt;&gt; where Trump put up taxes to tax the people. &gt;&gt; As Herod tax the people, &gt;&gt; they had to go to Bethlehem where Jesus had to be born because of taxes. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; The first coming taxes &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; taxes again. at the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So there'll be two churches right &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; There'll be a wise church &gt;&gt; and there'll be a foolish church. &gt;&gt; And you have to think &gt;&gt; in which church you are in &gt;&gt; tonight. [applause and cheering] The El Tabernacle is a foolish church. And I want to tell you, you better get out &gt;&gt; and go look where there is &gt;&gt; a wise church &gt;&gt; where the scriptures are being fulfilled. [applause] And if you're from any other church, may you sit here in this meeting tonight and may you do some calculations in your mind &gt;&gt; and ask yourself the question, &gt;&gt; do I belong to a foolish church &gt;&gt; or do I belong to &gt;&gt; a wise church? [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; We want to find that out tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, so ironic, &gt;&gt; nobody actually spoke on this, &gt;&gt; but the king himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No disciples spoke on this. &gt;&gt; No scribe, &gt;&gt; no Pharisee, &gt;&gt; but the Lord himself. [applause] [cheering] [applause] And he tells us &gt;&gt; in that time, &gt;&gt; open your eyes, &gt;&gt; there's going to be two churches, [applause] &gt;&gt; one foolish church, and one wise church. &gt;&gt; And you will have to fight through it all. It's not easy to get into the wise church. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It is a battle. It is a revelation. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And the king says in Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; he said, \"Just before I come, &gt;&gt; and I hope if you're in El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; that you're not foolish. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now why is she foolish? &gt;&gt; Why is this church foolish? Webster dictionary says a fool is somebody &gt;&gt; lacking understanding &gt;&gt; can't understand &gt;&gt; why this people &gt;&gt; going like a bunch of mad [cheering] heresy worshippers can't understand. [cheering] [cheering] A fool is somebody &gt;&gt; that lacks judgment &gt;&gt; or choosing. &gt;&gt; They can't judge properly. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; That's a fool. or she can't even see common sense, &gt;&gt; apples and pears. &gt;&gt; She can't discern common sense. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; or one that's fooled. &gt;&gt; One that's fooled get deceived with the wrong ignorant &gt;&gt; things of the world. &gt;&gt; Is it to influence them? by family &gt;&gt; or friends &gt;&gt; or popular opinion. [applause] &gt;&gt; I rather go with a stream. &gt;&gt; I rather go with a majority of the people &gt;&gt; than to accept the right thing. [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's a fool.\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2025-04-20%20-%20Mthatha%20Cornerstone%20Unveiling%20%2020%20April%202025%20-%20Mthatha%20Cornerstone%20Unveiling.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2025-04-20 - Mthatha Cornerstone Unveiling  20 April 2025 - Mthatha Cornerstone Unveiling.txt\n################################################################################\n\nSERMON DETAILS\n========================================\nDate:     2025-04-20\nTitle:    Mthatha Cornerstone Unveiling | 20 April 2025\nSpeaker:  Mthatha Cornerstone Unveiling\nChurch:   EL Tabernacle Ministries\nType:     Short Service\nDuration: 10m\nLanguage: English\nURL:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjlcomP4TRY\n========================================\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\n[Music] Amen. We greet you all in the name of Jesus [Applause] Christ. We are here to unveil a stone and it's not any stone. We are here to identify that El Tabernacle has moved across southern Africa. We are here yet to identify that the man has come around. [Applause] We are here to identify that God is in somebody because how can these things be and how can we wor witness so many miracles in El Tabernacle like we are ministering and seeing every day. So once again, we are witnesses to Pastor Ja down here in the Eastern Cape as he follows the star. [Applause] And I'd like to tell the believers and our pastor Ja, don't follow us, follow the dove. [Applause] because the dove knows the way home. So let us pray. Lord, we come to you as your apostle vision for El Tabernacle is continuing. We are yet to unveil El Tabernacle stone, a stone that is of great essence for the hour we're living in. May you come and bless us as we prepare for the service. Lord, may you come and bless each one of these here has come to witness this day. We give you all the praise, all the glory in Jesus name. Amen and amen. [Applause] Are you happy? Don't look at Paul says, \"Wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works of the law, for they stumbled at the stumbling stone. As it is written, Behold, I lay in Z a stumbling stone, a rock which going to be an offense to everybody. And whosoever believeth on him to stone his person. So even there are people that still are confused about him because he's a rock of offense. He's a stumbling stone. You must stumble when he is there. You have big question mark cuz it's he is a stumbling stone. Hallelujah. But he says I'll put that stumbling stone in El Tabernacle. Whoever believe on him will will [Music] be saved. [Music] [Applause] So that's why we are here. So we are here to identify him because it's his stone, his ministry here in the eastern. So pastor Ja follow that stumbling stone and you will be saved with everybody that comes here. Nobody will like the stone. Everybody hates it cuz it's offensive. It tramps on your toes. Tells you you're not right. You can put any tape on, you will hear. It's a rock of offense. But it's God's stone. And in closing, the stone that the builders has rejected is the rejected one. The one that's rejected in the message is become the head of Elwood, El Tabernacle Church. Amen. So, Pastor Ja, you and your wife, can you just open it up for us? Praise the Lord. We are we got lot of these stones across South Africa where sister Maris will be in Heras to change that one to white. We will be there brother. Thank you. But this is how it is from vend right across on every church building of El Tabernacle. It's the church ages Jesus and the megers. Then it has the cross and a star and the seven thunders because the seven thunders is the messengers that El tabernacle follows. Amen. And it's to the glory of God and it's got love and faith and all the virtues. It's got the names of the messengers and it gives you every church age. He has scriptures here. If you want to have scriptures to read before you go into church, there's scriptures given for you before you come in here. It will give you insight to what else heaven. It's written there. That's why we put it down there. Now I know you just walk into church but if you're in Bloomington Estras wherever those scriptures down and read it which I know you didn't see you just put your hand on it but there's scriptures there to be read that the apostle put for a reason and all this has been laid by the apostle E H Ros Rosco all of you boulder and founder of Eaban.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's very quiet in here. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] In 1979, the message of the hour was in a graveyard. There was no hallelujah. [Music] There was no Holy Ghost. There was no people shouting on the top of their voices. But I want you to know 1979 came and the message is still trembling today because of 1979. That's why I say it's a bit quiet in here. [Music] The devil knows that 79 the silence was broken and it will never be silent again. Hallelujah. And today, [Music] Satan, right in this moment, it's 79 again. That's why I say it's very quiet in here. It's very quiet in here. After all that singing, after that the morning when the sun came up, Satan, it's 79 [Music] again. When God's house will never be quiet because when the man came around, he broke the silence. The man came around [Music] Hallelujah. If you still waiting for something, just shout. You still confused what where you are, just open your mouth and [Music] [Music] Wherever Jesus [Music] You'll hear a lot of noise. So, I want to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm so glad that the apostle invited me to his [Music] birthday. Me, the least of all, he he invited me to be here. And what makes it worse, he asked me to say something. Oh, I feel honored. Out of 8 billion, I made it. [Music] Yeah. Same as [Music] somebody. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to [Music] say to this body that carries the power of God. Happy birthday, man of God. [Applause] [Music] I have a saying to my father every now and then when I look at him when I saw him say when he was 60 when he preached crossing the line he said I'm an old man but now I don't believe he's an old man there's a young man living in this [Music] Morning. Hallelujah. And I keep saying to the apostle, do me a favor, Daddy. Just keep on breathing. When CO came, I said, \"Oh, God man, just keep on breathing.\" And I'm so glad it is here with us today. words runs out when it comes to Apostle Ros. You can't say enough. It doesn't do justice to the work that God has done in our [Music] tabernacle. I just want to read a scripture or two. I don't have much to say. [Music] And the Bible says in Job 42:12, so the Lord blessed the letter of Job more of his blessings than what he began. The letter part of Job was blessed more. And I can see it and I'm a witness of it that the latter part was more blessed than when Job was blessed. So in blessing, God has blessed this man. Are you a witness of the letter? [Music] And just before that, the man that accused him of sin, God told those men, if that man don't pray for you, you're in trouble. And I'm so glad he prayed for all of us and we are not in [Music] trouble. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh my my my my. Can I just say something quickly? Paul says, \"Ye are all partakers. You are all partakers of my grace.\" And I am a witness today that today and this Revelation stand series and crossing the line, we are all partakers of God's apostles grace because God gave him grace. We are here. Are you here? I can't hear El tabernacle. [Music] Hallelujah. Grace has come our way. [Music] And we want to say thank you to the Lord. It's quiet all over. The message, the internet, the preaching, the moving of the spirit has gone quiet all over and it's getting quieter. But in El Tabernacle, there's a man [Music] [Applause] Now in the book of Genesis, I'm not going to be long. I pastor Jude will be come after me [Music] today. And while I'm on that point, he asked tomorrow to preach for his father. So, we'll be broadcasting tomorrow cuz it's our father. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Although there's many rostals around, but at least it's our father. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Before I finish up, Pastor Paul made a wish to the man of God. And he said that at the latter time he brother Bam say he'll choose to come to the earth to help God's people. I feel we already helped why why why the god man gave you the greatest thing that any man could give you. The greatest thing in the world he gave to our tabernacle. Can you tell me what is that gift that he gave? So if he has given you the Holy Ghost, you can't give him a greater gift back. You receive the greatest [Music] gift. Hallelujah. And I was thinking in the book of Genesis, there was a man whose name started with a E. He was the seventh from Adam. And it was in the book of Genesis. There was a man whose name started with an E. And the Bible says this man walked with God. [Applause] And when I heard them sing that song, I can't even walk unless he holds my hand. I realized God has another man whose name starts with an E and he walks with God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] My father flies pigeons and he can see every bird in the kit at his age without glasses. I can't see who's behind in the church, but those dove eyes still sees better than his son's [Music] [Applause] eyes. And Enoch walked with God and he was not. that I believe in Revelations 10, there's another man with a ear. Revelations 10:8 and he also walks with God. Pray for the man of God. Love him more. Appreciate him more. Do what he says. And like he said, don't follow us. Follow that dove. Happy birthday to you, my father. I really love you. You've been more than a father to me. And thanks for coming every time for my soul. I'm a preacher today because he allowed me to keep his mic. This will never be my mic, but my father allowed me as a preacher to keep his mic. We love you pastor Apostle and we know that we'll understand it in the by and by you. Many a day wanted to leave this church but you are back here this afternoon. There's something in this place that's holding the reigns. May God bless you. Happy birthday daddy. God bless you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] We can do much better than that, church. Thank you, Pastor Jonathan Ross. Let's give him a shout. Hallelujah. While we welcome our precious pastor, Jude Rosco, let's give him a mighty, mighty, mighty hand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We greet each one in the name of the Lord this afternoon. [Applause] God is so good to us that he sent a gift our way in this hour. [Applause] And so what's so nice, he made the 21st of March a holiday so that we could be here this afternoon. [Music] [Music] [Applause] In 1946, on 21st of March, God brought a gift to the [Music] earth to help you and to help me. Amen. And the amazing thing is we are still very happy that God's gift is still with us. Amen. And leading us on. Amen. [Applause] [Music] I told the apostle in the week I met him at Mall of the South by chance. I said I the the fasting day I listened to silence part two. I said even if somebody could have those notes they wouldn't be able to preach it like that. Even if you listen to it and try to copy it, you won't be able to preach it like that. It was meant to come out of one man's lips. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. And what's so heavy is the anointing on those messages. [Applause] No matter how you feel when you put it on, devils and demons runs. Amen. [Applause] That's why I say like Pastor John, it's an honor to say [Applause] something at our apostles birthday. You don't know what to say. Words like Pastor John says fails you. There's so many things to say. And uh I think sometimes words doesn't make justice to what has been put in to this ministry. [Applause] And uh I always wondered what my mother meant when she said, \"You know, Edgar, me and you, we die with our boots on.\" Hallelujah. We work until we die. And it was so funny when she was in the accident and thrown out of the car, her shoes still stayed on her feet. She was trying to tell us, \"I died with my boots on.\" Amen. And I want to tell her on the other side, my father still got his boots on. We we don't wish him anything because he already has what we want to wish him for. Amen. [Applause] I just want to read two scriptures. Psalms 90 verse 10. The days of our years are three score and three score years and 10 that 70 is allotted to men. And if by reason of strength they be four score years even they four score years 80 years. The Bible says yet is their strength labor and sorrows. When the apostle reached 70, we thought it will be smooth sailing. But even if him living up till now, it came with labor and it came with sorrows. But I thank God that it's Revelations 10:8. Sweet in your mouth, butter in your belly. But what I like of our apostl, he doesn't care about the bitterness. He concentrates on the sweetness. Amen. And I can say that song is fulfilled in his life. We'll work until Jesus come. We'll work until he comes. The apostle is working. Amen. And we appreciate him for that. Amen. That's why we are here this afternoon to come and celebrate his birthday. [Applause] Amen. That's why I'm nearly there. Zechariah 4:7 says, verse 6 says, \"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, this is the word of the Lord unto Jerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but my spirit, say the Lord of hosts.\" He never came with might. He never came with power. But this apostle came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You don't overcome by power. You don't overcome by might. God says, \"Not by power, not by might, but by my my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.\" [Applause] Amen. And the spirit did come and the Holy Ghost did fall. Hallelujah. Here's the Here's the witnesses. Each flag the Holy Ghost fell in every country. Amen. Over 40 countries the Holy Ghost did come. [Applause] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Jerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace. Oh hallelujah. I thank God that the headstone came spring grace grace the mercy seat. Amen. For you and for [Applause] me. Grace. Grace already came. But we have double grace. If a man lives after 70, it's grace. If he lives to 75, it's grace. If he lives beyond 75, it's double grace because grace is number five. Five and five. Amen. That's why we thank God that the headstone cried grace, grace to El Tabernacle. [Applause] That's why we say apostle age is simply the number of years that the world has been enjoying you. We have been enjoying you. The world has been enjoying you for 79 years. El tabernacle. Have you been enjoying God's apostle? [Music] [Applause] Amen. You might be enjoying him for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. But before that some people has been enjoying him for the his young age and all the world has enjoyed him for all these years. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. As the CRS leader comes up. Amen. Getting old is like climbing a mountain. Hallelujah. I thank God that this man was climbing permit mountain. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] The older he got, the higher he climbed, the wiser he became. The higher he climbed, the further he saw. The higher he went up the tower, the further he could see. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Y tabernacle. Can you say praise the Lord? Y tabernacle. [Applause] The older he got, he must have got out of breath. The higher he went. [Applause] The higher he went, the slower he might have gone, but as long as he went [Applause] higher. The higher the eagle goes, the further he [Music] sees. At 79, we want to tell the devil, he went higher and he looked further. [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, the better the view is. And we want to say, Apostle, enjoy the view. Apostle, tell us what's going on on the other side. The further you see, Apostle, tell us what's going to happen. the higher you [Music] go. Daddy, we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for all your labors. We thank you, Lord, for not giving up on us and fighting the fight.

Thank you for our pastor Lord. Thank you for keeping him Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, happy birthday, my apostle. There's a lady, a special lady that we would like to call the granddaughter of the apostle, the daughter of our senior pastor, Jonathan Rosco, Sister Esther. If she can come, let's give her a wonderful warm hand. [Applause] God bless you saints. We are gathered here today to honor a truly special man, a true man of God, a legend. A man, a man known in the heavens and known around this world. On behalf of the Rosco grandchildren, I'm truly honored as your first granddaughter to deliver a speech to our phenomenal grandfather. Today we the grandchildren have hearts full of gratitude for a man who has not only been our grandfather but also our apostle who has been a guiding light and a pillar of strength in our lives. Our grandfather is not just any man. He's a man of God. A true shepherd. A true shepherd who has dedicated his entire life to preaching the gospel, leading his flock and living out the word with unwavering faith and dedication. Through his sermons and his prayers and most importantly his example, he has shown us what it means to walk with God. The Bible says in Proverbs 13:22, \"A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children.\" Many measure inheritance in material wealth. But our grandfather has given us something far greater. The inheritance of the Holy Ghost, the good news. He has shown us that the greatest gift a man can pass down is not riches, but a life rooted in Christ. A legacy of faith and the power of the Holy Spirit working within us. Growing up under his influence has been a blessing beyond measure. His wisdom has shaped us. His prayers covered us. His love has given us strength to live each day with God on our side. Whether through a kind word, a firm lesson, or a simple moment of laughter, he has always reminded us that faith in God is not just something we speak about, but something we live by. Grandpa, your life has been a testimony of faithfulness, perseverance, unwavering trust in the Lord. You have taught us that no matter how difficult the journey, God is always in control, you have shown us what it means to serve with humility, love without conditions, and lead with a heart full of grace. Our family is blessed with many cherished testimonies that continue to deepen our faith in this great, glorious ministry. I too have a testimony. after countless persons to a few doctors. It was only through your prayers, grandpa, that opened my womb, leaving doctors confused and amazed, that I suddenly got to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see. And for that, I'm so thankful, Grandpa. All as a daily reminder that God can do miracles. [Music] The power of God has moved throughout our lives, each and every one of us in this family, pinpointing to the fact that God truly walks with you, grandpa. And we cannot deny it. [Applause] [Music] On behalf of all your grandchildren, we want to say thank you. Thank you for always thinking of us, your grandchildren. Thank you for this great and glorious ministry you've built. Thank you for building a school, a safe haven that molded us. Thank you for all the praise that is keeping us for your wisdom, for your love and for your and for your spiritual legacy you have given us. All we have is because of you grandpa. We are proud to be your grandchildren and we pray that God continues to bless you with strength, good health, and the joy in the Holy Ghost. The 79th birthday, thank you for everything, Grandpa. No amount of words or actions will truly describe what you mean to us. It's because of you that we can be who we the people we are today. We love you, Grandpa. We salute you. May God bless you abundantly and may you enjoy your special day with love from your grandchildren. God bless.

Money cannot buy that. [applause] Even the old people that are children that wanted to that played, it brought joy to us and we thank God for making it a success. and everybody that contributed their time, effort, energy to make this a success. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're looking at me like you know what's on this list. Amen. Then again, we want to thank God for this wonderful occasions we had with the woman's day.

You've never heard things like we heard at that man's camp. &gt;&gt; Let's just give a God's apostle a hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Then um I don't know if you remember I don't know if you forgot we had a concert here. I don't know if you remember highly successful And the apostle says, \"Looking forward for another one in 2026.\" In a few hours when we eat 20, he's looking forward to another one. The sisters that cook the whole year and for the special meetings. There are people here that do things that you don't know. They slip here on the side and they cook and they move. All that you do, you eat. You don't know who they are that cooked for you. Give them a hand. Amen. Special meetings all over. We went, food was provided. We were in Richmond. They had food provided. Short notice, but people are on the ball. People want to do something. Then again, this year, I don't know about you, El Tabernacle, but these media guys on the cameras, they took us to another level. I don't know if you see the clips and the videos and the preaching. It's on another level. Can we stand up and give them a hand? And the reason why I want you to stand up and give them a hand, they travel the country to record the man of God. And the reason you need to give them a hand, it's easy to buy data to look it on your coach than to travel to the real live meeting. They make it possible for you to relax and watch it at home. Give them a hand. Give them a hand. [music] And they're doing such a good job that every so-cal message Pentecostal is on our stream because they doing a good job. Edgar and Edgar and the people behind it. Amen. They doing a good job. My father says they're just special. &gt;&gt; Servicing the whole world. Apostle says they servicing the whole world. Keeping the voice in this church alive. God's voice alive. Then we want to thank brother Israel, brother Daniel, brother Lost, all the L tabernacle worers that work in the unseen every time to keep us going here. Can we give them a hand? [music] Can you give them a hand? I'm out of cater out of notes but use a spoiled man. Yellow man says kabad. You need to get one of those message pastors and you'll see what it is what you have. Let's give the man on the tower a hand. It's not just running this place. Having a vision for this place every time takes a special man. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't get happy for a man and run after a man here. Any man in the church. Look who anointing that man. &gt;&gt; There's a man anointing people here. [applause] Then we want to thank the school. It's still standing. You know you here but the whole year there's people on the sides here. A school every day every year since we started the school is still here. Not God in the prison only. God in the school. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; We want to thank the principal, the vice principal, the teachers, and every worker here. They work every day to keep the school going. And you know how many made it because of this El Tabernacle. We gave up on the school, but God did not give up on. And by God's grace, we're going to open up again 2026. You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. [music] I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school. All the grandchildren made it because God had a school. &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the principal. And behind that, thank the God of the apostle. The apostle saw it through for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [music] through that school and everything. Be patient with Edgar Roscoll. &gt;&gt; Be patient with him. &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. [music] Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. [cheering] That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. [applause] &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] And then for the first time this year &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the people from far cleaned this place not as visitors. &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors. They cleaned the hostels and wherever they were the yard, the kitchen not as visitors. They told us now we are El Tabernacle. Let's give them a hand. It's clean around here because people feel that this is their place. I'm almost done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then at this time I would like to where's brother Lloyd Ptorius. &gt;&gt; I don't see him. He's here. But we want to wish him happy birthday. Then in a few hours, Sister Jasmine, happy birthday. The 1st of January. Sister Darie, Pastor Edgar's wife, happy birthday from the church, the apostle and the family. Sister Esther, happy birthday. Sister Myra, happy birthday. And whoever birthday it is today or tomorrow or whatever, happy birthday. We are ready to receive the man of God. Do you appreciate the man of God? There will never be a thing like this ever again. Enjoy it, church. God bless you. [applause] Good evening and welcome back to E News Network, your trusted [music] source for uplifting, inspiring, and informative news across Eban. I'm Rosanne [music] Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [music] [music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying [music] and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone [music] revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. [music] On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, [music] the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in [music] Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, [music] the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question [music] and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and [music] preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh [music] seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year. Are you an expectation for the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco?

[applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how [clears throat] friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey [music] your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. [applause] [music] He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. [applause] I knew how to dress [cheering] [music] [applause] and I had them flocking after me. Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. [applause] He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend [applause] boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. And I said to myself, \"So far, my friend.\" Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? I cornered him [applause] [music] one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned [music] it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause and cheering] [music] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [cheering and applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't find his body [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. [cheering] [applause] His old life is gone. Christina &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Because I hated myself. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. [applause] &gt;&gt; Who can save me? [cheering] Hallelujah. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers?

[cheering] &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. [applause] &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, \"Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer.\" [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. [applause] &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision [applause] &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does [applause and cheering] thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [cheering] So remember, I say I hope. [applause] &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready [applause] &gt;&gt; to move. [cheering] [applause] I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] [cheering] It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? [applause] It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a [cheering] big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [cheering] on the wall. [applause] [cheering] [applause] And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Every service [cheering] she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. [cheering] [applause] She didn't set stone [cheering] and let it pass by. She grabbed it. [cheering] Every service and now there is no oil. [cheering] [applause] Hey, [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; The oil is here. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [applause and cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; that [applause] that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] love. Hallelujah. [cheering] There [applause] [cheering] [applause] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, gets closed, [cheering] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. [cheering] [applause] He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins was panomites. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. [cheering] You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, \"Come into the ark.\" That means that God was already in the ark. [cheering and applause] Does that mean [applause] if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? [cheering] [cheering] Yes. Yes. Yeah. [cheering] Heat. Heat. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. [applause] &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, \"Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us [cheering] [applause] and here we are tonight. [cheering] The door was open to us. [cheering] The oil came and made us walk into the door. [cheering] [applause] Aren't you happy? [cheering] You didn't sit outside the door. [applause] You walked into the door [cheering] and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. [cheering] Come in and sap with me. [cheering] Come into the wedding supper. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil [cheering] because the oil is here. [cheering] I claim it. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, \"Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But [cheering] but right here. [cheering] Look at the oil flowing. [cheering] And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[cheering] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat up [cheering] [cheering] [applause] here. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] That makes 6,000 years. And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody [cheering] to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. [laughter] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] [applause] Heat.

[cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, \"Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa.\" I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, \"Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, \"Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth.\" &gt;&gt; I said, \"It's finished. The door's closed.\" [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Shot. [cheering] [applause] It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And listen, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, [cheering] &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. [applause] &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. [cheering] [cheering] May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. [cheering] May he come here tonight [cheering] and make you a murderer. [cheering] May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. [cheering] [applause] Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle.

[applause] And as it rained, you know what the rain done? [applause and cheering] The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; The rain took the word [cheering] and lifted it up. Oh, [applause] [cheering] [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] thank you. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, [cheering] the spirit of the Lord raises you up. [cheering] This is my bride. Yes, she is. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You lifted up in the message. [cheering] They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. [cheering] And they say there's no church like your church. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work [cheering] amongst the Gentiles. Then only [applause and cheering] Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east [cheering] putting a mark, the seal of God [cheering] onto the 144,000, [applause] but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil.

I take my stand. [cheering] Oh, [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] heat, heat. [screaming] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church [cheering] &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. [cheering] The ceiling angel in at the rostel [cheering] seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. [cheering] Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah.

[cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Just go to Genesis 18. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Where is the greater works, [cheering] &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. [cheering] [applause] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my.

[cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The wise version says, \"We can't give you our oil.\" [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Let's read. All &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, [cheering] &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, [cheering] the oil. Again. &gt;&gt; Again. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But the children in this house [cheering] &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because [cheering] [applause] [cheering] a champagne epic. Champagne epic. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, [cheering] &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time [cheering] when the door of longsuffering gets some close. [applause] And this is not the time for the door to open. [cheering] This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. [cheering] [applause] Are you locked in? &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And a door, [cheering] a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth [cheering] [applause] dynamics and [cheering] &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. [cheering] And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Have you got the seven thunders? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; You can open the door. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And you can [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my [applause] [cheering] hallelujah. [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; \"Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. [applause] &gt;&gt; And a voice says, \"Come up higher.\" Brian, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. [cheering] Come up higher. [cheering and applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, \"Come in.\" Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. [cheering] [applause] You had a body change [cheering] &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed.

[cheering] [applause] Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here [applause and cheering] that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And the bridegroom said to her, \"Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Get out [applause] [cheering] [applause] friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message [cheering] &gt;&gt; and the door tonight [cheering and applause] is shut. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Will the pianos come? [applause] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [cheering] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, [cheering] he's standing right next to you now. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You speak to him. [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza [applause] where the Jews are finishing the thing off.

[applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] Lord, [music] [applause] [music] [music] thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; as I finish off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. You can't even save your children's soul. The foolish virgin said a half an hour to fill up and it didn't fill up. And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. A murderous confession. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Don't get too big for your boots [applause] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, to kill the flesh. It's time that you search yourself before we go into this new year. A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. Children listens to us. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. [applause] Search me. [applause] Oh Lord, I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [applause] [music] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this [music] day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, \"When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close [music] this eyes, you're going to find me here. &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice [music] that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps is God's word. [applause] [music] [applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [applause] Wouldn't you like to kill yourself tonight? [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? [singing] &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let's commit suicide. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause and music] [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. [music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [music] are shut. And the wise virgin says, \"I [music] cannot give you any oil. I just got enough for myself.\" Brother Oscar, why don't you [music] go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. [music and applause] Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the [music] door is shut. Brother Jonathan &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let [music] [singing] me see. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Search [singing] me, [music] oh God, and [music] all [singing] my today. [music] [singing] Oh, [music] save. [singing] Oh [music and singing] my go [music] see [music] the be some [music and singing] Bring the light in me. [singing and music] Amen. [singing] Set [music] me free. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody? It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my kill myself. There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be and Oh son. Oh God, [music] my heart [music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, \"No, that's not for me. Somebody else.\" But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [singing] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay? You feel okay? It's fine. You'll feel &gt;&gt; I'll be your next year then you [music] &gt;&gt; say anybody I don't want to be a preacher tonight that expects you to worship and I don't worship when God speaks. [music] I don't want to be like that. I want to tell you, but I'm not doing help the preacher tonight. Lord, tabernacle, it's later than what you think it is. [music] I believe the spirit spoke plainly tonight. It was not it was plainly speaking to us. He that has an ear, let him hear what God told you to know. Thank you. Spirit to the earth. Lord, speak to me. We are staring. [music] I sing to you strange. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. So lovely. Please. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. Okay. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat.

I wonder precious brother Ignatius come to read us the scripture for the communion. Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, [music] he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give [screaming] me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. [crying] When he has supper, saying, \"This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord [music] unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so [music] let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat [music] tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest [music] will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. [applause] Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Thank you Lord that we can come and break bread with thee tonight Lord. Father Lord when the world does not know Lord Jesus. Father Lord what they have missed out Lord Jesus the greatest thing that they have missed which is the Holy Ghost Lord. Father Lord tonight it is the Holy Ghost Lord that has called us to the tree of life Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, where we can have eternally suck with thee, Lord, may you bless, Lord Jesus. Father, the breaking of the bread, Lord, may you come, Lord Jesus, Father, and just Lord Jesus, make a way, Father, as we partake, Lord Jesus, of your table tonight, Lord, Father, that it will strengthen us, Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, that it will keep us, Lord. And the apostles said, Lord, Father, that it will keep us, Lord, in this day, Lord Jesus. May you bless the table, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, as we Lord, partake, Lord, and as we've examined ourselves, Lord, that we will not partake unworthily, Lord Jesus, but Lord, that we've examined ourselves, Lord, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and have your way now, Lord, and bless this table, we ask it in Jesus precious and mighty name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. [applause] Amen. We're going to start with the communion. We're going to do it rowbyrow and we request that everybody be reverent.

[cheering] [music] [applause] Amen. Bowheads and close our eyes. Oh great eternal heavenly father Lord, how can we close a champagne epic such as this tonight? Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God. May you just bless us with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we pray Lord for our precious apostle that you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father, like never before, Lord. We've never seen a man such as this. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us an odd pole. Thank you for sending us a man that we can see right through the footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray Lord that you'd restore all the virtue that has left his body. Remember our precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco family, Lord. God, bless and undertake for them even the more, Lord. May the same fullness that dwells upon the father dwell upon each and every one of them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord, may it reach from the head down to the beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even down to the skirts. And may we just be filled with more of that rain that Apostle says should fall upon us, heavenly father. May it rain so much upon us until we lose trace of our flesh in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may you take our flesh so deep in the sea of forgetfulness until we cannot even go and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this beautiful service. May you bless each and everyone that is here. And may we depart Lord in your shakina glory. We ask it not by might, not by power, but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the apostle in your infallible name of [music] Jesus King God. Amen and amen. Amen.

the pit than anywhere else I don't think there's a pastor that's uh so much in the poopit like uh I am that's why I read that quotation scripture where Paul says I labored more than them all and um I can't stop laboring I'm a workaholic Hallelujah I like my [Applause] job you may be seated amen I am I said I'm going to come this Wednesday to make this clip um about the quotation that brother Sol renica gave us and gave me um that he said he's got the quote where brother Brenham said um you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and although I told him there is no quote because since 1979 I was was nailing this thing down and if and I call it the Cod and if had a quot you would have blasted me if Gideon had the quot you would have blasted me Beckett had a quote and the whole world went after that quote somewhere in the world would have blasted me and put that quote up and I told him there is no quote like that and then he made a mistake to say that no no received the Holy Ghost without Sensations I said there only one it says this is a Time page 32 and if it's that quote you don't send it to me I got the quote I say you don't have the quote you know so for all these years I've been nailing the thing down and I was shocked that he said he's got a quote and that's why I said I'll give you two weeks and one Wednesday I will come and say whether there is a court like that or whether there is not a court like that and I ask all the the brainy guys you know in in U in elano you know the engineers and uh and and and and the guys with the diplomas from the University you see I come from u a spiritual University and um we gave it two weeks from two we Wednesday when I had a confrontation with him and they've been searching and I asked a few pastors and they told me we're not even going to look because there's nothing like that you know so they just switched me off uh immediately we're not going to waste our time you know there's nothing like that so um finally today is two weeks is up and none of the brainy guys the university guys could find a quote like that so there is no quote like that and another clever guy in the message with us you know that guy very clever in school he came first most of the time you know and he also went through University and he says uh Pastor uh I also looked but I can't find it I said well then I was right for all this years since 1979 so s REO was lying again he lied playing down he lied and you can see that hits of uh the combine I think it's going to 8,000 now and you know you got to times that by bang bang bang because most of them don't listen to it alone so are we near the time that we take it off because we take it off if the hits is above six then we take it off because then we know know the whole world has heard it so um I think the whole world has heard it and I think they're going to sit him flat on that one and also I can understand now why he sits at Will's church because he never danced in his life he never woried he never shouted he never jumped in his life I never seen him do that here I never saw him do it at Raymond's I never saw him do it in tukum serus the only thing he done was to to go against the pits went against my pit went against Raymond's pit went against tok's pit and then also if he feels that uh a minister cannot tell him anything then he leaves and he going sits in the car my wife used to get a fit for that thing and out in tukum I believe Georgie also done the same thing now who the heck are they and they know nothing sir I have never given a guy a hiding a spanking like I gave Sol renica [Music] he came the worst of of them all and he had to start lying you know when you when you get a guy in a corner he's either going to admit or he's going to lie to get out of the corner and I hope that Raymond Thompson told him that he never bought the tape and Ne neither the tape recorders you see the thing that God gave me in Revelations 10:8 nobody had it to think that this Mighty God kept this thing a secret he kept his mouth closed and then he revealed it after he broke it he revealed it to the prophet Revelations 10:7 then nobody saw anything it was on white granite rock then 2023 he says now come on Edgar check that rock and it's still bursting I don't have any time that angel keep me busy telling you I'm busy some sometimes was awake I'm you know I am awake between 2: and 4: in the morning since a young man and I'm an old man I still wake up that time amen you know I sometimes ask mhari to to phone me when I have to get up early and then uh the time she phone I already had a shower I already dressed I'm starting to make myself coffee you know but just in case my age you know will let me that day sleep a little late but it hasn't happened yet so I never disappointed you in praying for you between 2: and 4: in the morning I pray for El tle I never fail and now now now that's all the grace of God it's not me it's God Amen so um he tried to stop it you know and you you'll hear uh the end of the month sir I just finished the messages I got messages until August it's laying it's finished and the end of the month one you'll hear me say there and show you uh when the lion roars who can but prophesy he doesn't say the prophets prophesy he says the who Edgar Osco will hear the Roar of the Lion you watch the end of the month or we're going to preach on that and I'm going to have a prayer line the end of the month he told me to with that message I must have a prayer line so the end of the month we're going to have a prayer line it's going to be announced you know so he says who can stop them after the lon law nobody can stop me not even Sol Rica am man he's nothing he never can you know he thought he stopped me with a split but here I am I'm better of than when he was here he thought he'll stop me at sao's funeral when he walked up out him and his wife as I walked towards the podium he walked out he thought he was going to stop me and I laughed Within Myself he said said that you know I left because I couldn't see the seven Thunders being the Seven Virtues but El Li he Li he walked out by Raymond maybe not believing the seven Thunders seven verges but he didn't leave Raymond chased him away and one of the brothers was in the church and he was hardly in his car and that brother phoned me to say hey man Raymond chase this guy away like a dog I said but how did he look he says the only way I can describe it is a dog with his tail between his legs that's how Sol can walk out of Raymond's church then Raymond looked and he saw this brother in my church sitting there then he says I don't even care if you're going to tell Edgar Rosco because I'm not Edgar Rosco s and you people that sitting here that that that that likes him someone walk out with him that's how he chased Sol away and then I I asked the brothers then who got up and walked out with him he says nobody not not I didn't see anybody walk out with him he walked out alone the professor now the professor is going to be taught by little boys in the message is going to finish him now you don't come up against anointed of God so that I needed to tell the church because I said tonight I am going to and um we couldn't find the tape the the quot and you that's going to listen to me on this clip right around the world as you all are listening to me anyhow you know yeah it's quite something man you all know Sol R Canal so he's not that guy that he keeps himself you know even I was waiting for Jonathan to be born for 2 years you know and after 2 years she only fell pregnant and uh I read the book of Jude and I was really impressed with the with the book of Jude because it's the book before Revelations so I said if I get a boy I'm going to name his name Jude and Jonathan came and he was a boy and I was going to call his named Jude and so Reno went to my mother-in-law and said Jude means Judas and my mother-in-law came up against me and says you're not going to name your son Jude and that's why we changed judee's uh Jonathan's name uh from Jude to Jonathan because of Sol renica and then what happened was uh I looked at this guy and says man Edgar rosu don't get stopped I said if I get the next boy nobody but is going to stop itall I'm a hell of a station masterj when Jude got born I said welcome home Jude nobody stopped me now Jude does mean the other word is Judas but the main word for Jude is Judah the line of the tribe of Judah and here that lion is roaring of Judah in E Tabernacle and S can't take it

I went to his house but the Holy Ghost is gone. I came to his house and Holy Ghost is gone. But I tried to leave something behind us. [Music] Now there is a beast that's taken my brain. You can put me to bed, but you can't feel my pain. You could put me to bed, but you can't bear my pain. Leaving the soul from the I'm just trying. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus God. [Music] is free but the [Music] holy cost more than our [Music] bra come by simply it's so hard to read the future ahead it's already and it's time to leave hunting behind in the footprints of Jesus [Music] King. Now I've got this feeling that I'm still at the shore and my pockets don't know what it means to be poor. I can get through the wall if you give me a door. All the doors is closed. It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus King. Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere and you're not going to find it. It's a mental [Music] break. It's locked up from those who hurry ahead. It's time to leave something behind the foot of Jesus [Applause] God. All the money and the ceiling is hard [Music] to when my son stands as a statue of God. He will know what I [Music] meant. Try to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd Like I'd like to take a scripture out of St. John 1. It's 46, 47, and 48. And Nathaniel said unto him, \"Can there any good thing come out of the El Tabernacle? Philip saith unto him, \"Come and see if something good is in Al Teabernc.\" [Applause] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him. Yes. Amen. and sayith unto him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed in whom is no G.\" [Music] Then Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knoweth thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, \"Before that film called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee.\" Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. May our past catch up with our future [Music] as Nathaniel's past caught up in his future. [Music] I do pray that you'd undertake for us. Lord, on my birthday, I wanted church. and you gave it to me. What a boom day present. Church. Thank you that I could be in church with people that was there. with me in the confidence to celebrate the gift that you gave Lord. What a gift. Pray that you'd undertake for us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I will take a title from there. I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] I just want to leave on this birthday something behind. Nathaniel asked him the question, \"Since when do you know me?\" He says, \"When you were in a fig under the fig tree the other day, Now the minute you say I leave something behind, it means that you showed to the past. So Nathaniel, it might have been a couple of days ago in the past. I saw you, but now your past has caught up with your future. And I want to say El Tabernacle, your past has caught up with you in this future that you're living in tonight. Brother Brandham says, \"If you weren't there in the beginning, in the past, you're never going to be there in the future.\" And that is what it is. I'll leave something behind. And brother Brandham took a song on the wings of a snow white dove and he add words to that song that was on the hip parade [Applause] and he put himself in that song. Though I have suffered, in many ways I cried for healing, he took that song and he pleaded on the wings of a snow white dove. Brother Brandham, when he got near his wife and they were laying on the bed, Amen. And he looked into our eyes and he wanted to serenate her. Amen. He wanted to have a loving evening. And then the prophet will take that song. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are blue. It takes a song. And then and then he preached a whole message. Loving he loved me. dying. He saved me a whole song. He takes that and he starts preaching a message on it. So I tonight want to take this song in all that I tried to do for 79 years. I was just trying to leave something behind. Everybody leaves something behind. Don't care who you are, bad or good, you leave something behind. Some leaves big wolves behind with a lot of money, but they leave something behind. Others leaves a lot of credit behind, but you leave something behind. Others leave legacies, great legacies, but you leave something behind. Others leaves disappointments and that too you leave [Applause] behind. The thing you leave behind become a memory. People remembers. Look at every funeral you attend. They will come and says, \"Well, he did this and this and this.\" What they left something behind. Memories gets left behind. And from memories it become history. And history makes memorials [Applause] because you just left something behind. The great guys of yesterday year left something behind. [Applause] They always leave something behind, something that people could remember them by. Jenkins Khn left something behind. Alexander the Great left something behind. Napoleon Bonapart left something behind. Hitler left something behind. Pelle left something behind. Jack Nicholas with a golf left something behind. You can be a great guy, you're going to leave something behind. You can be a nobody and yet you're going to leave something behind. soul. William Brennham. Yes. Amen. When he cried out, I'm going to leave this Bible for Joseph. Brother Brennan left something behind. Brother Brennham when he took the cloud and he turned the cloud and he said this will go down in history what did he do? He left something behind. Amen. Amen. The pillar of fire that was at the back of his head. Amen. That's hanging all over where you went and go. What was that? He left something behind. All the mysteries of the entire Bible, every nuke, every corner in the Bible, he revealed it. What did he do? He put it on tape because he wanted to leave something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he says, \"I have to go to my father, but I'll send you a comforter.\" He left something behind. He said, he said, \"I must go so that he can come because I'm leaving him behind to lead you into all truth.\" Yes, he left something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he took his final step and he looked back, he saw footprints on the sands of time that's leading to the promised land. What did he do? I can't hear you. What did he do? He left footprints behind. He left something behind. He left something for you to follow. He left something for you to to be guided because he left something behind. [Music] Oh my [Applause] Paul left something behind. So if anybody comes and says seven thunders and seven virtues let him be a curse because even if it's an angel because I left something behind. [Applause] And then I came [Music] to this place. I went before the beginning. I went in the beginning and I end from the beginning. [Applause] [Music] Woo! Hallelujah. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yes. Yes. Yes. I went before the beginning and I came out to a place before the beginning at the great conference of God. And there we were sitting. Amen. In the great conference of God. And here God saw the deceitfulness of Satan before Satan was actually created. God save our souls already. Took the lamb and slay the lamb. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] And I look 3.5 billion years ago and God formed the earth 3.5 billion years ago. And as he forms the earth, the ones names that was in the lamb's book of life, they were there already. And they looked at him creating the earth. And the Bible says in the book of Job, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy when he laid the foundation, I just want to leave something behind. I don't think Lucifer wanted to hear that one. And the sons of God was shouting for joy. And right now, tonight, God's got another man that makes the sons and the daughters of God shout for joy for a new creation. I just wanted to leave something behind. And while while we were shouting, while we were screaming, while we were drunk in the spirit, Lucifer didn't like it. and it caused trouble in heaven. And God says, \"Any man that makes trouble in my church, I kick him out.\" And I saw Lucifer fall down. How have I fallen on Lucifer? And we're kicking him out here tonight because the sons of God is here tonight. Heat. Heat. Thank you. Yeah. [Applause] When I preached that, hallelujah. When I preach that, what did you do, brother Rosco? I just wanted to leave something behind and God made in Eden and I see him drop down in Eden. Lucifer in the body of the serpent a handsome man. The Bible call him a cherubam. Which cherubam? The man cheruban. The one with the face of a man. He was thrown out. Amen. Into the Garden of Eden. And I look at this cherubam. Amen. A man, a serpent. And then I saw what that serpent could do. The weakness of a man. That's why God had to destroy him because Eve would have ran after him all the time and God slayed him. Then I saw evolution coming right up to the serpent. Lord, I saw the chimpanzee. I saw the H Highleberg man. I saw the Nebraska man. I saw the Bolton down man. I saw the peeking man. I saw the neon grateral man. I see the cro-Magnum man. And then I see the serpent man. And then I see the modern man. Amen. Adam. But also then I saw the real man, the only man, the son of man. I just wanted to leave something behind. And I hear a prophet says there'll come a man one time and he'll preach evolution and nobody in the message preach evolution, but he send a boy that is a man. Now I just wanted to [Music] leave something behind. And finally the man came. When he came He was full of blood, thorns on his head. And he stood in front of Pilate. And Pilate looked at him and he looked at this congressman and he says, \"Behold the man, the only man I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] Brother Brennham was compelled to come to South Africa 1951. There was a reason why he came because there was a little boy [Applause] And that little boy has become a man. And now he just want to leave something behind. That the prophet laid hands on this head. I just wanted to leave something [Music] behind. Sitting in my study, here come a letter from Billy Paul. And in the letter, Billy Paul says, \"Edgar Roscoll, I only listen to my father and you because you got a very fine spirit. I just wanted to leave something behind. From brother Brandham to Billy Paul, from Billy Paul to brother Higginson, the head deacon of Brennham tabernacle and he came into the sanctuary and he felt the anointing and he said the anointing that's here was the same anointing when brother Brandham preached the same the scripture. is fulfilled and this day the scripture is fulfilled. I just wanted to leave something behind from brother Brandham to Billy Paul to the head deacon of Brandham Tabernacle. knows that something has been left behind. El tabernacle, even Jeffersonville had to acknowledge there's going to come somebody that's going to leave something behind. I can't help who I am because I was chosen to leave something behind. Will brother Stephford come up please? Brother [Music] Steph and this cherubam was walking in the garden of Eden. That's why When we hear we devil chasing. Amen. You sisters that don't respect your husband, we one of these days are going to put you out of the church. Your husbands that don't love your wives, we're going to put you out of the church [Applause] because there is somebody that God said leave something behind. Brother Stephen, will you just give them the testimony so that we can just leave it behind. Thank you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Amen. The apostle just wants me to share a short testimony with you. Amen. I was working in this company and in one of our subsidiary companies was a colored guy and this guy wanted an appointment with me and every time he comes to my office I wasn't available and then I said to my PA I said listen just schedule this appointment with this guy. tell him when he comes we make an appointment and I'll see him. So he came and he came under the guise of wanting career advice. But really I could hear when we started to talk. He said he knows I'm a Christian. He knows where I serve El Tabernacle. He knows my apostle Edgar Rosco. So I said to this guy, his name is Nathan Operman. So I said, \"Nathan, how do you know my apostle?\" He says, \"Brother Stephford, let me tell you something.\" He says, \"My father is like a bishop in the AFM church.\" And around the late 70s, I think around 1977, Kenneth Hagen came to South Africa and he had an audience with Kenneth Hagen, his father Andrew Operman. And this young boy Nathan, he went with his father and he was sitting there when Kenneth Hagen spoke to his father. And Kenneth Hagen said to his father, that was around 1977 when he came to South Africa. He said, \"You need to associate yourself with a man by the name of Edgar Rosco. He said that man carries the power of God. And you know as we were talking it only became clear to me. So I told him about the church and all that but it only the puzzle came together only later when his father put in his will that when he dies the apostle must bury him. [Applause] So, this was something phenomenal to me and we wanted to get it on tape and we spoke to him and he said, \"No, we'll do it. It'll come on tape.\" But by the time we wanted to finalize it, he had stage four cancer and within 4 days after speaking to me, he passed away. But his father was buried by the apostle and we all know the rest is history what happened at that service. So to the man of God we salute you and we want to say happy birthday pastor. You definitely left something behind. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Now that's the same man that Sol Ranica and them was under that was his mentor. Every Tuesday they had studies with Andrew Oppaman and Andrew Oppaman's got a better chance than Solar Renica. Exactly. And I do not know Kenneth Copelan and all those guys, but you know, God does things like this just to leave something behind. What fruit is on the tree? One of the elders said to John the bride, hallelujah, part in El Tabernacle. told you, \"Weep not. You're safe. Weep not, John. You're safe. Just follow the footsteps that's left behind. And I asked the Holy Ghost, who is that elder? And nobody ever mentioned it. And it came down that elder is none else than Paul because Paul was in the third heaven and Paul saw the lamb there that takes away the sons of the world and he cried out, \"Don't cry. The line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. And I came and told you now I leave something behind. Oh my. And that anointed cherubam. It reminds me of the two cherubams that's on the ark. On the one side, the face of a man and on the other side, the face of a lion. Now, you never heard this in a message. They know nothing. Who's that? Two cherubams. Face of a man and a face of a lion. couldn't have been anybody else because the lion of the tribe of Judah has become a man and he poured out his blood on the mercy seat. Hallelujah. I'm just leaving something behind. That was not good enough. I just want to young people. I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Thank you. I was laying in my bed in Jerusalem. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how beautiful is your mountains. And when David saw it, he says, \"I lift up my eyes towards the mountains where from my strength come.\" I was lying in between the mountains of Jerusalem and he came down and he told me, \"You're not going outside seeing today.\" I said, \"Lord, why can't I go out today?\" Said, \"You s and you read Revelations 10.\" I said, \"But I I know Revelations 10. It's my bread and my butter, Lord.\" He said, \"You stay behind in Jerusalem.\" I went down. And I said, \"Lovey, I can't go out. I can't go sightseeing. I can't go out with you. I must stay.\" He told me to read a Revelation 10. And they left and I was in the room alone between the mountains that David saw. And shortly here round about 11:00 I think my strength came from the mountains. And as I read Revelations 10, I saw that the Bible says, \"And when the seven thunders uttered there,\" he says, \"Stop there.\" You said that's that's a word that you couldn't spell. When you spell there, you spell it t h e r e. But this is t h e i r. This is human beings. And if the seven thunders are there is seven human beings. And what is utter? Utter means speech. What is utter means preaching. He says the seven thundersu is the seven messengers of the seven church ages and the revelation came down where my strength come. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] Oh my [Music] [Applause] And then [Applause] to 20 24, he said, pick up Revelations 10 again and read it through. I must still come back and preach the entire Bible folded in Revelations 10. It might it might be the whole year. I don't know. And I started to read it verse by verse. And I came to Revelations 10:8. And I saw Brother Bram says, \"That's the bride.\" He said, \"But now watch now. It's the bride. But the sisters is in the bride, too. But they don't prophesy. It's only men that prophesy. So it must be in the five-fold ministry that prophesy.\" And I he said to me, \"Now, who in the five-fold ministry is prophesying again?\" And I wasn't ashamed to tell him Edgar Rosco Revelations 10:8. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] And then he gave me Revelations 22 to hook up with Revelations 10:8. Amen. John, see that you don't seal up the prophecy. Now, how could he not seal up the prophecy if he's not going to prophesy again? The only way to keep it open, preach on it for a whole year. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Then I went around the world in a message and all that I heard the word. The word the word the word spokes quotes the word. And I said, \"Lord, there's something wrong here.\" And then he spoke to my heart. He says, \"Edgar, there's four parts to the word.\" [Applause] Oh, I said, \"Lord, which four parts?\" He says, \"The written word don't save you.\" Everybody preach it. The spoken word don't save you. That's for third Paul. Squirrels. The revealed word don't save you. The minute he says flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you, Peter, the next verse says God told him, \"Get behind me, Satan. That don't save you.\" But what saves you? The living manifested word is the only thing that saves you. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Amen. The loving word saves you. Why? Amen. Then he opens the Bible for me. He says, \"Some seeds fall on rocky places. That don't save you. Other seeds fall in between thorns and it gets choked. That don't save you. other word word word falls on dry places that don't save you. So it's not word word but the word that falls on good ground that saves you. Four parts to the word of God. I just want to leave something behind. And then another thing that made me sick is whenever I go, brother, you got to love, man. You got to love, brother. You know, Brother Rosco's got no love. You know, there's no love. Nothing. Amen. And then I walked up and I found in the message rejected King. Brother Brandham says the Holy Ghost is love. [Music] [Applause] Then I found out that the book of Galatians says love is only a fruit of the spirit. Not the spirit is the fruit of love. Love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Cannot be any other way. only a fruit. Only a fruit. Then I read Romans 5:5. Could you read it with me? Romans 5:5. How does the love come into your heart? So without the Holy Ghost, no love. [Music] There is seven steps of love. Which love are you talking about? Amen. My Lord. Amen. And amen. Lord. Hey. Then he sings on the wings of the snow. White. What is the white dove? He says, \"And love is on the wings of a dove to the wings of the Holy Ghost.\" Oh, and then I read in the Bible, there's only a time to love. You can't laugh all the time. When are you going to get a re a time to rebuke? When are you going to get a time to hate sin? And there's only a time to laugh. But you want to laugh all the time. When Jesus knocked them out of the temple, where was love? [Applause] Hey, I just wanted to leave something behind. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The 1979 I walk into the classroom still under the umbrella of the teeth the Holy Ghost without emotions. And when I went in there and preached for 10 minutes chairs went through the window, sisters got slain. The hallelujah and the glory to God was like they shouted for joy. And the Holy Ghost fell from 79 until now. And it never stop. And it won't stop. I won't let it stop because I'm leaving something behind. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh my. Can I have another few moments? that I heard the other day. They said the initial evidence is when the word of God says, \"Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?\" And then they turn around believe what the message for your day. They said, \"That's the evidence.\" Now, the Holy Ghost told me that's right. Did you believe the word for your day since you received the Holy Ghost. They say that's it. But my problem is is dancing in the word, is shouting in the word, is being drunk in the word. Then why don't you believe it and do it? You're a liar. Faith without works is dead. I just wanted to leave something behind. Listen, then Phil thief came when the Holy Ghost poured out in Al tabernacle and he came and he said the Holy Ghost with no emotions. Now there is no quote for that but put that back in the Bible. Where are they going to put it? I know where it is. And I told you where it is. Acts chapter 2, there came a rushing mighty wind, the Holy Ghost. No emotions. It fell up the house. No emotions. They were sitting. No emotions. They had cloven tongues over their heads. no emotions. But after that, the Bible says, \"And they received the Holy Ghost and emotions came.\" Oh, put it back in the Bible. I just want to I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Oh my And then I thought, brother, I thought that I'm screaming. I'm shouting. I am dancing. I'm getting drunk. I'm acting stupid. I thought it it's me. And then I picked up a quote. Brother Graham says it's not you. Is the angel of God inside of you shouting, screaming, dancing. It's not you who's screaming there. I see the angels of God. And then we came back and we took the quote to brother B says turn the cloud to your right side. turn it to the right side the cloud. And then I read he says he's got a wig on. And then I saw he say it's the judge. [Applause] 1963 it's the judge. Do you know that we already judged by the word of the prophet? So, we're not going to the white throne because the white throne is the word of God judging. But the judge already came. And I see a a prophet said, \"I'm making this tabernacle a courthouse.\" [Applause] Hallelujah. He made his church a courthouse. And he says, \"I will start preaching warning and judgment.\" And after he preached warning and judgment, he preached, \"Now I already warned you. I indict you now.\" And after he preached indictment, he went around and preached trial, trial, trial, trial, trial. Five trials. And after he preached five trials, he put them in prison. Souls in prison. They in prison now can never get the Holy Ghost anymore. Why the judge is here? I just wanted to leave something behind. I save you from the prison. I pull the prison bars open. [Applause] Oh, then I preached the seven dimensions [Applause] and I preached Saturday is here. What happened Saturday? He went into the prison in the first dimension of hell and he preached in season and out of season. Out of season, Noah's day in his season, his day and they didn't repent. And after he preached, nobody got saved. It was the third pool. And then he went down to the third dimension of hell. And he rearranged Satan. Even his own devils didn't recognize him. He set captivity captive. He triumphed over the devil. He kicked the devil back into hell again. Saturday is here. Then that same Saturday, the blessed the saints under the sixth dimension. And it wasn't sixth dimension. It was paradise. heard him calking and talking to the thief that was on the cross next to him. And he told the thief, \"Don't worry. Watch these doors open.\" And he came to the doors. He said, \"Open up your [Applause] doors.\" And the angel says, \"Who are you?\" He says, \"I'm the Lord mighty in battle. I conquered hell. I conquered death. And I conquered the grave. [Music] Oh my. So, I'm nearly there. My brother, my sister, you can't put me to bed. You can't put me to bed. Because you can't feel my pain. You can put me to bed, but you'll never know my pain. Pain for 59 years in a message. All the different talks against me. Blessed is the man that when they speak all men of evil against him for my name's sake. You do not know my pain. You can put me to bed, but you don't know my pain. Oh my. I'm nearly closing. I can't get through the wall of these churches in the message. That's right. It's true. Hallelujah. Unless they open the door. But all the doors are closed. And they got the Holy Ghost outside. I can't get through their walls unless they open the door. Paul said, \"All have forsaken me.\" Brother Bram says, \"I'm alone.\" When you're a man of God, you are alone. Money is free. Everybody can get a dollar right up to a billion dollars. Money is free. But the Holy Ghost cost more than your natural bread. Simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the Holy Ghost. He didn't have enough money. Money is free, but the Holy Ghost costs more. Money is free, and the Holy Ghost is too far up the ceiling to reach. [Applause] [Music] Oh, the future head is already dead. Lord, it's already dead. because he's painted to a thread. The Pope is on his dying days. Trump is running wild around the world. Money is getting scarce. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus, King God. I'm trying to leave it behind. So you can go leave and say goodbye. But here I'll stay in El Tabernacle. I'm not going anywhere because I left something behind. You can lie to me with all those spoken word books that you don't love. Exactly. I can't follow you to the end of the world with all that false doctrines. Why not rightly dividing the word? Making the word of God to none effect. Mis consting the word. Misinterpreting the word. Dislocating the word. Add to the word seven thunders seven virtues add into the world subtracting from the word the Holy Ghost without emotions. I can't follow you till the end. My soul will be lost with all the spoken word books that you can't love. Amen. Amen. Oh, I'm nearing the end. Oh, I nearly forgot. I nearly forgot. I walk into the El Tabernacle church right into the sanctuary. I see a man that was blind once standing in front of the pulp. But now worshiping God. His eyes 2020. I'm just trying to leave something behind. right in the church now. Oh, I look and behold a man leaping and dancing right now in El Tabernacle. So crippled. So crippled that they had to carry him to the toilet. I see a couple man in Craig's door while we were dancing took his crutches and threw it away and started to dance. I just want to leave something behind. This couple man is right here now. Why? I just wanted to Leave something behind. I come into the church, the congregation and I witness three to five people raised from the dead. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. I remember Ptoria as sister Lynette and her husband brought it back to my mind. We were having a meeting at George Martins. Knock on the door. Guy came and asked us to just please come over. His wife just died. The morttery was standing there waiting for him, for her. We went over and Raymond, you were there. Raymond Thompson, you were there. Raymond, Raymond, you were there and we went over and we form a circle around her and I prayed just a simple prayer and she was ice cold. The mortary already wrote out her debt certificate and after I prayed for her, she jumped up and said, \"Give me some [Applause] water. I just want to leave something [Applause] [Music] behind.\" Amen. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. Amen. I behold in El Tabernacle now [Applause] a death and a dumb woman was a teacher at the deaf and dumb school. receive a healing, loose her tongue, and stop her ears before the whole congregation. And them all fainted. And there she is still alive today, yuring and talking. I just wanted to read something behind. [Music] Where's my other sister? That was death. Is she here? That was death. She is right in the church. Her ears is open in the church now. I was astonished in El Tabernacle now. A woman whose tubes was cut out and female parts damaged and the doctor says she will be barren all her life. Her husband's sperm bank couldn't make a half a child. God created human parts, raised sperm banks [Music] like in a third Paul manifestation and she gave birth to two children. There she is. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Hallelujah. I lost count of how many women now in El Tabernacle that was barren that's having babies in their hands babies on the two sides. I even told her, you know, the whole plan wasn't given to them. Hallelujah. To multiply. Amen. Right now in El Tabernacle, wouldn't you like to be in a church like this? I just wanted to leave something behind. A elder in El Tabernacle had to have a heart transplant. You know about the testimony. He came to me. He was on his way to hospital. To have the operation on his heart. I prayed for him. When he got to the doctor says, \"Let's just check you again.\" And they checked his heart again. and they found out he's got a heart like a little child and he's still in E tabernacle. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] I'm nearly closing. He had a heart like a baby. A preacher from Freandal. His mother came to the service in Cape Town, not belonging to the church. But she came and we prayed for her. She was barren. And I think the next month or so, she fell pregnant and she brought this boy forth who is a preacher now in our church. Can thou believe? Can thou believe? Then I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Brother kid, brother Jerry's son, the elder was deranged. Had a deranged mind. They took him just about all over. Amen. Church to church, sang to Sangoma. [Music] Hallelujah. But he couldn't get his healing. I do not know who told him about El Tabernacle and they brought him to Eel Tabernacle and God whipped his mind. He's in his right mind now. Listen. Listen. He's in his right mind now. He even know how to make babies. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I just wanted to leave something behind. All these people is right here. By the grace of God. We had brother Grant Augustine's daughter's birthday the other day and the doctor says she will never make it. She's going to die. They're going to try and save the mother. And we prayed. Brother Grant [Music] gave the testimony and two weeks ago she turned 21. [Music] And you know what? She's now ready to make ground another opa because I just left something behind. What a church. What a church. Oh, God. [Music] We had a convention and the food ran out and there was just a little bit of food left and the queue was full very very long and they prayed The trust is prayed. And as they dish, the food got more. As they dished, the food got more. When they dished the last ditch, there was still food over. Like God multiplied the bread, he multiplied the food. I just want to leave. I just want to leave. something behind for you people. [Applause] I'm closing from Venda right up in the north near Zimbabwe. Amen. To the west, Cape Point. Right to the east, Durban. To the south of South Africa, over 10 churches and thousands and thousands and thousands of souls saved. I just wanted to leave something behind. From the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the token with emotions to the four parts of the word to the four aspects of the Holy Ghost to the son of man, the son of God, the son of David, the son of righteousness, back to the son of God again into the worship like John on the aisle of atmos when the book was open. Why are you worshiping? Because Revelations 10 is open and made plain and prophesied again. Healing accompanied all this. People raised from the dead. What is love? Explain. We explain what is love. The virtues came out of the Holy Ghost baptism. The guide says so. Corinthians 13 said so. Prophesying discernment on the back part of El Tabernacle. See all the prophecies there. Amen. The creation of the earth and the 70th jubilee in 1977. And give me a minstra. Let me dance. The evolution from the chimpanzeee to the serpent man to Adam to the real man, the son of man. Hallelujah. But for me, I enjoy preaching in El Tabernacle where the oil and wine is flowing. Not a painted fire because I left something behind. I just magnified my office when I said I left something behind. And what I like the most after all this, I like this very much. Praise him in the sanctuary. Now it doesn't matter which century. It could be Becket century, Ratif sanctuary, George Martin century. The Bible says praise him in the sanctuary. Why don't they praise him in the sanctuary? Psalm 100 says, \"When I come into the congregation, I'm praising him.\" Because you got to praise him in the sanctu. Praise him in the firminant of his power, the moon and the stars and the Milky Way. Amen. And the black holes and the Milky Way and the zodiac. Praise him for his great acts. Praise he the Lord. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. He's so great. He opened the Red Sea and he's got the power to close it, too. I just wanted to leave something behind. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a fluid. Praise him with a sexy phone. Praise ye the Lord. Praise him in the dance. Oh, I got to say that again because they don't can't even dance anymore. Let a old man show them how to dance, man. Praise him in the dance. Don't you want to praise him in the dance? Praise him in the dance. Praise him with the strings, instruments, and organs. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Now here it comes. Let everything that has breath, oxygen, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Shouldn't put this here. Hallelujah. Everything that has breath. Praise ye the Lord. I don't care if it's a lion. Let the lion's roar be praise the Lord. He's got breath. I don't care if it's a coyote. Let his back be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the bellow of a frog, let the frog bellow be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the chipping of cricket, let the chipping of the cricket be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the buzzing of a bunch of bees, a swarm of bees, let the buzzing be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's El Tabernacle, [Applause] Heat. Heat. If if there's anybody here, if there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, God will wake you up one morning and you'll hear the the the the birds singing and their singing will be to you. Praise ye the Lord. If there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, Jesus says the rocks will praise him. Look at the rocks praising him. Look at it. Why are we praising? Because full obedience to the word entitle you. Don't give it. It only entitles you. For the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. My Lord. So if you obey, then you'll dance. If you obey, you will shout. If you obey, you'll speak in tongues. If you obey, you'll clap your hands. If you obey, you will dance. If you obey, you will I want to say this is why I was born. To leave something behind. I left something out. I left something out. When he opened the Bible, God wrote in the beginning. God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning, the better sheet. And a better when you take it from the right to the left spells out the crucifixion. The Bible open up with the crucifixion. In the beginning, there's the whole thing. It opens up with the crucifixion, the barit. And it closed in Revelations 5. Behold the lamb. Amen. Full of blood. It closes the Bible and opens the Bible. For this cause, I was born to leave something behind. God bless you. Thank you for my birthday. I wanted church on my birthday and you gave me church tonight because I'm leaving something behind. Happy birthday. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I say I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words. You don't live. I'm trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm trying to leave something behind. God bless you. Jesus God. Words have come from men. No Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong cry. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be the Holy Ghost is gone. My work is done. Trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus. [Music] Oh, money is free. Can't help it. If God has chosen some flesh to walk in, I got to exit to [Music] you because I had to [Music] leave something behind. Oh, the future ahead is broken in red. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of [Music] Jesus. This whole world is a foreign land. We swallow the moon, but we walk on the moon, but we don't know. We got salvation in our hand. Oh, we're running the seven time. Oh, I'm trying to be Have you got something? Have you got something? [Applause] We are in the wrong mind and I cannot but I know I've been to his house but I'm trying to leave something [Music] behind Jesus Now there is a piece to my skin in my brain.

that St Paul wrote because he was a Hebrew of Hebrews touching the Lord he was a Pharisee of Pharisees touching the the dispensation of Grace he was the first and foremost messenger of God touching the writings of the New Testament he wrote them all and everybody had to pattern after him because he says if an angel come from heaven and say anything contrary to what I I say let him be a [Music] curse Hebrews the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter reading the 16th and the 17th verse 16th and 17th verse L there be any fornicators a profane person as Esau who for one morcel of meat sold his birth right for you know how that afterwards after he sold out when he would have inherit the blessing he was supposed to inherit the blessing he was supposed to have been in the kingdom of God he was supposed to make it for heaven but he sold out gave it away didn't want it rejected it played around with it made a fool of it listen to what the word of God says inherited the blessing he was rejected even if he was supposed to have the blessing even if it was he was the son of a prophet even if he was in the lineage of many righteous man even if he was very religious he was rejected he was rejected for he found no place of repentance there was no place found for repentance it's all right no place found for repentance listen to the next line though he sought it carefully with tears carefully took his time went through his life line by line do by dot comma by comma as he took stock of his life and not only checking it but checking it with tears in his eyes maybe many a prayer went up at that moment of his distress and Gloom and being away from God and felt no touch from God anymore rejected it then what happened he cried he checked himself out he was still religious he still believed that his father was a prophet so believing brother Brenham is a prophet and it's your father if you do not live the life you go gone you gone God has no grandchildren the prophet says being in this message and think you are right and live any type of a life don't think that you are right seeking a place of repentance although we sought it carefully with tears cannot play with God God wants you to keep sincerity and fight on my son Jude preached not so long ago Don't Stop Don't Stop seeking it with tears many preachers think that when a man cries God will give him an opportunity to come back he didn't do it with Esau you cry while the grace of God is upon you then God wipes it away but when you cross the line you can cry until the cows come home you would don't listen to you let us bow our heads father what is scripture many and many Ministers of today Lord they'll be shaken when they see somebody cry at the altar like Esau but oh God once they cross that line nothing nothing nothing nothing will help them entering into the joys of the Lord I do pray that this morning Father that the efforts that's going to be put into this meeting Lord will be met after this meeting is over I do pray for the young people I do pray oh God that you'll speak to them I pray oh God that you would he would reveal to them the sincerity of this meeting I ask Lord that I cannot do anything unless you come you are the one that has called this meeting let results Blossom from the meeting father I give this meeting into your hands as I also after I went in and I saw this I was troubled in my soul lord I ask for grace and I ask Lord that I wouldn't play the fool with you that I would be sincere with the things of God H that I wouldn't shed tears when it's too late and the words will be UT uttered Lord too late too late too late for Tears answer prayer as I give this meeting into your hands Lord in jesus' name amen and amen you may be seated I greet everyone in the precious name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I I need your prayer to go through this meeting I feel tired I being at the funeral yesterday and uh would like to just B heads for the crossing over brother Samson and sister lyy and Coy i' would have Lov to be there but I'm just a human being I can't be all over I hardly have enough time for myself I do not know when last did I have a holiday I can't recall having a holiday I do not know when last so I ask you to pray for me I caught a little cold after preaching yesterday but I'm sure God will lead me through yet let us just bow our heads just for a little while for the two saints that has crossed over amen thank you want to thank God for their lives that was before us and the race is over as I said yesterday in mapani they had a dream many of us has dreams our dreams is actually what brings us to our purpose your dream is to be a millionaire that's fine politician that's fine we want our dreams to be on the Lord Jesus Christ if your dreams is on money if your dreams is on woman if your dreams is on the the world somebody will wake you up that great re Resurrection morning you'll be woken up but if your dream is on the Lord Jesus Christ then please don't wake me up I would like to Dream [Applause] On I've heard the other day that uh somebody said I preached on down the horizontal rainbow and uh that Mr Rosco uh doesn't care what he says when he's behind the poopit and speak about sex and stuff like that no I don't care and I don't apologize [Applause] [Music] if your pastor has a wishbone and cannot say those things then let him have a wishbone but I want to tell you I have a backbone and I'll say it again and again and [Applause] again I'd like to say that uh the young people years these things in school and you still want to speak about stalks bringing babies and stuff like that they know the hard facts and that's the reason I preach the hard facts I put it down without rubber gloves brother Brenham had to put it down and speak and it was bad in those times for saying those things that brother Brenham said when he spoke about the hum's underneath clothing is showing and it's a disgrace it was hard for him to say because nobody ever said it but we're living in another age that's worse than brother Bron's age this is worse and now I don't say that the humans underneath clothing is showing I said the penties are showing it's exactly what brother brandham says just brother BR couldn't say the way I say it because this is the age that needs the thing to be said [Applause] amen and if you not call Pastor to say it then don't say it you'll cause a lot of stumbling when you say it but when I say it it cause repentance wherever I preach that message fth came up and people [Applause] [Music] repented I preached that message down in Zimbabwe buo brother Beck walk up to me he says nobody can ever preach that the way you do cuz you have a gift to do it now if you don't have the gift to do it then shut up I'll do it for you years ago brother Coleman preached and in between his preaching he says there that woman sits with the split legs open and most of the ministers came down on him and I met him afterwards he says I do not know what's wrong with the ministers said God says he says uh do they read brother brandom and those guys didn't even know that was a quote can you imagine brother brandham how many years is ago brother Renee 30 some years that brother Rena spoke about a man stucking his fath in the woman and the woman is a a sexual garbage can 30 somewhat years ago and you want to play around Mister amen if you can't preach it get out of the poopet get somebody that will say it and preach it you know they they tried all the years to have something against me but every time they have something it actually boosts me [Music] [Applause] today I'm going to preach something that I think that ministers wouldn't like ministers would U would say how could he do a thing like this how could he show things like this in his church but again I would like to tell you that when I feel inspired of God then I do what God tells me and I'm going to go into things today that is mindboggling and I'm here to try and help my young people as I was told not long ago in the week and before that that somebody said you know there's a lot of virgins in Edgar Rosco's church so you don't have to tell me I know that because that's what I preach I tried to keep them clean and now even the world says he has a of Virgin sitting here so my young sister you think that nobody's watching you and you think that maybe you do not have a boyriend now they they they there's no eyes on you the eyes of the world is on you and they know who you are so keep yourself clean keep yourself clean don't let Devil's coming in and and and and wants to disrupt you and and the devil tells nobody's looking at you and that's why you don't have a boyfriend your boyfriend is on the way and when he's on the way he's going to appreciate you so much that you so you would like to be just around [Applause] you and it's funny uh that somebody phoned me I would not call her name phoned me and told me this but son Saturday after I preach I told my wife you know while I was preaching I looked around the congregation I saw so many virgins I said lovey I feel like fighting [Applause] on and may Lucifer know it may the hounds of Hell know it as long as I'm behind this Pulpit I'll preach Holiness like no man in the pipo ministry will preach it I will preach it with gloves of my hands rugged as rugged can be [Applause] and don't let anybody else tell you anything I am sent to help you I am sent to help [Applause] you and what I'm going to preach might not look so good to other people but it's good to me and they will say well how could brother Ros could do a thing like that but I would like to tell you that um brother Brenham one time was on the hunting trip and he walked and the angel of the Lord told him pick up that cigarette box and he said Lord I I never touch those things he says pick it up that's your message for Sunday a cigarette box and I want to tell you my brother and my pastor friend and preachers I'm picking up my cigarette box this morning and bringing out my message this morning Peter was told when he saw a vision of all the creeping things that the Jews was not supposed to eat and the voice told him eat kill and eat and he says I'm never at Haram before the angel told him listen you what I may don't call it haram slay and [Applause] eat so what I'm going to be busy with you do not call it by Any Other [Applause] Name just say that God showed him something that I never saw be honest once in your [Applause] life I must fulfill my purpose and I must come to make sense to the spoken word of William Brenan as he has [Applause] said in the spoken word that men will follow me in birth pains to make sense to the word and I must fulfill my purpose and so far I'm pleased I can see that I'm fulfilling my purpose what's in my heart I can see it's being fulfilled so I'd like to entitle this message crossing the line crossing the the line don't ever cross the line you'll feel religious you'll still feel that you're in the message you'll still go to church you'll still pray you'll weep you'll feel an anointing but it'll be on the outer cord but you have crossed the line God don't even listen to you crossing the line crossing the line means the place where something like a road a roadway or a Waterway or a line maybe crossed that's what crossing the line means lines get C gets drawn to determine borders that line is is is being drawn to show you this side is that country this side is this country anything that goes over that line is in trouble you are an alien when you come from this side and cross the line on the other side without papers you're an alien in that country God I mean the the the the governments of that country has all the right to put you into ceration and if they feel like throwing the key away they can because you cross the line crossing the line means that you're in somebody else's territory and you broke laws young people don't cross the line don't think that you can go on and on and on and God will just sit there and smile and say nothing and God will Pat you on your shoulder because he wants you to be saved God don't need you you need him could we have that first slide crossing the line normally you have a sign a skeleton or a skeleton's head and they said don't come into this terate and there's a skeleton's head there it means if you cross the line and there's a skeleton's head there then it means that you are going to become like a skeleton you are going to be severed apart you are going to be like the skeleton's head that's what a notice actually means and crossing the line could mean that your mortal life comes to an end crossing the line will make you a skeleton's head normally when they have a sign on the on the gate beware the dogs they have the same head there with a cross on there don't enter into this territory because he has vicious dogs here dogs that will ravage you dogs that will make you look like a skeleton dogs that's put there for one purpose is to protect the territory and everybody that passes the line that dog has the right to sever and tear him apart that's true crossing the line the logistics of that sign is don't cross that line into this territory you'll be SED apart I have visited most of the big waterfalls of the world most of them I visited all the big ones all the notable ones all the great waterfalls of the world I seen them all and brother and sister don't look at Rufus amen you watch me you look at that that that waterfalls falling and I seen them all over the world I visited them I saw Niagra Falls on the border of the states in Canada big water fall I saw the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe the biggest I mean the deepest waterfall in the world and I saw the aasha waterfalls in Brazil the biggest of them all I saw all those waterfalls all over and on that waterfalls there is a line drawn and that line especially at Niagara Falls that line is called the line of no return it means if you cross that line there is no way back it means that when you have penetrated that line amen the current is so immense the drag is so uh so mighty that there is no way that you can come back because the current just pulls you and pulls you you can't swim back because you've crossed the line of no return there is no return when you cross that line and that current just takes you into the cataracts below and brother Bram says in pmma Vision Jeffersonville Indiana 1969 what it will be to know that you set in meetings and heard that you you should get right with God uh and I hope that this meeting is a meeting like this that you will get right with God uh amen and receive the Holy Ghost and a and a defying soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you set in and heard the judgments of God preach and refuse it the Great Falls that's just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom way down in that cataracts that's when you come down the waterfall and you fall into that cataracts below amen he types it with eternal damnation when you cross the line of no return uh and the drag takes you uh and the current takes you and it throws you right down in the cataracts below and what happens when you hit the cataracts below it takes your soul right down in condemnation and eternal Doom he says voices of many Waters forth patronage of him voice of many Waters how you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded uh when The Voice this morning is recorded your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded as a man think it in his heart so is he notice your voice is louder in heaven than your uh I mean your thoughts is louder in heaven than your voice is on the earth certainly it is God knows the thoughts intense of heart he knows all about it don't cross the line into the currents of hell then not even my preaching will be able to save you and not even the Holy Ghost in L Tabernacle as it moveed from bench to bench will ever save you because you're heading down for the cataracts below where it takes your soul into Eternal damnation when you hear the voice of many Waters is a voice of many gods and Men of God that has the voice of almighty God when you hear that voice voice is hard and not your heart El Tabernacle amen never never before amen did you hear the voice of God so vividly declared to you as this church has heard it amen and I want to tell you don't cross this voice uh don't go over onto the other side in this voice amen you rather fulfill this voice uh and don't cross the line [Applause] down at the cataracts below as your soul gets dragged to Hell somebody says yes brother Ros shouldn't we be more positive and preach I preach positive most of my messages is positive but you cannot only uh preach positive you have to have a negative and a positive to let the light go on amen there's make Believers and unbelievers and Believers in the church you have to preach to them all uh amen there sers that needs repentance uh and you need to show them if you cross that line uh it's a line of no return uh and brother there's a line drawn for every blood watch child of the Living God uh there's a line drawn a bloodline a Jesus line a token line and brother I want to welcome you to cross that that line and you'll never return Hallelujah to the things of the world you'll be saved saved and saved uh yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sir the prophet crossed a line one time where a a man just the day before crossed that line and Abu came and slaughtered the man because he crossed the line he went into a territory that he was not supposed to have gone in and do you know I don't read nowhere that brother Brenham says that the authorities of the SPCA came and killed that bull no he penetrated the Bull's territory and he knew the consequences when you cross the line you know the consequences you know what's heading your way you know which way you're going and God has no apologies then you have to face the [Applause] music crossing the line and the next day brother Brenham didn't mean anything and he crossed the line and then that guy made himself ready for his second convict him but love saved him hallah love dropped out and love spoke to the bull and laugh told the bull listen here I was on my way to a certain brother to to to pray for him because the god that made you made me look how brother Brenham spoke to that murderous Bull and that bull just looked at brother Brenham and that bull deciphered what brother Brandon was saying and that bull says oh you're going to pray for a certain brother so you're loving for others okay go your way when you love for others even Bulls St come near you amen that's eternal life [Applause] thank you brother Rufus amen crossing the line you can't come back when you cross the line whether you cross the line of the blood of Jesus Christ you go so deep in that blood then you even sing the song no turning back no turning back amen you can't can't go back anymore because you have crossed the line into holy territory you would never want to come into the land of sin no more you're living in a Land of peace peace a wonderful peace uh coming down from the Savior above amen hallelujah amen God also has a line of no return and that's the blood of Jesus Christ don't let us cross that line young people this meeting is for you this morning amen don't cross that line of No Return by blaspheming the Holy Ghost is a line of no return rejecting the manifestation of the word to love the word is a line of no return uh turn your head and heart away from God uh then God turns his mind and heart away from you it's a line of no return amen put something between you and God Amen and make an idol of it that's the line of no return uh close your of compassion towards all that's called God Amen that's the line of no return you keep on sinning freely amen you War but you go on H that's the line of no return God won't give you another chance amen as long as eternity Rings Amen in this Dreadful thing this is what happens when you cross the line I wish I could let all you read it because because I've got a lot to say I'll just quote it uh Proverbs 1:24 because I have called and he refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but you have set at not all my counsels and who do and who none of my reprove I will also laugh your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as destruction and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me help us Lord when I called you you didn't want to come when I stretch my hand out to you I want to save you you refuse my head now when your Destruction come when you start to seek me with tears like Esau I had my hand out for Esau amen I tried my best for Esau but he turned my hand down he looked at a mortal little morcel of food and he rejected my amazing hand my hand of Grace he rejected it and now he rejected my hand of Grace I will reject him too he will seek me amen at the altar he will cry at the altar he'll call upon my name at the altar you'll say Lord where are you and I will turn my back against you because you didn't want to come when I called you now that you call me you won't find me why cuz you crossed the line you mean Esau born in the message yes you mean Esau with such a spiritual mother a Praying Mother yes you mean Esau that knew the Torah the spoken word for his day yes I reject him I reject him and when he calls I will not answer him why do Esau cross the line of no return brother brandham says when he was in hell he cried for God and the was was no God he prayed and he he repented but there was no God what was God showing him showing him that thus is the line of no return you my Prophet going tell them never to come to this place never never never never never come to this place cuz when you cross the line now you see the place now you want to turn back to the right place but the devil cannot leave you he says in Isaiah I am the one that do not open my prison doors there is no way of an escape crossing the line young people don't play around with god oh many and many didn't understand when I said you young boys that goes out and do whatever you want to do set it home why because I don't want your children to cross the line don't want them to sit you and go on and go on and go on and go on until they cannot come back anymore let them sit at home and reason it out is this better than hell is the church better than belir they have to decide but as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord when they call me I would not come I will laugh at that imagine God laughing imagine you hurt him so much that he feels so distressed that he laughs at you at your day of Calamity I told you some time ago that people wouldn't come on a Wednesday night to the meeting and afterwards they'll come maybe they stay out of this meeting one Wednesday the next Wednesday they in the meeting two Wednesdays they skip the third meeting they are there and not long they start on Sundays they don't come to Sundays I want to tell you beware that you do not cross the line and you're going to cry to be here and you'll cry and feel the Holy Ghost but God has rejected you you do not play around with God play around with your mother play around with your father play around with your friends but don't play around with the word of God God will God will thus sayth the Lord cut you [Applause] off cross the line of no return there's no way back and now I want to show you a striking thing young people I want to show you a striking thing this will happen to many of the young people that don't listen to this voice and the voices of that fivefold Ministry this is what's going to happen you go after this you want this this is the end thing amen I want this because my friends got it amen and because the whole the whole schools got it I feel like like an outcast you rather be an outcast but an incast in heaven outcast on the earth I want to be I do not want to be conformed to the things of the world I want to be right with almighty [Applause] God and now for the young people let us go Daniel you know of Elvis wle as the artist proclaim the king of rock and roll but what you're about to see is the side of this legendary singer which is on virtually unexplored join me as we discover generous spiritual man as revealed by those who knew him well and knew well his love of gospel music [Music] amaz in all likelihood gospel was the first music that Elvis heard the surviving child of twins born to Vernon and Gladis Presley Elvis entered the world in Humble circumstances he never laed for Love from his father he learned the value of heart Elvis Presley a twin Elvis Presley born with a brother Elvis Presley a gospel singer Elvis Presley a singer with talent but a twin what do you mean by TS Pastor Roso Cain and Abel Abel died Cain lived Elva's brother died and he lived twins what twins Pastor Rosco Jacob and Esau twins one evil one good one in the church Elvis Presley singing he touched me when did God touch Folk when did God ever work with f and young people would go after theck and R Kings and sell their births to them they would connect up with a man's name that's called Evil Al ver take the the L out behind the E and put it at the back it's evil and he sang a song I'm evil I'm evil and all that our young people see is to go with a mob and follow this monster I pull no punches and it's here where you lose your virgins the Devil comes in with music and he steals the virgins the Devil comes in with music and he prings the drugs and the cigarettes and the nice time and all that the young people do is to follow it but let us go on T Cain and AEL his mother to whom he was intensely devoted he gained a foundation of faith and a love for gospel music okay Daniel gospel music he loves singing gospel music a devil well I thought that the devil is Antichrist no the Bible says the devil believes even he sings great Musical songs doesn't mean that the man is saved it doesn't mean that the man is right with God uh it doesn't mean that he comes from Heaven uh no in a million miles no and you young people you go after things like this I don't want to follow him I already made up my mind I'll follow Jesus all the [Applause] way his mother gave him the gospel mother Pentecostal hold it Elvis Presley being baptized baptized in a Pentecostal Church baptized and be called a brother baptized as a child of God and yet he was the Devil Himself how could would I let my children go after men like that and act like them and dress like them and go with them and go to the session halls with things like that I will keep them away they say brother Rosco is il legalist yes you believe it sir I'll be a legalist as long as they don't get that into the church [Applause] don't think that you are baptized you are right don't think that that man that comes into the church and gets baptized he's a [Applause] saint he's so full of the devil Let It Roll Daniel [Music] when did he receive the Holy Ghost stop it did we receive the Holy Ghost we'll see further on he could go right up till the baptism but he could never get the baptism in the Holy Spirit you can receive the word anybody can receive the word anybody can receive the word and be baptized and he never questioned one time the word he even read the word we're going to see later on he read the word but the question was the baptism in the spirit of God brother brandham types him I've got the quotes as Judas scariot and Judas was in the word Judas slept with the prophet Judas was in the message don't tell me you're in the message man it means nothing to the devil the only thing that matters to the devil is when you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads you to the word and the word leads you into the light and the life leads you into shouting and jumping and dancing and shoing and dancing lead you into crying and sighing for the Abomination that's done in the city then the devil shakes [Applause] Let It [Music] Roll he long to be there you long to be there Bright sh they gets baptized not sprinkled we baptized the devil will even baptize himself but not the Holy Ghost [Music] baptism in the soul [Music] real this relationship with his mom was very special he was extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know okay his mother a Pentecostal woman his mother took him to a Pentecostal Church his mother a Praying Woman his mother set the pattern for him to never go lost young people El's mother was spiritual your mother is spiritual and don't think that your mother and father is spiritual and they're living the life with Jesus Christ that you're going to be all right and do whatever you want to you'll see what brother Brandon says about this guy I'm only starting we're going to get out here late he extremely close to her he was not as close to Vernon his father as by any by any means as he was his mother but his mother you know she held his hand and took him to church and took him to school walked him to school when he was a child those things he never was always there for him when he needed her it's just something he never forgot and you know he just he never got over her death [Music] I got into conversation with Elvis just it's just a regular General conversation how are you doing I'm doing fine and you and how you hurt from home this kind of thing but he said uh uh you know my mama went to the uh there in Memphis he said went to a Pentecostal Church down there and uh he said went at Pentecostal church he said are you Pentecostal I said well I've attended a Pentecostal Church quite a bit and uh but I said uh I don't you know I've just I've been kind of Baptist Baptist Churches also and uh he said well said uh I tell you what's on my mind he said this Holy Spirit thing you know anything about the Holy Spirit thing I said what you talking about I mean he was just kind of been he was just being Elvis cuz Elvis was so plain he just went straight to the juggler you know straight to the point and he began to talk about he never felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him in the church he never felt worthy of the Pentecostal blessing Judas could never get it Elvis couldn't get it he didn't say well I never he says I didn't feel worthy of it young people wake up this is where all the filth started this is the father of all the other rock stars and pop stars it's the father and the father wanted to know about the Holy Ghost I wanted to know how do I know that I've got it and if he you following him and you don't even know what was in the man's heart the man's heart wanted God the man's heart wanted to be a Christian the man's heart wanted to be near God but he crossed the line and God didn't answer him that's why he says I never felt withy made Shak in L Tabernacle this morning Let It Go felt worthy of this Christian or this type of religion his mother had taught him him in the church don't play with the sound just leave it he said how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy how do I know and how do I get it does holy ghost thing and he never got it oh elvers elvers if you only knew that was in the ease of man on the earth now that can give you the Holy Ghost that's got connection as brother Brandon says there is man that can give you and lead you into the Holy Ghost I might not be able to give you but I can lead you into [Applause] it and there was a man William brandham that could lead him into it but he wanted to listen to other men that William brandham was the hand of God to draw him away from the line of no r how do I know how do I know I've got it how do I get it and here you said Al Tabernacle you young people your Elvis Presley didn't have the Holy Ghost your Elvis Presley wanted to know how to get it your Elvis Presley that you get mad all want to just one more chance and get the Holy Ghost and yet he doesn't have it and here you sit in the church where the holy spirit is and where you can be saved where you'll never cross the line why don't you listen to this [Applause] preacher how will I get how will I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so I I don't quite know that uh this Baptist preacher don't even know how to get it too and some ministers in this message want to be Baptist they even turn around and says I would rather be a Baptist than a Pentecostal you don't even know what you're talking about sir you are actually saying that you want to be caring the only Eagles that there is is Eagles that's got the holy ghost that knows where to fly don't you know that I don't want to be a Baptist Hallelujah but I want to have the Pentecostal experience amen how would I know if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so was I I don't quite know that uh I said God has promised us everything and as long as we're faithful to him he'll give us everything we're supposed to have and when we get it we'll know it when we we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said Infinity you're talking if you talk about the Holy Ghost you're talking about Infinity Elvis knew more than a lot of bunch of ministers in this message that has rejected the Holy Ghost because of jumping and shouting if you don't jump and Shout you don't have it sir and I pull no punches that's one of the aspects of the Holy Ghost we have what we're supposed to have we'll know it I said I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want is God when you have the Holy Ghost you have God God in you Hallelujah the word and the spirit is God himself not the word the spirit and the word Let It Roll brother so I think that's Infinity you're talking about Infinity he said well I just want my what my mama had my mama had something real good so I kind of thought that was up my mama had something real good we you hear what brother brandham says about his mom all ministers in this message are you going to cross the line for you can never return to the Holy Ghost again oh I don't want the Holy Ghost that's Edgar Rosco's thing that is nothing to do with Edgar Rosco that's Infinity that's God hallelujah and it's for everybody I just want my my mama had my mama had something real good so I I thought that was a a a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything it was a deep one not the word everybody knows the Bible but the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen that even the type of Judas es scariot Elvis Presley knew that the Holy Ghost is a deep thing amen I've dug deep and I've drank strange Waters uh a simple maybe a simple statement from him but a very deep one because he he was trying to get into this thing of he wanted everything he could from God he really loved God he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and it wasn't so much uh what we did it was what happened in the room the at the atmosphere how it changed from one setting to this unbelievable setting with Coach chills with on your arm you know and and I I kind of they would sing with Elvis Presley at the backstage after he sang rock and roll and these guys would go you'll see them later on and you're going to have the have a question mark to listen to the music and uh while they were singing with Elvis at the back of the stage they could feel the Holy Ghost on their flesh as goose pimples comes I don't deny that but it's not on the right place it's on the flesh to this unbelievable setting with Co chills on your arm you know and and I I use the soul that in in my analogy of the Hol the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh watch what he says the Holy Ghost dwelt amongst them the Holy Ghost don't give up until you cross the line says he dwelt amidst us but he didn't dwell in US young people I hope to shake you this morning I hope so and remember ministers this is for my church for my young people and this is the way God wants me to show them it's not worth it when the very stars that they fall follow is fallen stars and these fallen stars one's God go on brother you know and and I I kind of use that in in my analogy of the ho the Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it's sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really begin to uh live the words instead of singing the words it kind of came in there and saturated us made us all equal I think that's that's the thing that equals us all out because when El started singing you knew he meant what he what he was singing you know he he meant those words almost every time Elvis would sing How Great Thou Art he had a special feeling I mean sometimes you can pretend that you have an emotion in a song almost every time you sang that song you could feel the spirit of him because that was his actual praying prise to God he really believed every word in that song he knew how great God is I believe that he got more joy out of singing that song and I think you can tell when you see the video and when you hear it this this is this is the soul of Elvis when he sings that song oh Lord my God listen to that gift without [Music] repentance Wonder consider all the words I has have [Music] me I see Star I hear The Rolling Thunder I power throughout the you display sing it fellas Christ take me what Jo shall my then I shall bow in Humble ad adoration and their Proclaim oh my God how great the world then think my thought sa God to the how great so are how great th [Music] are and sing My Soul Our Savior God who the how great the Lord how great [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you ever heard a gift like that you see the anointing behind it but that anointing is not calling anybody to Heaven it's calling everybody to Hell the devil sends his messenger with an anointing the people gets out of their mind when they hear him sing because gifts and callings is without [Music] [Applause] repentance and oh my God who was singing the background bul Gators group he just sang rock and roll now he just sang the the the the PS of hell now and people and woman would take out their penties and throw it uh amen and men will run naked around and people will faint uh amen because of the gift that that the devil gave him and the anointing the devil gave him and then he comes at the end of the coner How Great Thou Art then it feels for God he done the devil's Duty now he still wants an opportunity with God you cannot have God and have the devil at the same time out of one Fountain runs no two waters it's only one water and it's a clean water yes yes yes you say you say my but brother Rosco he sing gospel me brother I don't care if he sings gospel me he's still a devil why because Judas was also in the church and the Bible says they sang hymns and he also sang the hymns now you people that think the devil is Antichrist now you have learned something that the devil is religious Mah doesn't mean that he's right with God if he hasn't got uh if he hasn't got uh the qualities uh amen of a minister of God uh then you run away from him you better get away from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him the sure rocked many soul he sure rocked The Souls of black and white and blue and pink and whatever he rocked all their souls but now they're rolling in hell that's all that rock and roll brings and pop this is the top guy right on top young people right top okay elv who was his friend bu Gator who is this is that one of bulat's boys could men like this go behind Elvis Pressley Rock and Roll Show and sing with Elvis's gospel they were caught up in the same thing I'm coming to this made Rocky also young people made rock your soul behold your God behold your God you go out on drugs and drinking and smoking and whoring and all that behold your God the devil's own messenger elv us went to Sunday school I don't care if you went to Sunday school let go on Daniel I'll just ch from here it was a church called East trig Baptist Church Reverend Herbert Brewster was the pastor great gentleman and a great gospel songwriter I gave the music a different approach a new beat I knew that it wasn't going to hurt if I said much Jesus boss alone whether I've said with one beat two beat whether I've said it high low and I told him come on in here and and put your stuff together they came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group they had a glorious experience and Elvis was in the group Elvis learned the gospel amen that old negro gospel songs from this preacher right in the church and you your mom and dad is in the church and you come along and you think you're right here has Elvis also been in the church but the devil okay my brother came in here and it was a glorious experience and Elvis was in that group growing up in a Pentecostal church he had seen God work powerfully and he threw himself into his faith as passionately as his music we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his U he got his the blackhood brothers inspired Elvis we Al Mana better be very care for what we see you musicians you better wake up you know why Elvis could sing like that because him and his father was one his father was a good singer the Bible says he was a chorus leader well God send me to make sense this was never made sense to and I don't care what you think about me ministers in the message this is made sense to okay we according to Elvis inspired him to sing and inspired him to sing the way he sings that he got his uh he got his expressions and his uh way of singing from the Statesman quartet and the Blackwood Brothers those were the two dominant groups during that era when Elvis was coming up and they had the greatest influence is that all the the the the video of these guys Idol and singing B singer the Statesman they call him the big Che I'll this of my house kind of after the Big Chief but I didn't know but I know now I'm just glad that to have had a part in his early upbringing and his inspiration to [Music] sing Luc stands next to Elis the greatest bus [Music] singer you know him or just open my eyes that I may see Lead Me Oh [Music] Lord I am tired and I need I string and to guide me [Music] over or just open my eyes that I may sing me that's right [Music] me you Elvis Love B singing there was a sing done at the do you know that [Music] man you hear El was sing and surely what the man said you can feel the the the P amen of a man that's seeking for God and that just shows you what the word of God says esos SE after singing rock and roll and after sending millions of souls to hell he'll come back and he would like to be in contact with God what was he doing he was seeking for salvation and he didn't find it you young people you're never going to be the same after [Applause] this Elvis Love B singing there was a sing down at the Lis Auditorium which was two blocks from where he lived in the housing project he was always at the Saints and then one month he missed and the next month he came back I said Son where were you last month why didn't you come he said I didn't have enough money to buy a ticket I said well you won't need any money from now on I just come to the stage door I let you in for nothing and that's the way it remained until about the next thing I knew he was letting me in his stage door cuz I didn't have the money though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have he had questions and now you know what these questions was how can I be saved and it says it was never answered he died with a question I wonder if I've got the Holy Ghost I wonder if I'm right with God he had tears in his eyes young people tears looking for God looking for the way back and I'm so glad in this 20th century how mean in this Century that we're living in that there is a way to God uh there is a Divine approach amen and I'm not ashamed to say itth the spoken word amen the Holy Ghost and the spoken word with preaching under the anointing takes you back to God again [Applause] life loved though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers when the storm exactly at that time when he couldn't have an answer the answer was walking around in Jeffersonville on two feet but that's not what he wanted he wanted an answer that he could still be the rock King but this answer on 2 in Jeffersonville said you are Judas and he didn't win that that was God's answer okay let it go he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seem to have no answers no answers when the storms of life are raging stand by there was nobody to stand with him when the storms was raging when the storms of life are raging stand by in your day of Calamity I will love at you your days of storm when the world is tosing me like a ship out on the sea thou who rulest when what stand by I think that Elvis thought that he'd wake up and find that it was all over with you know it was just it was just a dream when I'm gr and when he woke up it was not only a deem a reality according to the prophet of the hour he'll tell you where Elvis woke up oh here's a quote here brother Bram says Alvis will walk up to the judgment and all his records will be plain for him as he walks up to the judgment oh I wish but I walk up to the throne of God that all my messages will be bluring out in front of my God and I tried my best I tried my best I tried my best young people I'm trying my best [Applause] he'd wake up and found that it was all over with you know it just it was just a dream when I'm growing old you didn't grow old [Music] and when I'm growing though his most Ardent fans felt he could do no wrong Elvis was well aware of his shortcomings and grew increasingly uncomfortable with the agulation lavished upon [Music] him look at this he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one you read the word from now onward ministers don't tell me about the word the word the word tell me about the Holy Ghost that leads you to the word then I'll start listening to you Elvis also read the word Judas also read the [Applause] word he frequently read the Bible and often prayed with those around him one notable example was the evening he learned that Sylvia shenell a member of his background group the Sweet Inspirations received news that she had been diagnosed with cancer we got to Vegas and as we he prayed he touched Sylvia's stomach and he asked God to move whatever it was just take it away and the next morning when syvia reported to Sunrise Hospital there in Las Vegas they did the test and it was gone whatever it was whether it was a misdiagnosis or whether God had healed Sylvia through Elvis's faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and Elvis believed also that God had worked a miracle through him he would discuss Elvis read the word Elvis prayed and Elvis had a Healing Ministry but the holy ghost thing he admitted that he hasn't got it okay faith and our faith I don't know but we believed and all us believed also that God had worked a miracle from him he would discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I open my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he even had discernment and you people in the message says well brother OS who's got discernment he's a prophet no Elvis also had it and you must have it each individual must have [Music] discernment that's thus sayth the Lord because brother Bron said it in discernment of spirits and Discerning the Lord's body okay my brother discuss spiritual ideas with us and I remember that we were standing in a circle one [Music] night and this was in Vegas and he said I want you all to close your eyes he said we're going to we weren't going to pray but he just said I want you to close your eyes and I was thinking in my mind I'll never forget this I was going to say Elvis what do you think about heaven I was going to ask him what he thought about heaven and I had my eyes closed and he said Jim we're going to get to that just a moment and I opened my eyes and he and I said to what he said you were going to ask me about heaven weren't you and I said yeah he said we'll get that in just a minute that blew me away I don't know how how that happened Elvis is very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else listen closely because when I come up to the quotes it's all that brother brandham saw even before she spoke about this and then you'll believe there's a prophet in the land and the apostolic gift will amen that Prophet around every day okay brother Elvis was very spiritual he uh believed that he had a certain connection with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so in his search and Judas what did Judas do for repentance he tried his utmost place to get repentance he was searching for God and he yet religious there's no way you can find god brother briam says God works through a Ministry only way God works there's where you'll finding okay brother with God not so much more than anybody else did but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his Elvis had even the revelation of others God made me preach before we got this [Applause] video but in his search he was trying to get close to God so he felt that by helping others maybe that was his mission and I remember just looking at him and I said man you are really really blessed and I said you know as great as this album is and all the success you have I said you know God is the one who made all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that huh and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just keep that one also in mind you'll hear what brother brandham says okay brother and all this possible I said God has placed you in a unique situation and I said you know you are really blessed and he turned to me and he said you know I know that and I know that I couldn't have done it without God and that just you know a lot of people think that he was insensitive to it but he realized that everything that came to him came from God and he and he cherished it that that way his friends noted that Elvis was often confused about why God had allowed him such success in a clan yet he never questioned that his gifts were from God perhaps that's why the song He Touched Me was particularly meaningful to his the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no I'm not here today to make him an angel I'm not here to make him a saint and I'm just telling you the truth and how he was and he but I read believe this whole deep this deep Foundation that his mother had these deep roots in the church uh gave Ela something to shoot for maybe something happen and now I know he touch [Music] me concert he just called us out to do it in the concert nobody knew nothing about it none of us knew we going to do it at all it just sort of an impromptu thing but I think it was it really put us kind of put us on the map so to speak I mean it kind of put us after the concer where people knew who we were ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please I am not singing yes Sweet Holy Spirit I'm not singing this cuz I'm not a part of that catch it watch it ladies and gentlemen if you would I would like to ask the stamps if they would sing a song that they do by themselves it's a beautiful song called sweet sweet spirit and I don't sing in this just listen to them please a sweet sweet spirit in this and I know that is the of the Lord there are [Music] sweet for each look at the [Music] tears that look at the [Music] tears Sweet [Music] Holy sweet St up their [Music] tears to too late too late blessing [Music] we without a doubt know that we have been when [Music] [Music] we look at that tears running down his cheeks that's why I read that scripture about Esau here they singing the greatest thing that could happen to humanity the Holy Spirit and yeah Elva says I cannot join with them I cannot sing with them I cannot I cannot connect with them in the song because I I can't reach this Holy Ghost but let them sing it and you'll know this is the thing that I'm short I know the word I read the word every day as we hear them say it amen I have have gifts of healing and I I have discernment and and I do pray but I this one thing the holy ghost thing I don't have and I can't join with them in singing and while they singing eso's tears is running and God is not answering young people your Elvis Presley that you want to follow the school friends wor this is how he felt and you sit right in a church where you can have a thing that Elvis will never never never never never never never never never never never never never never get and you that's got it keep it with two hands [Applause] though he sang of his faith with conviction Elvis was troubled by questions that seemed to have no answers listen to the song there must be lights burning brighter somewhere there wasn't Jeff be birds flying higher in a sky Eagles in Jeffers If I Can Dream of a better land where all my brothers walk in there was somebody that was in at land oh why oh why can't my dream come true his dream never come true oh why there must be peace and understanding sometimes strong wind of promise that will throw away all the doubt and fear If I Can Dream of a warmer Sun where hope keeps shining on every be one tell me why oh why oh why want that son son never appeared to you Jesus Christ we're lost in a cloud with too much rain we're trapped in a world that trouble with pain but as long as the man has the spr to dream he can redeem his soul and life there's a vision where there is no vision the people die my question still I am sure that the answer answer is going to come somehow out there in the dark a CLE oh yeah and why I can see while I can walk while I can stand while I can talk while I Can Dream leave let my dream come true right now let oh [Applause] [Music] yeah why doesn't my dream come true deep in my heart there's a dream somewhere The Sun Shines brighter yes Elvis just on the other side of in Jefferson Bol the sun deep sign because it is the rising of the sun somewhere the Birds flies higher yes Elvis just on the other side in Jefferson B there's a bird called an eagle a prophet that fly higher someone had a dream yes Elvis just there in Jefferson B there's a prophet that had a dream a vision that showed us on the other side of Heaven why didn't your dream come true because you made yourself an agent of Lucifer and you reject it God you backslid you went to the world and you left God you crossed the line and right at the end of your ministry Elvis you're saying why don't my dream come true every dream that's not based on eternal life will will never come true but I believe that my dream that's in my heart that there will be people in Al Tabernacle that's going to make it I know that you're shaken I was so shaken when I looked at this video I was not myself for weeks my brother Morgan asked me to take the funeral they will tell you how I preached I felt if Elvis could give his all for the devil what's wrong with that garage at the beginning Elvis couldn't see anything wrong with his rock and roll it was so nice it was so pleasant in the beginning when the friends comes around you young person amen and they they introduce you to Dr into cigarettes it looks so nice but you cannot see the wrong that's in it and what it's going to do for you he couldn't see that the devil was interlaced in his lyrics oh Alvis he couldn't see hell's arms was open like never before to take the young people to hell in his songs he couldn't see that Fallen Angels was anointing him and the crowds as they sweep through the minds of the young people by his music the 60s started off with a gutter of folk the 60s actually spurned off every vile thing that's on the earth now the 60s amen brought in the to be a virgin is out of fashion serving God is oh Mur going to church is outdated going on a trip through the drugs and and and and and have a long trip with drugs that's the in thing I would rather have that dream alvers a dream of drugs a dream that takes you on a trap uh that's what the young people want uh but I want to tell you amen I have a dream too and I have a vision too and my vision is a shout and a voice and a trumpet and I'll be changed uh in a moment in that twinkling an eye and the lost Trump and the Trump of [Applause] God the 60s brought in to the young people to love past Die Young and make a goodlooking corpse make a nice corpse but what lays behind that corpse is hell you're not nice there because the word of almighty God says there is nashing and weeping of tears after the corpse so I don't want to be a nice corpse I want to be a nice Christian in the six Dimension before God gives me the seventh [Music] Elvis was the blanket listen here the 60s brought in this gut of fult the devil was gone countering God what was the devil doing when he sent Elvis Presley he was countering God because right there in the 60s the greatest thing that ever happened outside of Calvary happened 196 three when seven angels came down from glory and they brought the book of redemption the Seven Seals amen what did the devil do he wanted to throw a blanket over that thing so that his colleagues couldn't see Redemption power but see him as the king of rock and roll he watered down God having a prophet because he wanted to be hell's King he watered down by singing The Great shalom shalom shalom good morning bride he threw that over and watered it down in the 60s oh God he took the sting of 1963 out from his people the demonic people take the sting out just in case they will come and get saved amen the devil says Okay God you have a prophet you have a holy prophet I will send my property and his name will be Elvis don't you call your child Elvis hell opened wider in the 60s Amen to accept the millions and the millions and the millions and the millions that Elvis freshly pushed into hell even up till now they that lived in the 1960s you look at them they still have earrings on and long hair it goes every musical thing that comes on the earth goes with hairstyles Hallelujah [Applause] and the hell brought on itself to receive the messages Elvis put them into hell and I'm going to read the quote for you and you ministers that don't understand Edgar Rosco why don't you just leave me alone I'm called higher than you when I said uh give me your soul I knew what I was saying [Applause] I am called higher than you whether you like it or whether you don't I am 60 years old and I know if I do not know by now I will never know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hell open wide in the 60s and I want to tell you he took the millions and the millions uh amen but have it open to receive the minute group uh that will believe that God send the message with the Holy Spirit and with angels and Heaven also open their arms uh to everyone that believe this message of the day the Dynamics and and the mechanics together that's the message of the hour no other message Hallelujah I had a dream and my dream will come [Applause] true and after Elvis prly many will follow and be his ministers after he goes there will be many that will follow him to keep the fire of Hell Ablaze Ministers of Elvis Presley and after William brandham lives because here the devil had his messenger here God had his messenger here the devil has ministers there sure must be ministers that will keep William bram's Word Alive there will be crows there will be crows there will be crows [Applause] let's go to the quotes quickly life 1957 that rock and roll Alvis Presley a modern Judas es scariot that boy was a Christian in a Pentecostal Church 1957 we only got it now but it was already laid down in 1957 who he was oh my god with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we know what he what they said they felt it on their flesh and brother Braham knows what he's talking about if Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he couldn't say he Judas a scariot because Judas scariot showed his colors when it came to the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh I feel like the messenger of God this morning Hallelujah I feel like an angel amen the fold Ministry is an angel that the angel of the [Applause] church Hallelujah glory to God in the highest amen listen Pentecostal church amen now listen what brother BR says I know he's Pastor the prophet know Alvis Presley's Pastor he knew the man that actually pastored him when he was small until he became a rock and roll king can you imagine how brother brandham spoke to the pastor listen I knew his Pastor oh oh God I knew his Pastor Elvis Presley's Pastor his mother his mother and them well he knew Elvis Presley mother well and he called Alvis Judas and listen what he says listen what he says nation has ever listen what he says the greatest hindrance at this nation no I'm not there uh listen what he says the Holy Ghost I know his parents his mother and them well but he sold his Birthright why did you read Esau because Esau is the one that sold his Birthright amen with tears why did Elvis cry brother Brown says he sold his Birthright don't sell your Birthright don't sell your Christian don't give it to the dogs and tomorrow you want to come back you can't make it brother then you have to make your way to hell i'll imagine Elvis pressure will be All Shook Up on that morning sure enough his records will be a reality when he hears the bleeding of the millions of souls that he that he sends to hell not that the devil sent to that Elvis sent to hell now if Elvis my brothers could take souls to Hell there must be five for Ministries that will take souls to heaven give me your soul your pastor will see you [Applause] [Music] through hallelujah hallelujah but El expressly perverted the listen what he says but Elvis prey perverted the right thing when he was a Christian he took the right thing and perverted it that's why after he feels so guilty they say that he would call the blackhood brothers and all that and he'll make them sing right through the night until the next morning to try and kill the conviction of the Holy Ghost and to try to get nearer to God and he could not get nearer to God and friends once you cross the line there is no way you can get closer to God there is no way that you can come to God it's finished finished finish try to get near to God perverted the right thing that Elvis Presley sang was the right thing perverted the prophet knew his mother Point number one and his Pastor the prophet says he sold his Birthright just like Esau did had the Holy Ghost Amen on the the outside realm until G pimples came his records will be played on Judgment Day right on Judgment Day Jail House Rock that the jail house is rocked what is the jail house the Bible says that the devil doesn't open his prison house his jail house it will be rocking as it welcomes millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions to hell you cannot just go to hell somebody's going to lead you there and you cannot go to heaven unless somebody lead you [Applause] then he sent them to hell in the Millions Elvis perverted the right thing many of people on that all Baptist songs and I want to tell you did you notice that Elvis sang All the Small the the the the slow hymns the hymns that the so-called Baptist in the message like Elvis also sang it so don't give it to Edgar Rosco amen it's not the hymn that you sing it's the spirit behind the hymns yes it is what Spirit leads you to sing amen that slow song songs or the fast songs if it's a wrong Spirit it is [Applause] wrong brother Bram says in spiritual atmosphere amen I wish I could just get it spiritual atmosphere just give me a chance I got a things to line up here page 11 somewhere around page 11 marmala series amen man marvelously he says take it in in the devil's work go over and say we're going to dance one man standing up and saying well now he don't know about whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over and she she that and the music playing Nearer My God to thee listen nearer slow song Nearer My God to me ah what an atmosphere for a dance well that's not any differ than what a lot of atmosphere you go into church for a service of God just that contrary says what an atmosphere near to my God to me he says the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dance is to put on their old music that makes dances in other words Nearer My God to me you can't dance with it amen and when are you going to fulfill the word when you have near my God to me every week in your church that means you're not fulfilling the Bible you're not fulfilling the word and the bride will be the word of God from Genesis to Revelation she'll sing near to my God to me and she'll sing a nice song for the dance amen for jubilation that Jesus Christ is alive and the Seven Seals is full back Hallelujah hit the balance hit the balance I'm glad for El Tabernacle we hit the [Applause] balance Hallelujah oh God Amen going to take my time yet countdown Sunday 1964 and this is the reason why go into South Africa listen not into Mexico not into amen Ghana not into uh Zimbabwe not into England not into Germany but go into South Africa going to South Africa and they were so why Elvis Presley is a very religious boy did you hear that on the video he the prophet brings in 1964 Elvis press is a very religious boy he sings hymns oh that doesn't mean nothing to me it's another Judas es scariot all the nice hymns that he sang all the good How Great Thou Art amen the devil also knows how great he [Applause] is that don't make him a Christian if Elvis prey was a Christian why did he die of drugs his music took him to drugs and maybe that same music will take them to Armageddon right in South Africa here in South Africa they say he's religious you know he sings religious songs and and and and and you know and you listen here not all over in South Africa not here here we say what the prophet says he is a incarnate devil yes he is handwriting on the wall 1958 and Elvis Presley and make a little album or some kind of a religious service right after the meetings religious service rock and roll on one side and religion on the other side the prophet knew Alva sang religious songs and with who did he sing it bugat there now now shook his his hips and just now real sad and singing one song he gave the whole night for the devil and he gave a little two minutes for God my God needs all the time either you serve God or you don't serve him at all either you do what God wants you to do or you don't do it at all young people either you serve God or set it home until you made up your mind that it's not one side the world and one side God it's all Bes sides [Applause] God we making sense to the word of God Now understand why brother Brenham says and I could never understand it I'm long in the message and that doesn't mean that I'm saved because I'm long in the I must fight the fight but I'm just saying that to make a point I could never understand the unentertained Christ Jesus with dir fet where he says that these singers they keep in the note until they blew in the face and I said Lord who is is he speaking about why does he say that until I saw this video they were right there when brother Brenham was there and brother Brenham saw them amen singing amen hymns with uh Elvis Presley and brother Brenham nailed Elvis Presley and he turned around he says and this Bunch that keeps that breath in so long to keep the note he says they not singing for God that was not singing for God [Applause] now I have the sense to what brother Brandon says I looked right in there and God showed me right in there listen here this is that bigus uh concubines that brother brandham spoke about they are concubines of Elvis Presley he pregnated them with hell now they sing until tears run down their cheeks

hit the balance get the balance [Applause] oh God says you never heard of a name like that in days gone by Alvis or Ricky and it just a name of the age that name had to come when the other name Brenham came there was never a Brenham a ham amen with letters from the time of Abraham and here that name had to come in the end hour but Judas also amen and send a man with a name for the first time Alvis showing you God showing you the devil oh people young people let your eyes open that name could only come in this hour Elvis he here oh here's where I go home Lord Christ the mystery 1963 if you only knew the numerology of the Bible and know what Elvis or Ricky means to the scriptures if you only knew the Bible Code the numerology the Bible Code he says you will otherwise run away from Elvis and what did I do when I got this quot i Phone brother Willies I said check this up in the numerology of the Bible check what the Bible says in the [Applause] Torah about Elvis and in the King James virgin and when they look into the Bible Code long before Elvis was born 4,000 years ago God wrote of Elva's name right in the numerology young people I'm not playing right in the numerology right in the Bible Code because brother Braham say in a numerology of the Bible he knew one day it will come forth and there will one be one person that will not be scared to use it and that's Edgar [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Rosco Hallelujah in the numerology of the Bible what Elvis mean and the Bible quote says Elvis mean Evil 2 Peter 52 1 Samuel 8:3 that's a Bible quote the second thing that Elvis means is a liar a beast a deceiver a devil amen this is on one Matrix in Elvis's name that is what he is that's what the Bible says he is and I don't care how you feel I don't care what you think if the Bible says he's a devil then he is a [Applause] devil Hallelujah and you can follow the devil if you want to young people but Jesus Christ is here amen the angel with a swap back Wings the eighth messenger Jesus Christ I will follow him [Applause] Hallelujah and around the other one the other metrix is Elvis and Elvis means rockar Amen on one metrix that is circled around his name when his name comes then next to his name rockar and it's circled this is thousands of years before Elvis was born the Bible already said he's coming oh god brother Bram says the numerology of God run for your lives young people run for your lives and the next metrics under Alvis will say shackles and silver and money with Alvis sheckles money and brother Braham say is a more than judas's Carri it Judah sold Christ for 30 pieces of silver and he for millions of dollars and yet the Bible says it that his name is connected with money and the Bible says that Lucifer set on the money of the world young people young people wake up and the num numerology of God goes on Amen on the next metrix it says connected with Elvis is hell in Hell the next metric Elvis in hell where did he go to although he's saying how great thou art it doesn't mean that you saved you seen great how great you are but you live like a devil only one way it's the way I laid down in this church Holiness Hallelujah not the word not the revealed word not the spoken word the manifested word when those words are manifested then you saved not the books when the books is living in you not the spoken wood book The spoken wood book is paper that paper must change into flesh written Apostles read of all man then you're marching to heaven [Applause] proper Revelation a decent Revelation where there's no vision that people die Hallelujah in Hell Elvis the Bible Code the Bible and the Elvis next to that is in hell and you're following a man like that that's already in hell young people AR shaking you today and wherever the tape goes every young person will be shaken show me who you follow then I'll tell you who you [Applause] are in the next metrix it says we took Presley and Presley is connected with petition second Peter 37 that's the Bible the six metric says another metric says with Presley comes drugs cause his death you mean thousands of years before he died of drugs the Bible says Presley dies of drugs and then he dies of drugs is that thus saith the Lord yes yes it is I will take the Bible and I will reject every other minister if he says that Elvis is saved I'll say no he crossed the line like Judas scariot and like Esau heard the truth heard the truth heard the truth heard he must change his life heard it but never done it and the day that they really want to get saved With Tears in their eyes they cannot come God is Not mocked he died of drugs and I think he tried to drown his convictions after when he couldn't find repentance the best thing to give drugs is the best thing to give up drugs is never to start with it I won't be able to help you when you cross that line loving kindness and Alvis prey with his All Shook Up rock and roll the reason you do it because something in there making and craving for that if the Holy Ghost hand had that heart fold you wouldn't have no desire for Alvis fres and his rock and roll there BR puts the things straight and the Holy Ghost is there your desires are [Applause] changed God keeps his word 57 I do not like to call people's names but I'm going to call somebody somebody his name now but I pray for the young man and I pray all the time for him but he is a instrument in the hands of the devil and that is this man Elvis Presley the people are gone Boogie hooi and rock and roll wild I like church music played like church music and not rock and roll in the church but when they get the spirit there's something something behind this you see I said the spirit there's something behind that Spirit whether it's soft music and nice hymns there's a spirit behind it you're doing that because you don't like the Holy Ghost that's why you like that soft music because you don't like dancing that's why you don't want the church to dance there's a spirit behind it with your soft HS message Pastor I pull no punches and I have no Reg [Applause] RS so like for there's something behind this and the devil puts himself out a challenge and it happens to be that this poor backslid Pentecostal boy shaking he caught it and learned it in church he is a member of the first Assemblies of God in Memphis Tennessee his Pastor is a friend of mine and he is the devil's instrument for delting and polluting the minds of the teenagers that's why I said this is for the young people polluting the minds of the young people they just left the place in Canada and I think they sent 14 young people to the insane asylum a few days after he was there they went cuckoo when to get this quotes and there's a lot that I still bring out watching Jesus feet and Elvis pry and all that there nonsense that's produced and put out to the American people's minds is contaminated with such stuff and then it even get into the Ministeries and they try to flower the pulpit they try to flower the pullit with that Elvis Presley is like he said in South Africa they say he religious they flower the poit did you realize that that is exactly what Cain did you know where that uh uh Cain come from Cain he had an altar same as Abel Kane had an altar and Elvis Presley had an altar what was his altar all the scils that he's saying and what does the altar do call you to some place Cain had an altar and Abel had an altar brother Brenham had an altar and Elvis had an altar Elvis altar took them to hell and God has an altar that can take you to heaven hallelujah hallelujah he types Elvis with Cain and Esau another altar rock and roll alar and the altar of God listen to this Corinthians book of symbols 957 and you get these little old sissified man today with a shock of hair cut down low on his neck like that and a pair of side barns like Elvis Presley and stand up and make all this boogie hooie stuff and you Christians try to impersonate an impostor like that now if you have sideburns you impersonating Elvis Presley I'm so glad I don't have gluts so that it can fall down here I'll be too scared to cut the gluts off cuz I want to be like Elvis I want to feel it in my neck I don't have to feel it in my neck I want to feel it in my heart [Applause] the side Burns cut it off young man if your hairstyle is like Elvis hairstyle amen it

Presley he man he had more audiences than Alvis Presley he was he's The Beetles and Elvis Presley in one person and if the Bible says that he's the Evangel of blood and he is and next to his name is Priscilla Elvis's daughter he couldn't marry anybody but Elvis's daughter because he had to match up with Elvis in marriage man what are you hearing what are you hearing man amen we preach the word the reveal word the Revelation made sense to bring a manifestation he had to marry Priscilla Elvis's daughter and he's got the what you call it on all Elvis Presley's music you can't have Elvis press his music until you write to Michael Jackson the two have become one the one started it the other one finished it the one came with the name of brandham and the other one came in the name of a man that's called the Apostle of God could only come now the two names had to come together don't care what you say it's the truth [Applause] [Applause] right in the hour right in the hour where a Ministry came by Revelation and preached Michael and open up Michael a fire4 minister amen and went around the world and place Michael right at that hour right at that time now I spoke about Michael years ago and I was first down by the ministers because they didn't know Christ the mystery and I read it right in Christ the mystery and I said it and they said where did he get it from even up till now they said where does he get it from but if you're not call on my realm it's up to you I preach according to my [Applause] faith Elvis Presley could only move his pis because he was Elvis pis but Michael Jackson moves his toes until his head he could go like this and there's nobody they said never will there ever be a man that will be able to dance like Michael [Applause] Jackson any brother Brandon felt like that about Alvis how would he have felt about Michael Jackson and the same thing that God spoke about Elvis it speaks about Michael Jackson have we got it I was amazed when I saw him dancing now you said did you watch it I'll watch it because I want to preach on it I never knew it and brother and watched Elvis and he knew what Elvis sang and who sang with Elvis that's why he could preach against it brother Bram says even the Beatles they are healers and he made one of the brothers read a cut out of Readers Digest how the Beatles healed people and of there was never never a man

I went to his house but the Holy Ghost is gone. I came to his house and Holy Ghost is gone. But I tried to leave something behind us. [Music] Now there is a beast that's taken my brain. You can put me to bed, but you can't feel my pain. You could put me to bed, but you can't bear my pain. Leaving the soul from the I'm just trying. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus God. [Music] is free but the [Music] holy cost more than our [Music] bra come by simply it's so hard to read the future ahead it's already and it's time to leave hunting behind in the footprints of Jesus [Music] King. Now I've got this feeling that I'm still at the shore and my pockets don't know what it means to be poor. I can get through the wall if you give me a door. All the doors is closed. It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus King. Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere and you're not going to find it. It's a mental [Music] break. It's locked up from those who hurry ahead. It's time to leave something behind the foot of Jesus [Applause] God. All the money and the ceiling is hard [Music] to when my son stands as a statue of God. He will know what I [Music] meant. Try to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd Like I'd like to take a scripture out of St. John 1. It's 46, 47, and 48. And Nathaniel said unto him, \"Can there any good thing come out of the El Tabernacle? Philip saith unto him, \"Come and see if something good is in Al Teabernc.\" [Applause] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him. Yes. Amen. and sayith unto him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed in whom is no G.\" [Music] Then Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knoweth thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, \"Before that film called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee.\" Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. May our past catch up with our future [Music] as Nathaniel's past caught up in his future. [Music] I do pray that you'd undertake for us. Lord, on my birthday, I wanted church. and you gave it to me. What a boom day present. Church. Thank you that I could be in church with people that was there. with me in the confidence to celebrate the gift that you gave Lord. What a gift. Pray that you'd undertake for us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I will take a title from there. I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] I just want to leave on this birthday something behind. Nathaniel asked him the question, \"Since when do you know me?\" He says, \"When you were in a fig under the fig tree the other day, Now the minute you say I leave something behind, it means that you showed to the past. So Nathaniel, it might have been a couple of days ago in the past. I saw you, but now your past has caught up with your future. And I want to say El Tabernacle, your past has caught up with you in this future that you're living in tonight. Brother Brandham says, \"If you weren't there in the beginning, in the past, you're never going to be there in the future.\" And that is what it is. I'll leave something behind. And brother Brandham took a song on the wings of a snow white dove and he add words to that song that was on the hip parade [Applause] and he put himself in that song. Though I have suffered, in many ways I cried for healing, he took that song and he pleaded on the wings of a snow white dove. Brother Brandham, when he got near his wife and they were laying on the bed, Amen. And he looked into our eyes and he wanted to serenate her. Amen. He wanted to have a loving evening. And then the prophet will take that song. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are blue. It takes a song. And then and then he preached a whole message. Loving he loved me. dying. He saved me a whole song. He takes that and he starts preaching a message on it. So I tonight want to take this song in all that I tried to do for 79 years. I was just trying to leave something behind. Everybody leaves something behind. Don't care who you are, bad or good, you leave something behind. Some leaves big wolves behind with a lot of money, but they leave something behind. Others leaves a lot of credit behind, but you leave something behind. Others leave legacies, great legacies, but you leave something behind. Others leaves disappointments and that too you leave [Applause] behind. The thing you leave behind become a memory. People remembers. Look at every funeral you attend. They will come and says, \"Well, he did this and this and this.\" What they left something behind. Memories gets left behind. And from memories it become history. And history makes memorials [Applause] because you just left something behind. The great guys of yesterday year left something behind. [Applause] They always leave something behind, something that people could remember them by. Jenkins Khn left something behind. Alexander the Great left something behind. Napoleon Bonapart left something behind. Hitler left something behind. Pelle left something behind. Jack Nicholas with a golf left something behind. You can be a great guy, you're going to leave something behind. You can be a nobody and yet you're going to leave something behind. soul. William Brennham. Yes. Amen. When he cried out, I'm going to leave this Bible for Joseph. Brother Brennan left something behind. Brother Brennham when he took the cloud and he turned the cloud and he said this will go down in history what did he do? He left something behind. Amen. Amen. The pillar of fire that was at the back of his head. Amen. That's hanging all over where you went and go. What was that? He left something behind. All the mysteries of the entire Bible, every nuke, every corner in the Bible, he revealed it. What did he do? He put it on tape because he wanted to leave something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he says, \"I have to go to my father, but I'll send you a comforter.\" He left something behind. He said, he said, \"I must go so that he can come because I'm leaving him behind to lead you into all truth.\" Yes, he left something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he took his final step and he looked back, he saw footprints on the sands of time that's leading to the promised land. What did he do? I can't hear you. What did he do? He left footprints behind. He left something behind. He left something for you to follow. He left something for you to to be guided because he left something behind. [Music] Oh my [Applause] Paul left something behind. So if anybody comes and says seven thunders and seven virtues let him be a curse because even if it's an angel because I left something behind. [Applause] And then I came [Music] to this place. I went before the beginning. I went in the beginning and I end from the beginning. [Applause] [Music] Woo! Hallelujah. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yes. Yes. Yes. I went before the beginning and I came out to a place before the beginning at the great conference of God. And there we were sitting. Amen. In the great conference of God. And here God saw the deceitfulness of Satan before Satan was actually created. God save our souls already. Took the lamb and slay the lamb. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] And I look 3.5 billion years ago and God formed the earth 3.5 billion years ago. And as he forms the earth, the ones names that was in the lamb's book of life, they were there already. And they looked at him creating the earth. And the Bible says in the book of Job, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy when he laid the foundation, I just want to leave something behind. I don't think Lucifer wanted to hear that one. And the sons of God was shouting for joy. And right now, tonight, God's got another man that makes the sons and the daughters of God shout for joy for a new creation. I just wanted to leave something behind. And while while we were shouting, while we were screaming, while we were drunk in the spirit, Lucifer didn't like it. and it caused trouble in heaven. And God says, \"Any man that makes trouble in my church, I kick him out.\" And I saw Lucifer fall down. How have I fallen on Lucifer? And we're kicking him out here tonight because the sons of God is here tonight. Heat. Heat. Thank you. Yeah. [Applause] When I preached that, hallelujah. When I preach that, what did you do, brother Rosco? I just wanted to leave something behind and God made in Eden and I see him drop down in Eden. Lucifer in the body of the serpent a handsome man. The Bible call him a cherubam. Which cherubam? The man cheruban. The one with the face of a man. He was thrown out. Amen. Into the Garden of Eden. And I look at this cherubam. Amen. A man, a serpent. And then I saw what that serpent could do. The weakness of a man. That's why God had to destroy him because Eve would have ran after him all the time and God slayed him. Then I saw evolution coming right up to the serpent. Lord, I saw the chimpanzee. I saw the H Highleberg man. I saw the Nebraska man. I saw the Bolton down man. I saw the peeking man. I saw the neon grateral man. I see the cro-Magnum man. And then I see the serpent man. And then I see the modern man. Amen. Adam. But also then I saw the real man, the only man, the son of man. I just wanted to leave something behind. And I hear a prophet says there'll come a man one time and he'll preach evolution and nobody in the message preach evolution, but he send a boy that is a man. Now I just wanted to [Music] leave something behind. And finally the man came. When he came He was full of blood, thorns on his head. And he stood in front of Pilate. And Pilate looked at him and he looked at this congressman and he says, \"Behold the man, the only man I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] Brother Brennham was compelled to come to South Africa 1951. There was a reason why he came because there was a little boy [Applause] And that little boy has become a man. And now he just want to leave something behind. That the prophet laid hands on this head. I just wanted to leave something [Music] behind. Sitting in my study, here come a letter from Billy Paul. And in the letter, Billy Paul says, \"Edgar Roscoll, I only listen to my father and you because you got a very fine spirit. I just wanted to leave something behind. From brother Brandham to Billy Paul, from Billy Paul to brother Higginson, the head deacon of Brennham tabernacle and he came into the sanctuary and he felt the anointing and he said the anointing that's here was the same anointing when brother Brandham preached the same the scripture. is fulfilled and this day the scripture is fulfilled. I just wanted to leave something behind from brother Brandham to Billy Paul to the head deacon of Brandham Tabernacle. knows that something has been left behind. El tabernacle, even Jeffersonville had to acknowledge there's going to come somebody that's going to leave something behind. I can't help who I am because I was chosen to leave something behind. Will brother Stephford come up please? Brother [Music] Steph and this cherubam was walking in the garden of Eden. That's why When we hear we devil chasing. Amen. You sisters that don't respect your husband, we one of these days are going to put you out of the church. Your husbands that don't love your wives, we're going to put you out of the church [Applause] because there is somebody that God said leave something behind. Brother Stephen, will you just give them the testimony so that we can just leave it behind. Thank you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Amen. The apostle just wants me to share a short testimony with you. Amen. I was working in this company and in one of our subsidiary companies was a colored guy and this guy wanted an appointment with me and every time he comes to my office I wasn't available and then I said to my PA I said listen just schedule this appointment with this guy. tell him when he comes we make an appointment and I'll see him. So he came and he came under the guise of wanting career advice. But really I could hear when we started to talk. He said he knows I'm a Christian. He knows where I serve El Tabernacle. He knows my apostle Edgar Rosco. So I said to this guy, his name is Nathan Operman. So I said, \"Nathan, how do you know my apostle?\" He says, \"Brother Stephford, let me tell you something.\" He says, \"My father is like a bishop in the AFM church.\" And around the late 70s, I think around 1977, Kenneth Hagen came to South Africa and he had an audience with Kenneth Hagen, his father Andrew Operman. And this young boy Nathan, he went with his father and he was sitting there when Kenneth Hagen spoke to his father. And Kenneth Hagen said to his father, that was around 1977 when he came to South Africa. He said, \"You need to associate yourself with a man by the name of Edgar Rosco. He said that man carries the power of God. And you know as we were talking it only became clear to me. So I told him about the church and all that but it only the puzzle came together only later when his father put in his will that when he dies the apostle must bury him. [Applause] So, this was something phenomenal to me and we wanted to get it on tape and we spoke to him and he said, \"No, we'll do it. It'll come on tape.\" But by the time we wanted to finalize it, he had stage four cancer and within 4 days after speaking to me, he passed away. But his father was buried by the apostle and we all know the rest is history what happened at that service. So to the man of God we salute you and we want to say happy birthday pastor. You definitely left something behind. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Now that's the same man that Sol Ranica and them was under that was his mentor. Every Tuesday they had studies with Andrew Oppaman and Andrew Oppaman's got a better chance than Solar Renica. Exactly. And I do not know Kenneth Copelan and all those guys, but you know, God does things like this just to leave something behind. What fruit is on the tree? One of the elders said to John the bride, hallelujah, part in El Tabernacle. told you, \"Weep not. You're safe. Weep not, John. You're safe. Just follow the footsteps that's left behind. And I asked the Holy Ghost, who is that elder? And nobody ever mentioned it. And it came down that elder is none else than Paul because Paul was in the third heaven and Paul saw the lamb there that takes away the sons of the world and he cried out, \"Don't cry. The line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. And I came and told you now I leave something behind. Oh my. And that anointed cherubam. It reminds me of the two cherubams that's on the ark. On the one side, the face of a man and on the other side, the face of a lion. Now, you never heard this in a message. They know nothing. Who's that? Two cherubams. Face of a man and a face of a lion. couldn't have been anybody else because the lion of the tribe of Judah has become a man and he poured out his blood on the mercy seat. Hallelujah. I'm just leaving something behind. That was not good enough. I just want to young people. I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Thank you. I was laying in my bed in Jerusalem. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how beautiful is your mountains. And when David saw it, he says, \"I lift up my eyes towards the mountains where from my strength come.\" I was lying in between the mountains of Jerusalem and he came down and he told me, \"You're not going outside seeing today.\" I said, \"Lord, why can't I go out today?\" Said, \"You s and you read Revelations 10.\" I said, \"But I I know Revelations 10. It's my bread and my butter, Lord.\" He said, \"You stay behind in Jerusalem.\" I went down. And I said, \"Lovey, I can't go out. I can't go sightseeing. I can't go out with you. I must stay.\" He told me to read a Revelation 10. And they left and I was in the room alone between the mountains that David saw. And shortly here round about 11:00 I think my strength came from the mountains. And as I read Revelations 10, I saw that the Bible says, \"And when the seven thunders uttered there,\" he says, \"Stop there.\" You said that's that's a word that you couldn't spell. When you spell there, you spell it t h e r e. But this is t h e i r. This is human beings. And if the seven thunders are there is seven human beings. And what is utter? Utter means speech. What is utter means preaching. He says the seven thundersu is the seven messengers of the seven church ages and the revelation came down where my strength come. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] Oh my [Music] [Applause] And then [Applause] to 20 24, he said, pick up Revelations 10 again and read it through. I must still come back and preach the entire Bible folded in Revelations 10. It might it might be the whole year. I don't know. And I started to read it verse by verse. And I came to Revelations 10:8. And I saw Brother Bram says, \"That's the bride.\" He said, \"But now watch now. It's the bride. But the sisters is in the bride, too. But they don't prophesy. It's only men that prophesy. So it must be in the five-fold ministry that prophesy.\" And I he said to me, \"Now, who in the five-fold ministry is prophesying again?\" And I wasn't ashamed to tell him Edgar Rosco Revelations 10:8. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] And then he gave me Revelations 22 to hook up with Revelations 10:8. Amen. John, see that you don't seal up the prophecy. Now, how could he not seal up the prophecy if he's not going to prophesy again? The only way to keep it open, preach on it for a whole year. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Then I went around the world in a message and all that I heard the word. The word the word the word spokes quotes the word. And I said, \"Lord, there's something wrong here.\" And then he spoke to my heart. He says, \"Edgar, there's four parts to the word.\" [Applause] Oh, I said, \"Lord, which four parts?\" He says, \"The written word don't save you.\" Everybody preach it. The spoken word don't save you. That's for third Paul. Squirrels. The revealed word don't save you. The minute he says flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you, Peter, the next verse says God told him, \"Get behind me, Satan. That don't save you.\" But what saves you? The living manifested word is the only thing that saves you. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Amen. The loving word saves you. Why? Amen. Then he opens the Bible for me. He says, \"Some seeds fall on rocky places. That don't save you. Other seeds fall in between thorns and it gets choked. That don't save you. other word word word falls on dry places that don't save you. So it's not word word but the word that falls on good ground that saves you. Four parts to the word of God. I just want to leave something behind. And then another thing that made me sick is whenever I go, brother, you got to love, man. You got to love, brother. You know, Brother Rosco's got no love. You know, there's no love. Nothing. Amen. And then I walked up and I found in the message rejected King. Brother Brandham says the Holy Ghost is love. [Music] [Applause] Then I found out that the book of Galatians says love is only a fruit of the spirit. Not the spirit is the fruit of love. Love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Cannot be any other way. only a fruit. Only a fruit. Then I read Romans 5:5. Could you read it with me? Romans 5:5. How does the love come into your heart? So without the Holy Ghost, no love. [Music] There is seven steps of love. Which love are you talking about? Amen. My Lord. Amen. And amen. Lord. Hey. Then he sings on the wings of the snow. White. What is the white dove? He says, \"And love is on the wings of a dove to the wings of the Holy Ghost.\" Oh, and then I read in the Bible, there's only a time to love. You can't laugh all the time. When are you going to get a re a time to rebuke? When are you going to get a time to hate sin? And there's only a time to laugh. But you want to laugh all the time. When Jesus knocked them out of the temple, where was love? [Applause] Hey, I just wanted to leave something behind. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The 1979 I walk into the classroom still under the umbrella of the teeth the Holy Ghost without emotions. And when I went in there and preached for 10 minutes chairs went through the window, sisters got slain. The hallelujah and the glory to God was like they shouted for joy. And the Holy Ghost fell from 79 until now. And it never stop. And it won't stop. I won't let it stop because I'm leaving something behind. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh my. Can I have another few moments? that I heard the other day. They said the initial evidence is when the word of God says, \"Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?\" And then they turn around believe what the message for your day. They said, \"That's the evidence.\" Now, the Holy Ghost told me that's right. Did you believe the word for your day since you received the Holy Ghost. They say that's it. But my problem is is dancing in the word, is shouting in the word, is being drunk in the word. Then why don't you believe it and do it? You're a liar. Faith without works is dead. I just wanted to leave something behind. Listen, then Phil thief came when the Holy Ghost poured out in Al tabernacle and he came and he said the Holy Ghost with no emotions. Now there is no quote for that but put that back in the Bible. Where are they going to put it? I know where it is. And I told you where it is. Acts chapter 2, there came a rushing mighty wind, the Holy Ghost. No emotions. It fell up the house. No emotions. They were sitting. No emotions. They had cloven tongues over their heads. no emotions. But after that, the Bible says, \"And they received the Holy Ghost and emotions came.\" Oh, put it back in the Bible. I just want to I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Oh my And then I thought, brother, I thought that I'm screaming. I'm shouting. I am dancing. I'm getting drunk. I'm acting stupid. I thought it it's me. And then I picked up a quote. Brother Graham says it's not you. Is the angel of God inside of you shouting, screaming, dancing. It's not you who's screaming there. I see the angels of God. And then we came back and we took the quote to brother B says turn the cloud to your right side. turn it to the right side the cloud. And then I read he says he's got a wig on. And then I saw he say it's the judge. [Applause] 1963 it's the judge. Do you know that we already judged by the word of the prophet? So, we're not going to the white throne because the white throne is the word of God judging. But the judge already came. And I see a a prophet said, \"I'm making this tabernacle a courthouse.\" [Applause] Hallelujah. He made his church a courthouse. And he says, \"I will start preaching warning and judgment.\" And after he preached warning and judgment, he preached, \"Now I already warned you. I indict you now.\" And after he preached indictment, he went around and preached trial, trial, trial, trial, trial. Five trials. And after he preached five trials, he put them in prison. Souls in prison. They in prison now can never get the Holy Ghost anymore. Why the judge is here? I just wanted to leave something behind. I save you from the prison. I pull the prison bars open. [Applause] Oh, then I preached the seven dimensions [Applause] and I preached Saturday is here. What happened Saturday? He went into the prison in the first dimension of hell and he preached in season and out of season. Out of season, Noah's day in his season, his day and they didn't repent. And after he preached, nobody got saved. It was the third pool. And then he went down to the third dimension of hell. And he rearranged Satan. Even his own devils didn't recognize him. He set captivity captive. He triumphed over the devil. He kicked the devil back into hell again. Saturday is here. Then that same Saturday, the blessed the saints under the sixth dimension. And it wasn't sixth dimension. It was paradise. heard him calking and talking to the thief that was on the cross next to him. And he told the thief, \"Don't worry. Watch these doors open.\" And he came to the doors. He said, \"Open up your [Applause] doors.\" And the angel says, \"Who are you?\" He says, \"I'm the Lord mighty in battle. I conquered hell. I conquered death. And I conquered the grave. [Music] Oh my. So, I'm nearly there. My brother, my sister, you can't put me to bed. You can't put me to bed. Because you can't feel my pain. You can put me to bed, but you'll never know my pain. Pain for 59 years in a message. All the different talks against me. Blessed is the man that when they speak all men of evil against him for my name's sake. You do not know my pain. You can put me to bed, but you don't know my pain. Oh my. I'm nearly closing. I can't get through the wall of these churches in the message. That's right. It's true. Hallelujah. Unless they open the door. But all the doors are closed. And they got the Holy Ghost outside. I can't get through their walls unless they open the door. Paul said, \"All have forsaken me.\" Brother Bram says, \"I'm alone.\" When you're a man of God, you are alone. Money is free. Everybody can get a dollar right up to a billion dollars. Money is free. But the Holy Ghost cost more than your natural bread. Simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the Holy Ghost. He didn't have enough money. Money is free, but the Holy Ghost costs more. Money is free, and the Holy Ghost is too far up the ceiling to reach. [Applause] [Music] Oh, the future head is already dead. Lord, it's already dead. because he's painted to a thread. The Pope is on his dying days. Trump is running wild around the world. Money is getting scarce. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus, King God. I'm trying to leave it behind. So you can go leave and say goodbye. But here I'll stay in El Tabernacle. I'm not going anywhere because I left something behind. You can lie to me with all those spoken word books that you don't love. Exactly. I can't follow you to the end of the world with all that false doctrines. Why not rightly dividing the word? Making the word of God to none effect. Mis consting the word. Misinterpreting the word. Dislocating the word. Add to the word seven thunders seven virtues add into the world subtracting from the word the Holy Ghost without emotions. I can't follow you till the end. My soul will be lost with all the spoken word books that you can't love. Amen. Amen. Oh, I'm nearing the end. Oh, I nearly forgot. I nearly forgot. I walk into the El Tabernacle church right into the sanctuary. I see a man that was blind once standing in front of the pulp. But now worshiping God. His eyes 2020. I'm just trying to leave something behind. right in the church now. Oh, I look and behold a man leaping and dancing right now in El Tabernacle. So crippled. So crippled that they had to carry him to the toilet. I see a couple man in Craig's door while we were dancing took his crutches and threw it away and started to dance. I just want to leave something behind. This couple man is right here now. Why? I just wanted to Leave something behind. I come into the church, the congregation and I witness three to five people raised from the dead. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. I remember Ptoria as sister Lynette and her husband brought it back to my mind. We were having a meeting at George Martins. Knock on the door. Guy came and asked us to just please come over. His wife just died. The morttery was standing there waiting for him, for her. We went over and Raymond, you were there. Raymond Thompson, you were there. Raymond, Raymond, you were there and we went over and we form a circle around her and I prayed just a simple prayer and she was ice cold. The mortary already wrote out her debt certificate and after I prayed for her, she jumped up and said, \"Give me some [Applause] water. I just want to leave something [Applause] [Music] behind.\" Amen. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. Amen. I behold in El Tabernacle now [Applause] a death and a dumb woman was a teacher at the deaf and dumb school. receive a healing, loose her tongue, and stop her ears before the whole congregation. And them all fainted. And there she is still alive today, yuring and talking. I just wanted to read something behind. [Music] Where's my other sister? That was death. Is she here? That was death. She is right in the church. Her ears is open in the church now. I was astonished in El Tabernacle now. A woman whose tubes was cut out and female parts damaged and the doctor says she will be barren all her life. Her husband's sperm bank couldn't make a half a child. God created human parts, raised sperm banks [Music] like in a third Paul manifestation and she gave birth to two children. There she is. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Hallelujah. I lost count of how many women now in El Tabernacle that was barren that's having babies in their hands babies on the two sides. I even told her, you know, the whole plan wasn't given to them. Hallelujah. To multiply. Amen. Right now in El Tabernacle, wouldn't you like to be in a church like this? I just wanted to leave something behind. A elder in El Tabernacle had to have a heart transplant. You know about the testimony. He came to me. He was on his way to hospital. To have the operation on his heart. I prayed for him. When he got to the doctor says, \"Let's just check you again.\" And they checked his heart again. and they found out he's got a heart like a little child and he's still in E tabernacle. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] I'm nearly closing. He had a heart like a baby. A preacher from Freandal. His mother came to the service in Cape Town, not belonging to the church. But she came and we prayed for her. She was barren. And I think the next month or so, she fell pregnant and she brought this boy forth who is a preacher now in our church. Can thou believe? Can thou believe? Then I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Brother kid, brother Jerry's son, the elder was deranged. Had a deranged mind. They took him just about all over. Amen. Church to church, sang to Sangoma. [Music] Hallelujah. But he couldn't get his healing. I do not know who told him about El Tabernacle and they brought him to Eel Tabernacle and God whipped his mind. He's in his right mind now. Listen. Listen. He's in his right mind now. He even know how to make babies. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I just wanted to leave something behind. All these people is right here. By the grace of God. We had brother Grant Augustine's daughter's birthday the other day and the doctor says she will never make it. She's going to die. They're going to try and save the mother. And we prayed. Brother Grant [Music] gave the testimony and two weeks ago she turned 21. [Music] And you know what? She's now ready to make ground another opa because I just left something behind. What a church. What a church. Oh, God. [Music] We had a convention and the food ran out and there was just a little bit of food left and the queue was full very very long and they prayed The trust is prayed. And as they dish, the food got more. As they dished, the food got more. When they dished the last ditch, there was still food over. Like God multiplied the bread, he multiplied the food. I just want to leave. I just want to leave. something behind for you people. [Applause] I'm closing from Venda right up in the north near Zimbabwe. Amen. To the west, Cape Point. Right to the east, Durban. To the south of South Africa, over 10 churches and thousands and thousands and thousands of souls saved. I just wanted to leave something behind. From the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the token with emotions to the four parts of the word to the four aspects of the Holy Ghost to the son of man, the son of God, the son of David, the son of righteousness, back to the son of God again into the worship like John on the aisle of atmos when the book was open. Why are you worshiping? Because Revelations 10 is open and made plain and prophesied again. Healing accompanied all this. People raised from the dead. What is love? Explain. We explain what is love. The virtues came out of the Holy Ghost baptism. The guide says so. Corinthians 13 said so. Prophesying discernment on the back part of El Tabernacle. See all the prophecies there. Amen. The creation of the earth and the 70th jubilee in 1977. And give me a minstra. Let me dance. The evolution from the chimpanzeee to the serpent man to Adam to the real man, the son of man. Hallelujah. But for me, I enjoy preaching in El Tabernacle where the oil and wine is flowing. Not a painted fire because I left something behind. I just magnified my office when I said I left something behind. And what I like the most after all this, I like this very much. Praise him in the sanctuary. Now it doesn't matter which century. It could be Becket century, Ratif sanctuary, George Martin century. The Bible says praise him in the sanctuary. Why don't they praise him in the sanctuary? Psalm 100 says, \"When I come into the congregation, I'm praising him.\" Because you got to praise him in the sanctu. Praise him in the firminant of his power, the moon and the stars and the Milky Way. Amen. And the black holes and the Milky Way and the zodiac. Praise him for his great acts. Praise he the Lord. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. He's so great. He opened the Red Sea and he's got the power to close it, too. I just wanted to leave something behind. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a fluid. Praise him with a sexy phone. Praise ye the Lord. Praise him in the dance. Oh, I got to say that again because they don't can't even dance anymore. Let a old man show them how to dance, man. Praise him in the dance. Don't you want to praise him in the dance? Praise him in the dance. Praise him with the strings, instruments, and organs. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Now here it comes. Let everything that has breath, oxygen, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Shouldn't put this here. Hallelujah. Everything that has breath. Praise ye the Lord. I don't care if it's a lion. Let the lion's roar be praise the Lord. He's got breath. I don't care if it's a coyote. Let his back be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the bellow of a frog, let the frog bellow be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the chipping of cricket, let the chipping of the cricket be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the buzzing of a bunch of bees, a swarm of bees, let the buzzing be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's El Tabernacle, [Applause] Heat. Heat. If if there's anybody here, if there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, God will wake you up one morning and you'll hear the the the the birds singing and their singing will be to you. Praise ye the Lord. If there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, Jesus says the rocks will praise him. Look at the rocks praising him. Look at it. Why are we praising? Because full obedience to the word entitle you. Don't give it. It only entitles you. For the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. My Lord. So if you obey, then you'll dance. If you obey, you will shout. If you obey, you'll speak in tongues. If you obey, you'll clap your hands. If you obey, you will dance. If you obey, you will I want to say this is why I was born. To leave something behind. I left something out. I left something out. When he opened the Bible, God wrote in the beginning. God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning, the better sheet. And a better when you take it from the right to the left spells out the crucifixion. The Bible open up with the crucifixion. In the beginning, there's the whole thing. It opens up with the crucifixion, the barit. And it closed in Revelations 5. Behold the lamb. Amen. Full of blood. It closes the Bible and opens the Bible. For this cause, I was born to leave something behind. God bless you. Thank you for my birthday. I wanted church on my birthday and you gave me church tonight because I'm leaving something behind. Happy birthday. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I say I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words. You don't live. I'm trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm trying to leave something behind. God bless you. Jesus God. Words have come from men. No Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong cry. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be the Holy Ghost is gone. My work is done. Trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus. [Music] Oh, money is free. Can't help it. If God has chosen some flesh to walk in, I got to exit to [Music] you because I had to [Music] leave something behind. Oh, the future ahead is broken in red.

We got salvation in our hand. Oh, we're running the seven time. Oh, I'm trying to be Have you got something? Have you got something? [Applause] We are in the wrong mind and I cannot but I know I've been to his house but I'm trying to leave something [Music] behind Jesus Now there is a piece to my skin in my brain.

today if you have your weapons with you As You Are the children of God we are going to turn our Bibles to familiar scripture that actually coincide with the happenings today we have come from Johannesburg to ordain a young man We Believe the fire of God is in his soul that has chosen straight and another way I don't easily ordained any person for my 57 years you can count them on one hand I first want to see fruit before I ordain anybody and I saw this young man didn't go to other churches to pull people away from another fall and he went into the streets today we're both churches from other churches we can't then we split the church to start a church but you can take your head off for a man that comes start a church without anybody outside the brothers we think I hear you that you made it God bless you if I can draw your attention to the book of Ephesians as the scholars name this book as the best writings of the first messenger in it it dovetails and parallels the Book of Joshua and Joshua is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 11 you know the scripture but let us read it and he gave listen how it starts and he gave some not everybody although you can kick under Every Little Bush you kick a pasta out but the Bible said there's only some [Applause] [Music] it's not every football player that is a messy or a Ronaldo they all play football but there's one run out and there's one message so the Bible picks out of all of them some thank you some apostles don't stop there and some evangelists it's like a million not everybody can be a mayor but some that's why you can't help but take ministers and weigh them out you weigh them up why because some [Applause] the rest is not only there to fill up the Gap but they are not in the Sun [Music] some Prophets yes out of all the guys that say the prophets there's only some that's a real Prophets evangelists somebody told me brother Roscoe you'll never talk about evangelism evangelists I said now first bring me the guy that burns up the whole city and then I'll call him the evangelist if he didn't bring It One Soul then he is but only evangelist by name but evangelist pulls up to church [Applause] that's why you only have some that bring in Souls I had ministers for 40 years great preachers educational preachers but they didn't bring one Soul into El Tabernacle not one they call themselves evangelists but the work of the evangelists is not there some pastors to some of them not all of them some of them is 40 years here they've done nothing and now they leave the message where do they fall in they fall into some you cannot just join a church you're going to know why you're sitting in a church [Applause] and what will these five guys do they perfect the Saints and the minister in the church they would uplift and to edify the church they'll do anything [Applause] let us pray I think I'll really preach I'm not going to be able to finish this message father Jesus king God Jesus king of God we bow our heads before thee and oh God we're incapable to handle this meeting but father to fulfill all righteousness to not shun to declare all the councils we will stand in the gap and do thy will may you bless the reading of your word and oh God hide me behind the cross so the people don't see the scum that stands here but let they see the man that can cleanse the leper [Music] [Applause] I asked in Jesus name you maybe say that I'm sorry that you had to stand so long but if we Sing the anthem of South Africa then we stand the springboks are playing today and you're going to see they stand to the anthem of the hand on their heart and if we read the word of God this is the anthem of Heaven we stand to the word of God Amen if I should take a title out of there the way of a true preacher I'm going to ordain a preacher and that's why I'm titling this message the way of a true preacher and I want to take my inspiration through a prophet's message God call man [Applause] the man that God called that's why the Bible says he'll put into the church it's not the church putting in somebody as a pastor the minutes the church get involved in choosing a man of God they've been wrong all the time as long as the Deacon board come together and they put a man in there it is altogether wrong the minute the disciples chose Barnabas and not Paul because the church chose Barnabas they were wrong We cannot put anybody in behind this holy desk because the Bible says and God put bring that scripture back in and he who's he he gave he gave [Music] [Applause] not today we get a club of people a Ministerial Association in the message where ministers feel that one we're not having fellowship with him and we kick him out and we'll keep this one and we have fellowship with this one but the one they kick out is the one that God chose [Applause] [Music] we want people here behind the secret desk of God that is actually called a God that knows God we do not want hand-picked guys behind the pulpit and after 40 years they give up the message and they say that brother Branham is a false prophet they are hand-picked amen but if God put him to the church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you alone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and therefore I want to read the quote God call man listen to the title of this message listen to the vocabulary of a true prophet listen to what the man of God says the men of God says God has called The Man it won't help me if I call that young man because it is called by a man and it won't work and it can't work it will flop it will come to nothing if I have called that young man but if God called that young man [Applause] then nobody can stop him you can rather stop the Sun but you won't stop that young man if God has called him a man come hell or high water that young man will stand Hallelujah because he was not called by a man he was called by God Amen God called man I like that God is calling the man [Music] God called man God called man Page Six he says God cannot send a Revival till he's got man shake you take it why don't we have Revival in the message take me wherever you want to there is no Revival take me to a church that's a life there is no church alive take me to a place in the message where you can feel the Holy Ghost move there is no place take me to a place where people is drunk under the spirit there is no place why we were taught right [Applause] foreign they don't even know what's the Holy Ghost they don't even know City amen they know nothing about a Heavenly language they know nothing about speaking in tongues they know nothing about being drunk in the spirit why they're not shaped for the Revival [Applause] we cannot we cannot have a Revival until we get men oh I hope this young man is a man that'll shake the lovers out of Port Elizabeth [Applause] a god-called man listen to what he says God trained man now somebody's got a train somebody's got to train this man now if you don't have a trainer how can you have a man so you need a trainer you'll need somebody that knows God that's got proof behind him every man he's got fruit amen go wherever he goes That's truth amen you need a man like that to train this young man to come up higher amen a god-strained man [Music] oh [Applause] God's winning man that's not trained up in the schools of theology and of Education they preached today as if Oxford and Webster dictionary is her uncle and no Revival because they were trained in this in the school of theology come from the Bible School come from that school come from that school amen but they don't come from the train school where God trained his men [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when they preach it looks as if they swallowed in the whole Webster dictionary and there's no Revival there's nothing going on the people must take half an hour to actually work out what English word is used brother I don't have time for that I want some plain simple straightforward Gospel of Jesus Christ because the Bible says that the [Applause] that the simple heard Jesus [Applause] but you need old man that can train the young man now if the old man wasn't trained how is the young man going to be they gonna be twice as bad as the old man but give me an old man [Applause] that's been in the presence of God he can learn and teach the young man to be a god-called man [Applause] and he said further rugged Man of faith you don't have that rugged Man anymore because the man that that we have now in the message wants to be loved by everybody [Applause] and when you have a pastor that wants to be loved by everybody you got a compromise behind the death I don't want to be loved by everybody I want to be loved by God I want God's way to be my way every time Hallelujah I Wanna Be A Rocket Man [Applause] a rugged Man of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training he must be hated and not loved by everybody [Applause] and still walk through that and say I shall not recant Luther will you re can I shall not regain rugged me Rocket Man that will stand [Applause] Amen on the word of God Amen [Applause] thank you [Applause] yes Rocket Man [Applause]

even if you heat it upwards 20 times we are not going to bow young man regardless of how the fires burn against you we gotta saw water the fire is heated and heated and heat it you have to turn around and say beat it even more but we won't bow down to what you think I'm a rugged man I'll play I walk into the fire [Applause] they too scared to walk into the fire they do scared to take a trial they do scared when people actually come up against them but God wants rocket man that will walk right through all that criticism and say we won't repent [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] God call man they walk through the fire and I thank God I hope that when this young man walk into the fire maybe his friends don't like the stand he took maybe the church in Port Elizabeth don't like it but he's prepared to walk into the fire and he would have never met the thought man he would have never met the thought of man unless he was prepared to walk in the fire the fourth man waited for him in the fire and the fourth man is walking again that thought man is walking again the postman is walking again the boss man is walking again through the fire through the storm through the smoke and through the Heat [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign this is harmony how many did we how many did he throw into this fire I I I thought it was it was three that we thought through into this fire he said but there's four and the Fourth Man and the thought man and glory to God the Batman The Postman in the fire look like the Son of God Amen [Music] [Applause]

be the fourth man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] El Tabernacle Nebuchadnezzar the king the pastor of Babylon couldn't believe it he says bring them here bring them out of the fire and you know the dangerous part of it all [Music] the guys that threw them in the fire they died and if your pastor never taught you about the fire don't come near the fire you'll burn out you'll die and he brought them out and they stood in front of the king and the Bible says and the Bible says and the Bible says they took them and they smelled them and the Bible says and the Bible says they never ever smell like smoke not even smoke could get onto their garments and now because I said they don't even smell like smoke what smoke they never fell and smell like compromise or no compromising no smoke [Applause] no lovey-dovey with somebody that don't believe like them if you do that then you're smelling like smoke [Applause] rocket man who has come into the presence of God I know his power now if you don't have the Holy Ghost when did you come into the presence of God when the guys finish preach the church is dead dead there's no movement of the Holy Ghost there's nobody that's drunk they're making a mistake they think clamping hands and and shouting that's the Holy Ghost no that's the worship of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues amen that is the Holy Ghost and dancing in the spirit [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] now listen what he says men who are not afraid to face the fire men who come into the presence of God and knows his power they know the power two weeks ago or one week ago men stood up in the pulpit and said medicals count your money [Applause] oh you're there [Applause] [Music] when last do they see a miracle in this message two weeks ago a sister that had cancer Jonathan myself winnegan prayed for the doctor says it's all over and I mentioned count your Miracles one two three four I can hardly count them the Holy Ghost swept over the horse she got up to accept my miracle Monday she went to the doctors the doctors checked her he says you've got nothing there's no there's no cancer here no church can fly outside of the supernatural [Applause] [Music] count your miracles [Applause] a sister that couldn't fall pregnant right when the Miracles was going and the fourth man was walking and the fourth man was walking

surprise you because I know the supernatural [Applause] not only coming to church there must be Supernatural signs [Applause] [Music] some man that knows the Living God it's all right listen to what he says it's all right to be trained to train them by the word the prophet said the prophet said the quote says the Bible says it says all right to train them by the word is that the message is that what we hear the guy go to a concordance and he gets all the quotes on one word they come and read quotes he says it's not dead it's not the word it's not the quotes then what is it what did he says after that amen someone that's trying to know the loving God it's all right to train them by the word we're throwing them by the word all the years but we made a mistake it says spirit and then truth parrot and then the quotes [Applause] I don't listen to any guy that come into the pulpit I'll walk out I know he knows nothing he wasn't doing properly he didn't come through the school of the supernatural because brother Brown says they are trained by the word let's not do what he says but the letter killeth the more word you put in your church the more you kill the people you gave them so much word until now they don't believe the word get the spirit to get into the word that Dynamics to the mechanics then you'll see something moved [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know this is only my introduction all right [Applause] I'd like to put this one down and a teaching for this young man First Kings 18 20. now therefore sinned and gathered to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel the Elijah Ministry our ministry gather them around the pyramid Mountain and the prophet saw bar 450. and the prophets of groves 400. of them so it's 850 right 850. preachers [Music] and Elijah said Gather them gather them bring them what does an expert say the last which 850 preachers eating at Jezebel's table that means she supported her Jezebel was a meal ticket how many ministers is sitting at some rich guys table because he's pouring in money there [Applause] is no rich man that can buy this man unto expensive [Applause] I don't sit at Jezebel's table to have food amen I work for my food I don't need no rich man to sit at his table and prophesy what he wants me to prophesy a meal ticket young man don't let anybody buy you [Applause] the way of a true minister doesn't sit at the table of these rich guys [Applause] they work for their money you know here's page one I haven't started preaching you [Applause] so the Continental Doctrine of the anti-message is for a young man to watch a woman to watch money to watch popularity money woman popularity how many of these men fell with women well you know that seven times this is the seven Villages but you slept with four women you want to tell me that's the virtues you're playing Seven Virtues huh and the guy that brought it amen died and he said he's gonna come back with blue eyes you wouldn't like this eh you don't like it huh but I'm here before all of them [Applause] woman money locks on a woman it's the same spirit when you have money you want more money when you have one woman and you've got a human Spirit you want another one Same Spirit when you are popular you want everybody to like you Same Spirit that's the Cardinal Doctrine of the message [Applause] what is it money Balaam woman Samson Delilah popularity Saul and then when they die these Thunder guys foreign but seventh under seven virtues [Applause] both fool somebody else you don't like it that's your business okay God called The Man God put into the church not the church put into the church Jeremiah 23 verse 4. and I was I God will shed set Shepherds over them which shall feed them the guy come to the pulpit and he's got nothing a quote after a quote after a quote after a quote they light the camel dry you know the quotes back to front how can you still read quotes to me that's 57 years here I know that I need something fresh on that quote and the only thing that kept the word fresh is that Shekinah Glory the only thing that will keep the the quotes fresh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] and I will put Shepherds not the church God will put Shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they lack saith the Lord they will be fed they don't eat this week out of the garbage cans of the Pentecostals and tomorrow TD Jakes and after that old son and after that amen the Thunders and after that they leave the message they get to a place where they have a Shepherd that feeds them they don't have to go and get fed by anybody else [Applause] they will lack nothing the Sheep will be fed [Music] so we are not ordaining a gift I'm not gonna attain this young man because he's got a gift I'm not ordaining a gift we are daining fruit because everybody's got a gift [Applause] I had men that as a gift of preaching that your hair will raise after they preach but there's no Supernatural there's no souls coming in they got a gift but they don't have no fruit so I'm not ordaining a gift I'm ordaining fruit Romans 11 29 says for the gifts and callings of God or our worth that guy can have a preaching gift and he's not even repented but he's got a gift because God gave him a gift it's without repentance Matthew 7 20 wherefore by their fruits you shall know them you want to know what's the right thing you want to know what's the right Pastor he wants to know what's the right man of God you want to know what's the right Ministry there's only one way to know it by that fruit

Baptist meeting for 10 minutes that the church is dismissed and there you go you didn't even do a stitch foreign my sister told me before she died she was a Pentecostal preacher she says Edgar let me tell you something today I'm laying on my deathbed but let me tell you something today Edgar so what is that he says you know when a man stands here when he finished preach we know that he'd done his homework [Applause] oh [Applause] oh my God I'm I'm 57 years in this message and even more if I take it from 1951 when he laid hands on reads then he said I don't know how many years [Applause] the preacher must impersonate the gospel brother Abraham says what's the gospel good news he says what what he says it's Dynamics and mechanics and brother Abraham turns around he says now if you have the Holy Ghost come up here and my poop but brother Brown challenge the message the the preachers in this message he says come up here and come and preach and let the Holy Ghost go between the people let me see you can do it nobody came but if you ask Edgar Roscoe I will walk up because I let the Holy Ghost fall rise around the world that's the gospel [Applause] you must impersonate the gospel it's the power must imitate the gospel must copy cat the gospel you must be a carbon copy of the Gospel you must mimic the gospel you're a clone of the Gospel and then what then what Pastor Oscar what until he become the gospel on two feet [Applause] okay [Applause] [Applause] young man you must go on in your eager to suit of the war and more and more holiness not Holiness alone but more and more and more holiness equals godliness [Applause] [Music] more and more and more holiness equals godliness they must mistake you for God liness and add to your faith godliness what is godliness provinces to be like Jesus and then he says to be like Jesus to then he starts singing with that gothy voice of his to be like Jesus to be like Jesus oh I won to be like him so holy Soul me and lonely Paul I want [Applause] to be [Applause] [Music] and when you become with him and you'll act like him and you talk like him and you walk like him and then brother Osco and then your Trials come now my young man let me tell you it's not tides it's trials [Applause] they all want to become Pastor because of Tides [Applause] another young sister or said to some sister oh my my husband is maybe going to be the pastor you know and we'll get all the tides I said Lord give them trials that they give up [Applause] it's not trial of Tides it's trials more and more trials if you're preaching you don't have trials go back and start all over again you have must something because now if you don't have trials the devil likes you [Applause] I'm gonna close the preaching man must become the prayer man that's his weapon The Preacher Man must become the praying man because that's his weapon brother Roscoe why are you so successful why is all your churches right around the country full I don't have to put a seat here and a seed here and a seed here to pull wool over people's eyes at my church is full put the seeds together then you only have two rows full the churches don't even have a hundred people anymore what's going on you're here for 20 years and you don't even have 20 people but what about you brother Oscar I got 3 000 in one place why because the preacher man must be a praying man everybody careful man but be careful [Applause] but [Applause] that's an undying unending weapon the ears that hears him he is him forever if he prayed over the sermon I want to tell you something you know in the lockdown nobody had Church and we just play tapes and I baptize a hundred people without having church just from the tapes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the ears that Hears A man that comes from his knees hears him forever the anointing just come off the tape we play tapes that I preached 25 years ago and that tapes will still win souls why [Applause] why must he pray because the real sermons is made in the closet in the study alone with God when he is alone with God then the real sermon come and he preached that sermon and that sermon is energized for 20 solid years [Music] Hallelujah and the people that hear that sermon says man it looks as if this thing was preached just the other day why because that sermon was made on his knees in the closet of his study [Applause] the modern preacher the more money he gets and the more secure he is by money amen is the preacher that has come up from his knees he prays and he gets and he don't pray anymore no ready Mana the Mercedes-Benz Equity you know Mike but [Applause] I'm going to close I don't say the man say closing he never closer he lies I didn't say what time I'm gonna close [Applause] but lest they pray the more money they make they pray Lord give me a million God gives him a million and then after that they don't pray luxury spoils the preacher it takes him from his knees and close the engine of his soul towards holiness these profound as conviction is born in secret conversation and communion with God oh my best times is when I'm alone and I speak to God that's my best time [Applause] that's the reason the world over go wherever you want to I challenge you in the name of God go wherever there's a message Church and go and see how weak the pulpit is just be honest you know there's no honest people in this message they're not honest ly why must I hear one quote after one quote after one quote amen and I know the quotes I'm hearing the quotes for 60 years man certificate it's Anna the life-giving preacher is the true man of God oh I like a thirsty preacher man that makes other people thirsty what a man that is after he leaves the pulpit he sermons lost for over 20 years [Applause] now the preacher that kills is a preacher without the spirit that's the preacher that kills near my end Spirit isn't moved by the word is false anointed ones and the word without the spirit is false anointed ones and the spirit and the word without the spirit is foolish virgin if the spirit isn't mixed with the word it kills the latter killeth by the spirit giveth life remember this young man never preach without the Holy Ghost it's the letter preacher that kills that preaching without the spirit kills why do you think the message right around the world is dead because we only gave them word all the time right in America all over they did why because there's no spirit it's in word word word word word man is a bunch of nonsense says it [Applause] it kills word preaching kills so a young man makes that word with a meal and the oil you'll have a cake coming it's a letter preacher that kills the word messages are only word in this message and the person because those has a glorious time jubilating praising God even without the word they're more happier than what we are so when I'm in a message you know we're going to hold my message you know but just do it he's doing it [Applause] the elected Pentecostals forms the headstall now how can you be elected Pentecostal when you sit like this the preaching that kills is a shapely and orderly and eloquent and fluent Place preaching and no spirit it kills more than error this is told the letter it's told that date later the letter was dead in the Old Testament it was cold it was formal until that seed came into the New Testament and the duck flew over Mary and then the the word loved but it was dead all the time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Philippians come Glory no God is Not mocked you can pull all over people's eyes but someday they're going to find out [Music] [Applause] God is Not mocked people think they can fool God we think we can fool God when we say the Holy Ghost without emotions and there's no quote for it you're trying to fool God you say the seven Thunders is the Seven Virtues and there's no quote for that I asked brother Twilight Mr brother here and just put it

the elders healed sister ghani they are here brother Branham calls him the angel of healing the one that stirs the water an ear drop in there and you get healed by that angel at the beginning of thy supplication at the beginning of your prayers when you're laid in front of me the Commandment came forth and I have come to show thee but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do what Point number one to finish transgression Point number two to make make an end of sins Point number three and to make reconciliation [Music] for iniquity Point number four and to bring in Everlasting righteousness Hallelujah Point number five and to seal up the vision and the prophecy Point number six and to anoint for the last time the most holy the six-fold purpose that's why I said you cannot preach purpose unless you preach a mind and when you preach mind you cannot have mind unless you have a prophet therefore the prophet could say six fold purpose and then he comes back in a seal book everything God has three fold purpose and he comes after the seal book and he preached the threefold purpose and they stealing the messages but that same message on purpose they preach they're going to stand in front of God and give an account what they've done with their message brother Branham reaches and the gold mines and the diamond mines of South Africa he means more to us than anything else so we thank him and we praise him what a wonderful savior is he don't you love him this morning now it's been preached The Invasion it has come into the newspaper and that's a rock newspaper and brother Branham says this if a man preaches and God comes behind it like that then it was not the man it was God [Music] [Applause] so we must have heard the voice of God in this couple of months that has elapsed now I can only come and fulfill my purpose and fulfill what God sent me to do and I cannot vouch for anybody else but even if I try to do something else I can't because every man of God is in prison like Paul being a prisoner of Christ we can only do what God has ordained us to do on this mother earth nothing more nothing less and we want to finish the course we one till to get to the bottom and that we could turn around and say we didn't shun to declare all the Praises of God all the councils of God before we leave this world behind and it's so very soon that we're going to go home and we're going to do everything in our power and you see how God is Healing The Sick we had another and announce of last week and Saturday the young sister fullness and told us in Cape Town how are the people is getting healed and I what I'd done was after we had the prayer line I came behind I says now some of you still have the pain and you still feel sick and all that I said but after a while the Holy Ghost will visit you one by one by your house I said the I said the angel of the Lord will visit you one by one at your homes and uh for this last three weeks the testimonies are coming in and last week and Saturday nights sister back at home when we just came back from the um uh uh combined or was it Sunday one of the two days but it was just after we made that announcement and then she told my wife please tell brother roscom that we stole getting in testimonies of the healing power of almighty God psalm very sure something going on we're not just coming to church and sit around the Supernatural is all around you and you supposed to be in desperation amen and um Shiva spoke about the message says even I a lot of churches outside is buying the message that I preached down there pain and um we really glad for what God is doing no I had quite a few invitations to go out this year but as we see such a lot of things are happening I don't feel really or maybe if God speaks to my heart I might move but as far as my mind is concerned because my heart can only do what my mind says and uh as far as my mind is concerned I'd like to stay around and just see a couple of months left and get behind me so I can feel okay because [Music] um everything is ready everything is planned and purpose and on the verge of breaking forth so we really thank God that we posted my concern goes a lot to the young people I am concerned about him and I want you to get the Holy Ghost because if you're not going to get the Seal of God you are not going to stand repentance is all right it's good to repent every day please but the conversion is the thing the Holy Ghost is the thing it's good to be baptized but friends you can be saved and yet not converted and conversion only comes by a baptism so we pray that God would invade you as brother Lenny or Somebody Prayed with the Holy Ghost then I'll feel good then you can go to as many sessions you want to go you can smoke as many cigarettes you want to smoke you can go with any wealthy friend as much as you want to go I feel safe because you're gonna run away there the Holy Ghost is not going to keep you in one of those places so before visiting those places and having a worldly friend get the Holy Ghost and once you have the Holy Ghost then you can do what you want to do all that I know that you seal till the day of your Redemption so my work here is to give you the Holy Ghost God can't do anything in the interval unless he sealed the 144. with the same baptism that's here now I'm glad that God has given me one thing in this life to give out the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm satisfied and when the young people has the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you can touch one another I want to see if you will be able to go like because the Holy Ghost is a counter it can't smoke it can't drink [Applause] it can't touch a woman it can't touch a man it's a counter can't look at television that's the reason the people fear it can't put the see-through blouse on can't put a short dress on can't have bob hair cut hair but I like the sconther amen so let's get the Holy Ghost a lot of things are going on a lot of things is going past many people but God has been good to us their eyes is open about a year and a half ago we preached when money fails many thought it was just a good message many thought it was just a time to pass by in the Church of God but it was prophecy we told you when you start seeing things like that look up your Redemption is drawing now and those other things that we're watching because brother Branham told us to watch it those are the things that we underline because brother Branham says underline it [Music] and just a couple of weeks ago in Time Magazine how low can it go how low is the dollar and I told you when I preached and I came back from the states last

plunging and when she goes money fails right around the world I looked at how the Jesuits worked out the whole thing what has the dollar got to do with the Yen and with her Benchmark and with the Rand and with the power what what I mean what but it shows you there's power behind the monetary system and the German's money is one of the strongest in Durham Japanese yen is the strongest but they say if this still goes down further than they their money that's so strong will have to go down as well when the dollar goes the whole world goes for each two years ago this day the scripture of Genesis is fulfilled in front of your very eyes [Applause] where Joseph says in Genesis and money fails now when money fails then also on the other side the perfect man is just about to be birthed [Applause]

wife and myself and I won't mention some of the sisters that she mentioned and down in Cape Town whenever I go down there and they said man we don't want to listen to anybody but when brother Roscoe come we want to be there because we're going to get something and she turned around she says yeah I just wish that you don't put too much emphasis on the man to let the man fall because we realize that God gave that man something but the tower is too late for any falling it can only be a rapture [Applause] so Wednesday night we're gonna play again when money fails to you bring your mind into rapturing faith and if I catch your mind I don't care about the perfect man character forget you here I've got you all the other things will be added then this alone was a message I Can Say Goodbye

And after you tell it on a mountain, tell it on Rosco Hill that Jesus Christ It's born. &gt;&gt; They don't want it. We will have it. Oh my. The greatest time of the year. There is no greater time. This is the only time where a Muslim will bow before the present king. This is the only time that the Jews will close their shops and say going to tell it on the mountain. This is the only time that our tabernacle is not drawn to a Christmas tree, but they chased to the tree of life. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills. And I say I say everywhere. This is the greatest time of the year when kings get born. &gt;&gt; They get born in palaces. Beautiful garments. That's when kings get born. But this time when a king of king is born is not born in a palace. He's born in a stable. Because he [music] that was rich became poor so that we that poor can become rich. The greatest time of the year. Oh, praise God. So that's why we're going to tell it to the mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you tell it to the mountain, it echoes back. Your voice come back to you that Jesus Christ is born. We don't care when he was born, what month he was born, as long as he was born. Emanuel, God with us. A star led them to the birth of Jesus. They followed the star. The challen wise men follow the star and the star took them to Jesus. Our day, the seventh star took the wise virgins. The wise virgins. I can't hear you. the wine virgin to where Jesus Christ is born. Amen. That's why I go tell it on a mountain over the hills over Edgar Hill Soul Hill. The hills in Bloomington, the hills in Cape Town, the hills in Victoria, the hills in Johannesburg, the hills in Upton, the hills in Abodine, the hills in King Williamstown, the hills in the Cape Province. We can tell it on every hill that Jesus is born. That's why you need to be born again. And to be born again, you need the spirit of God. So Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain. And when you tell it on the mountain, let the bride receive her king. Are you ready to receive your king? Let the bride receive a king. For he has come and is born in the joyful atmosphere of El Tabernacle. And when the magi saw him, they were full of joy and they opened their treasures. After opening their treasures, [music] then only they open gold, frankincense and myrr. And they say the gold they brought for ordinary king is more than 5 million rand dollars. And all the gifts that they brought was over a billion rand. When that boy was born, he was born a billionaire. And when Edgar Osco is born, I possess [music] everything BECAUSE WHY? I CAN tell it on the mountain. Hallelujah. Oh, Christmas is a time of giving. We all give and we receive gifts. That's Christmas time when you receive gifts and you give gifts. But what gift did we bring this morning? We need to give him something, too. Hey, what game did we play? [music] This Christmas we give him our gift. What is our gift? The thing that he appreciates. Watch that. Your body, your soul, and your spirit. You give as a living testimony that you went to tell it on the mountain. Your body, your soul, and your spirit. Three things you're giving him. And the magi gave him three things. gold, frankincense, [music] and myrr. But all three things is something from above, not something from below. So go and tell it on the mountain. Why I'm finishing off? Why, children? Why? Why must we tell it on the mountain? Why? Because Christmas is to do with the heart, the soul. What's Christmas? Christmas is all in the heart. Christmas is not in the Christmas tree. Christmas is not in the snow. Christmas is not with Santa Claus. Christmas is not with the gifts. [music] Christmas is not with choir practicing. Christmas is all in the heart, your body, your soul. Are you ready to give him your gift? [music] Then if you're ready to give him that gift, your pastor is telling you, \"Happy Christmas. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you as we going to tell it one more time on the mountain.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd like to welcome you all. Although we have been welcomed at the beginning of the service. But we thank the Lord that El Tabernacle &gt;&gt; is not at Bloomfentine or in Estras or in Cape [music] Town. El Tabernacle is at the convention center. I rode in this morning and I saw the sign at the gate and the name is Convention Center. There is no church that has that name, Convention Center. We've come to adore him because the Christ is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; We've come to adore him. There there's no place this morning Wherever you can go that they adore the Christ like here in El Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle knows how to entertain, worship, and adore him. And how do we know he's here? Wherever Jesus is, there's a little noise [music] in Tabernacle Convention Center. There's a lot of noise. So let's just give Jesus King gone a shabbak this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you the one next to you can't hear you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We received the greatest gift. There is no greater gift that could ever hit the globe, but it hit El Tabernacle. the greatest gift. He's here in our midst. [music] He has come down to deliver his people. Amen. So on behalf of my father the apostle the god that has come down in that body we wish you merry Christmas everyone in our midst this morning it's Christmas in our tabernacle Cool. not in the message in El Tabernacle this morning. [cheering] It's Christmas. And I heard the apostles say, \"There's wise virgins here.\" And wherever they are, &gt;&gt; because they carry the oil, we have come. All of us. All of us. We have come. Herod asks why are you here? They say we have come to worship him. Why are you here all the way on the road? We have come as the wise virgins [music] to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We want to thank God's apostle for this convention. We want to thank him that we we all made it. &gt;&gt; When we thought we had a busy year with a man of God preaching almost every week for us, we thought the year's over, but we forgot there's still Christmas. The year is not over yet. The service is not over yet. We still coming back on Saturday because the year is not over yet. It's Christmas. [music] The apostle went over and above to give us the best meal for today and for the convention. Why are we here? Because there's a man that wants us to know it's Christmas. Sister Abigail said the meat is already cooked. This good meat we're going to eat is already cooked. So the food is waiting for us. But we still need to give another Shabbach to the Lord and realize it's Christmas. Amen. We want to thank everybody for the birthday wishes. Brother Katiso, are you here? Where is it? Amen. There. Happy birthday, God. Man from the apostle from El Tabernacle. God bless you. We are happy you in our church. Amen. Stay as sweet as you are. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Then the apostle asked brother Joe, the preacher of Bloomfentine, the apostle said he wants to announce it and I'm going to announce it. He has special gifts that he sells &gt;&gt; and the apostle was so appreciative of that gift. &gt;&gt; So if you see brother Joe, get the gift from him because it's a nice gift. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have church. Though there be one today, but we're going to have a week full of church. It's convention. And I want to be of them, brother Malcolm. That says I was at the whole convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. When wherever the apostle is, there was a convention. &gt;&gt; Since I know myself in El Tabernacle, I was in a convention. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So be welcomed. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; We waited long for this week. I could see you were under expectation but the services has started. [applause] And in closing, I would like to say to the Jews, a son was born. According to the apostle, if you know, but to El Tabernacle, a son is given. Jesus came down and he lifted me up. So, are we going to kiss the sun? the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The greatest thing that there is. May God bless you, El Tabernacle. Enjoy the fellowship. Enjoy the convention. Enjoy this [music] day. It has started. And may you be merry. Don't be sad. Put a smile on your face and be married. We have God with us. That's why we are here to worship him. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. We can't have all these things if God is not with us. And if you don't believe the man, believe [music] the works. We can't even write down what happened this year. But we believe that if the works [music] testify who is in our midst, let's give the Lord a shabbak. [music] God bless you. And merry Christmas. [music] Amen. You still appreciate our precious pastor Jonathan. Amen. Would love to call up the tithes and the offerings. If the Ashes can just place the tithes if you can remain standing. Jesus, King God, Jehovah Elohim. [applause] Lord, we are grateful and thankful, Father, that we are in you, our house of worship, Lord. [applause] Father, can you heavenly father bless the tithes and offerings, oh Lord, and Lord, bless the hand that gave and that couldn't give, oh Lord, in a merciful and mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just one more time, wherever you are, don't you want to just welcome one another? Just give your neighbor a beautiful hug, a high five, and remind them that it's Christmas. Just say, \"It's Christmas. Tell somebody is Cana. Can you feel it in the air? Joys everywhere.

priority that testified to me as well and then when he came there he said to me my brother I won't stop testifying until the whole future becomes the UL Tabernacle um those words actually came in straight into my heart and that's what I told myself as well is that I won't stop testifying until the whole Beauty becomes the new El Tabernacle [Applause] uh so the first test we actually have a lot of testimonies but uh because of time I'll just say a few that are close to my heart or the ones that threatened me in my faith in L7 naked uh so last year so we were actually at the at the rest is normal so it happened that one of the students there they She fainted and When She fainted now they try to wake her up and then to pour water on here but nothing happened she wasn't waking up and then the rest manager actually he knows what we are Christian so he said no they have to call those guys they have to call those young men's to come and help us and then they call they called us and then we looked at her and then yeah she was not moving nothing and then we went to the study here and we told them that okay everyone must come out and it was only us and the brothers and the and that girl and then we took um we we played an instrument a mystery and then when you play that instrument um we started uh we started praying and then we prayed and prayed and prayed and then I heard they're screaming once and then she woke up and then when we put out actually when we got out to find out that the rest manager was standing at the door his wife was also there all the students were there they even called the ambulance to come and take that girl but when we came out with her she was fine completely fine [Applause] and then yeah it was it was a big scene my brothers and sisters because even those people of the ambulance they didn't know what happened they just too careful test but we went the following day she told us that she was perfectly fine [Applause] um and then the next testimony I would like to share is actually the one whereby um I realized something about this man that we have here the apostol uh is not an ordinary man brothers and sisters now it's not an ordinary man this man doesn't just preach the weight he unknowns the weight I believe everywhere that comes out of the Apostles mouth those words they are anointed I remember this other time I was actually testifying to one see stuff from the University of Pretoria usually here if she's baptized now uh I was just I was testifying to her and I remember this one time I said you know what my sister next time will speak I will be telling you about the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost how do you receive the Holy Ghost and how do you know that you have the Holy Ghost and then I didn't know what where to start I didn't know what to say so I decided to watch the one of the Apostles tape is called how do you know you have the Holy Ghost I actually listened to that tape and I was like saying to myself I'll just get some something then I'll write some few notes and then I found myself writing almost the whole thing and then when I was done I think I had two or three pages and then I called there I said okay now I'm ready my sister and then I started reading what the apostle was saying as I was reading she was aiming but when I was left with a half a page she was crying and I asked myself ah maybe she doesn't like what I'm saying but I continued reading and the time I was almost done she started crying my presence because she cried and now I didn't know what to say anymore because I kept on saying amen my sister amen you know what the Apostle says after the surface that's what I said I didn't know what else to say and then I hanged up the call and then after that I was thinking what just happened and then the thought just hit me and say remember you were fellowshipping about the Holy Ghost and then says if you can speak about the Holy Ghost and nothing happened then you will lie [Applause] and then I realized that actually what I said about the Holy Ghost it is what the apostle was preaching and then the same thing that happened on that tape happened when that Fellowship when I was fellowshipping to her and then as I continued fellowshipping with that girl there was this other day I posted a picture of the Apostle on my status and then I wrote The caption I said The only voice I know and then she replied and said what do you mean I called there and said that's what I mean it's the only voice I know she said to me are you saying that this man is God I said yeah I believe that this man is God [Applause] and then she said to me she said no no no wait wait from the church I am from they are telling me that that man is God so she was from zcc she was saying that man is God I said yeah there are many gods but we don't just want any other court but we want the core of the Bible [Applause] I said um you want the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the god of Isaac that's the god that we are looking for we are not just looking for any other God but we are looking for that God and then I could you took the Bible I said you know what let us put these two Gods on the test you say this man is God I said yeah he's God I'm saying this one is God but let's check which one is the god of the Bible and then I Fellowship to her I told her about Genesis 18 as it was in the days of Lords I told her about the desire of the court of this Bible I told them everything that I know about this God and then after some okay and then it was fine after some few months I think she was in the message there was this other day she was on a call with another sister from nelspruit he says the sister spoke and then she had three voices at the same time she said she was scared now she hanged up the call she called again she had three voices okay she said my sister do you have flu then no I don't have flu but he said hey what's happening now she hanged up the call and then she was sitting on his on her chair and then she says that as she was sitting she saw she saw the Apostle Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Julie's [Applause] and then that's where I found out that I that's why I found out I'm sure even now she knows that there are many chords but we have found the core of the pirate bless your Saints I reach all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's actually a lot of things to say about this ministry uh not knowing where to start because the Lord has done so much for us uh just start by sharing a few testimonies because I'm actually in the University of Johannesburg but I'm working together with the brothers from Val and the president Justified to me is the brother that just spoke we actually come from a place near the border of Mozambique and also Swaziland the reason why we call it nelspade is because I believe that it's a place that many of you are familiar with and um but the name of the place is actually Gomez so by the grace of God in 2019 the brother testified to me I was still doing metric at the time and I remember he went to University at the time and what really took me up by this ministry is that I have known this brother all my life and all of a sudden there was just something different about him I've known him all my life I knew that this Prada we used to do worldly things together but all of a sudden I remember it was during October he told me my brother I found a church and I thought to myself okay you found the church and said to me no but we'll talk when I get there I said no it's fine he came December I remember he started testifying to me and the first time I saw him he was there was just something different about him there was just something about him that I couldn't understand and even the way he spoke the things he was telling me it was things I've never heard before I've been reading the Bible but it was different so now I thought to myself okay this is new and at first I was a bit resistant but the more I spend time with him the more I started to change as well the more I spend time with him the more I something happened to me so by the grace of God I remember the first day he played to me was the mind of Christ and when the apostle was preaching the mind of Christ I remember there's this part where the Apostle says now lay hands on one another and the brother laid his hand on my head I laid my hand on his head I never told him this but it happened after we were done praying he removed his hand and there was just like the palm of his hand there was fire on my head and I said this is God I realized that this is God and since the time I came in it was 2020 it was locked down so we couldn't come to church for two years I couldn't come to church but I was testifying it was just a fire in my soul the things that I heard it was just too much for me and I remember at the church that I was at I remember almost everyone that I got in contact with I told them about the things that I heard I remember at the time it was tips such as uh modern events made clear by prophecy I gave away my wedding comment it was such tips that I told them about that a woman is not allowed to preach it was the basic things things that were supposed to know but for me I remember when I took it I thought that everyone else is going to take it because he this was the truth and I had the mindset that the truth shall set you free I thought that these people were not free so let me go and tell them so that they can be free and by the grace of God uh the whole December so now another story the whole December I remember we were speaking about the apostle and I remember I didn't know him at the time I didn't I it was my first time hearing about this man but there was just something different about him I remember we came to one point we were fellowshipping with the brother the whole December through fellowshipping about revelation 22 16 and he said that no the Apostle is the Angel that's what we had that's the first revelation that we had because the Apostle says you grow in Revelation so we were growing in Revelation you're getting closer and closer and closer so what happened was what happened was um what really shook us is that every time it Fellowship a brother would come in a fellowship the exact same things that he was speaking about so that really shook us but the most remarkable thing is that the whole December through we're speaking about the Apostle being the angel and if you remember Saints the 31st of December 2019 the title of the Apostles message was I sent my angel before you [Applause] so after that I I remember I was supposed to go to university and things didn't work out I believe that God wanted me to stay at home because there were other things that came in during the time testifying and mind you come from a place where at the time there was no deacons no Elders nothing it was only us young people but the tapes kept us alive and I I remember the the statement which Paul made he said I'm uh absent in the flesh but present in the spirit so I think that God was there because he as I said we have a lot of testimonies but because of time we can't share all of them so just going back a bit to what happened this year not very long ago it was last week and last of last week at rest there's a sister from the same rest that I stay at I testified to her last year by the grace of God she got baptized and she's also testifying as well we're winning souls for the Lord so what happened was uh last week we were because sometimes we come together and we have Fellowship so the sister came and there was another soul that she came with and there was another sister which is a message believer she's not in church but she's a message believer so I remember her telling me that I met this other sister but she's a message believer and she said to her that she asked her do you know about El Tabernacle do you know about the Apostle she said she doesn't know anything about that I said it's fine my sister we'll talk about it when we get to the fellowship so we go to the fellowship I remember um as we started fellowshipping and the only thing I could tell her was the quotes of Prada pranam where he speaks about 1946 was the cold weather speaks about that angel he says those seven angels are Earthly Messengers but he says that there's that one angel that will come to announce something he says that there's that one Angel that's gonna come and he's gonna announce something he says that angel is revelation 10. so I was telling the sister about that and as you continued speaking about taking out the quotes and then I started I just drifted I don't know what happened but I just found myself speaking about the jubility how the apostle was raised how he grew up the testimonies he had and all of a sudden uh the sister as I mentioned the sister from rest I won't mention any names but the Holy Ghost fell and she started feeling the Holy Ghost and I could see that the Holy Ghost is falling and not only that since but even the soul that you brought with the soul that she brought with God's slay even the message believer got slain [Applause] and since um even I think last week Wednesday uh before I came to church because I think that Wednesday he was supposed to share this testimony but due to change of plans we had to come today but even that Wednesday before I left I said to the sister my sister can you please all just come together and let's just have a fellowship because I won't be there on Thursday and Friday and she said it's fine my brother we came together and I remember we were fellowshipping the same thing happened the Holy Ghost came down again [Applause] and then now um in closing uh uh as the brother said that um he doesn't believe that the Apostle is an ordinary man and I'd like to say that um I remember when he came in the ministry he used to share his testimonies with me told me you know my brother I had a dream about the apostle but I think that with me and as I mentioned that I only came to church after two years with me I wasn't that much bothered with not dreaming about the Apostle I believe that God comes to all of us in a different way and with me there was just something different there's just this feeling that I get whenever I the the angel of the Lord is there and there's even the sister from nelspruit the brother mentioned about her that sister can attest to that I remember there was this one time I went to where she stays and we had a fellowship I told her my sister connect the angel of the Lord is here and all of a sudden the sister started feeling the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost was present so the last testimony I remember there was this other sister I was testifying to we used to go to the same school together but I take her as my little sister and this sister I remember we spoke and over the phone he was speaking and I was sharing to her about um uh what I was listening to because we only had tapes and there was some brothers that used to Fellowship to us another product from secunda so I was listening to a tape and I remember at the time if my memory says me correctly I remember it was uh the revelation of Hell and its Dimensions part two and I remember I was sharing to the sister about that um tape and all of a sudden the sister was responding but something happened and as the sister there was a moment where the sister got silent and I but I could also feel that the Holy Ghost came and all of a sudden I just heard the sister Scream the Holy Ghost came into the room she was speaking over the phone so I felt that the Holy Ghost was present and believe you're saying this this was happening even before I got baptized I only got baptized in 2021 February but then it was still 2020 and every time it Fellowship the Holy Ghost would come down [Applause] so now this is the when she screamed and she fell down on the floor and as I said I was worshiping I just put the phone down I started worshiping and all of a sudden as the Holy Ghost began to subside and then the the sister came to me uh she came back on the phone we started speaking again and then she told me brother you won't believe what happened I I said to her my sister what do you mean she said to me uh something just happened she said to me when I screamed uh uh my sibling came into the room and asked me if I'm fine and she said uh to The Sibling no it's fine you can go out and The Sibling left the room close the door she said she felt as if a door was opening again and when she looked the door was closed and she said that the thing is with her door when you open it it makes a noise she said that she felt a presence in a room once you fill that presence in the room she said when she looked up she saw a light and that light changed into a figure and the figure was a man wearing a white suit and she said the man wearing a white suit was the Apostle at the hill roster foreign amen let's give him a hand of Praise amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

said that I am uh going to count U the restoration of the Gloria and um the veterans that's there will be bringing back the restoration of the Gloria so I am not against that I just want to show in this in this video clip that I'm going to play to you that the restoration didn't take place and I just want show you that for 40 years up till now after the 20 um 2024 restoration of the Glorious meetings it's not back in any other Church what you're going to see here so I want to say this that I am not fighting this anymore because Monday my whole perspective changed as said we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believes what he believes we don't see what your father sees and your father don't see what I see that settled it for me because a thing that had me all was Ezekiel when you see somebody do wrong and you don't straighten him out he's blood is on your hands and that was since a young man that he had me that's why I was so bold but I told God now that thing is off me now everybody sealed in and everybody believed what they believe so I will not be going into these things anymore as far as speaking about their beliefs they can chop me with my beliefs it's fine I think I'm big enough to take it as I said with George Martin I'm not going to mention him again and I could have I could have blasted them now with a split you know but it's not my business that's their business they got to go on I must say that I had some people that went to the breakup Church of George Martin and U they did report back to me I I went as far as that you know I just wanted to know if I'm right so uh I hope that you're honest brother brandham says the gospel trumpet is blowing and it's the good news and it says the good news is the Holy Ghost is here he says how do we know it's yeah you watch how it works its manifestation and then he mentions one of the things which the other things I'll mention with my next message um one of the things it brings back is honesty to be honest so uh if the Holy Ghost is y back we're going to have honesty and I just want to be honest you look at deog Gloria what is deog Gloria you young guys you know and see if it going to ever be able to hand over de Gloria to you young guys thank you and I'm not fighting H you can come behind me and write me and say what you want to after this tap I'm finished I'm not going to answer you we cannot leave you and listen in 1983 84 when it happened in de Gloria it's in shock waves around the world that bright stirring it stirred the world Listen young people you may not realize this what happened here in South Africa and mind you Kimberly bar is actually the center of South Africa few kilometers down the road there's a pole there they believe that's the center of South Africa so God chose the center of South Africa C the bride here to meet us here to have literal they seen the fire the fire fell people were slain anointed filled with the Holy Ghost amen and uh it went around South Africa around Africa it hit America they took it back South America Allelujah Europe amen Germany all places of the world Amen the anointing from de Gloria went is that right by the way it went around the world from here so we are happy we're not bragging but we're happy to say God chose us we represent the Bride of South Africa we representing the bride and Africa we're representing the bride around the world this morning as God saw it fit to start here with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost unprecedented anointing that happened here in 84 unprecedented aen the world that to recognize that what can we say my God Amen a brother in my church had a dream on December 2nd that twice a Thursday and December uh 1st and he had a dream that uh it was in a like a like a hot place and brother Musgrove brother rusco and myself were there was very warm like South Africa or the tropics he and there he was sealed which was back in New York and he said but there he was seal and he seen the cloud and Three Angels like like smoke coming down here they are amen and it had the dream two times and charity poured out at the last day the holy spirit is here now and God has confirmed it what can we say bless the Lord the eyes that see and the ears that hear we are here we are here we are here praise God Amen now you have heard what brother woman said the Gloria actually didn't just start it started with a dream a vision that um brother mazov myself and brother Coleman uh was in the tropics hot place de your Gloria as brother Coleman was saying and uh Three Angels dropped down and and he showed you the photo now if you can make up your mind this is what bog Gloria is brother colan and myself mainly brother mazra wasn't here in 83 I think and 84 he came I think and um then we were together but the thing started with brother colan and myself that is the Gloria by a vision that's why we had the meetings there you can make up your own mind what you think it is the Angel was first cited at El Tabernacle in Johannesburg before the Deo Gloria convention in this video brother Coleman clearly experienced his first genuine touch during a significant outpouring of the Holy Spirit following this sister's testimony she shared her encounter with the mighty angel of God during another meeting in Johannesburg sister bapsy was the first witness to confirm that the Angelic visitations did not begin at the Deo Gloria convention instead she had multiple encounters with the angel while staying with the late sister Moses in Johannesburg see aen from Johannesburg she has a testimony that Sheen the angel of [Applause] the you say but brother can we see angels listen your man read the book of Acts in the book of Acts there was Angels te in all chapter and the Heart being rest back it's Angel time again um again I don't have to explain anything here brother Owen was interpreting the sister with cut off the the tape it's on tape we have it on the other tape and um he uh interpreted it and said well the angel was first seen in Johannesburg before de Gloria I don't have to say much and I don't want to say much so you make up your mind and you believe what you want to believe but this is de Gloria I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I've never ever experienced the supernatural yet until this morning I was just sitting there and a sister came up and she gave her testimony that she seen an angel I was sitting there I just raised up my hand closed my eyes just to worship and through my closed eyes behind OE I saw I saw a big guy standing behind him standing Head and Shoulders above him dark colored long hair [Applause] [Music] Barefoot now after sister bubs on on the tape has testified and own testified um while she was there there that same angel that sister BB was speaking about and uh brother Owen was speaking about brother sh saw him on the platform and he gave a testimony yeah and um I just like the way brother Becket was actually aiming uh uh brother Schubert on this very issue here you know if you have if you have the tape you can just rly back and you'll see brother back at at the back there shouting amen hallelujah so that big Angel was prevalent and present right after Bubsy has testified about the angel being in Johannesburg first so you make up your mind what you believe and then I just want to interject here why we um I'm playing this so that you can say don't come from me now the angel of the Lord was first saw in 1979 in Johannesburg then I never told Brother K nothing then we had the coronationville uh Crusade with brother Coleman when he came and he saw that angel and his presence then Coleman called me one side it's like brother Vick said the behind the scenes things then he says brother Rosco when did this happen so I said no October month it happened and then uh brother Becka came and asked me to dedicate his church and I prayed because I didn't know if this was right or wrong and I told the Lord if this Holy Ghost Falls in brother becket's Church then I will never side away from it I said brother Coleman then it did fall in Becka church we have the video of it and uh from Beckett's church then coronation happened where the same thing happened and the people that stayed around the coronationville hall saw smoke coming out and they found the police so the Holy Ghost came down 1979 before deog Gloria 5 years before the GL de Gloria meetings or 4 years before the Gloria meetings all all depends if you take it 83 or 84 and then I want to remind you we're going to play a small Club of 1981 in P Elizabeth when brother Coleman came up and um what happened there so we just want to show you how the Holy Ghost got a hold of brother Coleman when when it was said about the angel of the Lord in [Applause] Johannesburg the mechanics back charity we pray this morning dear God May the young people may you smile upon the testimony may you see them [Applause] away Oh Glory [Applause] Glory Hallelujah HJ receive now here again this is the glory where ministers receive the Holy Ghost now where are we going to have meetings like this yeah brother Coleman the one who brought the Thunders the originator of the seventh Thunder Seven Virtues got so full of the Holy Ghost that he danced and I also got the Holy Ghost there and Owen and them said they got the Holy Ghost there and we'll show you just now brother SMY of Sanai how he got the Holy Ghost there now do glorious to do not only with the people but with ministers receiving the Holy Ghost so you make up your mind and think are they going to get restored back here and we will play just now what own said 40 years it's gone we'll say something on that I like to feel the Angels behind me I want of feel the seven angels in [Applause] them I want to feel the waves of Glory coming from behind me and from in front of me the last time I was on this platform I preach to seven Thunders I thought I was in the graveyard but this time I feel like I'm in glory [Applause] no more graveyard the seven sons is not [Applause] dead now again it raises question marks it was said that the the seven Thunder inspiration brought the Angels but here brother Coleman says when it came that was 1981 brother own is sitting right at the back in P yeah you know and just before that he came from Johannesburg so he said the first time he came and preach the seven Thunders graveyard now how could brother Coleman that preach the seven Thunders say he came to a graveyard when he came but now you feel the angels of the Lord behind it because he preached in Johannesburg in 1979 when the Angels Came now you make up your mind because you sure heard that they say the seventh Thunders uh uh uh inspiration 7th 7 inspiration brought the Gloria the says when he came it was a graveyard it was a graveyard and it was a graveyard it was a graveyard but when he came 79 he told is going to take this South African worship and it was not South African worship 79 it was El tacle worship and it's still Al Tabernacle worship back to New York City and then what did Joey sing No American SP what initiated in the Gloria or in Johannesburg so that whole thing falls through the Met because Coleman says when he came it was a graveyard he preached and he tried to preach the seven Thunders you make up your mind everybody I I'm I got to the place now that um I really appreciate what brother said you know your father believe what he believes and we believe what we believe believe you know so we see it different than what he's seen it and he see it different than what we see it I have come to the conclusion of that I am not going to fight anymore because I believe we're all sealed off in what we believe there won't be anymore speaking about seventh and Seven Virtues if you believe it it's up to you but I am this video just to show you what the Gloria is all about and you know I can't say much because Jean already blasted the thing you know and real bad so I'm not going to blast this thing I just want to show the young guys like Vic said we're going to hand over the pattern now what type of a b are you going to hand over with what brother Owen says there was a law for 40 years yes so we don't just want the word restored we want the power restored we want the Holy Ghost restored we want the supernatural restored amen hallelujah went through aoud and so forth 40 years and it's still AOW after now we don't have this that we see in here on this video it's only seen in alter anle and I'm sorry to say so if it hurts you I'm sorry but it is a truth that it's only only found in Al anle that angel never left us it's still here so I am not fighting I am showing the young guys the truth [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] refilling all the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord reform me tonight bre for me tonight Lord God give me a brand new touch tonight Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Lord here am I do not pass me Lord while on other th calling do not pass me by Lord I need a touch from you tonight Lord I'm feeding that Camel Lord I want to write it now I want to write it Lord I want to write it I want to write it [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah the angel of the Lord is in the camp he's here as brother Brenham says in God's Eagles he stands next to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you okay now this is been Harris in October month before de Gloria and here we already speaking about the angel before the Gloria you know so the problem is is now was the angel first saw in deog Gloria or long before theog Gloria because this is not P Harris before the Gloria October 83 this happened in the states and there's the same Angel the same worship so how come it is not here now and it's not it's not in the Gloria point one and it's not in pen Harris anymore and I want to say this I'm sorry to say it is it because Edgar Rosco left and I'm going to play you a clip of our December convention and even the last combined meeting where everybody saw on Saturday how the Holy Ghost poured out with nobody in the pit no band playing nothing just the angel of the Lord moving for over an hour on the people so it sto with us it left Coleman it left pen Harris it left um uh uh uh de Gloria and I'm quoting brother Omen pal which he honestly said for 40 years and it is 40 84 to 2004 is 40 years judgment No Angel no Holy Ghost no pouring out like this whatsoever so you make up your mind again I am not fighting you know any fool can see it black and white I got all the tapes I got all the tapes you know and I got all the full tapes I'm just playing you little shots because we're handing over the Batton to the young guys they must see what the pattern is that they need to run with this is the pattern [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] what can we say Amen the intelligence is here that's not a man that's the Holy Spirit that's here now amen praise there was a binding spirit in here the there was a hole in back and God used his servant to bust a thing it's free now Glory the Holy Spirit has now to baptize you tonight amen praise God I feel the same anointing that was in Holland Saturday night is here now it's only 8:25 this may be your day this may be your night oh hallelujah praise God that same God that came down in the upper room on 120 Souls that same holy spirit is here tonight praise God to seal your way into the kingdom of God don't you back up now come on praise God Press Your Way Hallelujah glory to God praise His Wonderful Name the holy spirit is here oh praise God hallelujah my my let's have a word of prayer almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray for them now father this is the Holy Ghost night there's many in here that want to be married to the lamb Glory let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and father in order to be wife we have to have an experience oh

hallelujah that they might be ready for the call to the mar supper Glory let us be glad and rejoice praise God God for many shall be sealed in the name of Jesus Christ we ask a blessing amen and amen Oh [Applause] [Music] Glory my let me share something with you with the Saints down in Guyana in Bur beast and how they I thank God for this little group holding out they don't want none of those pastors coming around that's against the Thunders and so forth they want brother Brown's message precious brother in Christ God bless you and greetings to you the past and all the Believers in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ trus in the Lord that you and all the other Bethlehem dwellers from the local Christian Assembly are pressing towards Perfection praise God no Pastor last week we had a combined Fellowship service with both groups of Believers here in furnish uh furnace a furnish we listen to the marriage of the Lamb by God servant brother rasal before the message even was through the Believers went on for hours watering the camel brother rasco's message way down in Guyana South America my praising God for ours on on their knees we raise up from our knees with a new vision and a determination to press with all our might to Perfection God is already here that Joseph is here I got refilled brother we are convinced we heard straight from the Throne of God our lives have changed we can never ever be the same everyone is desperate and now on expectation waiting for his or her day to be sealed away the season is here and no devil can stop us so what can I say this is before de Gloria and the angel of the Lord was here and went down to guania and Bless the people for hours there so how could de Gloria produce the angel of the Lord and from the Gloria around the world how can it be here it is before the Gloria and uh I clearly remember how dead this meeting was in penis like brother Coleman said again this is a seventh Thunder meeting and it was dead at a breakthrough and it wasn't the first time twice it happened in colan's church that the church was dead and it took me 6 minutes for the Holy Ghost to come down and visit and then keman came back in in in in in Flores Hill and said this place was dead you can put brother Rosco in a graveyard when he start praying and preaching the dead will rise up and say Amen because we couldn't move you guys here again in pen Harris it was dead that's com's own words then who brought this Angel there again before the Gloria and that angel went right down to guania the same Angel before de Gloria now that's why I said you make up your mind am I lying colan lying or was it lies last year in the Gloria 2024 who was it lies who who's lying I leave it to you I'm not I'm not perturbed anymore because I don't want to speak about these things anymore like I said I finished with George Mar I don't speak about him I never spoke about him again even if you had that big big a breakup and the things those people are saying the same people that was against me and wrote all that commments against me was the same people that's now Downing George Martin so I don't have time for these people they now with you tomorrow they dump you like a hot potato the way they dump brother tum down there I don't even have to go into that so again this is the Gloria the Gloria was still going on before theog Gloria and after deog Gloria we still have a de Gloria in Al Tabernacle and everybody knows that you make up your mind I don't care anymore we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believe what he believes you know so there's where we are now we're all sealed in and what we believe everybody's sealed in on what he believe we'll see when we get Yonder who was right and who was wrong if I'm wrong I'm gone so you make up your mind I'm playing you the videos I got all these videos and I mean by now Raymond must know that I'm sitting with all the old radio or all the old uh uh tapes so I can go scratch them out whenever I want to if I want to know what rock um brother um uh Mike and them when they were with us and Monty what they said way back there I just going to take the tapes out and I can play it so that they can hear with their own words but now you have 2024 theog Gloria and you have that words and now you have these words you can pay it up it's not my business anymore you know I told every girl after I heard well we believe what we believe you believe what you believe that settled it for me even if I catch a pastor in bed with a woman I'm not going to say anything I'm going to walk on Hallelujah the angel is here now close your eyes and say Lord seal me Lord Fill Me This Is Your Night this is the visitation 1983 GL Hallelujah the angel of God himself is here hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Jesus Loves [Applause] Me we pray this morning de God young people when you smile upon the testimon hands when you see them [Applause] awaiting was the Lord all the [Music] time he was [Applause] there all the waiting patiently so patiently and [Music] love he was there [Music] the he was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there praise [Applause] God and something told a brother to take another snap and he snapped to the sky there right here we have all the ministers that receive the holy ghost in the Gloria from that angel now why am i showing you this because this is what the Gloria is all about not only the people receiving the Holy Ghost the ministers from Goldman down if that don't get actually Revisited again then you can't have a restoration and the question comes the people is asking now why did it leave for 40 years why is this not seen nowhere in the world but in E Tabernacle I don't know it's up to you and my Congo Brothers you cross from me because I said the Holy Ghost left what did I mean by the Holy Ghost left this is what the Holy Ghost was all about this happened at Coleman de Gloria class room right in bis's church and across the world this is what happened but I don't see this no more so did hlyh leave if you don't see this anymore look at how many ministers here is drunk under the Holy Ghost where did you see this this needs to be restored how can we restore this if you don't have the right guys to build a Revival on you know what brother Braham says God get a man and he prepares him to build a Revival on him you know you need the man that God buil the Revival on and the moment of that left 84 then the whole thing fell into chaos according to brother Owen Palm 40 years and I thinkk Owen because he's honest okay I hope you not know what's handing over the pattern of the Glory it's a hell of a big beton it comes from a vision then into a classroom then into uh brother becket's church then into um the coronation convention then into the PE convention and America you know that is the Gloria that's the glory of God you can't have this I I agree with Jean you know we don't agree on a l of things but when he said this is not going to come back I agree with him so I believe what I believe you believe what you believe that is now the Criterion out Tabernacle we have come to a place that brother said you believe what you believe and I believe what I believe I want to see ministers being slain like this the last time I saw it was 50 to 100 ministers in Brazil with B this thing happened in the temp praise God you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost you can be sealed away Hallelujah you can grab a hole of the altar tonight praise God Amen Hallelujah Lord God my all is on the alt I'm waiting for the fire waiting waiting for the fire all over this place the angel of the Lord is seeing hallelujah praise God Amen hallelujah praise God the young people are sing outside praise God God is busy moving like a magnet [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God the fir of God is here tonight oh Hallelujah the angel of God is here [Applause] hold on hold on don't let go tonight I will not let you go I will not let you go until you bless me praise God hallelujah hallelujah so Hallelujah s Hallelujah forever [Music] I pray your visitation of the angel in South Africa here he is Glory brother brandham did not have to come back the angel has come back himself Glory that angel is here now Glory he's sealing the people Glory you begin to pray Lord seal me Lord seal my children father don't let them so here we have The Minister's wives under the Holy Ghost I'm not speaking about the congregation I'm not speaking about I'm speaking about the ministers and the ministers wives that got folded up where is that is that going to come back you know I agree with you brother John I'm sorry I don't agree with you with many things but this is something different than anything else and the big question is why did it leave why did it leave brother Coleman why did he leave the seven Thunders why did he leave South Africa this very thing that started in South Africa it's up to you again to make up your mind no more me the precious of me me I'm going to have a good time after this and I'll believe that you can believe even a Jehovah Witness Doctrine and I told God I'll speak about it very very soon all the power of God is all over the place hallelujah thank God for anointed Minister amen edar Rosco do you know what edar means Ed means protector of property Hallelujah he is protecting the property of God you are God's Property he is protecting you that's why he's blasting you that's why s I'm hitting you hitting you hitting you [Applause] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus after I came back from Johannesburg brother sister Hallelujah the very first the very first uh day after been back we had our Wednesday night service and I related to the dear ones what has happened what God is doing on the land brother sister you know what happened this Sunday morning after I came from the cross of Amen coming to preach the word of the Lord there was no time to preach amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost strike that place until the worship went on for three solid hours no time to preach the worship went on for 3 hours listen this is the hour for God's power and for the manifestation Hallelujah [Applause] Jesus loves [Music] me yes now yeah here we have brother theck and you might make out what he meant by saying those words he came from the r which is Johannesburg and he experienced it in Johannesburg not de Gloria Johannesburg now who's lying am I lying but fine you know this tape will be played at electron judgment to show where the thing actually happened and here brother even brother minty they lays on the floor he also as a minister received the Holy Ghost where are we going to have those days 40 years those days was gone and I stress it why did it leave Coleman pan Harris and de Gloria for 40 years why never again did they see this you know everybody says brother Oscar because you left and that's the truth I left 84 and from 84 there was nothing going on I went back after I went up there to brother um uh in Canada brother Ed bisco and uh I preached there and the Holy Ghost fell until 1:00 in the morning and uh I first went around there to Coman and them and when I sat there I told my wife she's gone she's gone and it was nothing there when we got up to to uh uh uh Canada there she was again so I'm asking you this is what the people pick up because it's all I got that of of what have happened in in Canada I got it on tape too you know we'll play it sometime and uh the same thing happened there a de Gloria happened there after years after de Gloria so now the problem again is why did it leave why is it gone what type of Aon are we leaving for the young men so young men if you don't see this then you don't have a restoration of the glor Ever from the vision of Ken who will be in the Gloria and it was proven by Three Angels you know so it will never be proven again thank you there brother I started tape service bruty I hired the hall I paid the sign the lease I bought the real and I picked up the people and started tape Services now I don't want to argue about who bought the reals Raymond all that I ask tell me from who did you buy the reals please don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals like you say I would like to know now remember Raymond I know the history of ative so don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals that's all that I want to know and then also even if you did that this is the quote that I would like the people to read brother say God don't work through Mechanical Devices he use human instrumentality we put tears that quot so it don't help us to go against the prophet you can't put a tape recorder on the street corner and expect people to come in people never came in with a tape recorder people came through human instrumentality just like God's Prophet said so I don't even want to query and argue that because s renica told me the same thing that you bought the reals and I knew it was not sold and all that I ask just tell us from who did you buy the real and as I was saying here is the two sets of tapes that I bought for Al Tabernacle she always had two sets of tapes now if Raymond had bought tapes where is he set this first set is still here that was totally hopeless that V done in the early couple of years of making tapes we only got fter tapes late when I bought the second for e e tacle so if he bought tapes for E tle where is the tapes I'm the pastor of el Tabernacle I know no tapes Raymond that you bought I was here before you point number one point number two Raymond I am the pastor and not you point number three I am your brother-in-law I frequent your house for many years I never saw a set of brother brandham stes in A's house never so I don't know what you're talking about but don't make a mistake remember the real to reals came out before the cassetes you said real to real I just want to know that because that will be my last encounter with you with a real to real and a real to real big tape that tape was so big I'm not speaking about a small tape recorder I'm speaking about the big one the real to real tapes with the real to reals I want to know where did you buy it from the reals and um that's why when they wanted to destroy the cassette tapes I said no leave it it might come up as witness one day and I never thought that will come up now after Sor reica said you said then I remembered I still have the tapes I still have the tapes now any common sense any person that's honest any real end time believer will automatically think if El tacle had two sets of tapes one from V and one filed why why did they need another one from Raymond Thompson that means we should have had three sets of tapes here you never had a set of tapes at home never a full set never I frequent your house so I'm not going to query that you can say you had but just tell me about the real to real so that I can tell the world because they're going to immediately know who's lying you on me from who did you buy the real to real as you said here now I was the pastor of el Tabernacle the next thing I want to ask you if you were so great with the tapes who stopped the tape you you were the the the maduna I sto that tapes I stopped the tape meetings you know why didn't you go on with the tape meetings because I was a pastor and I put a stop to it and I know why because I spoke with I think George vuk and we checked something out and we realize it doesn't work nobody got saved there wasn't one tape meeting that we had where where we LED somebody to the Lord not one so don't come and boast on things that is invalid tapes don't work yeah yeah they're trying push and tape it's not working why are you always busy brother Rayman with things that falls to the med always I'm not fighting I'm asking and uh you know uh the reason I just have to explain what is happening why are we having this convention you know I think it was about two years ago me and pastor and spoke and he just spoke that he says he wants to host a convention where all the young ministers can preach you know so I thought to myself you know the young ministers will always be there but I mean the elderly ministers we don't know how long we'll still have them with us so this convention we decided that we want all the veterans to preach to us at this convention okay uh brother Tim Timothy said that Raymond is initiated this convention and again another flop another flop because brother R comes back he says so happy is here de Gloria blah blah blah blah but he is happy because of a flop now how many times must a man flop pure flock that every minister is talking about this flock and he don't stop and the people still follow him I can't go on with this anymore as I said he believes what he believed and I believe what I believe zedekiah also believed that he's got a Holy Ghost and Mah don't have so I rest myself from now onwards with this but I still want to hear where you bought not the cassette the real to real tapes where did you buy it from Raymond don't make a mistake here thank you oh take my life take my thoughts Lord I don't want to worry about anything oh fill me with your Holy Spirit father fill me with your spirit Lord Lord We Worship You We Praise You Lord sweep over my soul Spirit of the Living God for fresh on me today Lord Break Me Lord melt me Lord fill me with your spirit Lord [Music] hallelujah oh Hallelujah GL to God thank you Jesus

good news it's good news it's good news the news are good good [Applause] he w oh w w [Applause] we I showed you exactly the same is still happening in Al Tabernacle without doubt here it is and um I want to say now that um this you'll never find in since Raymond Thompson left and split my church as he had it in his lawyer's letter when he left in ' 87 from that time till now Raymond you never had this up till now you don't have this so nobody has this but El EO only want to be honest if that was the angel and it's still here that means the angel is only in E Tabernacle visible and manifested yeah I brought out a quotation where brother brandham says the good news is the Holy Ghost is here there's the Holy Ghost nobody actually pumping nobody in the pit no musicians amen and here's the Holy Ghost here's the quote here's the manifestation you cannot argue it and nobody in the world can argue it it's still here so I thank you it's your problem now to work out who lied I want to also just put down here remember brother B say what make the people dance what make the people shout what he says a supernatural being in them you don't have to pump you don't have to ask please clap your hands please shout like you guys do in the Thunders say Amen say this you know it must be an automatic thing like in Al Tabernacle they shout because brother Braham says something tickles their nervous system to yell out and scream you don't have to whoop it up God pushes it out of the people automatically and that you only find in alter eckle everybody asked for a hand clap shout and all that that's not the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost thank you I'm [Music] finished is Tru still [Music] Mar Satan triy is best to block it but there's no power on Earth that can stop it TR [Music] still over land TR still eternity true [Music] TR TR\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2022-06-20%20-%205%20DAYS%20TO%20GO!%20-%20Unknown%20Speaker.txt", "text":

We um want to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have um set this thing out to do this clip and um for tabernacle we have mentioned it as we're going to have these this meeting on the 10th of October Friday night and um we thought that we'll just put out this clip so that um uh our church around South Africa could uh get ready for this meeting. So, um we're just going to have um a little talk around it. to um actually sketch a picture of um this meeting. I'm quite excited um to actually uh preach it and go into it and um I know it is going to be a tremendous blessing to um to uh this part of the bride of Jesus Christ and a person can only do what's in your theophony and uh I believe that this message is certainly something that's been laid in me before the foundation of the world to bring out and preach. So let us go into it. &gt;&gt; Thank you apostle. Thank you for your time. and we let go. &gt;&gt; So agree the church and the saints at large. May God bless you. Um thank you for your time, Apostle. Apostle Mike, first question is that I see you are preaching a lot around Matthew 25. What is the reason? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, a good a good question. Um it's uh it's special to me. I preach on it 13 years ago and I must mention uh Edgar uh that it didn't go well in the message when I preach it and um I got a little bit of stick for preaching it and um 30 years ago Huh? Because the majority of the message believe it was Pentecost is a foolish virgin. And um but going through it, you know that the spirit of God speaks to preachers. He showed me that it isn't and that the foolish virgin is in the bride and not Pentecost. And because um they went on that brother Brandham seemingly has shown to the Pentecostals, you know, but there's a lot of things that brother Brandham dropped that clearly indicated to me 30, 40 years ago that is in the message and uh in question and answers. He says um the foolish virgin is closer home than what we think. And uh that actually stirred my curiosity that uh Pentecost is not closer home. It's not here near us. We're miles apart. And then I could see that brother Brham was showing where the foolish virgin is going to be. And uh then he says in the 10 virgins she's a virgin. You can only be a virgin through the word. and Pentecost don't have the word so they aren't and will never be a virgin and brother B says both of them are virgins you know and that further showed me that the only virgins you are going to get will be in the message then it says she is so close it will deceive the very elect if it's possible and he makes the sister read the scripture Matthew 24:24 so another point that it could not be Pentecost another point that it clearly shows it's in the message so close Pentecost cannot deceive us. Their mouths apart. You know, you just look at a woman and you know they're not close. So that's another point that shows that it is not Pentecost but in the message the foolish virgins is amidst us. She and the wise recognized the same voice Malachi 4 and woke up. Pentecost don't recognize brother Brandham's voice. They're not under that voice. So that is another point that it can't be Pentecost but message. They all press and play. They know the voice of the of the of the of the messenger. And that's another point, a proven point, a solid point to show that it is not Pentecost. They're in the message. right here with us. So um and uh brother Bham says in question and answers if you know what watch that voice came it was not in the first watch it was in the seventh watch go meet the bridegroom. So that voice is a seventh angel's voice which is brother Brham and Pentecost don't recognize that voice. So it is a clear indication that the foolish virgins is amidst the bride. Then um it says that they all woke up to trim their lambs. The wise and the foolish got up and trimmed their lamps. Now the lamb we all know the psalm writer says the word of God is a lamp unto our feet. So the lambs is the word of God. So all of them had the word of God and the word of God in the seventh watch is the message of the hour and they all had the same lamps which they all were under the same ministry of the seventh angel. So um it is another point that makes it more at home than anywhere else. We should not even look at a Pentecostals or anybody else. Those guys are here. Another place brother says the hypocrites. They act as if they are, but they not. They act as if they are bride, but they're not. And that's hypocrisy. That's the reason when you look at them, you can just see it's a facade. It's a put on, you know, and that's another point. And brother Brandham goes on in the 10 virgins. He said she preaches the word you know same he said same like the wise virgin. So they had the same word they all they press and played you know and they said the same thing preached the same thing. Brother Brandon says, \"So Pentecost don't preach the same message we preach.\" So again, it's a proven fact that they write here amidst us. And um the prophet says she had everything. The wise virgin had everything. She believe in the blood. She believed in sanctification. Brother Bland says she believe in the atonement. She preached the word. She preached justification. She preached a healing. All the same. And she had a clean life. Brotherson, her life was as clean as a whistle. He says you couldn't put your finger on a life. That means when a guy don't live a life, you can put your finger on him. according to 10 virgins. But with a foolish virgin, you can't you couldn't even do that. She was just as clean as the wise virgin. They had everything the same. But brother Abraham says the only difference between the two was the oil, the quickening power, the good news that the Holy Ghost is here. That was the only difference. All right. &gt;&gt; So now if we look in here and we look at them then or in a message you have to look where the oil is because the oil determines whether she's bride or not bride because she's got the lamp. She's already got the mechanics, but she don't have the dynamics. So, you don't have to worry about the word because she's in the word. But what brother says, I don't care about the word, the mechanics, push and play. I'm worried about the dynamics that must come onto the mechanics. So when you are in a end time church, if you're vigilant, then you will look for a church that has the dynamics and the mechanics. I think in question and answers, he also say uh uh he also says um um he likes a church that's full of the Holy Ghost, you know. So what make them foolish is that they know they don't have it and yet they go on which is foolish. It's like somebody tells you don't smoke, you're going to get cancer and you go on smoking. Is that intelligence? It's not. And uh then what comes to being is what brother Brandham says in Daniel 70 weeks. My wife's quote, she used to like it and she always used to tell me, Edgar, this people is willfully blind. You know it's it's not that they are naturally they like what Africans word says as they're going to show you're going to stay in this message under this pastor regardless if he's wrong. So that makes them fools and um because a real Brian member will look at the thing and say this is not right. So, I'm not going to be a fool to follow this thing because this thing ends up in the third dimension of hell. So, foolishness is brought in Matthew 25. And uh what I would like to bring out the Bloom team is they foolish and foolish is to know the truth but you still go for error. You're a fool, you know. So you can look around. I'm sorry to say this and I don't mean to be ugly. How many fools have you got in this message that knows the truth and go against it with everything in you? How could you get u Matthew 25 which is prophetic? It is the coming of the Lord. And in that coming the groom tells you what I want from you is oil to come in here. The Holy Ghost I want you to have my spirit. And I could never understand it when we were with brother Coleman those years. We we would like to quote this quote out of question and answers where brother B says the foolish virgin rejected the atonement in its fullness. I could never splice it. I could never ever get my thoughts around it. But now going back into it, I realize that the oil is a seven spirits and seven church ages. It's a baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So the statue of a perfect man is the full atonement. It's the whole blood. Brother Abraham says the token could only come at the end. Why? Because those seven bloods then came and made the token, the full atonement and they rejected it right at the time of the coming of the broom. Now you want to be bride, you have to be under subjection to the groom. And what the groom wanted was oil to enter in the Holy Ghost. and they rejected it. This message, nobody can come sit in front of me and say they didn't reject it. Nobody. They had many things to say about it. It's hogwash. It's Pentecostalism. It's it's emotions. They just tag everything on it that's ugly. and it became the rejected stone. But I thank God that there was somebody in South Africa that when we go pick up that rejected stone and today they all wanted after fighting all those years today they want it and they don't have it. It's like I told brother Owen Palmer I says Owen just be honest tell me where can I find the Gloria where they preach on it the Holy Ghost but there's no glory nothing there's no atmosphere nothing and yet we want to later on preach on the gospel or what brother mention what the gospel is and where he says that um um the Holy Ghost is the main main thing greater than the word greater than press and play because the Holy Ghost brought press and play the word. So, brother Bam says it's greater than he quotes the scripture of uh speaking against the word, you'll be forgiven. He said, but speaking against the Holy Ghost, no forgiveness. He says that's the greatest. And that's the reason we call this the greatest sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we busy with the greatest thing. And um uh we want to preach later on on um um the working of the Holy Ghost. Not the Holy Ghost. After you have the Holy Ghost, where's the working of the Holy Ghost? Some places they call it the acts. acting, you know, how did you act when you received the Holy Ghost, you know, so we can Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, but you need the working of the Holy Ghost. If you say the Holy Ghost is here, let us see in your church how does it work. You find people say, \"Okay, let let us worship God.\" And the pastor goes there and he blah blah blah, you know, he's the alpha, he's the omega, he's the beginning, he's the end, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And the church also go when he say amen, it stopped. That's not Bible worship. Bible worship you find when the uh tabernacle was dedicated. The Bible says the glory of the Lord came in and the ministers couldn't minister. You know, you can just stand there and the Holy Ghost pours out. That's Bible worship, you know. And uh when the minister's finished blah blah blah blah and the alpha and omega and all that, you know, when he's finished with that, then ship, it's cut off. No feeling, no atmosphere, no pull. And when you take that back to the Bible, you don't find that in the Bible. Find in the Bible emotions. You find in the Bible speaking in tongues. You find in the Bible the working of the Holy Ghost, signs and wonders and miracles. You know, you find in the Bible, you know, the um uh supernatural happens find in the B people drunk and you know a whole deal Gloria and you don't have the Gloria. No way. Dio Gloria means the glory of the Lord. So it that's why I um I'm on this thing because from Revelations 10 the prophecy how could you leave out Matthew 25? Yes, &gt;&gt; cuz Matthew 25 hooks up. I don't know if that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Apostle. Thank you. It it actually leads leads into my next question. Um, we we saw when the announcement went out for the services, you've captioned it for us to have a prophetic insight in Matthew 25. Why would you say that? Apostle &gt;&gt; why um if we believe that the seals is prophetic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's a prophecy. And um then how could you leave out Matthew 25? Because Matthew 24 is a six seals. Matthew 25 is a main seal, the coming of the Lord. Behold, the bridegroom will cometh. So if I had to preach on Revelations 10 and never came back to Matthew 25, then I haven't done justice to Revelations 10. &gt;&gt; And then ask yourself the question, is Revelations 10 prophetic? Why don't anybody preach on it only a prophetic class? So that's the reason when I saw that that it actually slides in to the seals and also when it comes to the twins he'll bring Matthew 24:24 on which is in the six seals. It's close. So that's the reason um I that's one of the reasons I hooked it up because it's the coming of the Lord, the seventh seal. Matthew 25 is the seventh seal. And um the wise virgin Edgar is the book of Revelations 10:2 because their names, the wise virgins names is in Revelations 10:2. And that makes it prophetic. That that brings a hallelujah. You know, if we don't if we didn't tie it up over here in the book of Revelations, then we would have had a broken Hallelujah. But so great is this thing here that you can take it and rush it right back to Revelations 10. Her name in the book which is in his right hand. Psalm Revelations 10:1 is the bridegroom. Revelations 10:2 is is his wife. So how can you go wrong? You know, and she's got his spirit. That's why the prophecy says the spirit and the bride. Brother Bible says &gt;&gt; they were one. Now where did they become one is when she filled up with oil. So it is prophetic and that's why for all these years look the message is nearly around for 100 years but nobody ever touched this. You know, they might mention it, but they haven't got insight. This has to come again in the prophecy. Revelations 10:8, prophesy again. What are we doing? We're prophesying again, but out of Matthew, out of the mouth of the guru. How beautiful is that, you know, to to be able to sit here and look at the whole thing played out. But the scary point is what he says, it's it's so close. They got long dresses. They got long hair. They Brother Brandham around the corner. They push and play. They believe the word. They believe in the atonement. They believe in the crucifixion, brother Brandham says. And they have all that and they just show oil and they miss it. So why go to a church that has all that and you know there's no oil there? That's foolish. That's why the Bible says foolish. You know the truth, but you don't accept the truth. and to him that knows to do good and don't do it to him it's sin. So the insin and sin cannot enter heaven. So yeah, that's why we believe what um what our revelation tells us because it swoops in to the message. And how are they going to hear again if there's not somebody that's coming to preach it again? I mean, they were all shaken up when they quoted Revelations 10:8. &gt;&gt; But how is it does it work? How's it going to be preached again? And some guys ruined and run and say, \"Well, that's the bride. You're right.\" But the whole bride don't preach. There's only a five-fold ministry in the bride that preach. The rest is bride, but they don't prophesy. It takes those five guys to prophesy. And I'm sorry, I have never heard any of them prophesy again. And nailing it down again, whether you like it or not. Brother told me revail and and and and and then uh preach on it said way where way reale didn't even believe in it and up to now he can't answer me he rather got cross so um that's why um it I call it prophetic insight. And I'm making it worse. That's the greatest message that has ever been preached. And I'm going to say it when I preach it that Friday. Why I say this is the greatest message that was ever preached. Show me anything greater. Especially when brother Bram comes around and say the Holy Ghost is everything. And I can take you and show you it is everything. So I think that God really wanted us to come back and speak and preach on this. And I say it again, not only the church is going to appreciate it and like it and lift up their voices and their hands about it, I'm going to feel the same. Cuz as I drew up that message, I drew waters out of the wells of salvation once again, you know. So the criteria, I mean, how could he put a criteria in the seventh seal and he says this is the criteria, not even the word, the Holy Ghost. And that's why we're going to read those quotes, you know, that he says he didn't come to give out the Holy Ghost. So then who had to come behind him and give out the Holy Ghost for 60 years? Everybody knows. So we're going to get into that thing that you know when I look at those things then I really get excited it go not not because it's me but why me if it was not in God's thinking that's why this ministry of ours is completely different and brother couldn't put it better to say there's a oddball ministry cuz nobody preaches like we for 60 years. So therefore I I want to encourage the people to um try and get a visitor and pull him along and also encourage the ones that's going to be on streaming which will be on the storehouse. I will give the details of the storehouse and uh for you to get it. I only have one problem Edgar. I really don't know if I'll be able to finish. It's the only problem I have. If not, we'll have to get another Friday. But I would like to have this message, the greatest of them all, to be on tape from the A till the Z. I think I was spared &gt;&gt; to get to this point. I feel so good that Revelations 10 is still moving on the prophecy. It's how long now? And also, Edgar, what I want to say is um why Matthew 25? Because Matthew 25 is the seventh seal and brother Bram says the anointing is on the seventh seal. Now there again I couldn't understand it way back there. I understand it now because I like to nail it back into the Bible. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't understand why he said so. But now I can because in the seventh seal you need the oil the anointing. So where is the anointing? &gt;&gt; On the seventh seal. He said I went west and came back with the Holy Ghost to bring down the Holy Ghost. The oil the seventh seal. The anointing is on the seventh seal. So I hope that that answers your question. &gt;&gt; Yes, surely does mentioning the seven seal apostle. What made you tie it into Revelation? I know you said it's the keystone Revelation. What made you tie Matthew 25 into it? Well, I must be honest. Well, I I I I didn't tie it in. Uh, Brother Brandham tied it in. I only was anointed to pick it up and tie it in like brother Brandham tied it in. And that's why when he said the kingdom of God is likened unto 10 virgins, 10 had oil, 10, five had oil, five didn't have oil, and they went a cry out at midnight, go and meet the bridegroom. And he says that was the coming of the Lord. And I said, \"Wow.\" Then I went and read the sixth seal. In the sixth seal, he brings up Matthew 24 right down and he skips Matthew 25. And then I check in the Bible the six seals one after the other till Revelation 6. It stopped at a six seal. Revelation 6. Revelation 74 144. Then after he skipped that, then he borrowed the seven seals in Revelations 10:8. Is exactly like Matthew 24. He stopped. Then he go to Matthew 25 and he brings out the seventh seal. So I didn't tie it up. I was given eyes and a revelation to see it while nobody else saw it, you know. So, um the six seals he explained and the seventh seal is where the oil is and there's where the anointing is. None of the other seals did you have to have the oil to go in. You were told in the sixth seal with a black horse rider at night oil and the wine it was still there. But that didn't happen there in the third seal. It happened in the seventh seal when they rejected it. Then he says, \"Bang, you rejected the oil. I know you're not.\" Now they preach it a lot of times and it does make sense. What do you mean there I know it not? Is like when a man knows his wife, she receive his seed. But here he knew her not. She had the can and the word but she didn't receive it inside of her. So he says, \"I don't even know you. Can you imagine all the years you prophet prophet prophet and in the end he says I don't know you. He rejected the most important thing and I want to say it. I'm going have to say it when I die and stand in front of God. that you have rejected it in the message. You rejected it. You rejected the working of the Holy Ghost is because you didn't have the Holy Ghost. Now, everybody wants it, but there's no deal, Gloria. It's a sad sad sad case. How many pastors did we have that came to our church and says they would like to have what we have? But the time is up. The time is up. There's a time for everything. There was a time that you could get the Holy Ghost, but there's a time it's cut off. Now, why do you say so? Because Jesus told us, I think Matthew 17, as it was in the days of Noah. Now, what happened in the days of Noah? Genesis 6, he says, \"My spirit, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; shall not always strive with men. My spirit will be taken away.\" And we know with Simpson and all this and Kabot and all that the spirit was taken away and here we are the spirit is taken away and it's hard saw and I want to say tell the brothers and I mean I tell them I don't know if you will be able to get it. They ask me to pray for them. I said, \"I don't know if you're going to get it and be able to take it to your church &gt;&gt; because my concern is you uh you have Revelation 6, Black Rider. There's just a little bit left. That means it dried up until a little bit in the third seal. But when you come to the seventh seal, Matthew 25, there's no oil. The seventh seal, no oil. And that's all that I'm trying to tell them and show them. I said if you can show me where I can get the gloria you know and Jesus makes it so simple for us all. He says by their fruit you will know them. Very simple. If a man says he's evangelist check his fruit. If a man says he's a prophet check his fruit. Is that fruit? He says he is an apostle. Let him show you his fruit of an apostle. It's very simple. The man says the Holy Ghost is gone. And he says, \"You show me where I can find it.\" And you can't find it. Then that guy is right. He's not blobbing. and saying things that is not true. Everybody knows is the truth that the Holy Ghost is gone. A thing that I want to bring in here, people think if they jump and shout and all that that's the Holy Ghost. That's not the Holy Ghost. That's what the Holy Ghost does. It will make you jump and shout and all that. But if you have the Holy Ghost in your church, even somebody outside like how many times it happened just this year, people outside, not of El Tabernacle, Pentecostals and everybody came in and says you can feel the Holy Ghost there. There's an atmosphere. But they preach on the Holy Ghost. No atmosphere, no feeling, no emotions, nothing. So it is only a talk and not a walk. I don't listen to the talk. Just go a token and a token and a to fine but let me see the working of the token. Let me come and hear you preach. Remember that the quote that brother says, you know, uh, let me ask you to come up here and, uh, let the Holy Ghost flow after you preach. You know that quote. And nobody came up. And we have the same thing. But guys speak about the Holy Ghost. Let him come up and preach and show us the dear Gloria. If you can't, you're a deceiver. You're only there to steal tithes. That's all that you care for. And you know you don't have it. That makes it so bad. And that's the reason Jesus emphatically put it down as foolish just because you like the guy's smile. you go with him. You know, I don't care if it's my father. If he don't have the works of his faith, I'm sorry. I hope that is what you asked for. That why we knitted it in to revelations and um brothers is saying they believe everything the lamb that stepped forward and blood and all they believe all that but they just don't have the oil condition. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the condition. Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Apostle. Surely we can agree with what you always quote the scripture where you say you've dug deep and drank strange waters. Once again, that scripture is made manifest. I think um for me it makes it a prophetic message. Surely makes it a prophetic message apostle. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. It does. And and the beauty part, Edgar, is not that we feel like that. The fact is it is like that. You cannot have the seventh seal and it's not prophetic. That's why they make such a bigger mistake. They say the seventh seal is silence. Brother Bam says is silence in heaven but activity on the earth. What activity? 10 virgins. Look at that activity. And you'll hear Friday the activity that has gone on by supernatural insight. What has gone on there in Matthew 25? the activity that went on there that it really blows your mind when you just read it. My brother B says we in a prophetic class. That's why we can't say this is prophetic, you know. and seeing it with a prophetic eye, you can look between the lines and realize what has gone on here, which is what we want to bring out. Um, on the 10th, Friday, October, what's written in between the lines to everybody else, it looked like crooked lines. But God likes to write straight on crooked lines. So I hope I answered the question. &gt;&gt; No, thank you Apostle. Um that concludes my questions. I thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. And then um I just want to say again I feel really excited. I mean we have a lot of meetings that we are going to handle until November, but I feel that um this one uh this Friday is going to be one of my pet seminates. And that's the reason I believe it is the greatest message that was ever preached in the end time message. So pray for the meeting and um look into what I tried to tell you about the oil and by prophetic insight you'll see that the oil is the Holy Ghost which is the dynamic dynamics and the dynamics change your body for the rapture and they went in. How did they go in? The oil changed their bodies but the foolish virgins bodies wasn't changed. And that's why brother Bam says what happens to them for the thousand years. He says they are in the grave. But because of the oil, our bodies is changed. If the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, it will change quicken your mortal bodies and then you can go in cuz flesh and blood doesn't go in. They will really change when the foolish virgins went to go look for oil. Can you see how prophetic this thing is? &gt;&gt; So may God bless you. I dropped a lot of the little things that uh but uh this is worth dropping again in any sermon. Thank you, Edgar. I hope I answered your questions and I hope uh I answered a lot of other questions. Amen. [Music] Heat up [Music] here. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

We were already blessed before we even stepped into this moment. What are you saying, preacher? We just playing out. We just came to play out what the author had in the script. And there's no demon in hell that can rob a child of God. God already saw you in this meeting. God already saw you in last night's meeting. God already saw you in Friday's meeting. It's already a done deal. [music] Why, preacher, [screaming] why? Before I conceived you, before you were in your mother's womb, I ordained you. I knew you. I loved you. It's the blood cell. It speaks. It speaks, Lord. It speaks. May your blood shall speak this morning to the throne of God. You are Mrs. Jesus. You are a child of God. You are a daughter of God. There's enough power within you to create a world. [music] to create a world and you can go and [music] live on it. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give the Lord a shabbat this morning. Let's give him just a little louder. Just a little louder. [music] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Forgive me this morning. I'm a very excited preacher [music] this morning. Why? Why can we have that quotation? I just want to round off the weekend. My cousin started with the quote. My Opa punctuated the quote. And so, and so, and so he's a preacher. Is there a preacher here this morning? His father is a preacher. And I think the old man can out preach the other two. And what a double portion. Because the apostle said, \"Brother Brandham, it's greater than what you think. I've got an uncle that's a preacher. [music] I've got a cousin that's a preacher. We are family of preacher. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's greater. It's greater than this quote. It's fun. [music] Can you imagine if one of you [music] can chase a million demons? What about four preachers? [music] What about a family [music] of preachers? House of hell. You in trouble. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. El tabernacle. I'm not here uplifting my family. No. But we can't help for what God has put together. You can't help that you're the bride of Jesus Christ. You can't help as God knew it's going to be you. So no matter what the critic says this morning, I'm embracing my destiny. I'm a child of God. I'm a daughter of God. Oh, hallelujah. [music] I don't think I'm going to finish this morning. He says it's mighty nice. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you got a family like that, a church that has a family like that, it's so beautiful. Are you happy this morning? Have you found the family? And I think after last night without a shadow of doubt, he's the greatest preacher, the greatest scientist, the greatest of all time. He's the goat in my books. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You can do better than that. El tabernacle, do you appreciate God's apostle? Do you appreciate God's servant? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [cheering] There's a saying in our family. We're in the business of saving souls, but not only that, keeping souls safe. &gt;&gt; He knows how to take the vessel. &gt;&gt; He knows how to pour the oil in. He knows every shape and size of every vessel. He knows this one needs a little bit &gt;&gt; and that one needs a lot &gt;&gt; because he's the handler of the oil and he's the God of the generations and he's imparted his knowledge to his family because Jehovah &gt;&gt; is God with his family. He knows &gt;&gt; that your vessel is the soul &gt;&gt; and in the vessel [music] is the nature of God. Zoe, the life of God, &gt;&gt; the oil &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; He says in in Abraham and his [music] seed 610460 &gt;&gt; when you're filled &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it is the person &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a greater gift than the word. You need the person. You need a personal pronoun today. [cheering] on answers maner. We make mistakes [cheering] el tabernacle. If you can just remember one thing today that I have said, you ought to thank God daily for the gift that's in this ministry. You ought to wake up every morning knowing, like the apostle said, there's a God out there. &gt;&gt; We are fortunate people this morning. &gt;&gt; I wonder, can we bow our heads? &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm beside myself this morning. Lord, I pray that you may bless your people. &gt;&gt; Father, it is your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are nothing &gt;&gt; unless somebody &gt;&gt; died for us. &gt;&gt; Somebody loved us, Lord. [cheering] Somebody came our way. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it's because of that samarita. Lord, he took us into the inn and he covered our wounds with oil. And we want to say thank you, Lord, for this ministry. Father, may you bless everyone that has come. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you strengthen your servant this day. May you bless him, Father. May you make his heart glad, Father. Lord, we love him. &gt;&gt; We appreciate him, Lord. May you bless your word, &gt;&gt; Lord. I cannot break it. But father, the way you break it, &gt;&gt; the language you speak, &gt;&gt; Lord, your sheep understands the language. Lord, may you bless our servers this morning. If there be a visitor in the camp, &gt;&gt; Lord, may their hearts burn within them &gt;&gt; to say, \"Father, I'm not going to harden my heart, &gt;&gt; but I'm giving you my heart this morning. &gt;&gt; I've given you my heart &gt;&gt; and we know it's in a good place this morning, Lord. Come now &gt;&gt; and bless us, Father. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the hotter it gets, &gt;&gt; the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] I wonder at this moment in time just turn to your brother, your sister, say, \"It's good to be here. I love you. I appreciate you.\" To the visitor friend, just go shake someone's hand that you don't know. Welcome to the service this morning. Oh, it's so beautiful. Don't be cross this morning. Just just turn to that person, you know, and just say, \"I love you. I appreciate you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just want to rub it in a little, you know. I just want to rub it in a little. [music] want to do something. [music] You you have my two grandsons preaching with me, but I would like to just rub it in. I got my grandson on their piano. my grandson on the piano [music] [applause] and I have a double portion. I have my grandson on the bass guitar. Get up there. Give us a strum there. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jealous Tom. Jealous Tom [cheering] [music] and the whole family in heaven. &gt;&gt; Did you ever see a thing like this? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But our tabernacle, we have it here. Thank you. Let's give God's apostle a hand. Let's give Brother Eda a hand. Let's give the troll Augustine a hand. [music] Let's give the Augustine family a hand. Uncle Ariel, my cousins, let's give the family a hand this morning. [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I just want to also rub it in. Grandpa Topella, do you have that picture? It's the angel. Let's just give her a hand [applause] now, man. Sir, &gt;&gt; it's a family weekend for ons. &gt;&gt; So, I'm entitled to bring out the files. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they won't tell you it, but I actually converted all these cousins. [cheering] &gt;&gt; They were in my meetings. Sister Esther, [music] there's Uriah in one of my church services there. So I wasn't ordained a preacher. No, man. I was born I was born into royalty. I didn't have a choice but I was born into it. [cheering and applause] And there's no pleasure better, no golf game, no singing a song can [music] compared to doing something for God's people. It's better than being the president of a country is to have a preacher. Amen, sir. Amen, sir. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you have your Bibles this morning, turn to two portions of scripture. So, let's leave Matthew. &gt;&gt; Let's leave Luke. But let's go to John because John speaks plainly. John doesn't beat around the bush. John will say who the son of God is. [cheering and applause] John 5 verse 39 and 40. John 5:39 and 40. &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; I invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Visit a friend eel tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Search, search this Bible. For in them ye think &gt;&gt; in those scriptures &gt;&gt; you think that you have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And little do you know &gt;&gt; they are they &gt;&gt; which only testify [cheering] &gt;&gt; of me. &gt;&gt; Jesus. You can go and search the scriptures, but it's only a testimony of the son Beth. &gt;&gt; But the problem we make is we think that's where the eternal life is. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; amen. [cheering] and he will not come unto me. &gt;&gt; It's so deep this thing. &gt;&gt; It's like the apostle said it's the saddest line. &gt;&gt; Because we find that they majored on the testimony of the word &gt;&gt; and they thought they've got life. And here Jesus your God says, \"Why don't you search the scriptures?\" &gt;&gt; He invites you this morning. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But he will not come unto me a foolish virgin. Even in that scripture, &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't do anything &gt;&gt; because you can take this book, you can buy it at any bookshop, you can this is very available &gt;&gt; but this can't save me. I need [cheering] &gt;&gt; [music] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Did you catch it? &gt;&gt; Why do I need that? Because I need eternal life. &gt;&gt; I never came to church to waste my time from Joberg on blue day. I don't I don't Why must I be here? I came for eternal life. &gt;&gt; I came for eternal [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And he's sad because he says he will not come &gt;&gt; that you might have life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But El tabernacle I'm like the hymnwriter this morning. &gt;&gt; Say, \"Here's my vessel. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. &gt;&gt; I want you to fill it up. Not with the letter, not with the script, but with the manifestation of that word, which is the eternal life of God, which is Zoe.\" Because the letter &gt;&gt; but the spirit. &gt;&gt; So if the spirit gives life, &gt;&gt; why do they major on the letter? &gt;&gt; John 6 verse 60 &gt;&gt; to 69. Many therefore of his disciples &gt;&gt; when they heard this said, &gt;&gt; \"This is a hard saying. &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?\" &gt;&gt; When it comes to his blood, &gt;&gt; when it comes to drinking, &gt;&gt; when it comes to the flesh, &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing. [cheering] When it comes to communion, &gt;&gt; when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, &gt;&gt; \"Do this offend you &gt;&gt; in El Tabernacle, is it offending you?\" &gt;&gt; Because this is where the division comes. Because you need to have so much faith in your leader. Because if you don't believe in the leader, he will take you to your damnation. He will take you to a destination you do not want to be. &gt;&gt; So you've got to have faith in your leader. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; David was so powerful that the congregation that the whole of Israel chanted his name because they had faith that this David slew a Goliath. That means there's a God with this little man. There's a God in this little body. There's a God in this little man. [cheering] And this morning we have another representation. There's a God in a man [cheering] that has slayed your Goliath in your life. [cheering] And that is why this is a glorious church without spot or wrinkle because we know who our leader is. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in God's servant. How do you do the will of God or the works of God? Believe. [cheering] [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do this morning. You just got to believe in the scent one which is an apostolic gift. [cheering] [applause] Many want to do something for God. Many want to walk for God. &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is believe. &gt;&gt; That's the requirement. &gt;&gt; Then you pass from death unto life because it's not your problem. We in the business of saving souls. He's the handler of the oil. He knows your need. Expel your thoughts to your pastor. Your pastor will see you through. It's the dove leading the eagle. It's the ammoya. Don't burden yourself this morning. It's too much for you. Give it over and believe it. If it's of God, it will come to pass. If it's of God, it will manifest itself. If it's of God, it's not your business to question. Just believe, child of God, [music] what? And if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before. Here Jesus asks them a question. Maybe if you see me &gt;&gt; ascend. Maybe that will boost your faith. Because as human beings that's what we want. We want an angel now &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven. We want a quick miracle. &gt;&gt; We need something to convince us that this is it. That's human nature. &gt;&gt; That's the life you in. But you need an eternal life where you pull your strength and you say, \"I I don't understand it, but I believe it this morning. I don't need you to ascend. I don't need you to go up. [screaming] You're on the earth now. You're on the earth now. Don't go up. Take me with you. Say hallelujah somebody. Say hallelujah. Somebody. We are not like the disciples this morning. We don't need a quick thing. We believe it. We believe it this morning. Oh, hallelujah. It is the spirit. The spirit that quickenth, &gt;&gt; it is the spirit. &gt;&gt; That quickenth because your body is weak. Your body has mistakes. But the spirit within you, it revives you week in and weak out. It's your power bank. [cheering] I'm going to leave the others. Let me just get to my point. Verse 67. Then Jesus said unto the 12, \"Ye will he also go. El tabernacle, &gt;&gt; will you also go?\" [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus this morning asking the church, \"Will you also go?\" Then Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like Peter. Oh, he spoke his mind. He wasn't like the 12 that was confused. Oh, who's living beside me? Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Peter jumped up. Oh, and he looked the Messiah, &gt;&gt; the son of the living loving God in the eye [cheering] and he says, \"Lord, [screaming] Lord, Lord, to whom shall we go?\" El tabernacle. El tabernacle. Where can we go from this? It took an apostolic answer. It took the guy with the keys to the Holy Ghost to answer &gt;&gt; and say, \"Where are we going to go?\" &gt;&gt; And Peter doesn't stop there. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle, I want you to read it. &gt;&gt; Thou, &gt;&gt; just read it one more time. Just one more time. &gt;&gt; You need a preacher. You need a leader &gt;&gt; that's got the word for your day. &gt;&gt; You need someone that's got eternal life. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing &gt;&gt; to the reading of this word. [cheering] &gt;&gt; May you just hug your brother and your sister before you take your seat. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for keeping you so long, Grandpa. I'm sorry for letting you stand so long, but it needs to sink in this morning. It needs to go into your theophony this morning. You need to realize who you are. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that you're just not by the way. &gt;&gt; You need to realize that any church out there can't give you eternal life. Mike like for Peter man &gt;&gt; the others were so confused &gt;&gt; and he throws the ball back to Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was the greatest tennis match &gt;&gt; because Jesus asked the question first. &gt;&gt; Are you going to go? [cheering] And Peter said, \"Where are we going to go, &gt;&gt; Lord? Where can we go?\" &gt;&gt; He says, \"You've got the words of eternal life.\" &gt;&gt; And imagine how Jesus felt. He knew that that answer came directly from the father above. Because only the father can put that desire in your heart to know where you come from, to know where you going to, to know who's your leader, to know who's your representative. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And visitor friend, we invite you this morning. &gt;&gt; Where are you going to go? Which church are you going to go to this morning that can give you the everlasting gospel? That can give you eternal life abundantly, that can preach the gospel without any shortity. You need a church. You need a representation from the throne of God. You need a guide that can take you by the hand and show you the ABCs and show you what is the basics of the Ephesians church age. They can show you there will be babies born in the millennium. They can show you the genetics of God. They can show you how the atom was broken. They can show you how life formed. They can show you creation started. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; like a Pentecostal experience without beginning and without the end. That is what life is this morning. Life is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Life is the Amoya. Life is Zoe. The goal. [cheering] Oh, I'm excited this morning. I'm excited this morning. I want to be like Peter. I want to say, \"Where can I go, Lord? Where can I go? You've got the words of eternal life. [cheering] For a title this morning, [cheering] we started the weekend with a question. &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah? [cheering] Let's end it with a question. Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want to take that thought this morning. And I want to put it in your lap this morning. El tabernacle visit a friend. &gt;&gt; Where can we go &gt;&gt; in the hour that we love him? in the time that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 30:1 19 says, \"I call heaven and earth to record this day against you.\" &gt;&gt; That I have set before you life. &gt;&gt; I have set before you. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; so the choice is yours this morning. Do you want eternal life &gt;&gt; or do you want a wordbased doctrine that's full of the scriptures that's so hard to digest? But when you have a ministry, hallelujah, that's got the oil to mix the meal and digest the system and move down. And when it reaches your system, it knows how to go because the body is so beautifully made. There's a certain amount of oil that your spiritual body needs and when it gets that [cheering] you feel leer in the service brothers they can [cheering] say word [cheering] [cheering] a blessing and a curse. Therefore, choose life &gt;&gt; that both thou. &gt;&gt; Can you read it for me? that both thou. &gt;&gt; So if this family, &gt;&gt; if this preaches, &gt;&gt; if the old man in the quote &gt;&gt; didn't choose life, &gt;&gt; read that part again at the bottom there, that thy &gt;&gt; we are alive this morning. We came to preach this morning because we have a handler of the oil that chose eternal life for his family that says, \"Rosco family, we're going to choose the blessing. We're going to choose the blessing. We're going to be like Jacob this morning. We're going to steal the Holy Ghost from every church, from every denomination, from every organization. And we took the blessing. We took the birthright.\" The apostle ran with the stump, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he says, \"This is for my family. [cheering] &gt;&gt; This is for my church. Amen.\" [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Years back they told the apostle, \"You chose the best part. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You took the best part &gt;&gt; of the whole lamb of the whole [cheering] because everything like Pastor Jude said is the Holy Ghost. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; In march to the blood, the apostle says, \"Isn't sin like death? Sin sold the prince of life &gt;&gt; for a mere 30 pieces of silver. It will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; Sin in your life will always make eternal life cheap. &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner, don't treat eternal life with contempt. If you're not, then why are you still going on in sin? &gt;&gt; A sinner treats eternal life cheap and mortal life gets treated with glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sir, &gt;&gt; can I get a amen? [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And not only the sinner, but also in our in our in our church. We treat our car as if it's everything. &gt;&gt; We treat our health as if it's everything. But we fail to realize that we are not here on our own merit. We are called our people. We are holy priesthood. We are chosen nation.\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2024-08-30%20-%20Is%20It%20Kamala%20Harris,%20Then%20The%20Earthquake%20%20Apostle%20Edgar%20H.%20Roscoe%20-%20Edgar%20Roscoe.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2024-08-30 - Is It Kamala Harris, Then The Earthquake  Apostle Edgar H.

Don't miss this must-watch video for every End-Time Message believer seeking deeper understanding and clarity. \n\nTune in to uncover insights that could shape your perspective on the times we're living in!\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nuh good evening El tle it's uh as again we thought about making uh this video clip again uh because things as I told you the last time things are happening so fast that um we can't keep up um because you know you know our ministry is not a ordinary Ministry is is um Apostolic which brother Braham says it's evangelism and uh prophetic uh combin U make the apostolic uh Ministry so it's not an ordinary minist Ministry by taking a word and and expounding on a word and you know but it's uh based more on what brother brandham has prophesied on the prophetic side and um getting the sense of it now we we have anointed that quote for many years in birth pains that brother Bram says men will come after me and make more SS because brother brandham didn't have enough time on many topics that he he actually um uh preached on and prophesied so um uh I think that's the reason he he put that quote out so I I just uh want to remind you about what I heard believe Paul told us when brother B preached on the rapture how that woman went on brother brandham didn't have enough time to finish it because she was running at the back then and waving and telling brother Brandon we must stop and the prophet uh really couldn't put uh his teeth into the thing so uh he um just said enough for the five minut to pick it up and uh uh and Mak sense to it and and and a lot of you know statue of a perfect man all those quotes uh messages so we uh are yeah and U with the prophecy and the the seven visions of brother brandham to actually uh make more sense to it and uh we uh have dissected it and when we saw these things happening the Prophecies of brother brandham came to our attention and that's the reason we busy that's why we say that U we uh we're just different our ministry is different our preaching is different Paul says You Preach according to your faith you know so this is according to our faith on the prophetic level not that we are prophets but brother brandham you know brother sister we in a prophetic class so prophetic class needs a prophet uh to preach to them so brother Brandon preached to us and us in the prophetic class could understand him and further break it down so uh I thought let me just tell you that and uh I uh have entitled the thing is it Camila's is Camila Harris uh uh then the earthquake is it she first and then the earthquake so I got reason why I said so I I'll show you Clips just now that really shocked me so I thought uh let me get back to you because I won't be here um next week on Friday uh we'll be in Angola so I thought uh we'll make this video club for Friday so that you can be on par on what's happening in the world so listen I'm only venturing in I'm only pondering like brother Val used to like this word pondering let's Ponder I'm only pondering I'm only saying could it be or predicting not prophesying in that this thing might be in this sequence so I have the sequence that I feel it might be that way and you know we we all have our own ideas and we have uh our own Inspirations how it'll happen but God is the one that actually put it really in in sequence so uh I have the elections which is going on now and then uh after that the 70 weeks of Daniel and the 70th Jubilee uh running out um in September and uh you know that uh the um rabis is now really on this thing about September where the jubilees is running out and um and point number three is uh could it do money will fail in Statue of a perfect man after that and could after that be the earthquake and could after the earthquake be right in the seventh Vision when Elijah and Moses will be coming to 144,000 and uh could it be in that sequence which is actually the end of the world we know that the ab bomb which is the end of the world will that five things happen like there and the pope sits in Jerusalem and break the treaty now I gave you the quote nothing wrong with probing brother Bram tells you that and SS is a time there's nothing wrong in probing when you probe you just when going to see can it be so that's why he say says is this the time he was probing and uh although it was thus say the Lord and um so we we we only proing so um we have listened to Trump on the on the club of trump uh Trump saying Camila Harris is a beautiful human uh uh woman so let's listen to him Time Magazine think of this Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her they have this unbelievable artist drawing her and I said is that Sophia Laura and I couldn't who might that be is that Elizabeth Taylor they say she was a beautiful woman who is it so beautiful drawing it's a drawing they took a lot of pictures it didn't work out so they hired a sketch artist I said I'm sure oh they must be celebrating the great Life and Times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Lauren and you're not allowed to say this anymore you know David don't ever get caught in this trap David please don't ever call a woman beautiful because that'll be the end of your political career please I want to make your life much easier David by the way he's also got a great wife I have to say he's got a great wife but you know I mean I read a a so-called Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like by the way and she didn't like him but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer highly overrated I don't know anything about her I don't know her treats me badly but that's okay she called it wrong she's called it wrong now for about eight years but she said one thing that got me she said kamla has one big Advantage she's a very beautiful woman she's a [Music] so I decid to go back and reread the Clause I'm not saying he's but I say that I am much better looking than her I think I'm much better much better I'm a better looking person then CA well there you have it um the um the beauty of Kamala is now now we have the Roman Catholic Church beautiful and now they are saying that Chamilia is but beautiful so imagine being an uh opponent or R rival saying this and we have the prophet saying she look like uh uh she she's a beautiful woman she look like uh he says she you look like Sophia Lauren now if you young people ever saw Sophia Lauren she is also blushing blacking you know she was one of the the Queens in the 60s I think uh but brother brandham also speak about a beautiful woman I wonder if we got a quote then when these women help elect the wrong person then seen a great woman rise up in the United States well-dressed and beautiful but cruel and heart she will either guide or lead this nation to a ruination I got in princes perhaps Catholic Church there you have the quote uh how could brother Brandon 91 years ago say a thing like this and here Trump comes and say the same thing so um it shows you that um it is right in line um with uh What uh the prophet um saw uh 91 years ago 19 uh 33 and uh we could say that that portion of um of the prophecy is fulfilled Trum fulfilled it the other day then the write up on the cover of Time Magazine is um it's a a beautiful picture of her there she is and um we will uh play the quote she'll be a pretty human now both is pretty human as we already played the quote so um and the right up in Time Magazine will take a f things out there the reintroduction of CA Harris excerpts from the article published by Time Magazine inside of Philadelphia Arena on August 6th vice president camela Harris was greeted with a kind of reception a Democratic presidential candidate hasn't G en in years fans packed into overflow spaces waving homemade signs made of glitter and glue as drum lines roared when Harris introduced her new running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walls the cheering lasted more than a minute if you'd predicted this scene a month ago to anyone following the race they would never have believed you but Harris has pulled off the swiftest vibe shift in modern political history a contest that revolved around the cognitive decline of a geriatric president has been transformed Joe Biden is out Harris is in and a second Donald Trump presidency no longer seems inevitable Democrats resigned to a grim Death March toward certain defeat as one National organizer put it felt their Gloom replaced by a jolt of Hope Harris smashed fundraising records raking in 310 milli in July she packed stadiums and dominated Tik Tock offering a fresh message focused on the future over the past volunteers signed up in droves Trump's widening leads across the Battleground States evaporated over the span of a few weeks in Late July and early August Harris became a political phenomenon our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump she told the cheering crowd in Philadelphia our campaign is a fight for the future judging from the past few weeks Harris's own party underestimated her maybe the crowded 2020 primary just wasn't the right race for Harris to Showcase her talents maybe the vice presidency wasn't the right role suddenly she seems matched to the moment a former prosecutor running against a convicted felon a defender of abortion rights running against the man who helped overturn Row versus Wade a Next Generation Democrat running against a 78-year-old Republican perhaps above all she has given Americans the one thing they overwhelmingly told polsters they wanted a credible alternative to the two unpopular old men who have held the job for the past eight long years Harris may still be the dog Trump has arguably the clearer path to 270 electoral votes and an edge on the issues that voters say are most important to them she inherited a campaign infrastructure and policy record from her predecessor but the energy is all hers picking walls as a running mate over more conventional choices signals a belief that this race is as much about feelings as it is about fundamentals Harris's brand shift the happy warrior attitude the viral memes the iroll at Republican weirdos has already done what no Trump opponent has ever been able to do snatch the spotlight away from him she may seem like an overnight sensation but Harris's moment was years in the making quietly her small team of top AIDS had been laying the groundwork for a future presidential run after the Supreme Court's dobs decision the vice president added Reproductive Rights to her portfolio abortion was never a comfortable issue for Biden a devout Catholic but it was a natural fit for his number two Harris believed that with Rog gone Republicans would turn their sights to restricting both birth control and IVF in the months after dobs she traveled the us talking about abortion rights as a matter of reproductive Freedom as far back as the 2022 midterms Aid say she argued for making this the core of the party's National message even as the White House focused on jobs and the economy with Biden no longer a top the ticket the morban Democratic Grassroots came to life Harris was capable of delivering a message that never felt quite right under Clinton or Biden that theirs was the party of the future and Trump was of the past her campaign raised $200 million in the first week in what it said was the best 24 hours of any candidate in presidential campaign history more than 38,000 people registered on vote.org in the 48 hours after she became the presumptive nominee eclipsing the voter registration surge encouraged by Taylor Swift Last year within a week Harris erased Trump's polling dominance in key States turning a burgeoning landslide into a dead heat elections come down to Vibes and CA has got the Vibes right now says David hog co-founder of the genz political organization leaders we deserve after spending his entire political career organizing against Trump and his allies hog explains it felt good to finally have someone to vote for people are feeling the type of energy they felt during the Obama campaign says Michigan state senator Darren caleri who spends his weekends door knocking in his competitive District South of Detroit it feels different than with Hillary different than with Biden celebrities like Charlie XCX and Megan the stallion came out in support of Paris speaking in a packed airplane hanger in Detroit UAW president sha Fain called her a badass woman the campaign's new Harris walls camo hats sold out within half an hour Grassroots groups are seeing an explosion in fundraising and volunteer signups my niece who called Biden genocide Joe called me to say auntie I want to do something recall S leosha brown co-founder of black voters matter the shift is perhaps most visible in the digital sphere while millions of Hardcore Democrats would crawl over broken glass to keep Trump from reelection less reliable voters in gen Z are especially attuned to online trends for months President Biden's online supporters have been on the defensive about his support for Israel's war against Hamas comments about Gaza flooded Pro Biden content posted to social platforms making it difficult to create what digital strategists call a permission structure to support him to many it evoked the online mobs who would mock Clinton's supporters in 2016 preventing her from building traction on social media in 2016 if you wanted to be an online supporter of Hillary Clinton you did it in a private Facebook group says Litman in 2024 you blasted on Tik Tok and you're part of the kive and you make your username the coconut tree her early months as VP were checkered too big interviews went poorly Harris seemed ill-prepared and unsteady on her feet Biden reportedly vented to a friend that she was a work in progress he saddled her with a portfolio of difficult thankless work like addressing the root causes of the flow of undocumented immigrants from Central America's Northern triangle by 2023 Harris had the lowest approval ratings for a vice president in history it's always hard for the vice president because the president is the one setting the policy taking the responsibility says represent ative Adam Schiff a California Democrat and close Ally of Harris and historically vice presidents have often taken on the work that the president doesn't want to do another Democrat puts it more bluntly they set her up to fail from day one one challenge for Harris has been the people around her over the years a rotating cast of senior staff has clouded her message and raised questions about her abilities as a manager she needs a few political consiliari in her life she doesn't have a North star guiding her says one Democratic strategist she has made novice political moves that the political Elite and the pundits have glommed on to that have pushed the narrative that she's not ready for prime time that narrative has been out of date for some time according to allies who have worked with her and watched her closely Harris has mastered the art of arm twisting required to pass major legislation and become a global Diplomat championing Democratic goals she has gone Booker says from being a Padawan to a Jedi master yet if Harris was widely underestimated it's also true that her circumstances have radically changed success in politics is situational Harris no longer has to compete with more than 20 other democrats for attention on the campaign Trail or contort herself to appease liberal pities to win over the party's base she no longer has to be a loyal Deputy to the president who calls all the shots now the moment is finally hers Republicans admit Harris will be harder to beat than a diminished Biden but they believe the candidate Riding High the past few weeks will soon under sustained attack come down to earth if she runs the same kind of campaign she ran in 2019 and 20120 her campaign will collapse and Donald Trump will Waltz into the White House Republican pollster Whit a says on the other hand if she has learned as much as her allies and friends say she has in the last four years she will give Trump a real run for his money Harris is more popular with younger black and Latino voters than Biden was when he dropped out of the race according to polling which puts her in a stronger position to win the Sun Belt states at the same time she may be losing ground with older white voters which makes her more vulnerable in the trio of blue wall States Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that form that core of the Democrats Electoral College strategy to shore up those States Harris is is leaning on her major labor endorsements and making multiple visits to the Upper Midwest Harris inherited Biden's campaign infrastructure including more than 260 outposts across the Battleground States in Nevada the Harris campaign has 13 field officers to Trump's one in Pennsylvania it has 36 coordinated officers to Trump's 3 according to a campaign memo in the first 12 days of her camp campaign Harris supporters placed 2.3 million phone calls and made 172,000 house visits while Battleground organizers are knocking on swing voters doors the campaign's digital strategy is designed partly around reaching hard-to-reach voters and convincing them to choose between our candidate and the couch says Deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty the Avalanche of viral memes about Harris the enthusiastic Tik Tok videos and the massive Zoom calls of devoted supporters black women for Harris white dudes for Harris Latino men for Harris have made this task easier that's the kind of enthusiasm that money can't buy Flaherty says but Harris's moment also comes after eight years of transformation and Triumph for American women after Clinton's stinging defeat in 2016 women flooded the streets in the largest protest March in US history then formed a massive Grassroots electoral movement that helped Democrats overperform in most elections since the attack lines from the Republicans are going to be on Race and gender and those are going to work to her Advantage says Ashley etn a former communications director for the vice president all that was baggage is is now an asset amen I hope that you have uh listened carefully to that clip and it's all human human human human and um and human cause the fall we know that just if you take Genesis then you'll see the Decay that's brought by a woman woman fell with a silen in Genesis 3:6 lch had two wives Genesis 2 vers 23 which is polygamy it broke down further Genesis 62 they took themselves wives fre sex out of wedlock fornication Genesis 63 Abram two wives Genesis 1934 lot SL with his own daughters which is incest Genesis 345 sex of its children D not fell Genesis 195 hos sexuality that is just in Genesis how the moral Decay came just there not even any place else in the Bible just in Genesis and here we have a scenario where it's all woman as I said with the last clip that we put on so we see that this was in Time Magazine time says is this the time brother Bram says so we can say is this the time and season when humans going to cause the fall of the world then the next thing that happens which is ironic the Moon Over Australia they called a blue moon if we can get the right up and the club bar tonight you have the chance to see a rare super Blue Moon just step outside or just watch right here this is a live look right now at the moon shining in the night sky cvsa Jasmine Ramirez joins us in studio right now to tell us why this moon is considered to be so rare yeah that's right Marcel and this live look is pretty great tonight's moon it's supposed to be really bright and really big now having a super Blue Moon just anything like this really it only happens about every 10 years a super blue moon is a Celestial phenomenon tonight it was captured around the globe here you can see it glowing in Turkey Rising into the night sky in Greece shining in Portugal and peeking through the clouds in Australia the big excitement is just for the public to look up see a very bright beautiful full moon tonight I talked with Douglas Leonard a professor of astronomy at San Diego State he says a super moon happens when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth this makes it appear super big and super bright next I asked him what a blue moon is if you happen to have four full moons in one season like summer Okay the third of those full four full moons is called a blue moon so just how how rare is it to have a super blue moon to have a blue moon and which occurs about every every two or 3 years and a super moon which occurs about 25% of the time to have those two things occur together on one full moon happens about every decade and so that's what makes it a bit interesting that's why he recommends going outside and catching a glimpse of it this is such a cool event because it's something that everyone can enjoy that everyone can see easily and appreciate Maxwell palao is an astronomer here in San Diego taking photos of the moon and stars is one of his favorite things to do he has advice if you want to capture tonight's moon but if you really want to capture the best way to do it is to either have a pair of binoculars or a telescope and then put your iPhone or your Android device and put right up against the eyepiece and then take a picture of the Moon it'll look incredible and tonight's clear skies in San Diego will also help give a clear view of the moon now it's best to go outside and see it now I'm told the next Super Blue Moon it likely won't happen until 2037 Marcela that's so interesting so you know you hear the phrases once in a blue moon so that's great that you explained why it's rare to have a super moon and also Blue Moon and then people hear the word blue and they're looking at the photo thinking like does it have a little bit of a blue hue is the moon really blue or why does this you know why is it called a blue moon right no I asked that exact same question I did learn the term Blue Moon is really used to describe the third full moon in a season with four of them now in this case we're having four full moons this summer amen no no why we saw on this is because uh the day that Biden resigned I showed you the very night in New York City around the statue of Liberty she was covered or she's been in or behind her was a red moon why did we have this all at one time and we know what the moon represents when brother BR say Pope went to Israel and he showed you how the moon changed until it blackened out and then too in brandham Tabernacle the angel came down and through the seven Church ages as seven moons and the last one was totally dark and brother Bron put a little light in there that's why it represents the church ages resent represents a woman so why is is it's so explicit this time with the moon does he tell us because as above so below he put those things in the heavens as signs and seasons and Genesis says is this a sign that that woman is going to come in and you could have looked for the this week most of the week we had full full moons so it's so unusual the ordinary Moon full and then you had a blue moon you had a red moon everything is Moon which is a human so could them I'm asking could them be a sign that that woman is here if not you heard they can't even tell you the why of the matter they don't even go back to the the the day uh Biden resigned and there was a red moon so there is Def defitely a significance uh I'm sure if brother Brandon was around he wouldn't have left this thing because it's it's a strange phenomena what we are seeing happening just with the moons so as I said as above so below and then the thing that hit me last week in Monday is the earthquake she nearly went why is all these things right in the circle of Camila and it's been shaking ever since so I thought that we will have the clips um on that Quake watch it oh my [Applause] oh my God oh my oh my oh my God isn't that scary we that know what happened when brother Bram preached on choosing a bride how brother brandham puts this in choosing of a bride just take another listen to it I know you heard this but to see a thing happens and then go back to what brother brandham says in the prophecy it's really shaking I do not know I thank God for this guy that came to me he says you know brother Rosco um the things that you have put out there is really scaring it it it buckles my knees I says not only you my brother I am also shaken to see such a lot of things happen at the same time that speaking about meeting the Messiah you know because the seven Visions is before meeting the Messiah you know the earthquake is I'm going to tell you just now what it is it's also to do with the Messiah listen to how it is put in sincerity from the prophet thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things the even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away with your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom botom of the sea you're a great honeycom under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sandb hanging out over that on that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there Plum back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last day of pompe repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his Wrath upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ listen to that voice of urgency of desperation and here Monday it was nearly so nearly the only thing is the sequence that 144,000 has to be sealed and this woman must first come in otherwise Los Angeles would have been gone last week look how it look how it actually went just in the street how those cars were shifting look at the buildings collapsing it was like the africanis umerus nearly nearly gone 4 for earthquake so that's what the Bible says as I'm going to read it it's spoken in The Sixth Seal this earthquake Revelation 6:12 a great earthquake then spoken of this of it in the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:13 seven trumpet the Seven Seals same thing verse 192 it speaks about it then it speaks about it in the seventh vial the earthquake the biggest earthquake ever Revelation 16:18 then the great quake in Matthew 282 when the graves was open is this what's going to happen when Los Angeles open will Matthew 28 and Matthew 27 51 and 52 when the dead in Christ shall rise with this earthquake will this be like that that's why when I see a thing like this and I see it in the scripture and I see brother brandham say it I have no doubt I don't care what the critic says it's going to come to pass and as I say it nearly happened last week August month so let's take another clip you might be wondering have we been having more of them than normal well we did get the answer for you tonight and it is yes we are having the most seismically active year in almost four decades and experts say the shaking is likely to continue another earthquake hit Southern California this time near Lake Elenor it happened this morning around 9:30 the magnitude 3.9 earthquake rocked homes but so far no damage has been reported this is the third sizable earthquake in Southern California in just a couple of days Southern California has experienced multiple earthquakes this week as I'm sure all of you know and this is a good reminder now is the time to prepare for an even larger one through the Northridge Earthquake so you know the first thing I said is I think the big one's coming guys Judith gold the owner of Luca natural goods and Highland Park remembers the progression of smaller Quakes leading up to a very destructive one I know that this is the signs that a bigger earthquake is probably going to come I mean I hope I'm wrong it passes us but it usually that's how it was um before the nor northri earthquake some breaking news of 4.4 earthquake hitting the Las Vegas Valley tonight according to USGS Quake hit about 806 about 4 miles Northwest of Indian Springs Nevada the Quake was 5.8 Mi deep Indian Springs is home to Cree Air Force Base is 45 Mi Northwest of the Las Vegas Strip there were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage as you'd expect of a quake of this size but it was felt in a wide area of Nevada the recent earthquake that jolted the Southland is sparking concern and highlighting a much smaller but potentially more threatening fault line the fault running from the Pasadena area to Puente Hills has been very very active in recent months all the way over in Santa Monica a cam facing the pier shows the power of the large shocks well so far there's been a few after shocks but nothing significant two months ago there was actually a smaller quick That Shook that exact same area here in La a lot more recently and did feel a few of those but not nothing that strong as what we just felt in South PAAD from 2013 to 2023 Dr Jones says there was an average of five magnitude four or stronger shakers but 2024 has been a lot more volatile already this year there have been 13 magnitude 4 or stronger Quakes this year is now an active year again 2024 has had more earthquakes than any year we've seen since 1988 here's seismologist Dr Lucy Jones we had a six on this on this system in 1987 and it was like 350 million doll in damage and three direct deaths so when we've modeled what would it be like to have a 7 and a half on the penty Hills thrust we get 10 times as much damage as we see for a 7.9 on the San Andreas because we have so many more buildings and people on top of an earthquake if it's pente Hills Monday's 4.4 magnitude earthquake happened in the same area as a 3.4 magnitude earthquake June 2nd and both produced aftershocks nearby so they're all in about the same location uh within somewhere within the Plenty Hills thrust system so what should the everyday californi take from that not much we have earthquakes this is a great reminder that all of Southern California is earthqu country every one of us in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is within 5 miles of an active fault and which one of those are going to go within our lifetime is random scientists at Yellowstone National Park telling us this was a random event happening without warning some wild new vide showing an explosion at Yellowstone National Park a geyser going off sending tourists running for cover run run run Park officials closed the biscuit Basin area while they surveyed the damage the area is home to several geysers in pools including the sapphire pool which had a similar eruption in 1991 what happened is that an unusual event where a lot of pressure built up and with that so much pressure it again forced its way out it erupted officials say there did not appear to be any signs of an imminent volcanic eruption well that's good news geologists are investigating what exactly happened the scientist in charge with the Yellowstone volcano Observatory says this is not connected to volcanic activity which is often associated with the part well David scientists at Yellowstone tell us that this was a random event without warning still they are investigating exactly what happened and what it might mean for the future of this area David the last time an explosion similar to this happened at Yellowstone's biscuit Basin was back in 2009 yeah that was really something to see MOA thank you amen isn't it scary doesn't that shake a religious conceptions and arguments to put it one side and concentrate on Modern events that prophecy is making clear that we that is in this message we that's walking in this message for over 56 years heard and quoted these things time and time and time again but here it's upon us even the scientist doesn't know when but a scary point is 2024 why 2024 Kam's here the earthquakes has has actually tripled up so where are we at so El Tabernacle as your pastor I cannot help but put it in front in front of you I cannot bring something positive but a negative thing for what I see because I'm am reminded of what brother brandham says this earth needs a funeral service to be preached to and if there ever was a time that this earth needs a funeral service is now and wake up people to the fact that hey is no more F in the future it's on our doorstep it's right here we cannot try and put this thing under the carpet anymore it is staring us right in the face so so I thought that that would be a good thing then I ask you with a combin see that you finished pay your credits why because in Genesis 47:15 money failed in the land of Egypt we know that that is part and parcel of Camila coming in she's going to let America get busted up we know that brother Brenham said that in Statue of a perfect man and it's funny whenever you have a perfect man money goes in Genesis you had Joseph a perfect man and money failed when Jesus came and money was the issue 30 pieces of silver the Rich Young Ruler you know and um a laborous worth his wage and all those things it's always money when a perfect man comes is there another perfect man now that we see money is falling I think so I think that there is a bride that's nearly near Perfection when God is going to let money fail again now let us again listen to brother brandham Lifeline the other morning well you know it's just like you sell Bonds on the go the bonds is already tuck up and this present government now is spending money for what for tax money that they'll be cut in 40 years from now she's done that's Lifeline right out of Washington DC Across the Nation taxes they're spending and trying to buy forign well they're just giving it out anyway don't you see that's exactly what they what they're going to do see what is it now if this nation goes busted the only thing it can do is go busted the only thing it can do is go bankrupt that's the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under this presid Administration Roman Catholic Church owns a gold the world and what they'll do is sell out there you are that's what I am looking for now if you are spiritual you see what I'm going to say now kamla Harris is the first Domin Domino to fall you know if that first Domino Falls all the dominoes is falling so we waiting for that first Domino and when we see that all these things earthquakes and Pope and all that then comes into view that all of them isn't going to fall under the prophecy of one of the greatest prophets that ever struck the globe outside of Jesus Christ William mam branam may God bless his heart for giving us the signs of the time and taking all his time and go to Los Angeles and all those places to drop the prophecies that his master gave him so this is all prophecies hanging in the balance it's hanging there will she or Trump fulfill the prophecies will it be it's like a Dustin drum now beating is this behold I come quickly and my reward is with me Revelations 8:13 is then the next thing woe wo wo inhabitants of the earth three woes three world wars will that follow the first war the trumpet blew and got Israel back the second world world war was even worse and More in 1946 actually was going back and Israel became a nation and the third war is the atomic bomb that explodes and not only destroy America but the whole world Revelations 9:12 one war is passed One World War and behold there is coming actually two more WS Revelations 11:14 the second W is passed in other words the second world war is passed and behold the third world cometh quickly the third world war is come in quickly while the human is here Revelations 12:12 woe to the inhabitants of the earth woe unto us that's going to remain behind when that atomic bomb blast out so that's why I said three quarters of the six prophecy is fulfilled three qu quarters of it a woman as vice president fulfilled a woman's vote will put a in that seems also fulfilled Woman as a president she's a nominate she's a nominee now half of that is is fulfilled woman crew Time Magazine calls her you heard a badass woman tough as Nails fulfilled already woman will rule America she's ruling them now with even abortion it's three quarters fulfilled already we're waiting to see if she's going to do to be voted in the last thing that that must happen that last quarter will it be like that when all the others is already fulfill it will take a miracle for that not to happen if the other things already in the court has happened so El Tabernacle as we heard brother uh Bradley prayed it's to pray more you pray twice pray more four times you fasted once fast more and get spiritual get your mindset on only one thing the Lord Jesus Christ because that's all that we need to think about now because it is two desperate times that we are living in may God bless you thank you Nations up breaking Israel's

that men will be cut off according to God's Bible when will the 70th Jubilee be the expected time the desired time for God to come not the desired time that edar Rosco said because everybody said something the 7-Day Adventist also had a date and it failed the Jehovah Witness had a date and it failed because it was their date but the 7the Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's date that's the difference Lord what will the end be go your way there it's concealed until the time of the end when you see a preacher preach on Maranatha then it sounds for you what will the end be that's why he says it will be the Asing in of the Millennium because the 6,000 years is finished we moving into the seven Hallelujah waited the only thing that can change that date is the longsuffering of Christ nothing more my spirit shall not always strive with men cut off time have you realized that such a short time left in the short time time God in the short time amen Los Angeles has to go down in the short time that woman has to raise in America and 2024 is the USA elections again could it be the date that that woman will be elected that will cause America to go down yes b b yes you will see them

Good evening, saints, and special greetings to all the beautiful ladies of our tabernacle. We recently celebrated our woman's day in Christ Jesus. The team bloom where you are planted was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had. to tell you all nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our floristers, our decor ladies, everything proudly L tabernacle and we have received positive feedbacks from the sisters who attended. But now we have an an important announcement. With the woman month, women's month closing up, the apostle has thought it wise and requested that the book titled Just for the Ladies by Brother Brennan be made available to the L Tabernacle ladies. We want to share a few insights and on how this book can be a blessing to you to each one of you. And we have our dear loving sister Abigail here with us to elaborate on a few questions. Thank you for joining us sister Abigail. You're welcome sister. &gt;&gt; Sister Abigail um what are some of the insights as to how this book can help the sisters and what is the what is it that the apostle would like the sister to take from this book? &gt;&gt; Good evening everybody. Um, I think I need to start off with to say where this book originated from. Sister Rosco had a copy of this book and somehow it just got missing and God purposed it so that sister Joanie found a copy of the same book in the US and she gave it to us a couple of years ago. So when the seminar came up and um I saw the answers that the apostle gave it just pointed back to the book. So the apostle has twigged it a bit and we would like every sister to have a copy of it. So the book is based on questions that our precious uh prophet was asked and how he answered them. But it's targeted mainly to the ladies, the sisters. And it is in line with our doctrine, our belief, with many um scriptures added to the questions and the answers. And then the apostle what he wants us to take out of the book is the there's a lot of questions that the uh prophet answers by saying uh he doesn't have scripture to prove what he is saying but you need to make sure that your um your objective and your motives are right in anything you do as a Christian. So that's the main focus the apostle wants us to take because so many of the questions we receive the apostle doesn't really have scriptures for it but it is a matter of staying away from sin then coming closer to sin. So that's the main objective and then I think it is for us to bloom where we are planted. Beautiful. We're looking forward to it. Um just another question instead. Um what are some of the nuggets in the book that the ladies can look forward to to reading? Well, not to give a lot away. I think the book covers a lot covers how to be a good wife, a good mom. It covers a lot on dress code. It even covers on having unbelieving husbands. So I think there is so much nuggets for each one. It depends what applies to your life. So it applies for young and old and I think I will keep my nuggets to myself for you to enjoy your nuggets out of the book. So does that mean because I wanted to ask you on a personal note, what are the key concepts you personally enjoyed in this book? &gt;&gt; Well, for me I enjoyed the ending and the beginning of the book. the ending because um it speaks about menopause and that's what I'm going through now Mles unfortunately and I enjoyed the testimony that Rebecca Brandon gave that what her mom went through and I'd never known about that. I've read a lot of uh brother Brandon speaking on Wright's uh sister that was going through menopause. So to me that had a bit of a personal impact and I didn't realize that so many sisters went through the prayer line where the prophet prayed for them and I think the the nice part that Rebecca says her dad told her that her mom will be better off after this. So I'm looking forward to that part of being better off. And then I think it's the beginning of the book where they have a nice quotation where the prophet speaks about his wife and just to see how kind and gentle and loving the prophet was towards his wife. And he even says she's getting old now. But I love her the way I loved her back then. So that was remarkable for me because the prophet is always seen as somebody that was illuminated and to see the soft part when it comes to the sisters was remarkable. It just shows me how the apostle feels about us that he has a soft part when it comes to the sisters and how they get treated. So I think it's a good read and a mustave because everybody will be able to get something out of it. Oh, amen. Thank you so much, Sister Abby. As you all heard, this is a must readad and we want to thank you for your input and insight into the groups. There we have it, ladies. We really do appreciate our apostle, the leadership, the love they have for us and the care. Sisters, with all the wisdom that has been shared and will be shared by reading this book, don't miss out. Go and grab your copy. I think it will be a available at the combine titled just for the ladies. Be sure to get one. Thank you so much. God bless you. See you in the library. &gt;&gt; Bye &gt;&gt; bye.\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2023-08-31%20-%20A%20Wedding%20Anniversary%20Tribute%20to%20Sis.%20Sheila%20Roscoe%20%2030.08.2023%20-%20Sheila%20Roscoe.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2023-08-31 - A Wedding Anniversary Tribute to Sis.

Jesus to be like Jesus there is nobody that can be like Jesus unless you come in love in you [Applause] there is no pastor there is no prophet there is no and a possible not even had garage School can match him all of us wants to be like him [Applause] Muhammad says I've got to confess myself that I committed today that I committed yesterday and that I'm committing in the future and he says but Jesus Christ is accepted in this world and the world to come [Applause] because he never prayed to God to forgive him send his sons because he never sent these garbage and how are you gonna know you love him do you want to know how you know you love him it's only one way that you can know that you love him he says if you love me and keep my commands keep my word [Applause] when you keep his word then you ought to know you love him last night we just had his word on the screen that was only my commands and if you keep those Commandments brother Branham told you to do it don't only read the quotes don't only quote the word we're not only hearers of the world we are doers of the word if he says renewable the new birth is a mess you don't worry about your pompadoo you don't worry about your Liz Taylor's perfume if he slays me and I get up there and I look a mess let me look amazing as long as I'm fulfill the word that I know I love him [Applause] how do you know that he loves you how do you know that he loves you now you know when you keep the word then you love him but how do you know how does he love you if he'll if he gives you the Holy Ghost it's a gift [Music] who knows he loves you how many of you got the holy ghosts [Music] [Applause] amen then he loves you he doesn't give it to anybody it's a gift you don't give a gift to everybody [Applause] that's why [Applause] it's not everybody that has this gift foreign the whole of Israel millions of Jews there's only going to be 144. very loves and seals so El Tabernacle how fortunate are we to have the Holy Ghost [Applause] I want to thank the brother that's in there SMS is in last night from Brazil even Botswana I didn't even mention Botswana last night even from Botswana I think by by 11 o'clock last night we had 1 500 viewers across the world I they never knew about langa but since we came here the whole world knows about London [Applause] and I thank God for the um those pastors out in Brazil that also sent in I don't know they must have had an interpreter there because every time they just say Gloria's [Applause] so we want to thank so many people that has I remember it's not the LT of an echo because we had services in every Church we're out of an equally so they were in church this is outside people [Applause] no one is saying if anybody in Cape Town would like to counter that I spoke last night I mean it's not my words it's brother branham's words [Applause] if they do count it you just urge me to come back again and straighten out but it will only be a fool that tries to come up against those quotes were laid down last night they can only do one thing [Applause] is repent and obey the quotes [Applause] that's why that's why I am not concerned when the people says well we got the word we got the word fine everybody's got the word even Rome's got all the tapes they all say have the word the devil also has the word in Matthew 4. 3 when he quoted back to the word the word everybody's not aware that's why I tell you this year the word is dead this word was in the beginning so let them preach in the beginning the word but we preached before the beginning [Applause] you're going to have a life first before the baby talk he needs to be alive and after a couple of months when his brain starts developing through his Spirit the brain is Spirit [Applause] than when the spirit is developed then the word come [Applause] so don't be taken up with people that speak about the word the word the word they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] and then after your brain is developed your spirit is developed and you know because a word is a thought to express spirit where the spirit expresses the word if there's no spirit and the guys in saying he can't speak a proper word he misplaces the word because his spirit is deranged that's why if they misplace the word that means their spirit is deranged they matter misplaced dislocate [Applause] already preached already praised [Applause] the real world Jesus Christ right is Jesus the word and he only started to talk preach when he was 33 years old but he had to spread it all the time with him [Applause] amen I didn't touch my message so I'm going to try and touch it today [Applause] so let us just read the word of God in numbers again and what a blessing we had if you have given your heart to the Lord last night we we will be over anxious to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ over anxious and we welcome you in this family [Applause] numbers 13. and they came unto the brook of ashko and cut down from things a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff they put a a pole between the classical grapes how could they miss it I wonder that just that one cluster of grapes how much wine does it make God is telling Israel now I am going to make you drunk when you come into the land [Music] [Applause] God hates a sober Church a sober Church you're always as splits because the guys use the coconut to try and catch you but a drunk guy is just happy you just want the grapes that's all [Applause] can you see how the natural types the spiritual this quote is in the natural and in Acts 2 is the spiritual there the wine came down so how can they say the in the land and they sober can't be two guys said to me to carry it two guys the old in the New Testament will be governed by the grapes and they brought off the pomegranates and are fixed father I thank you for the reading of your word I hand this word into your hands I pray that you'll give me strength and a sound mind to preach this morning I'm so happy that I could work for you Lord so happy that you chose me to work father I am even more happy and glad and joyous that I can see I'm not doing God a service without being his will or his word the fruits of the work is hanging on the tree in front of everybody I hand over this leading into your hands and I pray o God that you'll bless your people when I was a young man I asked you help me to help your people the Lord for 57 years you helped me and I could help your people pray that you'd undertake for me in Jesus name you may be seated amen the fruit of the land and I'd like to start where I finished off last night with a quotation that I told you I love this quotation so very much the uncertain sounds I even print little cards and gave it to the church I told them if you go out and you visit other churches you want to know whether the church is the right Church then that church will have this quote manifested if it's not this quotation then you're in the wrong place look for the church that's got this and I just want the El Tabernacle have you got this [Applause] because you said every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church was the Pentecostal Church a noisy Church positive don't care [Applause] amen and out of an echo I hate a sober person in the church I like a person that forgets about himself [Applause] we don't have a boring Church we don't get bored here why because life is emotions is that right is that what brother Brown says so if you have the life of Jesus Christ in your life then you'll be full of emotions you can't help but praise the Lord you can't help but have prayed through meetings you can't help but have a fasting and a prayer you can but help amen dance in front of your critics even if your neighbor is in the church she'll be shocked how you act in church if we have Baptist people they'll be shocked because this quote says every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church Cape Town there's nothing you can do if your church is not this type of a church you are in the wrong Church you better get to a church that has these Karl Marx amen where people is free and the Holy Ghost comes down he that the spirit sets free is free indeed we know more back then the Baptist amen we're in the Pentecostal age [Applause] thank you if the bishop said if the bishop says if the bishop says if the bishop brother Beckett says anything else brother Branham says he's a liar because this quote has no uncertain sounds amen that's called it's got a real sound because they came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Winder amen and his sound like this quote I hear in this quote I want to tell you yes you are in this quote then let us rejoice and be glad for the lamb has made herself ready the spirit and the bride say come amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then he says they all says well don't worry we've got the Holy Ghost we you know they preach on the Holy Ghost and they think that's all right to preach on the Holy Ghost but this quote knock everybody out he says if you say you got it if you say you got it the Bible Tabernacle says they've got it your brother Beckett says they've got it amen this is the evidence and the proof and the manifestation that you got it watch that brother bam says and you didn't act like that like what like the first church then how did the first church Act they spoke in pounds they danced they shouted [Applause] can you say Amen foreign act like that then there's something wrong with you there's something wrong there's something wrong with the bishop if you preach on the Holy Ghost and the people don't act like that then there's something wrong with him that's what the prophet says and I say what the prophet says so if the man preached on the Holy Ghost and say you've got the Holy Ghost and they never acted like that because brother pranam says that's the way Jesus acted he said Jesus acted that way amen so why don't they act that way but El Tabernacle you will act that way why because Jesus act that way why because Jesus is in you and if Jesus is in you you'll act that same way no other way no other baptism there's only one baptism and there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is full of emotions brother pronounces foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] that's exactly what it said what what said that's what the Bible says not Bible Tabernacle not brother Beckett with his Baptist manners the Bible says it's a Pentecostal Menace because Pentecost started without an end and it's going on here because it's unto you and to your children and your children's children amen as many as the Lord called here is as many as the Lord called and we are acting the same way we are in the Bible this is the Bible amen we don't quote it we live it foreign [Music] [Applause] then the question comes up then what is the Holy Ghost you know now without it he doesn't know you they that don't have the spirit is none of Jesus none none but now if we have it [Applause] we need to know what how you're going to get it [Applause] the world is again falling apart and boy is it falling apart not even the world the churches is falling apart not even the churches the message is falling apart not even a message the foolish virgins is falling apart [Applause] but not the bride that has the oil the oil the oil make sure you've got the oil now instead of having to pick up the having preachers we've got lecturers man knows the word they know the word that's why I told you don't come to tell me where you got the word the word but otherwise it says the man's got a word another place he says this morning everybody is preaching the word so we passed the stage of the word we're at the stage of fulfilling the way [Applause] we passed the stage where the word was on paper we write now in the paper is turned into flesh and the word became flesh brother Brahm says your place that quote is in your flesh if that quote say dance and you dance that quote is in your flesh it's been made manifest [Music] it says they can sit there and put it together in such a way that it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics Ethel knows the mechanics brother Beckett knows the mechanics but then that ain't the Dynamics the mechanics the word that's not the Dynamics it's a mechanics what does he say can you read it for me we want not the word because he's a prophet you already lay down the word so you don't want the word you want the mechanics to go with the Dynamics or you want the Dynamics to work in the mechanics because the mechanics is there I don't have to prove the mechanics brother Branham already proved the mechanics I need the Dynamics to make the mechanics move to actually switch on the car and because all right you ought to shout the truth down you ought to run around this bowling that God gave you the Dynamics to go with the mechanics and make it pleasure again that you can walk with the word amen and talk with the word it has become the Dynamics of God we need the Dynamics and if the spirit of Jesus dwells in you it's gonna Quicken your mortal body and the Rapture will go oh my God now you now you finish this quote for me you finish this quote for me I don't I don't think that went into the third dimension of hell [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] my mind couldn't grasp it that a great prophet like that one of the greatest outside Jesus Christ could stand up and say a thing like that I don't care about the Bible the mechanics [Applause] now if he don't care I don't care brother Beckett because I had it for 57 years I know it I know the mechanics and nobody can tell me about the mechanics I know the mechanics everybody knows the mechanics this morning in the churches even the Roman Catholic Church they're going to open the Bible and read the mechanics but don't sit there they'll have the mechanics but they cannot have the dynamic say man we need the dynamic Hallelujah and what do you need Hey Brother Branham says he wants to know the Dynamics how come you don't want to know it brother Beckett amen I want to know it because I want to be like the prophet [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my [Applause] God can you imagine a proper says you want to know the Dynamics and little Pastor is just got nothing the Wonder Dynamics you make too much noise restoration I think page 34. brother Graham said you they say you make too much noise brother promises the Palm alone is it of the joy you're made too much noise [Applause] and what does he do it brings your joy unspeakable and what does it do they chase cigarettes out of your life and what does it do he Chase sin out of your life and what does he do he Chase these two things out of your life and what does he do it changes you from this and money devil amen and what does he do he changes from B want to be a bishop and you're not a bishop amen you're not even anything but you want to be that get the Holy Ghost then you'll know what you want to do what does he do that's what he does amen I love the old time Holy Ghost and the devil won't go near it that's all the reason people fear right it's good enough for me that's what he does amen oh Hallelujah I love the old-time Holy Ghost I love the old-time way I sing on my redeemer all the days of my life because I loved the old-time Dynamics amen and the Dynamics will make you run the Dynamics will strengthen your legs to jump a man that's what it will do it will make you stand on a street corner and Proclaim Jesus Christ as the king God of Our Lives amen [Applause] how do you know hey man let's take the next one reject Redemption in completion in joy they don't have joy anymore look at them sitting in Bible Tabernacle no joy and the Holy Ghost brings Joy I saw a brother sit here from Tabernacle just here amen with that brother standing and the whole time he just fit like this what's wrong with you guys that come from the Congo and UPS up South Africa you want to act like a bunch of white people we black people we like to toy toy man [Applause] [Music] when I see a black guy sitting like this I said this is a bird that's in a cage and proud of him since the cage is open and he doesn't want to fly out he loves the cage he will never get out of the cage but us as blacks Hallelujah we are brother we know [Music] can you say praise the Lord [Applause] now listen look what brother Brown says about the word look what he says about the word the one before this did we finish it no the one before this [Applause] oh yeah we finish it right now look what he says about the mechanics he says brother please read it just how you said I'm reading the wrong thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that you can't even get up from your seat and say Amen brother bear said get up there and pick your heels together get a little Dynamics into your fifth word amen fast enough by the word freshen up by the word pattern up by the word he says you round the way you fetch you around you'll be sinned your stomach is so big you can't dance anymore foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I just can't help this can you read this quote for me brother [Applause] [Applause] are you having a good time then you're not setting up with the word you got the word but you're not fetching up by the word because you can jump you can shout you can jump up and kick your heels together can they do that in Bible Tabernacle no they fatten up by the word aren't you happy with El Tabernacle aren't you happy you know Tabernacle then give me a minute of Praise if you are happy to be foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause]

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] mama mama [Applause] that turned off by the way fattened up by the way that's your faith oh my you're saying if you eat a lot and you go just give me one of those seeds here you add such a lot and you just sit you don't do anything if you want to go relax he says I'm feeling good relax eat and relax that's really hope and I'd say that she's almost around us around so it means is around and as a man saw around us if you are so fed that you're round did you ever hear a fit around man can say Amen can you ever get a 600 pound man or woman that so round fed that can dance you can't even walk from there till there can you see why they did they fattened up by the word now they can't even worship they can't even thank God they can't even thank God for the word they can't even thank God for sending a prophet they can't even thank God for saying Elijah is here they can't even say God for the prophecies that Elijah brought is getting pooped Russia is doing his own thing amen and the world is falling apart they can't even say Amen because they're round they're too fat amen they'll get a heart attack amen their lungs will hit close so they're going to go on sitting in the church threatened up by the word don't come and tell el Tabernacle about the word we want the Dynamics with a word [Applause] and you know what you as much as you want to and then after you eat and you start dancing you exercise you bring your weight down hallelujah amen and that's what we are doing praise God we worshiping God Amen we praising God and in the same time we're eating hallelujah we're eating the word in the same time we do two things in one amen we don't go sit down on our bed amen and our lazy backseat man and can't get up from your seat and come to the front and say amen hallelujah to take the weight down [Applause] give me the next one the token listen here now the token the Dynamics but Israel any Bible student knows that Israel was a type of the church exactly to the promised land and that's where she is turning to to the promised land if Ten Commandments and uh and Mount Sinai and and pull off fire and pull off cloud and uh the rock giving the war to all that is all right but that was just the journey to get to the promised land [Applause] The Ten Commandments was only the journey to get to the promised land now they still in in the journey we have crossed over in 1979 did you hear me we crossed over 1979. [Applause] they saw what justification sanctification justification said we in the baptism of the Holy Ghost as he says underscore [Applause] [Music] but when the evening time comes Wednesday evening time now and the journey was on there was one solemn requirement one after all that after having Moses the Ten Commandments the Smith and Rock Amen the raising of the serpent for healing in the wilderness after all that amen mounts and I after all that the cloud after all that the pull of fire after all that amen there's one requirement after all that after Moses there's one requirement one how many requirements no matter how much Jew he had been regardless of how he says I'm the bride I mean yeah brother says there's brides and brides and he bride regardless if you're a Jew how well you had kept his crops how well he had taken care of the neighbors how much he had done how good a member he was good Amendment Church I stick with brother back as you know and also go to hell with brother Beckett without the Holy Ghost God has no friends when it comes to the Token he even wanted to kill brother brainer took his wife took his shoulder and all that and who's Brother Beckett and brother Branham just sympathized with a Baptist Doctrine not preaching the weapon of the back of preaching hot what a chance does he spend when he dies no chance God can keep me accountable for that I can't see brother Brandon being stroked and really nailed down twice for rejecting the Holy Ghost not rejecting it but compromising with his mother-in-law the other time God straightened him out is when he those Pentecostals came into the church and it started to dance with the tambourine and all that and brother Branham says well you know where I come from I was Baptist I don't believe in this they're making my church a Tavern I'm coming to that and God says what are you sitting in the seat of a scornful Branham [Music] [Applause] he rebuked him twice [Applause] because brother Abraham's first a part of his ministry was baptized against Sensations against uh uh uh uh the the dancing he says I was against it I didn't like it emotions he was against it that was his first part of his ministry he came out with the Baptist idea and all those quotes in the beginning was Baptist but at the end when he asked to be the Elijah of Malachi 4 yet to say Pinnacle starts without a name he had to change [Applause] no matter how much he had done how good a member he was how much titles tithes he paid all these things was fine that was okay he was a good man recognized amongst his people as a good man but just read that so how is brother Becca going to make when brother Brown says without the Holy Ghost Shall Perish oh don't go to the Grave like that brother Becca you're going to have a pleasant surprise this quote is going to nail your height amen set the people free brother Roscoe you're an apostle of God straighten out the thing tell the people I'm in Cape Town and I'm telling you by the quotes [Applause] don't perish with them that is perishing get out from among my people and do not be partakers of their sin that's where the Holy Ghost is it's where the dancing is get away from them that's threatened by the word no how do you know you have got it palm oil locusts Cancun and caterpillar I think it's phase 30. listen what he says there is no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotions [Music] no place no place and they say we the word the word the word but brother Brahm says no place in the word where anybody ever received the Holy Ghost without emotions [Music] [Applause] so if you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions that means you've got another Holy Ghost but not this one not Malachi Falls Holy Ghost the only place that has this Holy Ghost is here Tabernacle so you're in the right place [Music] you in the right place you in the right place [Applause] [Music] do you believe you're in the right place foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not having emotions no place with with brother Becker foreign [Applause] that any of you can show me on tape that they spoke in tongues in Bible Tabernacle or in Georgia's Tabernacle then there is no Holy Ghost there if they didn't receive it like this then they don't have the Holy Ghost now I can tell you brother back had never receive it like this he comes from me unknown and he stopped it in his church he quenched the Holy Ghost it's times that he had the Deacon stand there if you say too much amen they he tells the deacons to tell you to shut up and sit quenching quenching quenching the Holy Ghost but in real Tabernacle quench him in to throw water on the Fire but in El Tabernacle we threw petrol on the Fire and we made it a wild fire [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm gonna skip a lot of my notes I'm late amen I'm late the land ball pomegranate a fruit when they came back they had the grapes and they had pomegranate grenades pomegranate is a fruit that's got a lot of seeds in [Music] but those seeds is in a fluid a red fluid the seed the word is right in the token the Holy Ghost God is telling Israel now you're coming to a land that will have the Dynamics and the mechanics foreign so when we preach here in the land we preach pomegranate seeds in the token seeds in red fluid see it's in the blood see it's not crisis Brother Francis there was Christ seeds going up into the upper room and when it got into the upper room down come the red fluid the token to cover the seed amen while we are preaching here hallelujah amen but right through it covers the preaching amen and after 10 years you can come back and you can see that it's so fresh amen because the token makes the seed fresh say Amen somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] every message that's preached in El Tabernacle a man is embedded in red fluid the token because the Dynamics keeps the mechanics fresh when you take the manner out of the fluid out of the holy of holies out of the presence of God the manner gets tail but put the Manna back into the red fluid with the power of God is where the Holy Ghost is where the dove is where the comforter is amen then that old seed never gets old whether it's the eagle message whether it's what message amen this message can't go stale why it's imperative red thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] El Tabernacle aren't you glad to be an El Tabernacle foreign [Applause] [Music] you're eating pomegranates when you bite it the red goes and the seed is in your mouth and you chop the seed I'm just preaching it I got it written down but I'm just preaching it because I'm not gonna get to it and the spies came back with pomegranates to say this is the land this land is got the seeds of God this land is going to be governed by the laws of God this land the people in this land is going to obey the word of God not only quoting but living it and I'm going to make sure they live it because I'm gonna dump it in red fluid the token the Holy Ghost the Dynamics amen the Darth the quickening power the rising of the sun Hallelujah the comforter has come [Applause] foreign and God said now I've got my seed I've got my word I've got my law covered now you know what the land is all about [Music]

apart that means that there is without a shed of a doubt that the world is going to have a traumatic climate change which they have never seen before we want to always know what is in the future what is there to follow covered 19. it is unequivocal that human activities are responsible for climate change that's the finding of a new study by the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change it's the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades environmental experts have called it a massive wake-up call to governments to cut emissions 234 authors from 66 countries have worked on the landmark assessment the report says global average temperature rise could reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years now that is 10 years sooner than expected that temperature rise will breach the ambition of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and bring widespread Devastation and unprecedented extreme weather this all comes less than three months before the cop 26 climate conference in Glasgow in Scotland vital un talks that will determine the future course of efforts to tackle climate change and the UK Minister responsible for delivering cop 26 has released this statement following the publication of today's report he says our message to every country government business and part of society is simple the next decade is decisive follow the science and embrace your responsibility to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius alive our environment and energy analyst Roger harobin has more wildfires blazing through Greece and Turkey have horrified people in the region the panel concludes we'll see a lot more fires as temperatures continue to rise and Rise they will as greenhouse gas emissions keep growing and growing The increased heat will change weather patterns bringing more droughts and more rainfall researchers say London was shocked to find areas underwater a few weeks ago rainfall patterns are hard to predict but experts say northern Europe will be wetter overall at London's Hampstead ponds they've already had to raise and reinforce the dams to protect hundreds of homes Downstream from the sort of floods expected in extreme rains that are forecast to come the cost has been huge we're already paying the price of ignoring scientists warnings on climate change so this report States as an absolute fact that human influence is warming the climate and that's a very Stark reminder that it is our activities which are changing the climate and affecting these extreme weather events um and as the planet continues to warm these consequences just get worse ice in the Arctic is melting faster than many scientists predicted that leads to sea level rise which in turn increases coastal flooding the Seas will keep Rising for maybe thousands of years because the ocean deep has absorbed so much heat already political attitudes are changing the UK is getting electric cars we need clean technology for home heating too in the words of one leading scientist we're not doomed but if we want to avoid catastrophe we have to drastically cut emissions now Roger harobin BBC News Valerie Masson delmot is a climate scientist and co-chair of one of the ipcc working groups which produce the Climate Change Report she said the threshold of keeping the global temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius limit will be breached around 2050. the report shows that in the next 20 years global warming the average temperature at the Earth's surface over a period of 20 euros is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the late 1800s however if we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we can reach global net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. it is extremely likely that we can keep global warming well below 2 degrees if we do this it is more likely than not that temperature would gradually decline to below or around 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century with a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1 degrees Celsius but if Global greenhouse gas emissions remain around today's levels in the coming decades we would reach two degrees of global warming by the middle of this century we joined Now by Tamsin Edwards a climate scientist and one of the authors of this report welcome to BBC News I know your area of expertise is the oceans and sea level change and in fact you spent three years investigating this haven't haven't you so it would be remiss of me not to um find out more about that what did you find exactly well that's right we have over 200 authors um in the whole report we have uh looked at 14 000 scientific studies over three years and I work on ice sheets and sea level rise as you say we don't do new research we assess the robustness of the evidence so for example for the Antarctic ice sheet we looked at the range of possibilities of the future of the ice sheet and therefore its contribution to sea level rise and one of your findings is that the melting of Greenland glaciers is irreversible am I right well that's right so there are different parts of um there are different uh Ice uh regions around the world we have the glaciers of the mountains and the polar regions and we have the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica the mountain and polar glasses are particularly sensitive and we have already committed to further melting over the next decades to hundreds of years we're also going to see more ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet over the next Century over this century and for the Antarctic ice sheet there's a really wide range of possibilities if we limit greenhouse gas emissions we may be fortunate and have a relatively low contribution to sea level rise but if we have very high greenhouse gas emissions and we're unlucky with how sensitive that ice sheet is we could see very high sea level rise indeed so at my right that the message is there's no going back from some change once they've melted they can't be refrozen I assume but there is a core optimism that this could be slowed or indeed even halted or is that putting it too optimistically we think that the the mountain and polar the mountain and polar Glaciers are these smaller glaciers and also Arctic sea ice um could have some reversible changes so if we limit warming and eventually reduce uh temperatures further that those could regrow and restore to some degree the ice sheets are much slower to respond so Greenland and Antarctica will keep responding for hundreds if not thousands of years and combined with the warming of the ocean which makes it expand and contribute to sea level rise that means sea levels are going to remain elevated for thousands of years I was very struck by what Inga Anderson said the executive director of the UN environment program she said scientists have been telling us for over three decades of the dangers of allowing the planet to warm the world listened but did not hear and I wondered do you think government and people will it's a difference isn't it between taking any notice of this and doing something about it of course I mean speaking personally you know I I do sense a real shift in the in the conversation over the last few years but I think what this um ipcc assessment report shows it's much more comprehensive than ever before assessed more of the scientific evidence than ever before obviously the timing with respect to the cop 26 meeting later this year it really shows that if we do have immediate rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions we can still limit warming to one and a half degrees uh above the sort of late 1800s as we've heard without much overshoot and eventually go to lower warming again but if we don't um enact the policies and pledges that we already have in place and in fact if we don't make those stronger then we won't meet that Target but what are your conclusions about reducing those greenhouse gas emissions and keeping temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels Can it can it be done well this particular part of the ipcc report is called the working group one report which is around the science of climate change and so we looked at different scenarios of emissions and what that would mean for climate change what we need to look out for next year is the third working group which looks at mitigation in other words where are those emissions coming from what are the different Pathways to cutting those emissions so that will give much more of that detail about exactly the how of cutting emissions whereas what this report is doing is showing the implications of very low emissions or medium intermediate emissions or very high what that actually implies for the extreme weather for the sea level rise and other changes in climate no I understand that's really useful tams in Edwards climate scientist at King's College London and one of the authors of the report thanks so much for your time so what can be next after covert that is the problem what is going to be next after this news flesh the biggest thing that must happen is climate change then the coming of the Lord amen [Music]\n"},

regarding the Catholic Church, drawing connections between these statements and the prophetic vision and quotes of the Prophet William Marrion Branham.\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\nokay well we greet you again and again again in The Only Name That's blessed only name that's glorified only name that bears life Jesus king God we um a GL GL again happy to make this recording and um so that you Al bacle people may know the hour and the time and what's going on as I told uh the family about what I see last night on TV about Visionaries people that can look in the future and decipher what is coming what is going to happen and we know that's Bible the Bible says without Vision the people perish so um that's why we feel that we want to do this clip before the elections on Tuesday of the uh presidency of the United States we U Know That U now that there's two things running here the Roman Catholic church and Camila we just want to focus on Trump and play the clips of trump uh with the Roman Catholic church and his commence about the Roman Catholic church and um never before was it taken into consideration and asking for the Catholics to vote and putting them on a pedestal where Trump has put them under so when we mentioned this in the previous Clips I know it was a shocker because it shocked me when I saw there's two possibilities here with this elections and uh and I saw the Roman Catholic church and uh whether it goes camil camil's way whether it goes Trump's way it just don't look good so um Trump as made the statements and we want to play it to you so that you know even before Tuesday either of them spells chaos to the world so uh I hope you enjoy it I hope your eyes open I hope you see it I hope you go dissect the quote End quotes on the Roman Catholic church we know that such a those scriptures that stand behind that Revelation 17 and Mark of the Beast Revelations 13 America and uh Rome together so I want my people to know exactly what's taking place and I like what somebody else says he says well remember if it don't come to pass there's still another election in front of us the prophet stands and I want to say why because in spite of the the prophecy and the vision it might ter but it says wait for its fulfillment now we've waited 91 years for this prophecy could it be the time and uh uh we saw that the Jubilee 1th Jubilee has finished last week and Friday we seen what happened with the bombing of U um uh the [Music] CH and um and I also would like to say uh Monday that pass was also a good date for us because that was the date when brother Bram laid hands on me in um maranata Park so everything was a cluster everything was together so I pray that uh this will be a blessing for you amen thank you from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother brandham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the a Bor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fold the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her rise was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor Francisco 20 uh 2003 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quote is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two woman that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how her votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church two woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out president Trump we are so honored to have you join us in in front of this very very important faith summit uh you are my friend and I am so blessed to have been a part of your life some people don't know for over 24 years as a part of I feel not only family but you're pastor and an advisor and I got to work in the White House and represent people Faith as senior advisor to Faith initiative and opportunity one of the greatest honors ever we have thousands of pastors here and Faith leaders and their number one issue that they want to know about is what about your faith we're going through a lot of problems in our country if you take a look at the anger the the uh the problems that we have and a lot of it is that it's less based on religion now than it was 25 years ago and 50 years ago and I mean we were a really people would say a Christian and really religious even other Faith's country and that seems to be heading in the wrong direction and I think as that goes goes uh down I think that our country goes down I really do I think this is a country that needs religion it's like the glue that holds it together and we don't we don't have that that's why you are the most important people and I'm not sure you even realize it and they're trying to hurt you they're trying to sty you this new Administration this new uh radical left group of people and it's not so new it's been around for a while and uh there are people that are not nice people if you're if you happen to be Catholic we don't have too many Catholics here maybe but boy they are trying they are persecuting Catholics I actually said how could a Catholic possibly vote for Kamala how could that I know the level of anger and the level of uh vitrio you know when you see uh what's going on with the FBI and the Catholic church I say what is happening and you know the expression is that you're next because they're all everybody's next next with this group and they have a very bad agenda and we have to stop it and we have to win this election I think winning this election I think it's going to be the most important election in the history of our country absolutely thank you everybody well thank you very much it's an honor and we are doing well by the way the votes are starting to come in you got to get out and vote and Catholics you got to vote for me just remember you better remember I'm here and she's not I could have done that too but you do something that's incredible the Catholic Church you're helping the poor educating children and supporting the vulnerable all polls are indicating I'm leading big with a Catholic vote as I should be as I should be I want to thank the Al Smith foundation for its Noble work and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic Community it's a great Community it's a community I've gotten along with all my life I tell you when I was when I was President I was in the Oval Office and I got a call from the Cardinal and he said we need help it was during the China virus I want to be accurate when I describe it and he said we need help our schools are in devastating shape they needed much more than a billion I won't even tell you the number but much more than a billion dollars but I've known the community and I've known the the schools I knew I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great and they just speak with it like with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen and he said sir we have uh a big problem we need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York school system the whole system in New York and I said give me 15 minutes I think I can find it and we gave him billions of dollars and you know what he stayed open and they thrive and to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education so and that was always an honor that was always and every time he sees me he says thank you very much I said I know what you're talking about but we work together we were a good partnership right we got that money in about 15 minutes billions and uh it was put to very good use but I just want to thank everybody this is a special evening Less Than 3 weeks to go till election day here in the United States and the race for president appears to be tightening there's a new National Catholic Reporter poll showing Trump up among Catholics in five of the seven swing States tonight the former president and current GOP candidate talks with me again about the issues important to people of Faith about life and those multiple assassination attempts we met at the 79th annual Al Smith dinner for the arch dasis of New York a dinner his opponent vice president kamla Harris has declined to attend here's my exclusive interview with President Donald J Trump Mr President I'm delighted first of all that you made the Downtown Abbey auditions we I think we're going to fit in nicely we're at the alith dinner of course tell me why did you decide it was important to be here and what message is kamla Harris sending by not being here to Catholic voters well I think you're honoring the Catholic church and you know I've been uh long time supporter and I'm surprised she's not here I think she's the first one in many many in decades actually to miss it as a candidate it was always been a tradition so I'm happy only that the Catholics are going to vote for Trump now but uh no it's look I have a special relationship with the Catholic church and I uh I think it was very important to be here yeah uh I've been noticing on your social media posts on your at your rallies you're playing the a Maria you're posting happy birthday Mary a St Michael prayer to ward off evil is that telling voters something about your spiritual journey what is that no I don't think it's just beautiful to me I mean I I look at the whole thing the words and the pictures the pictures are so beautiful and uh yeah I put up some stuff somebody else asked me that same question and it's really that I think it's really very beautiful okay in 2020 you told me I am a pro-life candidate in the interim you got rid of roie Wade and you've said I've returned it to the states and people have to follow their heart some of your supporters is saying well Trump is pro-choice now what would you say to them no no uh I am like Ronald Reagan before me the exceptions are very important to me and that's the life of the mother rape and incest and uh not at all I'm very proud of what we did everybody wanted it to be back in the States where it belongs and the states are voting and frankly some of the votes are very liberal by comparison to what people may have thought but it's now back in the States it's an issue that's torn the country apart for 52 years and now uh and everybody wanted it Democrats Republicans conservatives uh liberals everybody and all legal Scholars wanted it back in the States and now we did that and I have to tell you I give great credit to brilliant Supreme Court Justices we had six brilliant Supreme Court Justices and uh they had great courage and I think the country will now come together will you rein at the Mexico City policy which forbids International spending on abortion well I was the only one that did that as you know no other president did that and we're going to be giving that a very good serious look in other words how that compares and competes with the states but we'll be giving that a very serious look the other day you said I'm the father of IVF as you know some Catholics feel and the Catholic Church believes when you implement this technology you're killing embryos will you have a religious exemption to your IV F mandate for religious organizations and businesses that feel this violates my religious principle well you know I haven't been asked that but it sounds to me like a pretty good idea frankly but uh even Catholics a lot of them they want IVF it's fertilization basically and uh you know they view that as helping a family helping uh parents have a child and it's a very popular thing but certainly if there's a religious uh problem I think people should go with that I should be I I really think they should be able to do that but we'll look at that have an exemption well I got to look I got to get some new ones in here KLA Harris is changing her tactic against you she said to Brett Bear my colleague the other night you president Trump are targeting Americans uh you're calling them the Enemy Within and you're turning the military on the American people you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American Military on the American people he has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest he has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him this is a democracy your reaction to that and what did you mean when you said the Enemy Within well it's ridiculous that she says that they turning the military these are the really these are the threat to democracy people like actually like her with her language you know she's the most liberal senator in the Senate uh not as smart as most of them but she's certainly more liberal and she likes to say that turning the military how ridiculous is it but I will say this uh the enemy from within we do have an enemy from within we have people that uh are I think more danger to our country when you see the radical left programs that they're espousing and uh we have a a true enemy from within they hate when I say that but whether we like it and I think in many ways it's more dangerous from the outside enemies that we have I want to talk about immigration for a moment the church teaches welcome The Immigrant it also teaches that a nation has a right to protect it borders for the common good how do you president Trump balance welcoming The Immigrant with locking down the border and the deportation promise You' made well as you know we had the strongest borders we've ever had just four years ago we had the most powerful the strongest we let people in but they have to come illegally and I don't think that's changed we want people to come into our country but they have to come illegally uh as you know they allowed people to come in from prisons and frankly murderers the 13,099 murderers where they were let out of prison and convicted murderers and some killed more than one person some killed more than five people and they're now free in our country and we're going to have to get them out and we're going to get them out fast nobody wants that no I want to have people come into our country legally but we have to have strong borders and good elections did you see this lip reader when Joe Biden and Barack Obama were on the side of Ethel Kennedy's funeral this lipr reader who's a forensic expert claims Joe Biden said she's not as strong as I I am was it a mistake to trade KLA Harris for Joe Biden in your opinion well we seem to be winning and we were way up in Joe we had the debate and the numbers were very strong and I just see numbers that are very similar right now they're very similar so we'll see what happens I hope we win because we want to make America great again yeah and and your record of religious liberty how important is that to you religious liberty uh it's a stance that I've taken from the beginning and I'll keep it I wouldn't change it for anything okay final question the pope was asked about your candidacy and kamla Harris and he instructed Catholic voters to vote for the lesser of two evils who do you think he means and why well I think he wants them to vote for me and I stand for really everything that you stand for and that the church stands for and she doesn't she's a a very different kind of a person she's a Marxist her father was a Marxist and still is a Marxist and they are not big into religion I will tell you and I'm not just talking about the Catholic religion I'm talking about any religion uh the whole Democrat Party has gone really radical left and I'm the opposite I am totally in favor of religion and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot thank you Mr President what a pleasure we'll see you soon thank you [Music]\n"}, {"id":

in your homes just sing the stream Lord and He uted these words saying this Bullit is The Mercy Seat of e [Music] Tabernacle Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me he says what is the bullpit is to pull you out of the butt and there was an angel in E Tabernacle that pulled me out of the butth Hallelujah I was a good for nothing I was hopeless but there was another Angel another Angel and I say another Angel and I want to say that angel is no other than [Music] Rosco and the another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much in sense that he should offer it with the praise of the Saints unto the golden altar which was Before the Throne there's an angel in E Tabernacle that takes our prayers and he mixes it with sweet smelling Savor so that when it comes to the altar it comes to the presence of God he cannot help but turn and he and look where that good smell comes from but it's all because of that angel of this SP and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands and the angel took the scent and filled it with fire of the Altar and casted into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and earthquake when this Angel comes in to [Music] your needs your desires the whole Earth and Heaven shakes at the same time may God add a blessing to the reading of his word [Music] hallelujah the 28th of [Music] February it was a happy visitation day the 28th of February was when the cloud appeared and in Revelations 10:1 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and here is that Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud his clothes is a cloud Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the most high God and this [Music] was 2001 in maranata park where that angel was blowing the [Music] trumpet want to play you one clip [Music] Hallelujah God bless everyone I pray that you have a good day with God today brother brandham says when you want to get closer to God you pray and you read your Bible so where you were last week and this week it's two different levels that you can get so if you want to get more closer to God you're going to have to pray and remember what the Apostle said when you pray pray some part of you goes to the throne and God recognizes your voice and he says I know that voice that's my child speaking to me now and while you speaking he listens because you're part of him and by him recognizing your voice in prayer he will answer your prayer because he knows you are on the earth and you're going through a trial going through a hard time you are in a battle but he knows he's with you in the battle but he wants you to cry to him and when you cry out to him remember the answer is already on the way he says in the Millennium before you ask he will answer and it's already we are right there now that before we even ask God anything he already has worked out the answer because all things Works to together for the good to them that love the Lord so remember your prayer this Tuesday he's already answered but he wants you to ask so do the leadership and yourself of favor ask God today and then see if the answer comes and if the answer comes then you thank him for the rest of the week for answering your prayer cuz he's looking for an an excuse for you to talk to him he's every day looking for an excuse for you to meditate on him he's looking for an excuse to heal from you and you have a way to God's thrown by the representative on the earth so how come God cannot answer your prayer when he already sent somebody so that your prayers can be answered the Apostle praise you pray it's done Satan it's done House of hell it's done you just got to open your mouth buy your subconscious mind pray and God knows your voice God bless [Music] [Music] you spend time in the presence of God uh that man spends time with Jesus Christ that man hears from the Throne of God hallelujah he's under the unction and God wants more young men like that even if they said that you cannot pray he says I cannot pray that's my hour prayer no but the king said you I don't care what the king says I am going to pray Hallelujah young people God wants you to pray God wants you to [Music] [Applause] [Music] pray God bless you I just want to say this before we go into the prayer session just remember this that God's Apostle he moves in two Dimensions at the same [Music] time so I want show you that this holy ghost that is in this place can move in your homes wherever you are this morning you will feel the you will hear the footsteps of that angel because he can be here and there at the same time as we bow our heads and close our eyes [Music] great Eternal Heavenly Father Lord we come with bowed heads and bowed Hearts to your throne of grace your throne of Love Lord Lord we can still feel the brush of angel's wings of yesterday here Lord

Yes. in Matthew 12. &gt;&gt; You know even the ones who are outside their eyes on this. &gt;&gt; So what we say we must have the evidence. My I know you passed this Bible. This Bible became flesh. This Bible is a man because the former Brenham tabernacle didn't come with words only. But when that prophet was in the tabernacle, that was of the former reign on two feet. When he preached the unveiling of God, he said, \"Know me. What about the greatest? What about this? What about this last chocolate in the box? Because brother Brennham says hallelujah when dead man comes I will close my doors I will take my people double knock I will take brenham hallelujah amen hallelujah and show them the man so brother Benham desire was to live in distant time because when he showed the man in Maranata park he discerned that boy. This is not a normal boy because this boy this was the voice that spoke to me because brother Brandham say I didn't see the angel but 1946 for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time the prophet see him face to face in this angel 1946 and and church born on the same date. Amen. Brother of the prophet's daughter why to show the world this man have only one lady because a woman is a church and she can't preach. You need a man that turn the cloud who believe our report only because you was in the conference with this man. That's why he blessed you in your room by your work. He blessed you in present. He blessed you. You are an a lot of level. We can't come down. Heat. Heat. What we preach is in the Bible. What is the Bible says? When the oil came down on the house, Amen. and God can. Amen. Then God must reveal himself and the Holy Ghost. The oil came down 1979. How can the devil tell this church we don't see God? Who can he say? We see God behind the bullpin. Not only behind the spool pit, but when he sit there, when he walk there, we see the behavior, the character of is the oil for the countries. 40 countries. 40 countries. Then God take the mass off face to face. Now we're getting excited here. I jumped the car even. Sorry, brother. Can you give me the code? We have the scripture. Can you give me the code? The code? Yes. Can you read this code? No. No. The devil can't hear you because he he fight you. You must read to the devil because we have God's journalist. And what does Jesus says when the devil come and attack him? He says Satan there is written ask a scraver. So we tell some former and unbelief spirit the foolish virgins. We show you the Bible that is written. Amen. Because we follow and we found God's journalists preaching in the desert. Hallelujah. Preaches in the desert. Amen. Hallelujah. In the desert because in the desert there's nothing but in nothing. There is something because you need the deep to call you because a pullpit pull you out of your pit. What is the pit? Unbelief. You are in the pit. Baptist Church mind is changed. When you see him, you see God. Face to face. Face to face. Face to face. Face to face. I hear the devil outside. I hear the the police virgins. They tell me now. Do you hear? Do you hear? Yes. You on on on on the on the broadcast. They make him go. They make him go. That's why I'm not in that convention because they worship a man. When Raldinho flesh Raldinho was playing for for Barcelona, the player of Brazil was playing the ball and when he plays the people worship him and they made him go. He was God to the world and now Ronaldo Lionel Messi is God for the world. What about this church? What about the supernatural? Who healed you? Who healed you? God. Who saved you? God. Who answer your prayer? Wow. Heat. Satan. Listen here. Listen here. Listen here. Listen here. Church, I hear the police virgins. They said this church make too much noise. That's why I never Amen. Hallelujah. I never joined this church. You can't join this church. You never join this church. Chosen people. Chosen Paul. Before there was a devil, before there was a song, before there was a jealous prophet, he he to worship in this church because he preached to God. God preached to God and God. What is worship? Worship is God. Sir, sir, no. No, no, brother Osco. They make too much noise. Didn't you know? Didn't you know, sister? is as I kil it near I say balm he brings a sound and I hear the dove came down the greatest gift by a sound because God hate a dead church. God hate a dead church. That's why he divorced the five foolish virgin. He divorced them because they love a dead church. Amen. My the amen. The wise virgin, he married to them. Why? Because the bapt of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God. So who married you? that border and my banister. Listen here. Can we read that? Good. So, &gt;&gt; I can't hear this. N. &gt;&gt; Huh? This is the prophet. This is your prophet outside. That's why it's only this church that accept all what the prophet brought. When you look that to this man, do you see a man? Do you see the grandfather? &gt;&gt; Do you see somebody's son? You will endure your own debt level. That's why you for more than 20 years you struggle with with a job with the money of the sickness because you see a man and a man can't help you. But God in a man behind skins the blood was only the blood was the mask of the bottom of the Holy Ghost. So the blood covers the greatest gift. Now the flesh covers the wrapping covers. But when you see his flesh because job says in my flesh I I only know I I didn't know only my redeemer but job said in my flesh I shall because God is the oil. God is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Hallelujah. The Amen. I love Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; What is God's witness now? Witness now for this age, for your age, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So Jehovah is the Holy Ghost. So who's the token bearer? The token bearer is Jehovah, the fivestar general. Remember he preached it in bloom fontain. So bloom fontain bloom where you planted. He planned us he us amen corner. No, let's start with and is &gt;&gt; brea huh? Hallelujah. That's why he answered the questions. &gt;&gt; Did he preach questions and answer Can we give you the second code here? The greatest drawing and so he's drawing he's drawing the flesh didn't come with that power. We are weak mind battles. But he draw men for &gt;&gt; to serve him. So the man draws you not you draw the man. Don't make the man your charming. Okay. And &gt;&gt; empower Can the church say amen this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is there a witness? The devil fight you before there is convention. You have many challenges. Your car. Amen. Hallelujah. Money, your work. Amen. But greater than your problems. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Draws you. The greatest drawing power draw you to this convention. Can you worship the god? God. Amen. Hallelujah. Of this age. But the shabat and the blood. Give him a thorn. Amen. Halle. Can you give him an amen here? Amen. on the on the behind. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you give him a amen there? Amen. Hallelujah. Can you give him Hallelujah bloated temped? Hallelujah. Because we found grace. Nothing can stop us. Even your mother didn't give you money. Even your father didn't give you money. Even your boss didn't give you bonus. Whatever they can't stop you because the greatest drawing power me Lord. You love me Lord. Draw me Lord. Draw me Lord. Draw me Lord. Are you draw sister? Are you draw sister? Yes. You're drawing. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Drawing to the greatest. Draw me to the greatest pullpit. Hallelujah. Draw me with the greatest power that the world can't give us. That's why we stick for all these years in this ministry. Sickness can't stop you. Trials cannot stop you. Because the greatest hallelujah power, the bum of the Holy Ghost, the greatest gift, the angel bring you to this church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So in other words, so in other words, how can you tell this greatest &gt;&gt; drawing power magnet that you give people money &gt;&gt; to come to church. &gt;&gt; Is it what the prophet says? &gt;&gt; This boy will preach exactly. Hallelujah. So he will stick. Hallelujah. He will stick with that prophet. And that prophet says, \"Hallelujah.\" Amen. Hallelujah. You need the greatest drawing power to bring the people to the house of the Lord. And for all this years, the baptism of the Holy Ghost bring you from Cape Town. Amen. From Bloomain, from Venda, from all the different places because this is greater than Salom. Are you with me? In the time of Salom, only one woman. But look here, Satan. Look here, Satan. I see vendor. I see mama. I see. I see. I see the eye. I see bloom. Hallelujah. I see. I see perception. Hallelujah. Why? Because it's the power. Holy Ghost power. Amen. The angel, are you with me this morning? I can't hear this church. Who believe our report? Not everybody. Yes. Not the foolish church. Not the five foolish virgins. They can't believe. Amen. Hallelujah. This greatest gift. Why? Because this greatest gift didn't know then. Amen. Hallelujah. didn't know them. Why? Because the foolish virgins when this angel go around this world and give out the greatest gift, hallelujah, they reject him. Hallelujah. They reject him. How do you know, brother Rosco? Go to the churches around the world. Then you see the people sleep. There's no young people there. There's no joy. There's no speaking in tonesues. Amen. Hallelujah. There's no speaking in tonesues. There's no worship. There's no Amen. Even the choir here is bigger than that church. There's no people in this convention. Hallelujah. How do you know it, brother Rosco? How you know it? There's no people there. If there's people in this churches, then he will then that that pastor will take that service and put it live on the broadcast. Not only on the preacher but so inside on the communion how many people you have but this angel hallelujah they didn't pay hallelujah people with money but the power what is in him pulls you he showed the whole world what is inside and outside do you see the cars do you see the buses amen he didn't call freedal and say freel come to the convention no freel is with a 65 seat. What is this? Is the power that draws to the convention. Surely he didn't know the foolish church, but he know the wise virgins. Why? Hallelujah. Because your eyes were every spot. God didn't trust you and me. God trust himself. And because when God see you, he didn't see you. Hallelujah. Himself. Because I know the Holy Ghost in you is God in you. And if you have the Holy Ghost, automatically you have the fruits of the Holy Ghost, the garment, God's pyramid, himself, God's house, God dwelling place after skin. Nothing can stop you. Without you is not God. That's why he could hate you. Amen. beyond the cherubams. The cherubams can't worship like this church. I see last night even the chorus leader is out. They say they can't go on because this ladies worship your out man. This lady is very dangerous. She can worship man. Lucifer, can you hear this church worship? Why? Why? Why? Because Mary Mary Mary Mary act like a drunk person. Mary didn't only receive the Holy Ghost. She act like a drunk person. She act like a drunk person. And a drunk person worship 24 hours. A drunk person never get tired. A drunk person don't look Amen. Hallelujah about his weak points. When he have the alcohol, when they have the beer inside, happy the joy unspeakable. And this church is full of the wine, full of the Holy Ghost. So this church will never get tired because this man put you on the higher level. We can't come down. We living on a higher plane. What plane? Not just plain but the plane of the complete headship. Because dust is the mind. The Holy Ghost H. Dust is the last chocolate in the box. The battle of the Holy Ghost. The oil and the wine. The meal and the oil. The meal and the oil. The word and the spirit. The former rain and the letter together in this church. So you never get tired. Tell your sickness. Get behind me. I can't pick one. Tell the devil I'm born to worship the king of kings Jehovah Gyra. Lion of Judah, we worship you. We praise you. We adore you. Sick of no sick, money of no money, house of no house, we worship you. Because when you worship him, he do something. He brings the miracle.

Here in Job without this convention because God have only one place of worship because he give only one place. The oil the greatest gift is only in one place. So if the gift is there automatically the worship is only here. I don't care what the other minister says, but what this minister says, there's only one chief here and one place here. Do you find the place of worship? Can't hear you. Can't hear you. Can't hear you. Can't hear you. It's not It's not you.

What is this? That is the greatest. This is the This Holy Ghost is the greatest Christmas gift. How can we how can we have not a joy when somebody give you a present you and automatically the people have a joy when somebody give him a car of money of clothes. But this church didn't only receive a car. But we have the greatest gift. And the greatest gift is God's greatest Christmas gift. And when you receive that Christmas gift, you can't help it because unto the Jews, a son is born. But unto El tabernacle, a son. So let me hear you. Joy. You don't only You don't only have a joy, but you have a joy unspeakable power. Can't explain it. Can't explain it. Can't explain my worship. It's not me. It's not me.

No, God can't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; God give a mark. &gt;&gt; Life give you. &gt;&gt; So how can you say you are in the church of in the ministry and you don't see the people dancing, worshiping, speaking in tongues?

Moses no joy, stress, scorps here, but promised land. That's why he preached the joy of the land. The joy of the land. Why?

You know when you start the convention and it looks So long, but before you know it's over, that's just the way time is. Time is not counted by milestones. Time is counted by split seconds. In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, that's when time gets counted. And before we know, the time has slipped into history. These meetings we're going to sit in again when we get to the other side. &gt;&gt; God is going to switch on his tape recorders. And I'm sure as I stand here, as we walk into that conference after the rapture, each one of you will see your face &gt;&gt; as you walk in. He's the one that takes the photos. An angel of God was with us over this weekend and he took your photo. I just hope that you were in your point of duty where he placed you. And I'm sure you were there and a perfect picture was taken. And that picture has got no faults in &gt;&gt; that picture don't have your old history. It's only your good things that's going to be in that &gt;&gt; photo. So when we think about a thing like that then we going to hear him say you didn't come to the convention. View yourself something in here. &gt;&gt; Accepted an invitation from him. He invited you and he says where two or three are gathered there'll be in your midst and you accepted the invitation. You are here by invitation and you're going to be there by invitation. So we we just come to say as the family, thank you for the weekend of fellowship. Thank you for the weekend spent with him. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the weekend. musicians. David was very glad this weekend when he looked at you and he says, \"Surely I didn't write Psalm 150 for nothing.\" Elizabeth Aome. We thank all the ministers, elders, deacons. We used to in the old days used to sing that song. We together again. Surely we were together again. We do not know what's going to take place next year. And um just want to say this before New Year's Day. They call 2025 the year of the courts trials and a year of nation turn against nation. It was a year of indictment and in spiritual it was the year where he said I know you're not to the other group. We um we had tried to preach the message and it's not finished. The greatest message ever preached. We do not know why God gave us that message about 25 years ago or more. Brother Sunonny Bernades said, \"I would like to see you, brother Rosco.\" So I step aside. I said, um, what would you like to tell me, brother Sunny? He says, \"No, I just want to tell you this about 25, 30 years ago.\" He says, \"You know what you done?\" I says, \"What?\" He says, \"You took the best part of the message to yourself. And I asked him, I said, \"Uh, what is the best part?\" He said, \"That dove that's flying with you.\" &gt;&gt; And little did I know then that that was the greatest thing. in heaven, in the Bible, in the spoken word, in the worship, in my prayer, in my singing, in my dancing, because the Holy Ghost is everything. And little did I know I'll have people that feels the same way I feel. And little did I know I'm going to meet some people that don't only is message believers but oil receivers. It was worth it all. All the fights I had to go through, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't get me away from the oil. Therefore, at the late hour like this, he could give us a message like that. I'm so glad that I didn't follow like somebody said. If you have a man that feed your garbage, if you have a pastor that feeds your garbage, then you just hired yourself. You just got yourself a hired killer, a serial killer. Cuz a pastor that don't have the dynamics and mechanics is a serial killer. He kills the whole church. Don't kill his soul only and his family's soul. He kills the whole church. And I'm going to jump my gun from the part two. The greatest word in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Is this the thing that separated them? Is this give us of your oil? No, we can't. No. Separate them because God says no before he says yes. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not eat of the tree. No. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt no murder. Thou shalt know commit adultery. Thou shalt know 10 nos before he says yes. So what separated them? &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. That's why if anybody want to get you away from El Tabernacle, what must you say? I just want to conclude. Brother Brandham says God couldn't trust his own son without the Holy Ghost. And Jude just turned it around for me. Says, \"God, brother, uh, Dad, when you turn it around, that means God couldn't trust the word, the Bible, &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost. So that shows you that the Holy Ghost is greater. I don't hear you. Have you got the greatest thing? And then The message love Corinthians 13. They compromise and they call it Corinthians 13. They call it love. They love everybody. I'm dumping some of my friends because of the friends they have. Cuz their friends cannot be my friend. Why? &gt;&gt; Because that word became real to me. No, &gt;&gt; I'm going to lay down with the next and they like this love story, but I just like to read Corinthians 13 verse 13. and our abided faith, hope and charity. These three now he comes. But the greatest of these is And brother Abraham asked God, he says, u when the angel stood in front of him, he says, \"What is perfect love?\" And the angel says, \"You didn't preach it all the time.\" He says, \"What's it?\" He says, \"The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then I just want to turn the thing a little bit. Now abideth faith, hope, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the greatest of them all is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I have become as a sounding bride or tinkling symbol a foolish virgin. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and all the knowledge, and though I have all faith, seven thunder faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it profit me nothing. The Holy Ghost sufferth long virtue. The Holy Ghost is kind brotherly kindness. The Holy Ghost don't envy. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost don't vaunt itself, don't puff up virtues. So where does the virtues come from? Does the Bible say so? Galatians 5 says the fruit of the spirit is love. Love is only a fruit of Corinthians 13. The baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost do not behave itself unseemingly. It doesn't seek its own. &gt;&gt; It's not easily provoked. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; it thinks no evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; It rejoiceth not in iniquity. &gt;&gt; When somebody sins and he falls with four women, it doesn't compromise. It says no, you can't do it. But the baptism of the Holy Ghost, charity, rejoice in the truth. &gt;&gt; Why is there rejoicing here in El Tabernacle? Why is there rejoicing in El Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; The truth is preached. It bears all things. It believes all things. It hopes all things and endure at all things. The baptism of the Holy Ghost never fails. It started without an end &gt;&gt; and it's still here today after 1979 and it will never end. We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away with. When I was a child, a foolish virgin, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child. But when I become a man, &gt;&gt; I put childish things away. Receiving the Holy Ghost without emotional. I put it away. &gt;&gt; For the greatest of them all is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Greatest thing in heaven. And that's why I think Romans 5:5 says the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by so you can't have love. You ministers in the message, you can't have love unless the Holy Ghost put it in there. So as you go on your way, go tell this over the mountains, over the hills, and everywhere that Jesus Christ is born in hearts. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Jesus. As you go to your respective homes, may the angel of God go with you, gave you safe, traveling mercies. And may God help us to meet again. I know I'm going to see a lot of views maybe April month in Durban, but surely we'll see one another for the next convention. And then I want to see if you told somebody across the mountains, &gt;&gt; over the valleys, &gt;&gt; on the hilltops that Jesus Christ is in Eel Tabernacle. As a Rosco family, we greet you shalom. As a choir sings, go and tell it on the mountain. I wonder if you can just turn around, give one another hug. That will last maybe for one year. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Over the hills and everywhere. Tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. While shephers kept their watching or silent flocks by night, behold throughout the heaven there shone a holy Sh where upon the earth. &gt;&gt; I hope I see you next year again. Even if you don't have money, we'll make a plan for you to be here. &gt;&gt; God bless you. music everywhere. Tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. Don't you love and appreciate our apostle? Oh, let's put our hands together. Down in a lonely manger, our humble bride was born and brought us all salvation. That blessed Christmas morning. Go and tell it &gt;&gt; on the mountain. over the hills and every itus is on the mountain. of singus. Oh, &gt;&gt; let me see you. Put your hands together. Oh, I cannot see you.

You know his name goes for a day to me and do it for me. I think I think I see. Oh, let's give the Lord a shank in this house. Oh, let's keep the Lord a shank in this house. As Lord Clive comes forward just to close the Lord's service, Clive Precious Elder, can we all just bow our heads as we close our eyes? Let us pray. Kind one, lovely one. Father, we heard the blessing from the man of God as he send us in our different directions. And Lord, we will ride on that. Oh God, we thank you for this time. We thank you for this weekend, Lord. And we are riding on the blessing of the apostle as we go in our different separate directions in the name of Jesus, King God. Amen. And amen. May we see that as the deacons comes forward. Amen. We just have a few announcements. First of all, the there's a lot of items that's been found that people has lost. It's cell phones and charges, there's irons, there's clothing, there's extension cords. All these items, if you have lost them, it's in the coffee shop. You can get it from the deacons. Amen. And we would like to show you the baptism candidates. And I can tell you this that nowhere nowhere in this message world do they baptize at a convention. Amen. Amen. We have a courtship to announce brother Larato from Port Elizabeth, brother Laru and sister Koutlano Male from Johannesburg. Amen. Hallelujah. If you can just Amen. So uh Hallelujah. Amen.

A New Year's Eve service will start at half 7 this on Wednesday.

This is the only time that our tabernacle is not drawn, oh my &gt;&gt; to a Christmas tree, but they chased to the tree of life. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills. And I say I say everywhere One day, one day you will recognize that God is in you that it will be caught with God. Let me not fall into the hands of men. Let me fall into the hands of God. You tried many times to come out of that temptation. You tried many times to come out of that strike. Prayer after prayer, this after that. But one day you walk into an atmosphere. You didn't have to think. You didn't have to do anything. Your fingers went to the right places. Hallelujah. He saw people that can be delivered. He saw free people. He saw people hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That wants to go home. And my brother, I'm not looking to Pharaoh's window this morning, but I'm looking to the window of Moses. I'm looking to the window of an apostle that said doesn't look to your mistakes. Don't look to your problems. You are God, children of the most high God. Don't look to nothing else. I'm looking to his window this morning. You are God's sons and daughters of the most high God. And that settles it. is so great and so powerful that not even God in the flesh when he was here could preach it. said, \"The comforter didn't come yet, so I can't give you the comforter, but there's some coming with the greatest message ever preached. Cuz the greatest pullpit had the greatest man that have the greatest gift, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he give out to the people the greatest. What is this? The greatest. I feel it in my feet and I feel it in my hands. I feel it aloud. This must be the bapt of the Holy Ghost. And I can't help it because it's not me, but it's the angel, the Holy Ghost that think of my love, but sustainable. The Lord bless you, saints.

given us we can come together as brothers to enjoy you father we thank you for this Memorial occasion we thank you for your Apostle that's guiding and leading us we surely say we have true leadership in our church [Applause] [Music] princess the Lord in let me give you all the glory of Lord and we won't forget to give you the praise the honor and the glory for great things that was done may your bless us father in Jesus name amen amen you can just greet one another [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated we thank God for these two weekends that we've had with the mothers in the daughters and by coincidence the trusses wanted this weekend for the fathers and the sons and the fathers and the sons has been here did you just have a good time [Applause] it's so ironic that tomorrow's Father's Day and the fathers could be with their little ones enjoying things around God Amen what we would like to sow to you to this morning is the two core building blocks of what we believe and what we believe is what you should know and what you should teach your son what else what else Tabernacle in the message of the hour is all about and to say how to put it into the world and what I'm going to sow to you from God's apostle you'll be able to get the pamphlet of it and you'll go through it so that you can relate to it be able to tell your child about it and when your child faces the world and they know what to answer on what we believe and you might say I have a clue what it is but it's good to put it in the world and know what is our belief system everybody has a belief system out there and when you approach them they give it to you this is it and they give you the scriptures and this is what we want to do and the first thing that we'll start off with is the life story of a prophet William Mary and Brenham and you need to know everything about him because you're in the message of the hour and the name of his father was if somebody must ask you what was his father's name you can turn around and say his father's name was Charles Branham because you're in the the message of the hour you ought to know who brother Brian's father was amen who knew that or didn't know that amen it's quite a lot of new people in the church and we need to give you this so that you can go through it so that you can know how to answer amen and the name of his mother does anybody know that if you don't know put up your hand see a lot of yous don't know amen mother's name was Ella Branham the place of birth was Boxville Kentucky in the United States in bucks for Kentucky in the United States I don't know about the Doma knew that but that's actually where he was born amen amen the Apostle we we need to have the answer because we believe that God sent a messenger in this hour amen he was born in a log cabin and his grandmother was the midwife you didn't know that so this is the core things of what God did through the man that he sent amen his grandmother was the middle wife when he was born his mother says The Light Came whirling in and hung over his bed and when his father opened and his father opened the door to the cabin so there was something Supernatural at his birth and he was born in a lock cabin a wooden cabin amen so that was how the prophet of God arrived and that's where he was born then the question comes in when somebody asks you why a prophet why a prophet why do you say why a prophet the scripture goes on and you will have it on the spam flute I don't know if you have it already it says here be all out saying to Elijah the prophet he doesn't say I'll send you Elijah but he'll send you Elijah the prophet that's why it's a prophet because the Bible says I'll send you Elijah and he'll be a prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so just before that Dreadful day of the Lord that's why we believe he's a prophet he wants to say program is a prophet the Bible says you'll be a prophet and that's why we need to know this and that's why you need to teach your child and tell everybody that's why God sent a prophet and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse Revelation stands seven why a prophet and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets that's why we say it's a prophet because he will Revelation stances he will reveal it to his servant and that's why we say this was our Prophet do you believe he was our prophet but on here we are told in Amos 3 7 surely the Lord will do nothing God will do nothing but revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets so in this hour God would have done nothing unless he sent us Malachi 4 that's why we say Prophet because he will do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophet as he revealed it God promised that before he destroys the Earth he will send Elijah the prophet as per Malachi form so before he destroys the world he'll send an answer before he destroys it thus Prophet will be the seventh church as Messenger to the leotician church age he was sent to reveal the misery of God then seven Revelations tell you and it says here in Amos 3 7 God cannot do anything without revealing his secrets to his prophet so when you're out there you're the university wherever this is why we say prophet that's why we believe in the message of the hour because it's Bible amen as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the end time when the son of man shall be revealed that's what Jesus is it will be the same and if this is the days of Noah it is exactly what has taken place and that's what we need to know as young people as new converts as old people and to let our sons and our daughters be indoctrinated with what our core doctrines and why we say that amen in Matthew 17 10 down to 13 the disciples acquired of Elijah should still come Jesus affirmed that he has already come a lot of people believe he's still coming but we can surely say he has already come and they knew him not but surely he will come again to restore all things but the brother by Jesus is they knew they didn't know the first that Elijah John and he will surely come again and if I didn't know that one they will know this one and he will restore all things and we know that the spirit of the Prophet Elijah manifested five times according to the scripture so it manifests that five times that's why it's a prophet because God manifested it five times Elijah the prophet who could shut heavens and it reigned not open it again so it could rain Elisha who received the double portion of Elisha's spirit John the Baptist the third Elijah one that came and they knew him not as Jesus responds to his disciples then Elijah I mean William Branham one that Jesus referred to must restore all things before the Dreadful day of the Lord did this happen do you know why he came because it was said he is going to do these things so God's supposedly showing us we are in the word of God and we ought to know these things as preachers we ought to know we don't just say the prophet said it was in the Bible to say that these things will happen and it has already happened but we need to let our children and these young converts know why we say these things thank you and we got to tell our children our sons and our daughters this is why we come to El Tabernacle it's not just because we believe it's why we believe this because God said so then Elijah will return with Moses to preach to Israel during the tribulation period we should let them know the Elijah will come back after we go he'll be back here so Elijah will come how many times sorry okay so you still what what what we are trying to say here to you today he will come five times God said no Prophet to reveal the miseries of God call out a bride from the church as it happened God's Prophet is God's mouthpiece and as it was in the days of Noah this Prophet was sent to warn people before the oncoming judgment warning before judgment that's why it's a prophet and we need to know why a prophet amen let's give the Lord another hand amen do you love your son and does the son love the father and if you do make sure they know why they are and this is what we're trying to show why we believe things amen then the next thing that we want to lay down for you people this morning it's the life story of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know this man Jesus king God I don't know do you know do you know him if you're in El Tabernacle you ought to know him and you ought to know his life story and why and who he is and we also need to know the date of birth when he was born so when the they come and they ask you when was Jesus born you need it to know when he was born when was he born amen amen we agree we agree with you young men in a way to agree but why we have this is to show those young men when he was born and God has got leadership to tell us in this setting that each one must be on the same page to know in the Bible why he was born and when he was born Jesus was the Lamb of God and he was born in Bethlehem did you know he was born in Bethlehem Lambs were born between late March and mid-april so he was born between late March and the beginning of end of April according to the word of God can you say Amen to them [Applause] he was the son of God Joseph assumed fatherly duties being espoused to Mary so Joseph was not his father he took on fatherly duties but the Holy Ghost was his father amen thank you so if you are faced with this question or your son Faith you can teach him this is what we believe based on the word of God amen the name of his mother was Mary and she found favor in the sight of God and was given was a virgin when she was found with child of the Holy Ghost In accordance to the scripture Isaiah 7 14. and he says Behold a virgin shall conceive bear a son and shall be called his name Emmanuel he was born and of the Holy Ghost she was a virgin and Joseph just took on the fatherly duties because he was espoused but his father was amen the place of birth was bethelium of Judea about 10 kilometers from Jerusalem he was born in a manger because there was no place for Mary and Joseph at the Inn measures are normally found in a stable which is perfect manges I am normally in a stable befitting a lamb and the Lamb of God foreign and when he was born there was also a light a star appeared amen then the question comes from why Jesus why not Muhammad why not anything else the Bible says yo Matthew 1 23 says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which being interpreted God that's why we need him because he is with us the Emmanuel why Jesus [Applause] he was God in flesh in order to redeem his children God came down himself and was manifested in flesh that's why we needed him God himself was manifested in thank you that's why Jesus can you say it after me God himself was manifested in flesh but why was he manifested in flesh why why to redeem us are you redeemed that proves that God was in are you redeemed that proves that God was in why Jesus the Redemptive work God became flesh he took on our sins where no one was found worthy and died on the cross he became sin so that we can become the righteousness of God second Corinthians 5 11 who has no sin but who took our sins away that's why we need Jesus thank you First Corinthians 15 3 2 verse forces for I have delivered unto you first of all which I have received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the so the scripture said he will die and Rise Again and it happened just like that that's why is Jesus King God why Jesus why Jesus because it's Bible and it's fulfilled Acts 2 36 says therefore let all the house of Israel Noah surely that God has made that same Jesus whom we have crucified both Lord and Christ that's saying Jesus whom you have crucified is both Lord and Christ there they have the revelation of the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost but the scripture says the son is both Lord and Christ so in other words the name shows that he was God in flesh he was Jesus Christ he's Lord and that's why we believe in Jesus that's why we say Jesus king why is he King God because God made him both Lord and he is the Emmanuel which means Philippians 2 10 and 11 says that by the name of Jesus every knee by the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is now do we shout Jesus king God because he is Lord [Applause] can you say Amen [Music] [Applause] Revelations 5 John wept because no man was found worthy to open the book of redemption and no one and but one of the elders told him not to weep because the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book but when he looked he saw a lamb as it has been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the Earth that's why it is Jesus that's why it is King and that's why he is Lord when you look at him when John saw him he had seven eyes seven horns seven spirits of God manifested as why he is Lord amen in this day the Lord himself shall descend in this day because he is Lord he shall descend with a shout with a voice and with a trumpet The Messengers were the lamb before the foundation of the world when he was slain the seven eyes the seven spirits of God sent into the Earth The Messengers have they come were they here so why Jesus it's God in flesh as the musicians play before the man of God come why Jesus according to what the Apostle wants his son to understand he was born of a Virgin Mary and Joseph the assumed the parental duties but this was conceived of the Holy Ghost where was he born in Bethlehem because the Bible says he will come out of so that's why we say we don't say he is Lord or that because the word of God says he'll be those things and he is Emmanuel God worth us so does do you understand young man do you know now when was Jesus born between March and April because that's the time when Lambs are born [Music] let us stand to our feet keep this for reference until you know I'll go why we say do you appreciate the man of God because we ask him to come and address US Grace for us this morning amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right now oh my thank you you made me see that amen I was not supposed to be yeah I started recuperating and I just forced myself to to be here and that's why I'm here I try to save myself for the combined and uh I want to be really over this thing I think is about three or four years ago when I was struck with covet in bloemfontein is exactly the same time he came and visit me again and then I had quite a fight to get over it and um but I feel much better I have two weeks to go to a combined so um I need to try and get as much rest as I can so um I'm so happy for um these meetings that we had special house wake and now this week to give you the doctrine I'm a noun you heard such a lot from outside that we don't believe in a prophet and we don't even mention his name and we don't I think we even quote the prophet more than anybody else but we also realize that the young people is not indoctrinated with a doctrine that we believe in and we failed to sow it back and so that you can say it over and over and over again to your family imagine the Jews there's some core values that they are sowing back every day for more than five thousand years the same thing those children hear it every time now if you watch How I pulled it up I brought out what we believe is first before Jesus you know and just to clear the thing up people might think how could you put brother Branham in front of Jesus and I'd done that purposely because nobody will ever know Jesus unless you know brother Brennan and um that's why we wanted to lay down the whole history of the man that showed us Jesus now we are word oriented Church and now automatically you ask the question why and where is the word for that the word for that is in Matthew 3. where John the Baptist which is Elijah said behold the lamb nobody knew the land nobody knew Jesus but Elijah did and he pointed out Jesus [Applause] so none of us here know Jesus and you would have never known Jesus if God didn't send Malachi 4. [Applause] and he told us yeah let's look away to Jesus how can you look away to Jesus if you don't know him so he didn't only had to show us but he had to point him out and he pointed him out and that that makes us the only people on the Earth [Music] that knows Jesus [Applause] and that also makes us the only people that calls him Jesus can't hear you I can't hear you the only people that say that it's quite strange that he always want somebody to point him out thank you [Applause] and that's why we bring out brother branham's a life story and the man called Jesus King God that's our Doctrine [Applause] brother CJ told us that he brought a woman and a three children from polokwane to joburg in the time of Ramadan and he saw the kids about two o'clock that they were really lame and and they look as if they're gonna pass out so he pulled up at the shop he says ma'am I see your children is hungry I'll just run in and buy them something and we can go she says you don't do that and he says why she says I'm a Muslim but to buy food he says yes it's Ramadan they must know too fast they'll eat tonight when it comes to this [Applause] when it comes to this you put on your feet and you feel the difference if it's fast they have to fast they need to be indoctrinated the thing is going to be drawn into them if it's Tuesday [Applause] they need to know it's Tuesday there's no eating they need to be brainwashed in what we believe if if if the Jews and Muslims could be so strict on their belief the Muslims are so strict they even believe in lies anything that the elders told them they believe it you take for instance they're saying that Muhammad went to heaven from the Temple mount and you try to look at history Muhammad was never in Israel but they believe it because they get told that every day when you tell somebody a lie every day they're going to believe that lie and if we tell our children every day the same thing over and over and over and over and over again they will believe it so you cannot compromise on one little thing that we teach in El Tabernacle not one thing [Applause] you need to believe everything that we say yeah well if it's not Bible you don't believe it but if it's hurting yeah only ones you put your life on it believe it with everything in you and how could Jonathan even said why is it the Muhammad or somebody like that Muhammad is not a prophet he's never been a prophet there's not one time Muhammad prophesied to our young people must know who Jesus is because they claim Deuteronomy that God will raise up a prophet and they say that is Muhammad but Muhammad is a not a prophet he never prophesied anything you never said something will come to pass and it came to pass so it's not a prophet so we can't believe in it our children need to know not to believe in it I don't have to grow up not to believe in him I don't have to get so strong in their faith and say Jesus Christ is that prophet of Deuteronomy foreign ought to know that Muhammad married an old woman you wanted to taste our old woman taste and when she died he married and slept with a nine-year-old now which prophet ever slept with the baby made his wife but there's a Doctrine they believe in the Quran says that every Muslim can marry Four Women but he had ate so we need reality and we got reality because of our foundation is built on the prophet and the apostles so we can't go wrong because we know we're right amen that's why we told the sisters when that baby is born the minute that baby is born you take a or you take him he always been his ear and you whisper my child remember Jesus is King God my child remember God sent a prophet my child remember God sent the Holy Ghost in E El Tabernacle [Applause] foreign [Applause] so that goes to say brother William the first thing that God hears and that boy or girl years when they enter into this realm is God first thing the ear here now why why the ear because the ear is the first organ that develops while at babies in the stomach she already knows her mother's voice and then when Mom talk into the ear there that is already developed long ago and it catches the the the words from Mom and the words is another dimension God how can a child go wrong and the last thing that shuts off they say the last thing that shuts off when you die is your ear because when somebody is in a coma and you speak they can hear you although they're in a coma because the ear is active so that's the reason it's a must for you to talk into their ear oh and therefore brethren it's good to repeat things I got one problem I preach never the same thing but a good preach is a preacher that repeats things because God keeps on repeating remember remember he'll tell you he repeats himself all the time because we have to forget and we need to remind our children around the table at suppertime remind them about the doctrine remind them about King Jesus remind them about the miracle that has happened to you and then when you finish you bless your wife and you'll bless your children because that's what we don't do we have to do it every time God bless my wife God bless my children brethren this weekend might seem simple but God is hidden in simplicity you know it's such a good thing once in a while just to break away from a wife and children to be a little alone with him like this weekend [Applause] you ought to have a time of your life because you went away from the hustle and the bustle of brethren to be with him who loves your soul so very much [Applause] he has overcome everything he cried victory over everything [Music] he walked over every evil spirit and you know what as I'm closing he could have called Ten Thousand Angels that Saturday the Saturday [Applause] oh I'm sure that wormwood wanted to come with him I'm sure Gabriel was already I'm sure you real was ready I'm very very very very very sure that Raphael was ready to go with him I'm sure 10 000 Legions of angels was ready to join him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you know what [Applause] he remembered his own words in Matthew 24. he says hell was made for the devil and his angels it wasn't made for Heavenly angels and it wasn't made for you and then he said I'm not going to go down there with my bride my bride hell is not made for you he says I'll go down this Saturday alone a one-man invasion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it just shows you if anybody goes to hell he goes alone you won't have the brothers with him the rich and ruler said can you just won my brethren not to come to this place he was alone hell is a lonely place [Music] you go there alone [Music] but the funniest part of it all funniest part of it all heaven we go as a group for together we'll meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be with God God bless her [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]

This special message will include a deep exposition of how these events align with biblical prophecy\u2014fulfilling what the Apostle previously declared: \"In The Next 6 Months, Something  Is going To Crack...\"\nTRANSCRIPT\n========================================\n[Music] But you can't lie to me with all those spoken words. You don't [Music] live. I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm just trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus in God. Words have come from men. No Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be true. And I'm trying to leave something behind in the foot of Jesus. All the money is free but the holy go and the s is all to me. Oh, the future ahead is broken in something behind the Jesus. This whole world is a war. We follow the world, but we don't know why. We're running the case, but we got something in the footprints of Jesus. I believe we are at the wrong time and I cannot I don't There is a peaceful escape in my bra. You can put me there when the machine is taking the soul away. for the ceiling for me. It's so hard to f Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh somewhere those who It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus. Hold on my knees more [Music] than you. When my soul stands at his face [Music] statue, you will know what I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to something [Music] [Music] behind. I am uh glad that I could uh speak to especially my church eel tabernacle which God called me to be overseer look after his flock and uh I want to say like Paul saying I didn't um shun to declare all the councils of God and not only declare it but also manifest it, bring it to pass by the help and the grace of Almighty God. I would like just to pray and I didn't think it's going to be so quick that I have to put the clips out again because I'm trying to get away from it. But u major events requires major ministries to actually make sense. Like brother Brennham says in birth pains men will come behind me and make sense. And I'm glad that I could say in this late hour that I'm one of that men that has made sense to Malachi 4's prophecies and word as he has prayed over me, laid hands on me. I said, \"This boy will preach exactly what I preach, which I did.\" And he declares and put a stamp on Revelations 10:8. So, I just like to say a prayer. Father, we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ. We know all is just the grace of God. And all is inspired by an angel that we can do nothing unless it's given from above, Lord. And Lord, we so glad that we could only line up behind your prophet that you send in an hour and make sense to the word that he brought seeing that he didn't have all the time that we had. And Father, I pray that you'd again just make sense to what you showed me and this whole thing in your hand because I cannot handle it. You actually is the one that wrote it inspired through a prophet and you said men will come behind it and make sense to it. And you said Revelations 10:8 will prophesy again. And Lord, what we're going to say is already said, but because you said it needs to be said again, we fulfill the scriptures in Jesus' name. Amen. Um, I would like to just take a scripture reading. Revelation 17 verse 5. And upon her head, forehead, was a name written, mystery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, an abomination of the earth. It's a mystery that we're going to speak upon this evening. And I would like to take verse seven. And the angel said unto me, wherefore did thou marvel, John? Why did you marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carth her, which had the seven heads and 10 horns. It's a mystery. And John marveled. He wondered. He actually couldn't grasp it. when he looked at this woman and um we would like to speak on this because everybody is silent and I cannot be silent because I can't help for who I am. If there was a newspaper, I would call it the newspaper of the new Jerusalem. The headlines of this newspaper of the new Jerusalem will actually be focused on the very hour and the time we living now. The headlines will be what I am going to talk on now nothing else because God's word comes in its season and its time and now we have come into the time zone of these scriptures to be fulfilled and we do not want our church to miss it. They must catch on not modern events made clear by prophecy but prophecy now is been cleared by modern events. So we are going into some beautiful things, scary things, marveling things that is playing right in front of us now because it's in the newspaper of the New Jerusalem Post, which is the Bible, the book of Revelations that is playing out in front front of us. So the first thing I would like to do is to play the clip that I spoke on these things that's going to happen way back in December uh 2024 where I made a statement but I feel That's right. That in the next six months, something is going to happen. For the next 6 months, hold on. Something is going to crack, but we will be walking in the light. God bless you. Now there is a mouthwatering prophecy in December 5 months ago and I must be honest I was looking at Revelations 13 as such at that specific time where the spirit showed me revelation 13 and that's why I say something is going to break and little I know something more is going to break. Now if this thing has broken the way it did I conclude this thing positively I don't know what made me say so I don't know what came over me but that's how prophecy works you know brother Raymond Thompson and them will tell you how many times did I prophesy he was there when I prophesied of sister Ba um Daniel's brother Alfie's wife that nobody thought when I prophesied it it could ever happen what she did and the Holy Ghost told me the whole thing and uh when we got to our house luckily Alfie wasn't there me and Raymond was there and I told her what the Holy Ghost told me and she went in made tea and came back and she said I just told my sister do this afternoon that um she told her that listen I not going to believe this man anymore if he doesn't know what I'm doing. He said and yet tonight you and brother Raymond came and told me what I'm doing. Raymond can tell you the story. Then he was also there when I said on a Wednesday night, let's go to a certain flat. We'll catch one of the elders there with the woman. He was there with that prophecy as well. Then he was there when I said let's go down to Clay Thorp and uh brother Fortain being the trustee and a treasurer down there that uh he is busy taking uh the tithe money and he went with me down there and it was just like that he knows of all those prophecies. I don't speak about even you know Baron whoms I'm I'm I'm telling you something that you don't know and even Solenica knows some of this prophecies that came to pass and uh that's why it makes El tabernacle an outstanding church amidst all the churches in the message because a stamp is put on here not only with the Holy Ghost and not only by preaching Not only by a gift, but prophecy has been fulfilled many a times. And here goes the prophecy out again. How many people was wondering what's going to happen? How could this guy get up right in December and say, \"Well, in the next six months, something is going to break.\" And without sherking, without quavering, without being scared, say it twice. Now, it has come to pass. We're going to go into it and uh if that has come to pass then what about the rest what I said then al tabernacle you'll know that you are walking in the light. So brethren I cannot help for the fruit that's on the tree. Yeah, I think everybody has now seen what I said my prophecy for the next 6 months and um there's people that's going around and say that I said in another 6 months Jesus is coming and especially brother Oils's family and I'm now sick and tired of brother uh Peter Majadi Buddhy um hitting us from behind all the time. I'm going to have a special meeting and I'm going to tell you what his name mean and I'm going to tell you who he is. I don't have time now to go into it but I want you El Tabernacle when you see him call him Maju. That's what you call him. And I'll tell you people that don't know what that mean. I'll tell you the meaning of it. Thank you. As they like to say, you can't change history. You know, this is history. You can't change it. It's been done and it's there. You either believe it or you don't believe it. So that's why I like to play the clip once again. But I feel that in the next six months something is going to happen [Music] for the next 6 months. Hold on. Something is going to crack, but we will be walking in the light. God bless you. And that I made out of the mouth of two witnesses. Let everything be established. That's why I said it twice. Now, Statue of a Perfect Man, page 6D. I would like to just read it for you. And I want to take it, Brother Brandham says, and study it and compare it and then act upon it. Don't just study it, compare it, but act upon it. When you do, take it sincerely to yourself. Don't say, \"Well, I enjoyed listening at it. I did, too. But to listen at it and then receiving it is different. See, it's different. Now I want to say you compare this, you take it, you compare that, you act upon it. What I said within the next 6 months, see if this is the word of God. If it isn't, then you know it's false. It needs to be chucked in the dustman and it is from the devil himself. But if it is after you took it, study it, compare it, act upon it, after you done all that and you find out that it is the truth, then you obligated to it and compare it and take it and act upon it and study it. then you compel to actually take it or otherwise you find yourself sinning. Now that is why I would like to bring in this quote out of the oddball which is 1963 the year he he preached the seals and speak about the spirit of truth. So this is truth then that's why he put it in this message the spirit of truth and it may be my going home may be my time to die in other words it looks very much that way it looks as if I'm going cuz after two years here he died if it is there will raise somebody after me that will take the message on. He'll be an odd person, but he'll rise after this after what? after brother Brandham and take the message on and you listen to it as long as as it's scripture stay with it stay after you compare it page 60 stay with it now I can't help for this quote brother Brandham says it and I believe that that odd ball is Revelations 10:8. He will come after brother Brandham, prophesy again what brother Brandham already said. And there is nobody that came after brother Brham and prophesied again and it happened. So this gets fulfilled every time. Every time. I like to take an exposition of the seven church ages with that quote. It says this age started after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which a true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. We know that these must of necessity be a return of dynamical power which is the Holy Ghost dynamics. The believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. What seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration. It was not. It wasn't. Why? For the letter rain can come only after the former rain. So the former rain has to come first. Now what's the former rain? Which is the spring or teaching rain? The teaching rain is a former rain. Then comes the letter rain. The letter rain then is the harvest rain. That's the last rain. How could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come? The teaching rain didn't come yet. Now watch what he says here. The prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach. Now who brought the teaching reign? The prophet who brought the word the teaching reign the prophet the prophet brought it and that's why I do not go in this time with brother Brandham says brother brenham says brother brenham says quote after quote trying to teach brother brenham already done it trying to prove the message it's already proven because the teaching reign has come already So we need something extra. That's why he says I don't care about the mechanics, the teaching reign, the push and play rain. That's past tense. That's gone. We're in another age. We're in another reign. Why? Because this is what he says. Why do we not have that? is because he says the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people there's your teaching reign and turn the hearts. Then after teaching the word of God the former reign he turns around he says and turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers had heath not come. So the latter rain had not come. The teaching reign came because the prophet came. But the letter rain didn't come yet. So there must be somebody that come after the prophet that will bring the letter rain. And it's been proven since 1979 right around the world who brought the letter rain. And um thus what was uh uh thought to be the restoration and the final quickening until the rapture had not come. So this final climax, the quickening power is actually preparing the people for the rapture. So here you got two direct quotes. If this didn't happen and brother Brandham was a false prophet this is two quotes that's in prophecy you know somebody will come and after the teaching reign comes the baptism of the Holy Ghost the token. Oh, I thank God that the world knows, Pentecost knows, everybody knows that this quote was fulfilled in South Africa in El Tabernacle. Now, you can stumble as much as you want to stumble. You can't prove it any other way. You can't argue fruit. You can't go against history. You can't go against a ministry that has proven to be the dynamics and mechanics together. The former and the letter rain together. The dynamics and the mechanics, the oil and the wine. Amen. Together it is in El Tabernacle and still Yeah. So I needed to bring that in for you to see what brother Brandham says. So you work it out with brother Brandham. I don't even want to speak about what he says. In every generation, uh, God sends a messenger and he's only responsible for his generation. And here I am really nearly 80 years old. I'm nearly two generations old, but he says his generation. So we two generations away from what brother Brandham has has has lived in. So somebody had to come. I wonder, didn't you miss him? Did you miss him? I am sure you did. Now, let's get into the thing. So much happened already in this six months. We're going to take two of the main events that's been in the Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem Post, which is the book of Revelation. That is our newspaper for this day and this hour. I make it the newspaper the main thing for this hour and this time that we live in. It's on the front pages of the heavenly newspapers which is the book of Revelation. So the Bible which is the word of God in Revelations 13 comes into play uh into play with the USA Revelations 13. He showed you his power of the beast just like the Bible says the power of Revelations USA. What it's got? Let's read it. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as a mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave his power and his seed and great authority gave it over to who? To Rome. Revelation 17. There is your front page of the New Jerusalem post which is the book of Revelations 13 and 17. That's on the front pages now. That is where we are living in now. So look at the power he's got. Look at the authority he's got. Now please remember this. that the power revelation 13's got. Look what he does when he came in. It's so strange that he came in within the six months. He got ordained in February month. Trump sworn in as president 20th January 2025. That's within the 6 months. I said here he comes. Revelations 13. I call him Revelations 13. Here he comes in. Now remember I said don't miss it. Brother Brand speaks about a woman come out of some America being president or the Roman Catholic Church. And I said, \"Could that be Trump from that time?\" He says, \"Or the Catholic Church.\" So here we see the sprinkling two women. A natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman, which is the Roman Catholic Church, that's not voted in. She just comes in. But the natural woman that will be president, she gets voted in. So I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and all if you read really those quotes, you'll see he speaks every time of two women. That's why we have two candidates for the two women. One is Trump and the other one is Camila. One will be Cama that is voted in. So far we see how our votes went. The other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic Church. Because America owes her trillions of dollars. They can't even pay back the interest. So will she put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon. He says or the Catholic Church to women. Then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord. So it must come to pass that was prophesied. Now let's see if it's Trump uh sworn in as president 20 January 2025 he was sworn in and the minute he came in look what he does. He goes straight to trade war. World economy is buckled. Money watch the UN this year can't move without him. If he boycott it and says I don't want to even mention Israel and all that I stand with Israel. The whole world is against Israel. He says that everybody buckles. What power is that? Is that what we read in Revelations 13:2? Is that Revelations 13? Come on, man. Amen. We are not asleep in El Tabernacle because God placed a gift here. The G20 that they had last year meeting could not come to a deal without her. They couldn't make any decisions. every time they come to something that says we'll have to wait until Trump take office and see what he's going to do. What power is that? Why must the whole world stand still because of Trump? Revelations 13. Is that the scripture that I read? Revelations 13:2. It sure is. He has the power. Then the climate change guys also had a meeting and they also couldn't go forward because they said we got to wait until we see what Trump says. Then everybody run to Revelations 13. Trump everybody. What power has this man got? Revelation 13. Now when I speak about Trump, please put Revelations 13 there. Okay, look at Macron of France running to him with the econ economic problems, the tariffs that's been put up. Um, look at Mark Kaney of Canada that ran to America to see him about the economy, money. Look at Star, the England prime minister ran to him. Look at Putin listening to him. Says, \"I will listen to him.\" Look at him now. Few days ago stopped the war between India and Pakistan power. India ran to him. Syria ran to him. Iran ran to him. Now China yesterday had talks with him. You cannot deny such power and you cannot say that he Revelations 13 hasn't already shown his muscle. It's fulfilled. Revelations 13. Why? Because the Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem Post has said so and it's now on a f on a on a on a on a on a front pages to declare it. He buckled the economy around the world by what? Terrors 25% tariffs must go up already taken place. Gold soured to 30% more this year. I would like to bring in the prophecy of brother Brandham in statue of a perfect man page 56 57 and 58 what is it now if this nation goes busted Revelations 13 go busted the only thing it can do is go busted the only thing that it can do is go busted that's the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under this present ministration the Roman Catholic Church owns the gold of the world and what they'll do is sell out then it says it's the gold standard they gone to the gold standard and the Catholic church the hierarchy owns the gold of the world someone says6 68 billion. 168 billion. There you are. Throw it right back in the gold standard. Now, this is way back in ' 62. Now, you're going to put it about 70* 70 with that price. Then you see how many trillions you got that she has. The gold has gone up. to exceptional heights. And that shows that the prophecy prophesied by Ed Gahil Rossko December was spot on because this year the gold price has gone wild. Now, every time you near a statue of a perfect man, money fails. When Joseph came, statue of a perfect man, the Bible says, \"And money fails in the land.\" When Jesus came, money issues, the rich young ruler Judas, money was the issue. Econ economics, taxes was the problem. Here we are. Are we at the end where we have another stature of a perfect man chiseled out by the dynamics of God? The baptism in the Holy Spirit which makes a perfect man. He says, \"And the spirit takes them up into faith, virtue, knowledge, template, a perfect man.\" Oh, what a revelation. My God, I feel like preaching, man. Hey, man. They speak about virtues. They don't even know what they're talking about. Amen. When that comes in, you'll have another Joseph, a perfect man. So again, something happened. The gold price went up. Something happened. There's another perfect man on the way. Something happened. Which man in the world in this message can sit in front of me and said it never happened? It already happened. saw something cracked. Now, Revelation 13, Trump's politics against the other power. He's flicking his muscle. Leaders run to Revelations 13. Sinski, Netanyaw, Israel, they all running towards him. Revelations 13. What a thing we have. And here we have a clip of Trump and Sinski right in Rome. Right in Rome. What more can be more important than Revelation 13 has his finger in everything. Yes. Revelation 13 sitting in Revelation 17 seat man that's why I'd rather walk alone which with which minister can I walk and talk you know I saw how many times I can't afterwards I couldn't even talk to him because he didn't know he's not a pastor so God can't talk to him God speaks to the pastors first now if the pastors can't even understand me. Where can ordinary members like uh Solarenica uh uh uh understand me? They can never understand me. So here you are on the front pages of the New Jerusalem Post, Revelation 13 and Revelation 17, sitting right there. So something has happened in the 6 months. It's happening within the 6 months. Revelation 13. Trump tried to stop the Ukrainian war, tried to stop Israel and Hamas, tried to stop the Houthies, which he got it right. He stopped that war with the Houthis. Then he stopped the war on India. Now, what power is that? My brethren, if you really are spiritual, you are going to run for your life. We're going to run for your life. Okay, let's go on. Now, the mark of the beast comes out of Revelations 13:8. And let us read it. that no man might buy or sell. There you are. What is Trump doing? You can't buy without me and you can't sell without me. Now they're running because it's a buying and selling. Has this thing, this scripture being fulfilled or is it fulfilled? Right up till now, China is actually running because they want to buy and sell. But who's got the authority, the power in buying or selling? He says 25%. Even if he drops it to 10%. They still going to have to pay. He's still going to everybody. So this scripture is fulfilled. You cannot buy or sell the mark of the beast. and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of unless you come through us the beast of Revelation 13 that's going to give the power over to the real beast you know unless you have his number you can't trade I Trump which is Revelation 13 is going enforce this and this is already enforced in front of us all. Everybody speaks about it but they forgot about the scripture. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beasts. For it is the number of a man and his number is 63 score and six 666. And you don't find it in Revelation 17 which is the beast of the bottomless but Rome. You find it in America. Revelation 13 under Trump. I'm telling you, when I saw these things, I was shaking. The Holy Ghost woke me up 4:00. I mean, uh, the 4th of May, and told me, \"Go check these things out. Go back to the funeral and check the funeral out.\" And here we are. When I went through, I saw these things. I was shaking and still shaking. So, the mark of the beast right out of America. Well, now now we can understand it. You know, when I said it, nobody understood it, but now you can understand it. Why? It's because we're going to get to it, but I'm jumping the gun. The new pop pope comes out out of Revelation 13. There you are. There's the scripture. Where did brother Brandham get it? It's right in the Bible. The number of the beast of the antichrist of the pope is right in revelations 13. Where is this pope that we elected right now come from? Revelations 13. There's where brother William got it. And it's fulfilled. It's fulfilled. But somebody had to prophesy again. Who actually prophesied again? I'm the only one now that makes sense to this thing. You anti- messages um uh ministers, man, you know nothing about this. But El tabernacle, my prophecy December, we will walk in the light. God has to honor that. If he honored what I said, then he's got to honor this as well. So, we are in the light. So, El Dean, stay in the light. Don't let any other m Mickey Mouse minister try to wrap you up. This alone, just take this alone. You were sitting right in the church when I prophesied this. This alone should strengthen you so much that you close your ears to any other minister. Okay, let's go further. That number comes on Revelations 13. Who's handling the buying and the selling right now? A 2 year old can see this. A great thing has happened El tabernacle in your midst. Revelation 13 is on the march. Hardly six months. I told you there two women and I told you that Trump might represent the second woman and here we are. Okay. Revelation 13 lies the great earthquake. Everything Revelations 13 is a great earthquake. And the great earthquake contains can read the scripture when Jesus rose from the dead there was a earthquake and it was a resurrection. Now revelation 13 is holding the earthquake and Yellowstone's explosion and the a bomb from Russia. soul come into play right now. America, her doom is around the corner. I'm so glad I'm not an American. I come from God and I'm going back to God again. God hates her. She's going to pay for all the things she's done. Um, is is this the time and the season for Revelations 13? Yes, it happened before our eyes. Now, as if that's too much for our minds to absorb, this thing comes like a bullet through our spiritual brains. It hit me on Monday morning the 4th May as I said the Pope's death first of all just if the Pope had to die that alone is a major thing a major thing happened the Pope died without Trump now I'm on the second point of what cracked. That's why I said who can argue? Who can argue against fruit? Now this church, this ministry here in EL tabernacle is not an ordinary ministry. Like brother B says it's all together ministry. Brother Bram says, prophecy, dynamics, mechanics, former rain, letter rain, prophesying, all that is included. Raising the dead by the spirit, God's grace. Amen. The healing that went on, all these things, it's right in one ministry. You don't find this in any other ministry. So, what is this? Is that what God made brother Brandham come to South Africa and lay hands on the head? Whether you like it or not, it's proven. It's fulfilled. It's finished. So, Revelations 13 lies the great earthquake and everything that needs to happen. That's on the front pages now. The season is here. So, anytime anything can happen. Um but it boggles our imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imag imagination that here the pope dies just the dying of the pope it it it was so ironic I look at jet vans revelation 13 I look at that the day before the pope died vans went to team. Jack Vans, vice president of Revelation 13. Seeing Revelation 17, there's the two scriptures together. Still tell me that this is not the New Jerusalem's post front page. There's it. What does does this guy want there? Go see the Pope. And look how nice the pope look. Something cracked, my friends. Something happened. Happened already. Still going. It happened already. The two scriptures is running together. You never thought to bring the two scriptures together, but the Holy Ghost showed me is that two scripture, Revelation 13, Revelation 17, Trump and the Pope. There you have it. What more do you want, El Tabernacle? What more do you want? You're not going to get anything better than this. I am going to be 80 years old and a sherk no more. I say the thing because it's the truth. I can prove it black and white that this is something else. Psalm there you have this day the scriptures is fulfilled. Okay, with this we want to bring in another clip of Trump when they ask him what do you like to be the pope and just look at this. Oh my, it is mindboggling. As the Vatican prepares to host the conclave to elect a new pontiff, Donald Trump has posted an AI generated image of himself as the pope on his social media platform, which the White House then shared on its official exac account. Catholics around the world say it's deeply insulting and makes a mockery of their faith. in white paper robes seated in an ornate chair. Donald Trump posted this fake image AI generated. It was then shared on the official White House account. Earlier this week, the US president joked he'd like to be the next pope. I'd like to be Pope. That would be my number one choice. Now look at that, my friends. This looks like a joke. But yet many a true word was said in a joke. Here Revelation 13 is acting like Revelation 17. Come on. Come on. There you are. Come on. Two things I'm showing you here that already happen in front of our eyes and nobody's saying anything. Ministers, ministers, man, this makes you so jealous because you don't get anything that could prove to be near what we getting here in El Tabernacle. Whether you like it or not, I'm saying it because I'm in the the the springtime, not my springtime, the latter time of my years, and I have to say who I am. Paul says, \"Man, I magnify my office.\" So I magnify my office by proving you things. Let us look at that Revelation 13. In Revelation 17 again just and and and this this happened really it happened after this. This is before choosing the pope. As the Vatican prepares to host the conclave to elect a new pontiff, Donald Trump has posted an AI generated image of himself as the pope on his social media platform, which the White House then shared on its official ex account. Catholics around the world say it's deeply insulting and makes a mockery of their faith. In white papal robe, seated in an ornate chair, Donald Trump posted this fake image AI generated. It was then shared on the official White House account. Earlier this week, the US president joked he'd like to be the next pope. I'd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice. That's his number one choice. Revelation 13 tell you his number one choice is Revelation 17. Now, you never heard the lingo like this. You never heard like this, brother. Sorry. They never heard this. You never heard it. Nobody ever heard it. This was a joke. And yet it came to pass before it happened. He already showed you that America is going to receive a pope. And it will be a Trump and a pope both out of America. Man, I tell you, I couldn't sleep when I saw it. I don't know what you guys are going to do. That's your business. But my business is the Holy Ghost shows me the things. I cannot shun to declare the councils of God. That joke came to pass as being the truth. Now this all happened in the six months. Revelation 17. Now, Revelation 17 has that Jubilee year. This year, in the six months, this pope opened the Jubilee doors. This is the Jubilee year. So, the past year or so, the city of Rome has been cleaning all its monuments, all its fountains, getting ready for the Jubilee year. This year, 2025 rather, the year that's coming is uh called a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church. every 25 years that happens. And so, of course, they're expecting a huge influx of people into Rome, uh, to specifically to go to St. Peter's and to walk through the Holy Door, which is open once every 25 years. So, everything is nice and and spam, but of course, there going to be a lot of crowds this year coming up. So, here we are, Pantheon. Nice to be back in Rome. The weather's not great, but uh, at least it's not raining. Now, behind me is the holy door of St. Peter's Basilica. It's quite exciting to be here because normally this is cemented shut, but it's been prepared for Pope Francis to open it to begin the Jubilee year. Now, this event only takes place every 25 years. The opening of the door symbolizes God's mercy. And pilgrims who walk through the door and carry out certain acts of spirituality and charity receive forgiveness for their sins known as an indulgence. There you are right in the jubilee. Here we have a new pope. Last year was God's jubilee year. This year is the devil's jub jubilee year. Last year you got voted in a new president in Revelation 13. This year you have the Jubilee year, Satan's Jubilee year, and you have a pope voted in. Come on, how could it be? Last year, you could go free if you wanted. This year, the Roman Catholic Church says, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Where are we standing? How are we ever going to escape if you didn't sit like brother Brandham says study and show this these things and you sit in a church where God left long ago. God left long ago but you still sit there. There's no signs. There's no wonders. There's no preaching. There's no Holy Ghost. There's no anointing. There is no signs. There's no wonders. There's no prophesying. Get to a church where brother Brham says thrive under the supernatural. Okay. Yeah. For now, the reason of the visit is not published. We don't know why Vans actually visited. Maybe somebody knows, but I don't know. But I just know that it's in the 6 months that I prophesied. Watchmen. Watchmen. Watchmen. What about the night? What about the night? Watchmen. Huh? What about the night? What do you mean the night? How many days did they wait for the election of the pope? How many days? Nine days. What happened with the ninth plague? Darkness. What happened with the pope going to Israel? Darkness. Total darkness. That's where your nine days come for. What is nine days? Nine days is to bring forth a woman bring forth after 9 days. So after nine days, what did they bring forth a prison a pope right out of America? Are we sleeping? One thing our tabernacle, we are walking in the light. El Tabernacle and wherever you are and you listen to me here right now, you ought to shout your house roofs off because you were in a meeting when this happened before it happened. Can a man do and say things that will happen and it happened every time. It happens every time. No, there has never been a thing like this in this message. Six months. Watchmen. Watchmen. What about the night? Now I want to go to the day after the visit of Vans. The pope died. Was it time to hand over to the new pope that's coming? Now don't miss this. You have Revelation 13 America and now you have a pope out of America. Both now comes out of America. Is William Brham a prophet? You're not going to tell me he isn't. My eyes is watching the word and I'm watching the New Jerusalem Post front page Revelations 13 and Revelation 17 is being fulfilled to the tea. So, Revelation 13 and Revelation 17 right now is getting ready to dance together because both comes out of America. They're going to dance together. That's why I read Revelation 13:3. All the world wonders after Revelation 17. Even Revelation 13 went to go wonder after Revelation 17. 200,000 people look how they wonder after the beast. There has never been a number like that. Now, how couldn't this behave? Look at that. Look at [Music] that. Look at that. [Music] [Music] And you [Music] are Even the Muslims was wondering after the [Music] pope. There's Revelation 13. Right. In Revelation 17, 130 states 130. Sinski. [Music] Whatever [Music] color William It's not. So in so came this day the scripture is fulfilled. So in out tabernacle. God loves you as a UN and everybody there everybody there. So it's so ironic 130 has a 13 in it. Can you imagine? And then there was 133 cardinals that voted him in. There's another 13 in it. Then his name, the new pope's name, Robert Prios. 13 letters in his name. Everything. 13 1313. Are you sleeping at Garasco? No, I'm wide awake. The next pope will come out of America and his numbers will be 13. Did brother Brennham says his surname is seven. So count the numbers in his name 13 found in Revelations 13. Now please if this is not God then tell me who is this? I don't say anything. I just get led by the spirit. And if you're spiritual, you'll know who I am. 13 13. The whole thing is just 13s. So I can't but help to see these things playing out in front of me. and he became Leo the 14th out of America under the Augustinian order. And you look at normally they have six ball bearers that carries a coffin. He had a 77 which is 14 which is right back to the Augustinian religion back to the original. And they said the minute he walks out there and you look at his regalia, his dress code, it'll tell you who he is. And when he walked out, he came with the ancient Roman regalia, showing you we're back there again to kill and to murder. The same regalia of ancient Rome. He wore the traditional red cape and trapped the traditional one that all the popes all those bad guys use. Trappings of the papacy suggesting a return to some degree of tradition after Franc's unorthodox pontific pontificate. So we back there with the old Roman Catholic order. Beyond that he has a possible first foreign trip at the end of May. Travel to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the first council of Nia. Now that is what the pope before him wanted to do. That was his next trip to Nisha Rome. What do they want at N? What happened in Na Rome? Go and read what brother Bram says. What happened at Nia Rome? Everything is back there. All the bad things that happened there. a landmark event in Christian history and an important moment in Catholic Orthodox relations. So we are there again. So this guy we just have to wait for the right time when the devil stepped into him. Why? Because the Bible says, \"And it became night, nine days, and the devil stepped into Judas's scariot.\" The devil need to step into him. He needs to get the baptism of the devil because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is cut off. Now you understand why it says there is no Holy Ghost like in El Tabernacle. Nowhere. We are right at the point where anything can happen can happen. So that is what is going on. Then I'd like to say um he's a first American pope. We know that. And um he has a degree in economics. Top brass economical guy economics buy and sell him and Donald Trump. Imagine imagine it. It's right there. The scripture first put it. Brother Brennan says it in stature of a perfect man. We read it to you. And here it is playing out people. The economics of the world says and they won't be able to buy or sell. Why? Because revelation 6 says a measure of wheat for a penny, two measures of barley for a penny, weighing up the food of the world. I don't even want to speak about taxes. I don't even want to speak about I don't even want to go in there. Tariffs is taxes and the minute there's taxes, it's the birth of Jesus Christ. So will the return of Jesus Christ also determine taxes. We have it already. Tariffs is taxes. They're taxing you. They say they're taxing the outside world, but that taxes falls on you. So both of them, the Pope and Donald Trump, Revelation 17 and Revelation 13 is to do with economics, money. Oh my, I wonder El Tabernacle that you're going to get to the place now. I hope that you won't wait for these doors to open because a man stepped forward and said something is going to crack. And it did crack, it's supposed to shake ourselves to bits. I would like to put that scripture down. Uh when a man prophesy and it comes to pass, be scared of him. be scared of him. Now, I prophesied. I don't say you must be scared like uh I'm going to kill you or something, but scared that God is with me and I believe this is God, not me. Amen. So then then then watch this thing. Then watch this thing. They gave it nine days and then they started. When did they start with the election of the pope? Wednesday. What was Wednesday? The 7th of May. What happened the 7th of May 1946? The angel of the Lord came to brother Brandham. We'll give two quotes. I don't have it here. I forgot it. But we'll put it in. The angel of the Lord came to brother Brandham the 7th of May. Now, how could they have the election of the Pope the 7th of May and say Israel will be a nation? And the 7th of May they had the first election. Was that that the Catholic Church? Their wound will be completely healed. Is it? It's up to you to make up your mind. But for me, a new thing happened after the 7th of May. And after the 7th of May, now a new thing happened. A pope came out of America. It cannot be so perfect. It cannot be Amen. So prophetic that everything is just lined up. The Jubilees, everything is just lining up. The name is lining up. Everything is lining. The economy is lining up. Trump is lining up. He played Revelation 17 and he's Revelation 13. So my brethren, something did crack. 200,000 people at the funeral. 133 cardinals chose him and 130 heads of state there. All the nations represented all religions represented all news platforms was buzzing on this event. Even the Muslim network Alazer couldn't keep quiet but had a special representative there in Rome because they all wondering after the beast. This makes it a major major major thing that happened. So as I closed down, something did crack and something did happen. And the Bible says they wonder after him, small and great, rich and poor, the Bible says free and bond, wonders after him. This happened before our eyes. All of them was there. Like the Bible says, the pope should only be the pastor of the Roman Catholic Church or a imam or a rabbi. That's all that he is. Why does all the heads of state go there? If this is a church with a local shepherd, a local imam, a local rabbi, that means this should be the antichrist. No two ways about it. So everything to do with the end time is embedded in here. Everything about the a bomb, everything is revelation 13, Revelation 17. Both of them gets the a bomb and both of them is in play now. It's in season now. So you look at that wound being completely healed. Not wounded. It was wounded with nicer Rome and paple Rome and we know that but now completely healed. Nobody feels that they done anything by killing 100 million Christians in uh that's in the catacombs and what have you. It's completely healed the image to the beast. Revelation 13. They will hand it over to the beast very soon. And then I would like to say is just look at how many ministers just fell TD Jake. Look what happened to him. It's also worldly thing that happened. Look at um um Marcus Lamb. It's also a worldly thing. TD Joshua, look at him. What happened to him? Spiritual side. Everything cracked up. Look at what happened in Dio Gloria. And I said there that Raymond Thompson said that he gave out and bought the tapes and play bought the realtore tapes and bought the tapes and I said Raymond just tell me where you bought it from. I start the tape service bruti. I hired the hall. I paid signed the lease. I bought a real and I picked up the people and started tape services. Now I don't want to argue about who bought the reels. Raymond, all that I ask, tell me from who did you buy the reels. Please don't make a mistake here. From who did you buy the reals? Like you say, I would like to know. Now remember Raymond I know the history of aative so don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals that's all that I want to know and now it's after 5 months one of the days in the 6 months he still didn't answer so was that a lie brother so Renica was that a lie it sure was it sure was and I just wanted to know since when did he have a whole set of brother Brandham's cassette tapes? Not the real to real. The real to real. He's completely out. You don't even know where the real to reals was made. It was before his day. And I I I'm waiting for him to answer me. Then I'll I'll prove it to you where the real tapes come from. So uh but it's not answered which is a lie. Now, can a man come and stand in front of the whole world and make a statement that I bought the real truth. I this and I that and it was not him. He was lying and he bought the tapes. Now I can say he was lying and you guys are following him. I wonder if I had to do just one of the little things that he done, I would have been buried. All you ministers would have buried me. But these guys can sleep with women. They can lie. They can do whatever they want to and they still accept it. And here I am. You can't accept me. Why? Because we're playing in Revelations 13 and Revelation 17. He that's filthy, let him be filthy still. So church, may God bless you. El tabernacle, I wouldn't want to come here. It's just that now everybody was waiting for me in my church to say something about the pope and now I told you where it started from Revelation 13 because he wanted to tell me about Revelation 17 later on but I had Revelation 13 worked out and watched him and I just want to put Revelation 13 in Revelation 17 again. Can we have that clip as I close? There you are. Imagine this was supposed to be a joke and yet it came to pass. And Revelations 13 was portraying Revelation 17. And it came to pass. God bless you, Al Tabernacle. And I want to say it. Don't move from El Tabernacle. You're in the right place. Shalom.\n"}, {"id": "data/EL_Tabernacle_Ministries/2023-02-13%20-%20Meet%20Joe...%20A%20Short%20Story%20by%20EL%20Tabernacle%20Storehouse%20-%20Meet%20Joe...%20A%20Short.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2023-02-13 - Meet Joe...

Holy Ghost then we can hear from God then we can hear this great voice from God because we are in the spirit amen we are in the spirit my brother you are in the spirit my sister [Applause] [Music] and

and 11 you don't have 11 I'll read it for you amen so after you in the spirit then you hear the great voice but John had to be in the spirit before he could hear the voice Hallelujah we had to be in the spirit before we hear the voice [Applause] amen okay verse 12 amen okay that's right amen he was in the spirit and he heard it amen now we go to Revelations 22 verse 16 and 17 hallelujah amen amen how we heard from Revelations 22 Amen in hebbron Hallelujah amen we heard hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen I Jesus have sent my an angel to testify unto you these things in the churches Hallelujah he's come to speak and you got to hear what he says amen hallelujah I forg one scripture Revelations 3:6 before we go there he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches Hallelujah El Tabernacle have you got an ear to hear what the spirit has to say Amen [Applause] I want to hear what the spirit's got to say to the churches amen I've not come to speak but we've come to hear Hallelujah that's why I came to tell you this morning we haven't come to testify or say anything but we've come to give our ear so that we can hear what the spirit is going to say [Applause] we don't want to preach but we want to hear we want to year we want to year [Applause] Amen brother Bram says he had to say to every Church age every Church age he says he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit's got to say to the church every Church age he said the same thing amen maybe it's time to keep quiet and hear what

can speak what you heard amen you actually speaking what the spirit has said to the [Applause] church hallelujah hallelujah you received it now you speak it amen you have heard it now you speak [Applause] it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why the devil gave the wrong interpretations of the seven Thunders because he made them hear the wrong thing so you can't manifest the right thing when you hear the wrong thing but God send an apostle to say the seven Thunders Hallelujah is not the virtues but the seven Thunders is n because the Nuggets is man he needed

shine them I realized they they not the virtues but they are men so shine up those nuggets amen and we will realize that they are men [Music] amen hallelujah they are not virtues but they are men Hallelujah that's why the spirit and the bright say come and let him that heareth him that Hearth say Come Oh Hallelujah so they that has heard it is going to say it Hallelujah after you have heard

is at hand because you need to identify the he and he goes with the time is at hand the time wasn't at hand in brother branham's time it wasn't time at hand in Paul's time but the time is at hand now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Revelations book of symbols brother brandham takes the same scripture paragraph 77 hallu how many wants a blessing and read it isn't that marvelous blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the word and of and of the prophecy and keep these things which are written therein for the time is aan oh my if we just could go into it right now look when is the time at hand when the revelation of Jesus Christ has been revealed to the body of Christ then you know the time is at hand then you know the time is at end then you know the time is at end then you know the time is at end then you know the time is at hand then you know the time is at hand El Tabernacle the time is at hand the time is at hand the time is at hand the time is at hand the time is upon us the time is upon us the time is upon us the time is upon us [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah and Christ has been revealed not dead but alive living in his church doing the same things he did the same Ministry the same gospel the same sign the resurrected Christ can you say Amen to that El [Applause] Tabernacle when he is revealed by his Angel into the church then the time is at hand and never a time since that day until thus has the mystery of Jesus Christ ever been revealed until these last few years then the time is at hand then the time is at end then the time is at end Hallelujah it has been revealed by William brandham but the angel says I want you to prophesy [Applause] again I want you to prophesy again watch the world in its natural how do you know the time is at end you watch the world in its natural the atomic bomb the hydrogen bomb the Cobalt all the bombs and things they got the whole world is a tremoring everything just shaking and tremoring all nature is groaning you know that and we heard on Wednesday what the Apostle says hallelujah global change climate change amen what does climate change say the time is at hand the time for what the one that readeth and the one that Hearth amen it's time for them Hallelujah to prophesy again so that you can hear it a second time hear it the second time amen [Applause] you know it brother Bram says you know it when we open up we read it amen and we heard the Apostle says they can't pull it back anymore it's gone too far Hallelujah why because the time is at hand the time is at hand for the prophecy to come again [Applause] that's why nature is groaning they were groaning because of Revelations 108 to be fulfilled the time is at [Applause] hand nature is growning you know it I know it The Penton knows it The Penton knows it's at end the scientist knows it at hand Hallelujah everyone know the time is at hand that Russia knows that also England knows that the world knows it the time is at hand what's making nature qu that is that that way it is because the time is at hand oh Hallelujah the time is at hand hallelujah amen I want to say the time is not not at hand but the time is here now amen hallelujah the time is on us hallelujah for the Fulfillment of scripture Hallelujah I thank God that you are one of them I thank God that I am one of them that heard the prophecy that heard the prophecy that heard the prophecy and everything is lining up because the prophecy came now everything in nature and everywhere is falling into place Place amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah there will be a call to the resurrection Hallelujah the dead will hear it amen hallelujah the first thing Hallelujah that you that forms is the ear and after the ear forms amen and then you that baby starts hearing and that's why when that baby is born it hears its mother amen it knows the voice of its mother it can start crying but when Mama speaks the baby keeps quiet because in his mother's wound whom it heard the voice voice of the mother because the ear formed first Hallelujah and the last thing that shuts down when you die is the ear amen hallelujah it's a very important or organ oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] and that's why amen when Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell because it went into their ear when he spoke the words they heard the words and the Holy Ghost came an apostle speaks and the Holy Ghost comes when they hear the words of the Apostle amen when John was in the wom of his mother Hallelujah Mary just mentioned the name of Jesus because his ear was already formed in his mother Hallelujah and when he heard it he received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb so when you hear it Tabernacle you can get the Holy Ghost when you he it Tabernacle you can be delivered when you he Al Tabernacle you can be healed you can be saved you can be Redeemed by the heing of your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] year [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] hallah [Applause] H that's why they say the ear when you hear the voice it changes into electricity and it goes to your nervous system that's why you can't keep quiet once you hear it those words are changed into electricity and that's why Hallelujah every fiber of your body moves uh it moves into emotions uh those words becomes emotions those words becom becomes a amen and an Hallelujah and a shabak and a glory glory amen it changes into electricity you get electrified you get charged up uh you get charged like a battery when you he that you are one of them that comes from God and going back to [Applause] God hallelujah hallelu hallelujah I have come to you I have come to [Applause] you my nervous system oh hallelujah hallelujah is charged with electrical energy and it sent it along the nervous fibers hallelujah hallelujah to Hallelujah to your brain Hallelujah that's why I can't I can't St St because I have heard it now I recognize it then you act on it amen hallelujah I heard I I heard when you get the Holy Ghost it gives you emotions I heard it but now I act on it I recognize it and I act on it amen I heard that the Holy Ghost doesn't come with emotions but when the Holy Ghost comes in me I will have emotions so I act on it I hear it I recognize it and I act on it amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen amen [Applause] amen hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I have recognized you now I act on it amen the word of God that's why they say you only hear what one ear you hear mostly with one [Music] ear hallelujah hallelujah you don't hear what both ears but you mostly hear with your right ear Hallelujah that's why the Bible wasn't wrong when God says give me your ears not your ears your ear he doesn't want your left ear but he wants your right ear Hallelujah even so we can hear what po ears our brains more efficient efficiently process speech heard with the right ear because those signals arrive more quickly in a children younger than 11 the right ear Advantage is the most noticeable hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I want to hear what my right here Lord I give you my [Applause] ear because we come to you as a child Hallelujah you got to become a child so that you can have the right ear and hear the word of God [Applause] Amen [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I've heard that I'm one of them you have heard it but now you act on it God says you a son and a daughter of God you have heard it but now you act on it after it's reach your ear you say I believe it Lord I believe that I'm one of them I believe that I'm going into the Rapture I believe that I am a son and a daughter of the most high come from God and I'm going back to [Applause] God brother Clen what's the use you have an ear but you don't have a mouth because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God [Applause] and how will you he without the preacher the Bible says how will they hear if I don't send a preacher if I don't send a mouthpiece how will the year how will y Tabernacle year if there is no mouth to speak it amen [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without the preacher so you got a hear when there's a preacher if there's no pracher you can't hear so you can't have Revelations 108 out the [Applause] preacher and the Seven Thunders will give you Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith it's the oil it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can't have Rapture in faith without the mouthpiece [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't have it you can't have it without the preacher you got to have a preacher amen hallelujah not all the preacher you can't have it but we got a preacher and we can hear it we can feel it we can love it we can be prepared for it to have Rapture in faith and what is Rapture in faith uh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost H Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah I have raptured in FA hallu hall hallelujah he says when the eyes were open as the musicians comes up amen hallelujah we laugh at the preacher sometimes a good gospel preacher because he disagrees with our theology we make fun of him sometimes and even calls him that scandalous name of Holy Roller fanatic you don't know you might be talking about God when you do that oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so this man is very close to God when you say he's a Holy Roller he's a fanatic you might be speaking about God it's God in the preacher it's God in the Apostle it's God in you it's God in Me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallall Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah h hallu amen just another one questions and answers on Hebrews Hallelujah 63 632 so you won't hear from nothing but you'll hear from a preacher Hallelujah and watch which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has the greatest Authority that's why Paul says if an angel comes from Heaven Hallelujah and he doesn't say what I say let him he be a curse amen because the man in the pit though Michael is around the throne and Gabriel and Uriel the one in the pit has more Authority [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen the angel in the pit the angel in the poopet the angel in the poopet has more Authority amen s an angel up [Applause] there amen amen Apostle amen Apostle [Applause] amen that's why I can understand now when the apostles says that Mighty Angel when he dropped down he had to drop down into 26 elements because down here he doesn't have authority but in 60 26 elements he has [Applause] Authority a angel can't speak to you God needs a man a man with the mouth so that you can have an ear and hear what the mouth what the angel in the poop says to you and if the angel in the poop says you more than an overcomer then you more than of Overcomer because he's got Authority when he speaks Heaven stands at attention and says you better go answer my servant he's got more Authority than any angel in heaven then the answer must come uh then healing must come uh then Deliverance must come when the angel in the pulet speak then something must happen then the Holy Ghost will fall then something will happen to you and something will happen to me when he speaks something [Applause] happens amen [Applause] amen William Brenham can't speak anymore he's an angel in the Oran form but God will have somebody in the pit an angel behind the pit that has more Authority Hallelujah it means if he has more Authority than an angel in heaven it means he speaks before that angel when he speaks that angel must obey [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah Paul says if any angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel to you than this which I've already preached let him be be a curse so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God oh Hallelujah he's right in the throne amen he stands next to God Anointed with the Holy Ghost and Fire oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah do you believe y Tabernacle that the angel in the poopet has more Authority than an angel of Heaven do you believe El Tabernacle the angel in the poopit do you believe El Tabernacle the angel in the poopet do you believe do you believe do you believe have you heard the angel from the [Music] poopit amen amen amen amen amen amen the amen God the amen God the amen God I serve the amen God El tacle do you serve the amen God do you serve the amen God I serve the amen God God [Music]

Baptist [Applause] [Applause] s the Pentecostal experience under [Applause] that's why the people that has the Pentecostal experience gets such a lot out of a service [Applause] there is no time to sleep because the Holy Spirit is not gonna make you sleep [Music] [Applause] [Applause] they told Brother Branham how can you preach with all that noise and brother Brandon my answer them and said that's why I'm preaching [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I I've come down again too but every girl or husband and Jonathan as you feel the library dances yeah [Applause] we creature in the name of Jesus king God [Applause] [Applause] will ask him to bless you and we won't so I don't know I'm happy to be here [Applause] we came from bloemfontein and meeting them on Wednesday came down again to have this meeting and just greet you people [Applause] [Applause] are going up to George from yeah after the meeting I'm not gonna rush back home for the meeting next week [Applause] I have a busy schedule I like to be busy anyhow and try to look for that last soul [Applause] and I hope you are also looking for him [Applause] it could even be your friend that you walk with maybe every day to work it could even be a colic at work could be the neighbor it says you look for them [Applause] what else [Applause] let us look to make the time shorter now I don't know I still have a question mark with a you still got to be saved or whether he's gonna get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in because the baptism of the Holy Ghost put you in the church and when you come in from outside you only get converted so either way we sick and tired of this old world [Applause] song that's why we have been preaching in 40 countries and we didn't ask any of that 40 countries if we can come and visit them they send me invitation I don't go out to any country [Applause] unless they give me invitation [Applause] so I know there's some brethren as they travel they write and they ask if they could come and preach to their congregations around the world but I haven't asked any ever if I could come and visit their Church I was given invitations to the 40 countries and that's not the only countries that I visited I visited Taiwan Greece China of Africa with Zambia malao in Swaziland I visited Rome Italy Portugal and Malaysia and Singapore Argentina Wales Egypt Jordan and on and on and on it goes [Applause] [Applause] and right now it's been streamed right across South Africa this Gathering yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and by tomorrow it will be worldwide we do not ask them to come onto our stream but people knows where they can get something [Applause] [Applause] and so there's a lot of people a lot of ministers at streams but the people know they're not going to get anything so they don't listen to them they get sick so eight to ten or 20 people listening to their messages because there's no meat on the bone [Applause] and people you cannot fool them all the time [Applause] they're going to find out you look at animal life you'll find animals only there where they can get food the minute they don't get food they travel to another place [Applause] they might they might not like the place but because of the food that's there they might not like El Tabernacle but they like the food that's in our government so therefore we put the food on the table before them and you find them eating [Applause] another Pastor told me the other some time ago told me Brothers go all the two don't have to do please don't stop preaching because we're going to die [Applause] so foreign something you sound and it's selling Maybe you sound some things that the people want and they buy it why must you go and sell something that the people that don't want and leave the thing that you are selling that is actually bringing in something you'd rather leave the other thing and you go on to the thing that works [Applause] [Applause] so we are not gonna give this up for anything amen so may God bless you and uh you pray for me I pray for you [Applause] and remember we didn't come to church today we come here today to speak to something that will speak back to us [Applause] yeah [Applause] you're not going out here with an unanswered question May all your questions the answer is my prayer [Applause] so I think you know already what I'm gonna preach on because I streamed it and I am going to preach on it because I am the elders member in the message now in South Africa or in Africa in the whole of Africa and uh I am the only one that brother Branham laid the hands on [Applause] so so I should know what I'm talking about I I didn't come here to waste your time and waste my time because there is no time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have to make sure that everything is in place for us to make it to the gate positively and I don't want to miss it amen therefore let's go to the word of God and let us put down what God wants us to have for this day because he says give us this day Our Daily Bread so may he help us to give you this day your daily bread I like to take two scriptures in Ecclesiastes three one three eight First Corinthians 3 6. and Zechariah 4 6. turning to Ecclesiastes chapter 3. verse 1. and then Ecclesiastes three verse 8. to everything there is a season and a Time to every purpose under the heaven everything has a Time and has a season for every purpose that God sinned on the Earth therefore it's essential to know what time you are living in and what season you are experiencing in the message of the hour we cannot just go on and says I am in the message and you do not know your time in the message and your season in the message because everything has a Time and a season then verse 8 it says A Time To Love and as I said when we spoke on George Martin's thing brother George Martin Pastor George Martin sing I said you can't love all the time and that made me sick in this message wherever you go you hear love love love nice humble love and it's wrong because there's only a Time and a season too long I want to come back there then it says A Time To Love and a time to you can't hate all the time you become an outlaw when you hate all the time but now you can't hate in the time of love That season you need to love and then you can't Love in the Time of hate and judgment Sodom couldn't get love because it was a time of judgment you must have your balance I'd like to take another scripture um as I said Corinthians 3 verse 6. 13 6 I'm sorry 13 6. it says that love rejoices not in iniquity love rejoice in the truth now how could you say you have love and there's no rejoicing in your church then you're a liar because love rejoice you can't have rejoicing Without Love then why isn't there rejoicing in the church because automatically there's no love then why is there such a lot of rejoicing in El Tabernacle now I'm asking you [Applause] because we put a thing the way God wants it have you got it did I speak to somebody right over the air in South Africa where they're listening to me have you got it Johannesburg all those places so no rejoicing No Love and then made it worse rejoice in the truth the truth is the word so they don't have the true word in its season and in its time [Applause] another scripture foreign chapter 4 verse 6. then it answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Jehovah Bell I like to put brother branham's name in there saying to brother Brennan it's not by might nor by power but [Music] father we thank you for the reading of your word you said that your word won't turn unto your Void but it will accomplish what it should and I'll pray that you would open it up punctuated anointed throw water on it Let It Grow and never stop growing Lord as we add add the seven birth pings of Malachi 4. I hand a meeting into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be suitable um uh time to love A Time To Love there's only a space of time to love and there's a time space to hate that's why brother Branham says we must be like Jesus Christ we mustn't get too soft that we don't clean out the church he says Jesus Christ went into the church with a whoop and he says he cleaned the church out [Music] now that was not the time to laugh that was not the time to be nice my brother that was not the time to be meek my brother that was not the time that we think that love had to cover the multitude of the Sun in the church that was a time of height because the prophet says he looked at them with hatred malice he was crossed when he looked at him and brother when it says where's your virtues now if you don't hear the balance you would says now how could this be love that was perfect Lord [Applause] that was perfect love when he cleaned out the church and hit on the cross when there was a sin on his right left hand side and guys gambling here at the foot of his is his his cross he looked down on them and he says I forgive you A Time To Love [Applause] so there's a Time To Love and there's a time to hate the Bible says he loves The Sinner that's why he says they know not what they do it was a time that it showed love but in the temple there was no time for love Sodom and Gomorrah there was no time to lie so so he says I hated Esau there was no time to allow [Applause] so I came to the conclusion What is love everybody speaks about love wherever you go love they think that when you rebuke people you don't have love when you tell them where they are wrong they say you have no love [Applause] and then the one that compromises with a guy that is wrong that guy's got love it's got love you know no he's got compromise he's compromising [Applause] give me the man that come up and said brother Roscoe you're wrong then I show you a man that loves me and he shows me in the Bible and he shows me in the spoken word then I would say yes that's a lot [Applause] when you straighten out somebody then they say Mr No Love and yet that's love so what is love What is love is allowed to compromise with your brother if he can't dance and he doesn't want to dance and he'll reject to dance and the Bible says You must dance and you tell him the Bible says so and he doesn't want to listen you are the one that has love but he hasn't got it because God's love is correct [Applause] that's why an El Tabernacle when you're wrong you're wrong [Music] [Applause] What is love I sat in a church in Kimberly in another guy got up and say yeah you must love and I knew it was for me and I look at him I look at this young man and I said this young man don't even know what love is but they speak about love What is love do they know what is love now what a queer title and subject this is What is love and I got it straight from Brother Brennan brother Brandon rejected King I think 1916. I think that's after he preach all the love messages and then after that he preached on the rejected King and the angel of the Lord came to him and he thought this is my chance this is my opportunity this is my time This Is My Season to ask the angel of the Lord and this is what he asked the angel of the Lord angel of God What is love brother praying didn't even know what love is I Didn't Know What Love Is a seventh messenger Didn't Know What Love Is and I'm asking the same question What is love and the angel of the Lord says William Branham you've been preaching it all the time he says but what he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love now who has love I've got news for you El Tabernacle El Tabernacle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so what happened here president Didn't Know What Love Is that came out of the heart of the angel Into the Heart of the prophet then made known through the heart of an apostle this morning this morning this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I know what love is but they never knew it because nobody ever preached it this is the first time somebody preaching that the baptism of the Holy Ghost Islam what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost drunk in the spirit what's the baptism of the Holy Ghost president shouting and jumping and screaming what's the battle of the Holy Ghost emotions Say Amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] you know what they destroyed the library before reading the book they destroy the storehouse before they heard my message and now they're in darkness and our brother Branham tells you you don't have love until it is the Holy Ghost [Music] so you don't listen to them when they speak on love if they don't bring it from the Holy Ghost it's not God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I listen to them as they preach on love and speak about love and love amen and I think in myself they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] they mix love up with a fruit of love because I'm gonna jump the gun now Galatians tells you that the Fruit of the Spirit is love so love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only a fruit [Applause] of the Holy Ghost and they say that is love that's not love the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love my brother it's love my sister it's love my sinner friend get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he will lead you into love [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the either makes up love with the fruit of the spirit weakness and temperance godliness amen and niceness beautifulness and all that that's all fruit that's not love is the holy ghost that produce those things [Applause] do you understand [Applause] hermanus do you understand [Applause] [Music] so you never believe fables amen that's why you and El Tabernacle [Applause] and that's why you rejoice saying because the word of God has been preached [Applause] [Music] aren't you happy New Year [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] then they mix up love with fully Your Love for your love is not love there's only one love can you tell me which love [Applause] they brought us a belief loveman if you love a girl man are you going to be sad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and if you love God [Applause] they mix up love the world makes up love everybody makes up love they think to give things to the poor and all that that's love that's not love there's only one love and it's God's love and God's love is a rebuking love because it's resumed it rejoices in the truth and the truth shall set you free [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they mix up love amen they have a compromising love the guy the guy sleeps with every woman he gets and they still have him in the church paying tithes I give his tights back and says get out if I love him I'm going to correct him [Applause] amen [Applause] they believe in a in a compromising love the world believe in a compromising love why love hanging on a chain around their necks is in love but a perverted love and they feel religious would love hanging around the Nets on a chain love as a sticker on the bumper of a car is in love but perverted cloth and they feel secure because they've got love on the bumper of a car that nobody will steal that car that's not love they have love on a Signet of a ring amen that isn't love amen because tomorrow you can take that ring off and throw it away and say you have love that's not love they marry today tomorrow they divorce and the ring is gone that's not love and they feel they secure and they feel they're religious love displayed on a billboard of a building that's not love and they feel that they have salvation because love the word love is there I like brother Layman used to say he says don't come and tell me about love he says he's a loved one love on the postcard and a letter wrote to a woman or a man that's not love it's only a Feeling [Applause] then what is love it's not a Signet love on a ring it's not hanging around a neck it's not on a bumper sticker it's not the Love on a billboard or then what is love tell me church tell me I can't hear you I don't hear you that's too soft yes that is love according to Malachi 4 and according to the angel which is Jesus Christ [Applause] oh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Alice it's everything [Applause] [Music] why must I settle for less when God gave me the Revelation like another Prophet told me he says you took the best out of the message I said what's that he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost I took the best and I've got the best because the baptism of the Holy Ghost as ours [Applause] foreign [Applause] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is even the blood because the token is the Holy Ghost even the blog the blood that cleans you that's even the Holy Ghost that's even the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost baptism is greater than the word brother Brennan said [Applause] [Music] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost sees everything [Applause] [Music] Church I'll come and creep and sit in the back there for what my ears year and what my heart fails I peel it in my hands I peel it in my feet I put it way over me the love of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now listen to this they do not know what love is you know why because many love power they love power but I have no power to love they love power but they don't have power to love why because you can only get power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you have power to love Hallelujah blessed be my conscious man can preach man Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I want you to say it with me many love power but they have no power to love what happened when I answered George Martin of Pastor George Martin I said there's no love they speak about love but they don't have power to enforce law they don't have power to send my brother I forgive you but El Tabernacle the power is here for you to love your brother to love your sister to love your enemy power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh my they all speak about the blood [Music] but they never broke the blood but ultimate broke the blood vessel what came out of that what came out of that I want to hear from you what did come out of the blood vessel so that means you're under the blood [Applause] [Music] oh my God Jonathan in the Bible his father wanted him to portray David Jonathan in the Bible was actually hated by his father because of what because of the love he had for David [Applause] and you know what the Bible says the love between the two of them was greater than the love of a woman it was greater than polio love so what love was between Jonathan and David if it was greater [Music] [Applause] then what is the love in El Tabernacle [Music] a holy ghost love the real alarm [Applause] [Music] the baptism of the Holy Ghost alive [Applause] now listen to this preaching my God this guy can preach man listen to this preaching Amen brother Brahm says the guide which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes the Believer by the hand in a guide and he leads him into faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness he leads you into his own virtues he leads you into his own fruit amen the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and what I like and what I love after he led you right up then he says he lead you into the Holy Ghost then brother man put the Holy Ghost there and the next step is love and Galatians is the the fruit of the Holy Ghost is so the Holy Ghost gives you the Capstone that was for somebody somewhere [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there is only one love and that's a couple of all the other loves is a perversion it gets weaker and weaker everything that's not the Holy Ghost is not perfect because when that which is perfect has come that's which is in part will be done away with because the quickening power the Holy Ghost will change this Mortal body [Music] keeping the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] let me just eat this quickly a couple of his first John 4 16. God is a love and God is a spirit so the spirit has the fruits and all the fruits have the spirit fully Your Love is love for a woman Ephesians 5 28. its husbands love your wives a weaker love now it's not love God is love your wife it's a weaker love the third one as it comes down the ladder Heroes of love Evil's love is a sexual love goes into sex Hebrew 13 4 the bed is undefiled a week of love then it gets weaker it goes to stoic love stoic love is love for another man's wife Exodus 20. Thou shalt not come until thou tree [Applause] then it gets weaker it goes into free love free love free love amen Genesis 6 they took them to themselves wives they didn't marry them free love then it gets weaker it gets into lust full love Matthew 5 28 who sayever look upon a woman and lust after her has commanded adultery with her already lustful love [Applause] listen I can't help for what God gave me I can't help for what a preacher I am I can't help from a gift God gave me I came from the conference of God and I don't read the spoken word like all the other ministers God leads me different [Applause] [Music] then it comes to the loss Brother Bruno says then he comes to the last ungodly love which is Romans 1 24 homosexual love Solomon Gomorrah then God comes into the flesh it's a homosexual love then he comes down himself to come and see if it is soul Amen in homosexual love when it hits homosexual love it leads the the color violet it comes into the color violet and God become a man [Applause] [Applause] when you get here it's so far away from a couple so far away from the spirit of God that it's not resembling God anymore but is resembling the Lucifer then it goes further amen into a a a a furtherance from the agape love it goes into incest father sleeping with their daughters it breaks down it becomes worse and worse and worse and worse are we there [Applause] then you have men sleeping with animals it's also love so what is love those six steps or seven steps is not love there's only one love and that's the Holy Ghost and you don't want it you message groups don't want it and he says that in rejected King when the angel told him that love is the Holy Ghost rejected King is the Holy Ghost rejected of course it was rejected in this message they didn't want to jump they didn't want to have that Pompa do mix up they didn't want to act like maniacs but I'm like Paul my father in the way that Paul Harris say I'll serve the god of my fathers if they don't like it I don't care I'm like David I will dance before the ark because love rejoices in the ark [Applause] come on [Applause] and I don't know how you feel hermanus if you feel like your pastor then you'll do what your pastor do if he dances you will dance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Love Comes weaker as it comes into almost sexuality and then God said Michael Gabriel step into this why Lord he says we're going to take a little stroll [Applause] where to Lord going down to the plains of memory who's in the plains of memory is a plain and simple guy by the name of Abraham [Music] [Applause] but I'm not going to visit Abraham I want to visit Sarah [Music] when God comes into the flesh he don't worry about the prophets he worries about his bride [Applause] [Music] and if God comes into a flesh now he don't care about anything else for great is a mystery of godliness God men are pasted in the flesh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he says on the Holy Ghost take 1958. and they come all the way down from a couple to folio love and down to lustful love to the lowest than God himself became man when it comes to the lowest of love then God puts on flesh [Music] when man comes to their lowest and they reject love because the Bible says in Matthew 24 it says that this is what it says for the love the Holy Ghost of many shall wax cold when it comes to that step is the love works cold in the church what love the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost accepted that's why he put the quote in the rejected King because a rejected King is the Holy Ghost [Music] he even takes it for the book the Hebrew book page 157 you can go and read it oh El Tabernacle we can't read the spoken word like thing we're really different because we duck people [Applause] and we're drinking strange Waters plus his strange Waters you hurt it's true never heard it before that makes El Tabernacle so unique and it makes the ministry unique and make people want to know more and you know the quote I gave it to you in the Sin of unbelief he says the word the Holy Ghost is a quick to give than the word amen it's great to lie because you wrote the word says brother I said the Holy Ghost said [Applause] [Music] that's what I'm preaching now amen came out of brother Branham but I say that the Holy Ghost gave it to me because everybody read it and they don't know anything about it and they never ever mention it and they never ever preach it and they never ever testify about it and they never ever wrote about it but there's one Oddball a man that has grabbed it and heard it and preach it and now it is revealed in the Tabernacle [Applause] [Applause] oh my love what is it because faith is love on the battlefield it heals sickness and raise the Dead virtue is love that goes out to others a time to laugh knowledge is love in respond it response to everything knowledge Temperance is love in training controlling your tongue patience is love patience is love in all situations godliness is love incompleteness because God is alive [Applause] El Tabernacle in Africa what are you listening to you're not listening to a preacher you're listening to an apostle of God that gets the word out of the mouth of God [Applause] [Applause] [Music] brotherly kindness is love in action loving your brothers action not with talk action showing action loving for your brother action esteeming your brother higher than yourself that's love in action [Music] and the Holy Ghost is a loving self [Music] [Applause] can you say man man [Applause] Oh My ultimate you can't finish the tapes that I preach there's too much meat on the bone El Tabernacle is more worth than all the tides that you pay those are two year now your Tides can't pay for it God will pay me when I get there [Applause] [Applause] I ask you to support me and you did and that's why you get this because you support me and along you support me I'm telling you you're gonna get it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now we're preaching What is love somebody somebody somebody somewhere has quoted [Music] [Applause] that's why when you go to Corinthians 13 and you read about love the only thing it shows him it says love Saturday long that's the Fruit of the Spirit it's a love is kind of Brotherly kindness that's a fruit of the spirit Corinthians says love envied not is another fruit of the spirit because it's got kindness with it [Music] amen it's gentle another fruit of the spirit I'm reading Corinthians 13. [Music] it's not easy provoke why because it's full of joy it's a fruit of the spirit it beared all things amen that's the Fruit of the Spirit patience like job beareth all things is the Fruit of the Spirit I'm in Corinthians 13. it believe all things another fruit heir to your faith Faith believes God it's a fruit of the spirit I just want to read Corinthians 13 here First Corinthians 13. I just want to read it and I mention it to you but now let me read it verse 4 5 and 6. love charity suffer of law fruit of the spirit love is kind fruit of the spirit charity fruit of the spirit love Galatians 5 and the fruit of the spirit is alive it goes deeper I'm coming to that then we can close vaunted not itself is not puffed up because it's got a joy unspeakable do not behave itself unseemingly you listen to me amen you shut up Bishop if you don't say the Holy Ghost is a love then you shut up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord the Bible [Applause] we could not own fruit of the spirit is not easy to provoke think of No Evil and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth now watch Galatians at the same God that wrote this road Galatians and in Galatians he comes and he says Galatians 5 22 he says and the Fruit of the Spirit is love now you don't say love and the spirit is the same thing now he makes love the fruit [Applause] and he don't stop there he says now the truth of the spirit is love and not love is and now the Holy Ghost is the fruit of the spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love love is a fruit why is love a fruit because love wasn't there before the foundation of the world there was no hate there because Lucifer was not even created so there was no hate there so love wasn't there but the spirit was there [Applause] now Paul says my brother the fruit of the spirit is love and what does he do next he says love joy Out of Love Comes Joy now how could they have love and they don't have joy because Paul says out of the spirit comes love Out of Love Comes Joy [Applause] [Applause] oh my thank you [Applause] you can't love without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost bath love that's why the Holy Ghost must lead you up the stairs in my guide he says that because what he's leading you into is his fruit it's Galatians 5 22. so they take the fruit as love the fruit is not love it's a fruit of love the Holy Ghost amen I'm going to close I think you're blown out the bulbs are going like this out of love come Joy so give Jesus king God a boasting shout here [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just another five minutes this is the way you should read First Corinthians 13. this is the way you ought to read it though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm a sounding grass and a tinkling symbol this is the way the proper way to read it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and I understand all the Seven Seals and understand serpent seed and I understand the Mysteries that William Branham brought though I know all those Mysteries but if I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul says you are nothing though you're 40 years in the message amen and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Applause] [Applause] though you are a big preacher a Treasurer a trusting a deacon amen a member for 40 years Amen in the message though you quote the prophet like this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Music] though you'll have faith to remove mountains seven Thunders and seven Thunders and seven Thunders and nobody ever got the faith of it why because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost nothing works go you bestowed your goods to feed the poor and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it profits you nothing being in an end time Church you miss it you won't be considered Moses was not considered when he didn't have it God wanted to kill him because he didn't give it to his son brother Branham was not considered that's what his wife and his child was taken and you pastors think you're gonna make it when the prophet was actually a man under judgment when he didn't take it you're not going to be considered [Applause] I'm closing my God I'm closing love poinsure to the Holy Ghost as I said Colossians 5 26 2 says the fruit of the spirit is love thy doesn't say death love is equal with the Holy Ghost it says that's but just the fruit the same writer and I Echo amen why now you think love is going to save you love don't save you it doesn't the Bible says by Grace I will say not by Allah oh my it's so much deeper it's so much deeper love is the Fruit of the Spirit it leads us so deep the holy spirit will give you love so if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost your Void of perfect love you might have love but one of the other loves because Romans 5 5 says the love of God is abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost [Applause] love comes into your heart only by the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost lost so how are you going to get love if the Holy Ghost supposed to put it in your heart so El Tabernacle you're right there you're right there with a Bible and with what brother Branham says and with Apostle anointing it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me lay it down the prophet says in Israel and the church page 51. paragraph 122. he says the holy spirit is the love of God I can prove it by the Bible he's challenging them he knows they don't know it because he never knew it and the word comes to the prophet and a prophet gives you to the apostle and the Apostle makes it clear because man comes behind me I can prove it by the Bible and we proved it by the Bible too [Music] so what is love What is love joburg What is love Pretoria What is love hermanus What is love [Applause] [Applause] rejected King 1960 he preached this quality others he already preached now I always wondered you know I always wondered when I read eleventh commandment how come in 11 Commandments he rebukes Canada so bad very bad don't read it or put the tape on and I thought now this man is preaching on love how can he rebuke the people can't you just forgive them or just look over it no he rebuked them writing that book and I couldn't understand it and when God opened it to me he says no he was showing you to love because love is corrective agopo love is corrective and that's why he rebuked them because they had no joy they were stiff and stodgy and stale and dead conservative and the Holy Ghost says I'm preaching on love and you have no joy and if he built them made this message churches that's dead May the year the prophets rebuke them [Applause] I'm closing it's better to light a candle in the dark then to curse the darkness so what is love let us read rejected King 1916 515. if there be those here listen to him he's praying now if there be those here Lord who doesn't know you in that way of love they know the other way of love nicey nicey one the folio one the one that compromises so that everybody can like them they know that one but it's big clear about that one is the one we're preaching on now if there's anybody that don't know it that's a love now watching watching without that type of a love then he says what type of a love the new birth the being born again the Holy Ghost is love if there's anyone here that don't understand it Lord may you open their eyes that the Holy Ghost is love [Applause] open our eyes in El Tabernacle for the scripture and the Bible say the same thing and the Apostle anoint said I'm an anointing it [Applause] I'm closing brother branches and restoration of the bright tree he says the canker worm has added away the joy of the church and then he said shh you're making too much a noise he says it's a Kinko worm but an oddball from Johannesburg [Applause] kills that canker worm and now it's even in Cape Town give God a shout here I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna close for the love of many wax cold many vexed the Holy Ghost and it took its flight and the churches is cold they tried to clap their hands they can't even collect them why because the love of many [Applause] and now we're closing and as he calls on that message the wings of a snow white now it says Lord on the wings I will slow life down God said he's pure sweet love who brings love the wings of the dark what's the dog the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm closing and I want you to be like Noah and not like the message group Noah broke open the word because the word kept the dove in bondage the ark he couldn't fly but we want to right now release the dove because on its ways is the love of God if the Holy Ghost fly in here don't reject him if the Holy Ghost flies in here don't push him aside if the Holy Ghost flies in here lift up your hands and says not my mother my mother is not my father it's not my brother it's not my sister to me it's me standing in the need of prayer as the dove fly over this audience we're releasing yes you can feel him I know you came he's flying in this bowling right now [Music] on the wings of a Snow White so let the dark lie we're not keeping in prison raise your hands and say Lord It's Me it's me standing in the need of prayer Lord don't cage up the door open the door of your heart let him fly out of the Ark and settle on your ground with all I believe in his mouth [Music] oh I just want the dog to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody somebody has caught the dog let's go [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] my brother and sister before the dog flies to Israel we want to keep him here we want to go after it maybe tomorrow will be too late but we want to keep him here [Music] I told the last one has caught the dog [Music] he's moving here he's moving here he's moving into

finish this quote and then may God bless you he says further the Holy Spirit God is love we know that is true no matter if we remove mountains now he's showing us to Corinthians 30. by our faith if we did great things still without that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we could never climb that great ladder can't climb it but with it we have cliented look at it the love of God bless you on the

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] I I wonder how do you feel did I tell you the truth that there's no church like El Tabernacle every girl told me they had the back it says man it's just nice to be back you people are something else man God don't have to beg you to worship Him you just do [Music] it so God bless you and we're happy to have you [Applause] back oh and I would like to uh thank everybody I realize I did with uh the New Year's meeting and uh there's other brothers that I didn't mention if I didn't mention your name remember you included in the names of the other people amen we all one amen so I want to thank you the ones that supports the cause here with their tithes offerings and presents and special offerings we um want to thank you once again I want to thank the nurses last weekend Sunday I was laying with pipes in me and they came over Sunday and they come in and ministered to me and um this week I Hopple along I didn't know if I'm going to make make it in the poop this evening but I'm here so I want to thank them uh for coming and uh I don't know which doctor was behind them that gave the inscription for the nurses to administer to me so I thank God and uh may God richly bless you I feel fine and then uh I just want to say that um we straighten our things and uh it's just the kimy um an ail's problem you seen Adel quite back for quite some time and Ed said uh him and Kimmy is not together for a year and a half they they've decided that they want to serve God they divorced [Music] hallah and uh Ariel told us that um he don't even want to bother the Rosco family we must just allow him to come to church and um is doing just that and uh Kimmy called me in I think about a month ago or so and you you know I take my time I like to pray over things she told me that she's back in chelberg and uh she and a is not together and she said she knows that they have done wrong which I told the world you know brother when I said it if they don't do what I tell them they going to hell my son or who ever he is amen the word of God has no biasness it's like [Applause] [Music] that and they listened to me and she said well she realized that she' done wrong she asked forgiveness and um she says well she didn't do anything else because all the time time she just wanted to serve God and uh I said well if they're not together and they have separated and they live like single people by all means it's fine they could come serve God so um we uh also laid down a few things that U they have to do that's why I took a little time for to make the announcement here so um IO to God that God would look down on them and show Mercy amen and then I I need to tell you this one a certain brother by the name of brother Benny I think Edwards that Indian brother that came from Newcastle and he came and served God here and he left here and he went to branky and I don't know he left there where the deacy is now I don't know but apparently he said he was praying and God spoke to his heart and he spoke in tongues and the interpretation was a message to brother Rosal and uh he found Charlton is Charlton here Charlton right at the back there and he told Charlton to hand over the message to me and the message was uh through tongues and the message was in three parts one I must give over L Tabernacle to Jonathan two I must get my house in order and three I must present I must repent and God will show me of what so I've listened send him a message back and um I just felt that this God that has spoken to him it's a bit mixed up [Applause] um maybe maybe you heard from hery Krishna [Applause] now why I say so is that I let him know and he was in the church he knows it I think 20 years ago I then did handle the church over to Jonathan who's the head pastor of el Jonathan is running the church the Deacon board the trustey board the ministers the Bings for 20 years now you want to tell me my God don't know that [Applause] Point number two get your house in order well the thing is is that if it means my natural house there's only one in that house that's me you want to tell me God don't know that now what house must I get in order if it means I must get myself in order that entails when brother brandham and them speak about it that my time is up I'm busy living that one I welcome because I've been struggling in this poopit for 59 years and I worked because I want to get in there [Applause] number three is I must repent God will show me of what now again I don't understand this God I'm busy with my God every morning between 2: and 4: every morning between two and four I plead my case I beg him I think Denny still sleeps and snores that time when I'm busy with [Applause] him since a young man I never ever stopped praying at that time up till now so of what must I Repent when I Repent every morning for Thought word and deed and I ask God for your repentance and to forgive you Al every morning [Applause] now say for instance I had something and I asked God for forgiveness every morning you'll forgive me isn't that making my house in order or how do you get your house in order by repenting now I can't understand how funny this God is when he came to David he told David he son when he came to Moses he told Moses he son wherever he went he tell the people what they sinned but when it comes to Edgar Osco you don't tell me what's my son so I say this and not to be funny let his hery Krishna God go to hell and I cannot understand why can God speak to you know when I was in India they call guys like that num poop talk to a guy like that but he speak to me 59 years for 59 years he spoke to [Music] me can you see what I go through church [Music] now I see the colonell on Thursday I don't see him yet tonight um I went over there and uh I went going to ask him to check all the Rosco's phones if it's not hacked that's a word right and uh because I feel something funny and uh he says no by Monday you'll know if your phone is hugged and uh somebody breaks into your phone to listen to you but I would like them to check all the Rosco phones so be careful what you speak over your phone exactly amen my Lord I and he told me um they can do it and they can trace the people and uh the thing is this that um what happened when they broke into my house and uh what I don't understand is I I'm a very Thrifty guy with my celery I I always put something away even if it's TR but I must put money away I don't spend my whole wages so they knew exactly where I put the money and they stole all that money just came in the house take the money out of the house where I sted it now who knows that so I made them check the house the same guys that's going to check the phone uh special guys from the force and I must say they're very good they picked up everything check my car everything if it's um not uh the dubbed or and uh they picked up things because we we put in some uh security systems you know three of them if the one fail the other one will get you that one fail the other one will get you and they picked it up and I knew know these guys are professional so they checking they're going to check our phone and uh we will know who it is he mentioned names to me already but I'll keep quiet and it's a criminal offense to do a thing like that so we will know by Monday what's happening there so that's what uh the vision of brother Indian now I'm also half Indian I'm mixed up anyhow I don't even know what I [Music] am I I love for um no no I said we pray I prayed that time in the morning and I I just wake up I don't have an alarm he wakes me up exactly that time to talk to me all my life [Applause] and then when Mahari come and she starts at 8:00 and we have another prayer meeting and then I go and do my chores after that so a lot of prayer goes into the thing understand and um so yeah um the colonell will let us person all by Monday and then um that was not the first time it happened um that a thing like that um occurred I was give over the church uh December another guy came from America Luke Gibson I don't even know the guy a Johnny come lately that also wants to be on the pedestal and he came and he preached in brother tm's previous Church where um the concerns took over elwin m Christopher start I called him the three Baptist preachers I wonder how could tum all Baptist like that guys that's not anointed put him out of his church I'll take all three of them one time and Chuck them out in front of everybody no guy with no Holy Ghost mess around with us man I know God [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know the meetings that we have in El Tabernacle mixup meetings people laying on the floor screaming jumping visions and all that PE Tabernacle never had one meeting like that for all the years that twim was there even now so how can they tell me [Applause] that's what thing that's why the thing busted the way it did so he comes around Mr American you know I never worried about American when I see American and I take out my sword there a bunch of brags man [Music] and he preached in that church a lot of things about me my clothing and my dancing and all my ministers and all that but the thing he said other this is in one month Benny and him I just realized God speak to this one God spoke to that one and God spoke to him to preach through the through his preaching that I follow a Lal priesthood by handing the church over to my sons and we're not in the leidal priesthood we in the mesc priesthood that's what he said now if he comes from America and he knows that I gave it over to Jonathan how come Benny don't know how come this little Indian boy don't [Applause] know and then he's got the audacity to say I must come and see him I must run after him a man like [Music] me he must go to heav Krishna man [Music] now in so many words Gibson was also emphasizing hand over the church I cannot give it to my sons I must give it to somebody outside of the family yeah I've got Benny Benny says You must give it to your to Jonathan here Gibson comes and says no I can't to who did God speak to the two of those guys how come God gives two different messages in one month that's not my God one month [Applause] I'm sorry I am very very sorry to which one must I listen to then we had brother bapes brother Shan's son-in-law brother Shan's son-in-law that was with that Prophet the two of them together uh can you see I don't do these guys nothing so all the devil's eyes is upon [Applause] [Music] [Music] and they founded us and says that God spoke to this Prophet guy and to bapes I hope Garden jinda listen to what I got to say now and then they told Jonathan that God spoke to the prophet and told the prophet through babes that they're coming up to joerg and uh with all the papers transfer papers because God said we must hand the church over to them [Applause] and they told Jonathan they said Jonathan just keep the title deeds and a pen you just sign and all the rosos must get out of the church they'll take [Applause] over and Jonathan answered and Jonathan says yeah come come come up brother where are you now he says no we're on our way we just getting the last papers and we'll be there so Jonathan says come up man brothers because God spoke to me too [Applause] and God said if you come up here we'll be waiting for you we'll give both of you some blue eyes like Coleman that's what God told us we never heard from them again hallu so brother Godwin don't say that we didn't handle the man I handled [Applause] him then we were in elders and uh the church was growing and I put up that um balcony there and the church was growing and another guy walked up to me that's in the church he says Pastor Ros I have a message from God to you I said yeah what's it he says I had a vision and in the vision I saw your shoeses walk through I said now what does that man mean it means your ministry is finished and God is going to take you and you must give over the church to me and then in 1987 when brother Raymond Thompson and them split the church not they let they split ugly I heard the knock on my door stadi in anadale I opened the door yes stand a man when I looked at him it was Mr Bon beer Greg's Bon Bear's father and Kenny alus and Cliffy Marshall's stepfather he the man stand at the door I said good afternoon what's the best in bear he said good afternoon he says I don't have much time I have a message from God to you I said to him okay he said can I come in came in my wife let him sit he said don't even worry to make tea this is a a quick thing because you must do it right now and C Bon Beer's father then said God spoke to him him and God told him that I must repent and I must give the church over I said Mr Bon beer when did God say I must give it up say right now if I walk out here you must just hand it over I said oh right now yeah and I looked at him my wife standing there I said was the best you tell me what God is this said what do you mean I said you stink like a tobacco Factory you just smoked before you came here I said then you got to T in you too but does God don't tell you you must must repent of that tobacco repent of that drinking repent of your [Applause] falseness if I didn't have the Holy Ghost they would have taken the church but because I walk with the angel they will never get it right [Applause] so I feel like Jesus telling Peter Peter I pray for you because the devil want to Ser you church I pray for you cuz the devil is after you because there is no church like this church [Music] so after all these years they want to take my wife [Applause] now now that's not something new aimc wanted to take Sarah from Abram and God say you're a dead man and Benny you're a dead man you're a dead man [Music] [Applause] you know the guys that broke into my house we afterwards found the tag they used my tag for a whole year to go in and then we traced them and we went to the to the gate there with the insurance company they don't know how they got that tag my tag of all the people and then we throw the guy we got his car we got his number plate we got his address then brother Co and I went to his house and then he wasn't there and his wife told him so koven and them waited for a couple of weeks and they went back there when they went back there the wife says no he's in hospital says what's wrong brain Dam up till now you don't play with a man of God we had to close the case because the guys are vegetable and it just happened they don't know what how it happened and we will get them that hugs our [Applause] phones okay that was my commands you see you have to pray for this man let's go to Exodus 19 verse 19 and let us see how far we can get into this message Exodus chapter 19 verse 19 and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a voice father I give this scripture into your hands I'm not capable I'm just your servant may you grant unto me the [Music] Insight of this word that I want to preach tonight I pray that he that has an ear let him hear May El Tabernacle be encouraged once more [Applause] I hand it over into your hands Lord thank you Jesus amen you may be [Applause] seated amen now I had um a phone call from somebody and he told me he said brother Rosco I've listened to all the conventions that was held over the Christmas the one in Dubai the one here the one in Deo Gloria the one in oton and there one in brother toam old church and he says I was searching for the Holy Ghost in all those conventions because all of them was echoing out we need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost and now it's not in my church and he said to me he said you know I don't find that thing that's in your church nowhere Hallelujah [Applause] even the one that people went to Brazil they don't have it like [Music] [Applause] it's so we are going to to have to fight to keep it [Applause] here you're going to have to [Applause] fight every dry [Applause] Spirit until you act like a maniac Israel's got the country they got the land but they can't sit St since 1946 when they got in they have to fight you can't be nice you can't be nice nice outside what are we nice amen you have to fight otherwise they kill [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I want to start with this quote out of the mouth of a prophet From The Heart Of God out of the heart of God to the mouth of a prophet can you say [Applause] that I don't hear you [Applause] the M of the prophet and this is what the mouth of the Prophet says Mark of the base 961 now watch he ask you to watch don't just accept anything because nicey nicey being nicey nicey watch now my my title is the gospel trumpet and I was praying that another guy from Petoria is got green eyes you know and and gray comes his hair backwards he shouldn't catch this otherwise I'm going to have no message and I'm I'm I'm thankful for God God shut him up you know he said now watch you hear the gospel trumpet man I want you to read this quote hold it the what G what is the good news the Holy Ghost is what's the good news the Holy Ghost is de Gloria what's the good [Applause] news where yeah yeah yeah what's the good news the Holy Ghost is here then he ask the question out of a mouth of a prophet he asked the question how do you know it how do you know it it says watch it work see what it does it's the good news [Music] [Applause] watch it works how does it work make the people drunk working of the Holy Spirit make the people people shout working of the Holy Spirit make the people speak in [Applause] tongues working of the Holy Ghost make the people working of the Holy [Applause] Ghost if the Holy Ghost is here then those working of the Holy Ghost must also be here is it here [Music] [Applause] hallu and he says that's the good news [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he the working of the Holy Spirit the other quotation says what make you jump what make you shout What Make You Dance it's a supernatural being in you I make you jump I Make You Dance I make you worship that brings down the glory of God [Music] then if it is like that then the good news is here L Tabernacle the good news there is no other better [Applause] news oh than you the good news the good news the good news the good news is I don't have to tell you to shout like they did in Deal Gloria you shout automatically listen to it man listen listen to it good news it is not like our magazines and TV news and CNN and skying news an Aleria that has 99% of it is bad news the big bold black letters of the newspapers so many reads so many died here so many died in Ukraine so many died here so many died here all that they feed on is bad news am I [Music] right the only way to attract the people in this day is to have bad [Applause] news that takes the headlines bad news the big those bold black lettuce trumpets out famine here and famine there and young people starving children starving with their bellies pushed out and their eyes popped out of the sockets of malnutrition bad news all over and the bad news also over social media where they said in dear Gloria that the Holy Ghost left for 40 years there was a lapse for 40 years bad news the Holy Ghost isn't there's bad news but in El Tabernacle it never ceased so where is the good news [Applause] P bad news then they trumpeting out no scriptural Doctrine 7,000 Seven Virtues that's bad news that's New York City's garbage SC it comes out of it comes out of New York City garbage [Applause] scan it's garbage there's no Bible for it how can you believe in it anything that's not Bible is [Applause] garbage seven Thunders is not the Seven Virtues because the Bible don't say so brother brandham don't say so I rode the track on the seven Thunders and I found difficult to get out to the Seven Virtues I wanted to go to okar but I found myself in Pick and Pay and then I found myself in checkers but I want to be in O Bazar so I had to go and scratch to try make the thing work at the end I didn't have a scripture and I look I say he this is a bunch of garbage FR one FR and I'm going to play it when I preach against the LIE of the Gloria and then they can write me a lawyer letter but this time I'm going to court everything is going to come out this time and I want the newspapers to be there this time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but now brother Rosco have you got Bible for the seven Thunders Hallelujah being the seven Messengers Hallelujah well I'd like to call up our English teacher that's got a decree in English and that marks the papers of the grade 12 for the Department not like me and brother Raymond that didn't even Pass Time Sate five now I could I could ask the doctors here and I could ask the engineers here but I'm going to ask her because she's now like the authority on English as far as the department is let us hear from her okay bless you amen I'm going to put the scripture on the board and he crowd with a loud voice as when a lion roar it and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices now I just want her to explain that three words there utter there and voices I want to go and sit and I hope elado Park Assembly listens because you're following a lie in Alor good evening Al Tabernacle I think you are going to be my biggest class I've ever taught so here we go let's English so to utter means to speak say or Express something aloud often in words so take note they're not sounds they are sounds that are articulated in meaning so if an animal makes a sound you can't interpret it as a human being animals understand animals but when you utter as a person it comes across in words and therefore meaning the word there so we're not talking about the place t h e r e it's t h i e um e i r is a possessive pronoun now take note pronouns are used for people so if you want to say uh if you want to make your sentence um syntax correct you won't say the Apostle said that the Apostle will take the sermon in the apostles Church you say the Apostle said that he will take the sermon in his church so in this case the word there is not for one person but for many persons good so far okay let's go to voice voice is the sound produced when air from the lungs passes the vocal cords causing them to vibrate and it is shaped by the throat the tongue and the mouth into speech or song so if we pause there a moment take note that when the sound comes through your vocal cords so vocal chords in this case remember produces the sound so there's a difference between human sound and animal sound because although a whale makes a sound and can articulate meaning to another well you as a human won't understand it but now humans on the other hand have vocal chords they produce sound that articulate words and expression for meaning so in order for you to understand what the Apostle is saying he must produce the sound from his vocal cords through his mouth and then you will understand exactly what is happening in his mind and in his heart so let's just tie it to the scripture and please I'm not a preacher I'm only a teacher so here we go the seven Thunders had to utter words that carried meaning as indicated by the fact that what was said could have been written down so if you're going to the next verse in verse 4 that angel would not have been able to write anything or record anything if it wasn't words if it wasn't meaning so in essence that angel would have had nothing to record and we would not have been able to hear what comes from this gift over the [Applause] pulpit so let's link it back to the humans right because the argument is that the virtues are the Thunders and it can't be because a virtue is not a physical body a phys physical body carries vocal cords it needs to be within a human form and a virtue is not a human form it cannot articulate meaning it cannot carry or produce meaningful words in any way so I think the Apostle's view his standpoint his his anchor what is trying to bring across is that it is just not true it is fallible from the start thank you good good rala 10:4 now how could God use three words that actually refers to human beings they say if somebody actually come back on anything repeat anything then he actually he tells you watch but now he does it three times and show three times it's human [Applause] beings right then how can we be wrong when the Bible says it's human beings I don't care about elado Park I don't care about de Gloria I worry about the word of God go oh this will be nice in a court when if we go to court with a thing like this and they come with virtues the judge is going to shake his head man he's never going to agree with them he's going to agree Hallelujah with the truth amen seventh under seven virtues is garbage that's why when their founder died they said he's coming back with blue eyes [Applause] garbage now there you have it you know a nutshell now Sister Shanti that last verse also refers so clearly and plainly seal up those things which the seven Thunders so the seven Thunders uttered it which means it was spoken aloud it was spoken aloud so capital S seal so all seven was the seals that's what of the BAM says that there's a [Applause] scripture thank you we have the truth man and the Seven Thunders is our doct and the right Doctrine because the Bible said [Applause] so and that's the good news the good news the seven Thunders are banging [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] together Hallelujah now brother Owen pal likes English you know he's a typical English guy he gets excited when you hear English you think he's going to believe seven Thunder Seven Virtues after this I tell you he's not going to believe it because the Bible said [Applause] [Music] so okay let's take some interpretation on the Bible on Revelations 3 where Revelations 3 said is the seven messenges let's take Bible on Revelations 3 oh my what does the Africans say now we got the English say cl [Applause] cl po arus Mar Cola [Applause] man are these guys [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mad a virtue needs you need a body a virtue don't have a body we heard [Applause] so seven [Applause] bodies just play that again in fore do you think these guys but ex all offer up your stem Amen on [Applause] I just can't be wrong elado Park Assembly I can't be [Applause] wrong Hallelujah [Applause] and [Music] to and he be the off [Applause] now we got an English saying the seven Thunders is seven men human beings and God emphasizes it four times in Revelations 10 that it's human beings four times to ever add to this prophecy all the plagues all the [Applause] plagues now they can't come out anymore and accept this huj they get sealed with that lie brother sorry Rica told me yeah you you nail them all but they don't come out I says praise God you

us through this events that is taking place around us surely Lord we cannot let it just go because it's world news and nothing happens without you knowing and nothing is purpose without you predestinated it pray that you bless us bless the listeners bless El Tabernacle around South Africa and outside of South Africa in Jesus name amen now I entitled this a little should I say message or whatever the USA a woman's Nation Revelations 13 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of bless me and the Beast which I saw was unto a leopard and his F were as his feet was a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seed and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it it was wounded to death verse four and they worshiped the dragon which gave power upon unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is who is like unto the Beast who is also to make war with him and and was given unto him among speaking great things and verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world verse 11 is the thing and I behold another Beast coming up out of the Earth this one not out of the sea out of the earth and he had two horns religious and political like a lamb and he spoke as the dragon and there's where brother brandham says a America is that Beast cuz she is the only Kingdom that comes out of the earth not a population of people in Europe but the new world like they call it then so that's why we read that scripture because brother brandham referred to it and showed us what Revelations 13 is now I want to make it pretty clear don't go and say I said is the end of the world like some said about September 2023 said that I said the world is coming to an end and um but I vividly said on the 70th Jubilee it's God's desire time to come as we worked out the Jubilee the 70th Jubilee which no one in this message knew or understood um understood it we made it plain because we got it in Gabriel 70 weeks we brother B said the 70th Jubilee the Rapture goes so we went to check up the 70th jub and we bought books from all over what we can get and uh we brought you the times and how it worked out and it worked out right onto uh 2024 September will be the 50th Jubilee from 1974 when the 70th Jubilee started and brother Brian spoke of 1977 which we also clarified 1977 and we had the privilege to shut a lot of people's mouths we thank God for these um Revelations that we could prove by the Bible by the message and also by the history about the 70th weeks of Daniel so that is God's desired time to come and we also said when it comes to God's desired time he has the right to lengthen the time or shorten the time you know because as it was in the days of Noah when God waited listen waited waited in his judgment to judge Noah's day in his longsuffering so if God has a longsuffering then we could say that he that is all in his hand but his wish is to come in the 70th Jubilee which we worked it out and showed you 6,000 years is up exactly like six days God created the Heaven and the Earth so um it is no prophecy of mine but also it's a signs of the end time still a time period it must be scriptural and it must be in the quotes and it must be time and it must be God's season then it will happen that's a quote we know Proverbs says there is a time and a season time and a season for every purpose of God a time and a season so could we venture out and say could this Perhaps Perhaps be God's time and season for the sixth Vision to be fulfilled from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that woe comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president of Vice President well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a camp candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 generalist attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't this scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the court is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and or if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two wom that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's to two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take you to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to human then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so if it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out then in condemnation by representation then I seen a great woman rise up in the USA well dressed beautiful but cruel in heart she will either guide or lead this nation to ruination I got in parenthesis perhaps the Roman Catholic Church the second woman is well dressed and beautiful not the first one now we all were under the delusion that that woman that will come in the first one will be well-dressed and beautiful and many people will turn back and say well we don't think it's Camila because she's not so beautiful but he didn't put the emphasis on kamila the first woman he says the second woman the Roman Catholic Church is well dressed and cruel and beautiful now she's so beautiful that the Bible says when John saw her he marveled so beautiful the Roman Catholic Church is we're just eitting the Bible you know we just want you to see the Bible how brother Brandon put things down and he leaves it there for you to go check it up in the Bible so there's the Bible for it she's a beautiful woman he doesn't say that the first woman is pretty the second one then after that he seen USA lay in ashes after this woman comes in by votes or by force through maybe Trump he's the most uh eligible guy to let her come in because his name is Trump does he have the trump card to let it come in I'm just asking so um she will come in at the sixth the end of the sixth vision and then he says then after that he seen USA lay in ashes which is the seventh Vision the atomic bomb when it come to the end he says when it come to the end then he turns around and says it was the end so the seven vision is the end of the Earth and there's ases men mention here which is the atomic bomb so that why he says that's the beginning of it so he says the seven Vision ashes the USA uh is the end but the bride at this time is gone he said before the first eight bomb Falls we'll be in glory so we won't even see the end of the Earth that's why I said it you know we are not here when that seven Vision hit um as I said that pressure will be put on her now how is she coming in big question saw it in 1933 he saw it in 1933 how she will come in Ephesians Church age 196 and the woman being permitted to vote would help to elect the wrong person for this nation that would be the beginning we got back to human again now the woman's vote in America will swing the president don't see her way if they W vote for her because there's more woman voters than men voters there is more human voters in the states than men and right now the poll says the woman of the USA favor Camila Harris she pushes for abortion rights for women and woman can do with their bodies what they want the government can't tell a woman what to do with their bodies this is what woman is waiting for and Camila is a woman that said she will give it to them she'll sign it in to law will she come in with a woman vote it pretty much look like it so we have it right in front of us it closes with this it might be the beginning that quotation it might be the beginning of what what beginning of the seventh Vision the end of the world the human vote is the beginning of the end now five of the seven Visions came to pass the first V the second W 41 ashes atomic bomb is passed at this time with a second world war this now lays in the history books it's out of the Bible into the history books the message why seven things I saw five of them as of already come to pass what's left of the seven Visions the sixth vision and then which is woman president six vision and then the seventh the very very end the uh atomic bomb to follow the six Vision that's the end so Camila's election will be the beginning of the the end so it's obvious now remember let me let me bring this in is the beginning of the end but before the end comes the Rapture takes place get that straight so it's obvious we seeing the sixth one unfolding I say it very much look like it if if if it is then lift up your heads your Redemption of your body is n it's the beginning of the seven vision and the end of the six is that fair comment I think it is fair commence because brother Brenham says in desperation that the newspapers preaches much louder than the ministers and I want to say the ministers in this message because Pentecost is long gone denomination brother B says there's nothing wrong in probing in C is this the time and I probe and this is what I come up with we'll found find out in a few days time now I just want to give you this quote ludian Church age 1960 the nation is a woman's Nation the flag was made by a woman it's number 13 a human now this is a quote it started out 13 stars and 13 stripes woman 13 colonies woman both woman 13 stars on a silver dollar woman appears in Revelations 13 woman everything is human human human human human right on down they already worship a woman anyhow a woman's picture on the money end of quote and I want to add to all that the Statue of Liberty welcomes you into USA which is a woman right in the quotation this is the situation now in the States you can't deny it especially in the message this is scario this is what the ancient culture says the number 13 is represented as feminine which is woman straight with brother brenham's called as the ancient culture says why because it responded to the number of lunar menstral circles in a year 13 * 28 equal 364 days the theory is that as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunan the number 13 becomes anema there's two meanings to anema it means one excommunication by a church two person that's curs or condemned by God the seventh Vision she's condemned by God Los Angeles condemned by God Yellowstone condemned by God abam Seven Vision condemned by God a Prophet prophesying this condemned by God through thus saith the Lord oh my God nature tells you it is so Bible tells you it is so the prophet tells you it is so now the dictionary tells you so as Luke 17:26 says you'll hear it again we're going to play it again for you as it was in the days of Noah hum then Genesis uh Sodom and gomorra Lot's wife remember her Genesis 19 wife again a woman both Noah's day Noah's Genesis 6 Daughters of men became Fair became pretty human and lot's day Sodom Genesis 19 Lot's wife and Jesus tells us in this age remember Lot's wife woman both the end came with woman so shall it be in our day are we seeing the scripture being fulfilled I ask you El Tabernacle check it up I cannot see it any other way but we have to mention it to keep you alert you know so that you know to lift up your head and be already and Virgil and when the time comes she has invaded every space in the world today she's on motor cars all the blackards and all that you know a woman will rise and become president is God going to keep his word that's what he says in that message she choose a partner for vice president and look at this how can we miss it Tim Walls the sure is modern events made clear by prophecy is it prophecy made clear by modern events I looked I like this one I just swapped that title around of brother Brenan and said prophecy this is the prophecy Revelations 13 is the prophecy woman's vote is the prophecy made clear by modern events I like like this one for my day not a one that Revelations 10:8 says prophesy again this is all in the prophesy again do it again and then we have the picture of Biden Statue of Liberty Moon and Kema heris now sit back and listen to the clip thank you the United States of America a woman's Nation comments by the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco Joe Biden his name means associated with woman he chose a woman as vice president he resigned from the 2024 presidential race on the 21th July 2024 a Blood Moon Over the Statue of Liberty the same night Joe Biden resigns from the presidential race the moon represents a woman the Statue of Liberty representing a woman the next day the endorsement of a woman as candidate for US president Camala Harris [Music] Revelation 13 a woman the United States of America now you don't have to be super spiritual to see this to see what God wants us to see the whole thing is women and now there is 10 women for one man Genesis 6:1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them not men was born unto them daughters but daughters were born unto them men so it's fulfilled the daughters were Fair they're pretty even take the black women they're pretty a sign that it is finish can you read this look at this chart and still believe it's not the end Genesis 6:2 and they took them WI of all which they chose then and they took unto themselves wives they don't marry them she just shifts or moves in with you this was Noah's day then the scripture says in Luke the 17:26 and as it was in the days of Noah woman so shall it be also in the days of the son of man Genesis 18:9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife a woman Genesis 18:26 but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt Lot's wife woman again we need to remember Lot's wife Luke 17: 29-32 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the the son of man is revealed remember Lot's wife lot's day then the end comes when women is displaying themselves now church can you see this pattern being displayed in front of you a sign of the end in there homosexuality at the Olympics openly displayed in a mock show piece that mocks the last supper after they had that the pale horse rider ran out through the water you had to see it the devil made legit then the last thing is the message can't see this clearly she is a woman's Nation she stood in the Forefront in this debate she invaded every space in the world and I predict that a woman will be a great woman you younger people here tonight remember brother Brandon has said this and I said it in 33 when I saw the coming of the Lord and how the automobiles are continually shape up like an age until finally they would come into a perfect age shape maybe part of the Year NOS written on Old papers and things and I seen a woman rid vulgar as she was and dominated the country and I predict that a woman will either be president or do or come into great power of some sort in the United States before the total anation of the world keep that in mind and I have said it the title God keeps his word let's see if God keeps his word now many of you know before I was elected vice president or elected a United State Senator I was an elected attorney general and before that elected district attorney and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor the rise of camela Harris she came from being a courtroom prosecutor San Francisco City Hall then a district attorney San Francisco California then Attorney General of California then a United States Senator then Vice President of the United States now she is running for president of the United States of America look how she Rises up exactly like the quote says Tuesday 6th of August 2024 she chose her partner for vice president she didn't choose a woman to partner her she chose a man ironically she chooses a partner by the name of Tim Waltz Waltz is a dance with a musical beat quite difficult to master what does it mean what does this entail and what is God trying to tell us this is what Waltz means Waltz a dance in triple time performed by a couple Who as a pair turn rhythmically around and around as they progress around the Dance Floor dance a waltz I waltzed across the floor with the left tenant move or act lightly casually or inconsiderately you can't just Walt in here and bark orders at me what does it mean to waltz with someone a formal dance in which two people holding each other move around a large room turning as they go or a piece of music with three beats in a bar written for this style of dancing vienes Waltz the competitors must complete five dances including a vienes waltz what is the meaning behind the Walts danced with a step slide and step in three different a Time the Walts appeared to represent the new era's ideals of Freedom character passion and expressiveness it was brought to the operatic stage in 1787 Vienna Austria became the city of the Walts for there it surpassed everything in Wild Fury what is another term for Walts related words for Waltz are dance step ballroom dance wh music in 3/4 time box step vien Walts dance in 34 time dance March music and zip will they dance into the presidency of the United States fulfilling the sixth Vision presidency prophecy is modern events made clear by prophecy prophecy will make modern events clear it's clear to us that love this message if she becomes the president it is the end not the very end there's still a time will the devil enter her and the pope Revelation 13 and Revelation 17 then we have the seventh Vision the atomic bomb the third world war the annihilation of America and the world the end of the world we don't know what and where the Middle East is boiling the Ukraine and Russian war is escalating the Uproar in Many Nations is causing concern in Africa it's worrying it's tightening towards the seventh Vision can you see why she has to come in first to open the seventh Vision by her coming in I believe this Revelation 7 will happen afterwards WS after what the six seals Revelation 6 the sixth trumpet Revelation 7 verse1 and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree Four Winds War worldwide atomic bomb that's why they can't throw the atomic bomb Revelation 7:2 must happen after this Revelation 7:2 and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea atomic bomb Revelation 7:3 saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the tree till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads which is the 144,000 Jews now notice at the closing of this these Jews returning saying they were looking for the Messiah to come a great Spiritual Awakening to come in immediately after coming out of the here going right into Israel where there's never been any fanaticism or carrying on or anything right into Virgin Territory and I believe if there will be Awakening of the old Jews for about a million or two to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ will come on the scene as certain as anything there's your quote so the Holy Ghost will be taken away from the Gentiles this is the Camala Harris that makes me worried [Music] you can probe into this to find out if it is so because it's history and may God keep us true until the breakup day amen [Music] Our [Music] Father which are in heaven [Music] be th name thy kingom come thy will be the on on Earth as it is in heav [Music] give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our Deb as we forgive our de and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the king go and the power and the glory for [Music] [Music] for th

[Applause] place where you can give us understanding and knowledge to handle whatever comes our way I pray that you died me behind the Cross pray that you would open minds I pray that you would concrete [Applause] Faith what we believe I ask it in your blessed name amen amen now I'm just going to testify tonight I'm not here to preach if I do forgive me but I'd like to just lay down a testimony and um as things are boiling outside there of what has happened I would lay down my testimony and then afterwards try and go into uh the problematic thing that's hindering people so my testimony on Billy Paul [Applause] Brenham he was the first one to call me his friend so brother Rosco you are my friend and tonight I'd like to speak about my [Applause] friend when I found uh brother Keith in Cape Town we came back and I wanted to know how things are and then the first words that he uted to me was U do you know how that man loved you I said yes kid I know he said but but do you really know in other words I said yes I know cuz he wrote to me and uh I felt it on my heart seeing those question marks or just to go through some things I I've been around him and then uh the main thing is he's death now and those angels are still standing how do you get around it amen so you may be be seated I'm not going to look for amens or nothing I'm just testifying okay I also have a testimony so uh Daniel gave me a scripture which I would like to read um proverbs 10:7 the memory of the just is blessed am the memory of the just is blessed and I would include right in there I remember Bly Paul in a happy way cuz his memories that I carry is surely blessed I believe that some people was asking isn't brother rosar going to say something about Billy Paul they wanted to know if I'm going to say something about brother luck and I didn't because I didn't feel for it I didn't feel like wasting time it's a waste of time but but I feel to say something about Billy Paul you may be [Applause] seated his name carries two Church Church age Messengers combined in [Applause] one Bly is the name for William am if your name is William in the states they call you bu amen so his name is Bully which means brother brand the last Church age messenger and Paul the first church H [Applause] messeng so brother Brena took the two names and splice it together and called him the first and the last Messengers names his mother's name was hope that was his first Union and she died when she was very very very young and brother Bram tells you how he had to carry bully all over and keep the bottle here in his to keep it warm for Bully to drink so bully was without a mother since a young young age and Sarah Rose also died Bully's only sister died at the same time sister hope died and brother brandham didn't want to marry again and the angel of the Lord told him because of the days are so bad that um woman has gone on the Rampage he says You must get married and while God was speaking to him God was speaking to his second wife and he told his second wife behold I'll send you [Applause] [Music] Elijah and one day brother brandham got bully and he said you know bully you had a queen of a mother hope she was a queen she was just something extraordinary she was not maybe a woman she was a lady and all that she wanted to see is success for a husband brother brandham and I think that's why bully was so over brother brandham you can't say anything negative in Bully's presence about his father he was the best friend to his dad and I I always admired that by him what Dad said is yeah and amen settles [Applause] it and Bully couldn't preach because of the marriage and divorce case he had and I watched him all the years he would never go in and go PR because Dad said so he always said I'm a testimony he always said I'm I'm carrying the biscuits to the Brethren brother brandham baked the biscuits but he said he took the biscuits to give it to the brethren so those are the things that I hold dear about bullying and I had the privilege for being in his company quite a few times I do not think there's a South African guy or Minister that had the Privileges I had and therefore I was so rugged in what I believe that they couldn't change my mind at all I know where I am called [Applause] in and um I will always be grateful to God that I had those privileges with brother bully the first time I met him was in 1977 he took me around Jeff took me to the Ohio River his father baptized the 17th person it took me to Spring Street and um he took me to eat at the restaurant brother Bram used to like to go to he took me to the shop where brother BR used to buy that sweets that strong sweets and he bought me a packet he took me to the grave of brother brandham I wouldn't say what happened there he took me to his mother's um grave sister hope he took me to the tour through the church brandham Tabernacle Church because the evening I testified in the church there that's when that guy walked up and told me for all these years we only felt the same anointing that was upon brother Brandon that was on you that was the time and then you know what he gave he gave me and um then he showed me The Minister's room where brother Brandon first went in before he went into the pulpit and in The Minister's room he told me he said uh uh brother Edgar you see this Photograph I said yes I see the photograph he says to me um that photo brother Coleman gave brother brandham and when I looked at the photo God bless you brother when I looked at the photo I saw it was Elijah leaving and brother Brenham hanged it right in he studied there before going into the pit and then without Ado I told Brother Coleman I saw them photograph that you sent brother uh the prophet and then brother Coleman gave me the testimony of the photo somebody drew it painted it and uh and he told me who gave it to him when he received it and looked at it the inspiration of God fell on him brother Coleman and told the inspiration told Brother Coleman wrap it up and send it to my prophet and brother Coleman took the photo wrapped it up and sent it to brother Brenham and without Ado brother Ram took the photo and hanged it in that room it's still there today and um it wasn't long then Elijah did leave and I remember brother K said when when brother random died he walked into the pulit that morning and preach on the shout of the king is in the camp so don't be dismayed the messenger is gone but the shout of the king is in the [Applause] C so many will see that photo but they wouldn't know the history behind it the next meeting with Billy Paul was in Oklahoma after the meetings that I preach we had a lunch together Billy Paul his wife brother Coleman sister Elaine Musgrove his wife and me and my wife we sat at one table and at together and U after we finish at brother bik Paul remain seated and everybody left and me and my wife got up and I said bu I have to go over to the French people there because I was flying to Paris from New York and um bu he kept on sitting I spoke to the guys from France me my wife and as we came back I had to pass B Paul cuz he was still sitting and he had some papers or whatever it is in his hand and you know and when I came close to him he jumped in front of me and my wife and he said um brother Rosco I need to tell you something and I was shocked now keman told me a few things about bully which I already picked up there I knew what it what's coming but I I was praying that it was something good and not some little devil hiding somewhere that he's going to pull out you understand how it is is when you come into the into the presence of a man of God you always have question marks hey uh he mustn't see you know my ugly [Applause] side we all have ugly sides and he told me he says brother Rosco I just want to tell you that um since I saw the angel of the Lord I said oh oh he says since I saw the angel of the Lord he left me with a gift to discern ministers I said okay so I will really know who I am and then he said brother Ros I have discerned you and I want to tell you that you have one of the best Spirits among all the ministers I ever met in this [Applause] message me and my wife's knees buckled and we said we're going to keep that one for the Millennium that me and my wife is going to talk it over how he felt when he said [Applause] that and he just said that and and and and and he left me and he walked out and uh we were really shocked when my wife we stood stood there and uh we walked out and right in the corner there brother Coleman was standing and when we started to walk out brother Coleman ran over and he says come on brother Rosco come on what did bully tell you I said um yeah you did he said I know I I was watching the whole thing when he had his stuff there and he was sitting there I knew he was Discerning one of us and he discerned you and then I gave brother colan the story but I thought it's going to end right there but it didn't end there him and um Joseph came to South Africa and they asked me to take them around so when he came to South Africa I picked them up with um Theo Erasmus and then he said brother Rosco I want to go to the hotel where I saw the angel now look how he hooks the thing up he waited I took him to the hotel he says that angel just stood here and he went through it you know the story and uh he said do you know why he said wake up your son to see me and not no no no these young pastors know nothing man must come to the Elder the Elder will tell them and he said you know why brother Rosco I said no he says on our way down to Cape Town just before CS door there was popular trees there they cut it off now just before you get into clar do brother Bram told him to stop the car and he got out and he went over to that popular of trees and he plucked off the branches and he threw the branches in front of them on their feet and he says thus sayeth the Lord I'm not supposed to go he was not supposed to go to Cape Town he was not supposed to go to csor that's why we never built a church in clor but in porch and um then you know what he said What The Minister's done wake up that brother there right next to you yeah yeah you slap like there and um he says and I told my dad I says Dad can I tell you something he says yes he says let's book our tickets back why should we listen to these ministers let's listen to God and let's go [Applause] back don't listen to this Minister's day he says and when they came back to jobber the why of the matter why he and not his brother was woken up to see the angel was because bully said let us not listen to the ministers don't listen to a minister that don't have the Holy [Applause] Ghost and he said dad told me that that pleased the angel so that I could see that angel brother osar he stood right here and he went right through the window gone and you know he described the angel exactly dark [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] skin and you hooked Oklahoma up with Joe to make sure that I understood What's Happening Now how could I listen to these past yeah want to tell me something I don't care about that I heard straight from the angel of the Lord and straight from Brother brandham when you laid hands on my head I don't listen to No Minister you're not on my level and I will never listen to [Applause] you what a testimony that [Applause] is if you look deep into this story here what he says since the angel left him he got discernment so I look deep into the thing I feel that the angel told him sit there and tell him who he is how else could it be and he sat and he waited for me and told me who I am if you have the right Spirit you have the right word I would rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine and here's Al Tabernacle why because the blessing is on [Applause] somebody now how could guy a guy a simple black guy like this African boy have a blessing from a prophet and a prophet son that saw the [Applause] angel tell me which which black guy up Africa way can have a testimony like this [Applause] n okay that's why I can't listen to anybody brother Brown says this boy will preach exactly what I preach Billy PA said this boy has got a nicer Spirit among the Ministries he'll preach exactly the word mechanics buly comes he says you have the best Spirit Dynamics Dynamics mechanics together is that my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ministry then then to you El Tabernacle look I'm responsible for you I'm not responsible for anybody else you pay me your ti [Music] so I need to look after [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I carry a heavy testimony and I can't come down that's why I'm so robust [Applause] on another meeting in Oklahoma I was cautioned by the Holy Ghost there's a trap set for me I stayed in a hotel room just went down into the now by the way the the the the hotel that brother R stayed in here they broke it down was an old old hotel and I'm so glad that it was still standing when bll and them came and I could take them there you know um the meeting was tight in Oklahoma it was stuff and Coin and I'm didn't know what to do many of times uh in Forest Hill brother K's church when I come then there is nothing I sat in a in a in a in a Minister's room and K will tell me just go up and talk and leave that people don't want to serve God and then uh Joey bomo will come down and said brother Rosco you're not going to get these people right and then I said I just thought well we'll see and then I went up and I think within 15 minutes the church was mixed up it's going on [Music] this and you you heard the statement brother Coleman said he said brother Rosco you can put brother Rosco in the middle of a graveyard you heard him say that so after he preached the dead will raise up and clap their [Applause] hands now again the the the the convention was really tight and dry and um Bly and them was there with his son and uh I went in and uh I commended and thank bully and said bully we're really glad for you and your family and many of days you were without the father so that your father can fathered us so many a days you didn't have somebody to guide you CU you W home but you were busy guiding this bride I said bully many a days you might have weeped and cried for dad while your dad was preaching to us and we were weeping and crying in front of God I said [Applause] bully today because of your dad I can live of tithes that your dad's labors brought to me I'm not worthy it's your father's tithes that I'm living on so I'm living actually of your money Bly and buly and them was crying and I started to preach and the deacons were standing you know how K posted these Deacons and uh when I was about a half an hour in I looked around and the deacons was crying standing and the tears was running all of [Applause] them all of them I then left the poopit I went up because I needed to change and uh I ran down because I wanted to speak to norga from Tucson and just before he pulled away Coleman was standing there say Isaac save Journey my brother he says yeah he says brother keman I just want to tell you something and brother keman says what he said you know where to put this guy where to preach when your meetings is dying then you know there's a Rosco that can pick it [Music] up what a [Applause] testimony and then when I went back I just see somebody jump into the lift and says brother Rosco there was a trap set for you here because I had a dream that you were going to bomb this place to pieces I had a dream but I must tell you it was from the devil because it was just the opposite and they still don't know that I know but that's when you got the Holy Ghost he [Applause] Wars then I heard bully tell somebody that you know today well brother OS was preaching my son received the Holy [Applause] Ghost the other time I preached and met bully was when I preached on identification and this message is on tape uh you know the message and after I preach as usual the Holy Ghost filled the house you can hear Brother Coleman tell brother bully bully isn't this it's right on tape isn't this the same anointing that was with your father buly rais his hand up and he [Applause] says I remember buly in a happy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] way after the meeting bully met me before we went in for lunch and he said to me brother Rosco you brought it [Applause] [Music] I remember bully in a happy [Applause] way and after this meeting was when he sent me the letter and they stole the letter in Zimbabwe with my Bible funny they didn't steal anything else in the car I had a Bible like this my name printed on and the letter was in there and I just took the Bible with the letter when they broke into the car but I ready to the church I ready to the elders I ready to the Deacons and the Rasmus read the letter and uh in the letter he asked me to send him the cloud picture with hopman's head in [Applause] Christ and then he said brother Ros will you be so kind and S Joseph one too so in other words send us two one for Joseph one for me and I send it off to them the next thing in the letter was he called me Edgar my friend I'm glad I have friends I don't have to go make friends I don't need friends I the best of the [Applause] best as a friend and in the letter he says you know but he told me this after the meeting too he says I just like to listen to you but in the letter he said I only listen to you and my dad no other [Applause] minister yes I remember bully in a happy way [Applause] the Rasmus read the letter and he gave the letter back to me he says now can I add to that letter I says yeah well add brother Theo he says I would put them down there the greatest charismatic preacher in the message and that the message ever saw is you brother rosar not F Edgar [Applause] OS now we're coming to the close here a buly Paul died and as I said there such a lot of things going on lot of people talking a lot of people criticizing a lot of people ready to leave the message again the churches has gone small as I told you on sister Sunday Monday was it Monday Monday it's going to be worse now but elter I want to tell you that you have a man of God in a poop [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] w [Applause] I ain't going [Applause] [Music] nowhere [Applause] brother bully died remember to be spiritual now I'm asking you to be spiritual now just a little thing can throw you out and offboard amen and make you believe some fault things just a little thing that's overlooked in the scripture can throw you way back in the world therefore a pastor must be very sensitive to the word of God now this thing of bully Paul in Los Angeles a small thing in that quote can make you give up deny the message reject the message reject brother brandham and yet brother brandham says sometimes things got to be said so that some may flock away exactly but El Tabernacle you're not going to flock away I am standing right there I will stop you from fing [Applause] away just a little thing that you miss in the scriptures will make you backslide or leave the message so your leader must be very spiritual because God is pruned to hide things he likes to do it he likes to do things to make you like [Music] [Applause] this one time brother Brandon was waiting for a vision to get fulfilled and he waited and he know everything was settled everything was said there and uh he was wondering now what what is wrong that thing had to break and you know what was wrong a hat was not on the on the right place a hat so a hat so perfect is your God how can we ever be [Applause] God little thing small thing ahead everything must be lined up then God moves why because the Song of Solomon Chapter 2:1 15 says it's the little foxes that spoils the vine that little intri that make you miss [Applause] God so here is a little thing that causing the stumbling block and people wanting to leave the message and as I said I'm responsible for El Tabernacle only I'm going to give an account of this what I see amen now watch be alert with every problem in this message 20 some OD years ago I found the answer to every problem that's why we could never go wrong and I'm going to tell you the [Applause] problem you want to know the problem you did hear it before but in the light that it is now you'll know it even the better amen okay let's go to 1963 721 he cares do you listen to the message he cares do you care it was on Luther King brother Braham says he's going to lead thousands of people to their death and it didn't happen and this guy wrote to brother brandham says did you prophesy because Martin Luther King just died and this is what brother brandham had to say have we got it brother listen to what he says he says now see listen listen to this now see I've always asked you to be careful little things be careful amen what you're listening to see that's Point number one he is educating the bride now to be careful what are you listening to have you got that point let's go on with that quote point two not everything is thus sayth the Lord that I say so brother brandham when he speak is not everything is thus sayth the Lord amen oh my when brother BR say throw that ball is that that say the Lord not everything he said now I didn't say it brother brandham said it and if brother Brenham said it that you have to be careful then you have to check whether the thing is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so before you run is it God speaking or is it William brenham's Human Side speaking brother Brenham goes on I'm going to show you further he says there's many things in the spoken word That's The Human Side not the prophetic side [Applause] so when you read the scripture and the quotes you must make sure that it is thus sayeth the Lord and not brother bram's Human Side amen am that answers all the [Applause] [Music] questions now listen what he says Point number three for everything in the message that goes forth this is what you have to do what read it for me are they doing it brother Bram speak like a human being and not thus say the Lord then they want to say listen brother Brenham is a human being not everything he spoke was thus say the Lord so he says watch when I say that say of the [Applause] Lord oh my my my my my my my my [Applause] my [Applause] he goes further point 4 five it's not me it's him if it's me it will fail but if it's him it can't fail if it's William brandham that said it and not thus sayth the Lord it will fail so now you got two streams to watch as you read the spoken word is it thus say the Lord or is it brother brandham [Applause] [Music] saying can I have a witness [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here now let's go to the next one listen to what he says and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King and he was wrong because it was not thus sayeth the Lord how you going to rock edar Osco I have Bible and word Hallelujah I am not an ordinary Minister I am [Music] [Applause] special Point number six this is me speaking it's my opinion so I was wrong that was just the human side and not the thus sayeth the Lord that's why it didn't come to pass I want to ask you elter vano can you see where I'm going to [Applause] when he speaks it's thus sayth the Lord now I have dissected the quote from bully Paul I was in this meeting will he play the clip reach back a new shock of hair said just once more I believe that's the hour that we're living I believe that with all of us I believe that God making his final move going home if you want a little s to look at you need a little sign look at this old man he said I won't be an old sharks will be swimming where you're standing get close you seated now I want you to be honest with edar Rosco did he say th say of the Lord it says thus say the Lord bully you will not be an old man so n it is not th sayth the Lord it is brother bram's opinion in a private interview with his son it is not in the spoken word nowhere because the spoken word is for the bride so that was not for us that was for Billy Paul Point number [Applause] two point number three he spoke many of things to Brothers personally he told Brother R you'll be a preacher that's not in a spoken word and Ashley Campbell told Brother brand brother buly I was there he did tell you that but he never say you're fful Minister and bang Dev R gos he told bcll some things about a woman that Bisal told me personal you won't find it in the spook word he told home how many things about Bishop Johnson and what have you personal it's not in the spoken word so it's got nothing to do with a [Applause] bride so that is in two parts there it's in two parts the one part was human speaking to Billy Paul and not thus say the Lord the other part of the Sharks will swim is thus sayth the Lord that's going to [Applause] happen now why is it thus say the Lord is because of Los Angeles choosing of a bride am when brother brandham came to the pit Ed Hunter told me he said brother Rosco it was bad you know when brother Brown spoke about that cow how she looks and that's how some woman looks he said don't marry a woman like that that's got that cow look he says and the Pentecost was laughing and joking he says all of a sudden the atmosphere switched and it was like angel's wings coming into the church and then brother brandham got up he said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles Los Angeles one day you'll find yourself beneath the ocean that's thus sayth the Lord the Shark part is thus sayith the Lord but the Bully part is not thus sayith the Lord it is also not on the tapes it is also not in the [Applause] books are you clear on it so why was we worry we worry about that say of the [Applause] Lord and you know how this happened brother BR and prophesied and said thus say the Lord sister shakarian demon sharan's sister you shall die and in the same meeting a guy got up and spoke in tongues well Paul said he had Go's flesh and he was worried and the interpretation was my daughter you won't die you will love and Bully was worried brother Benham looked at him and said buly what's wrong said no nothing there he said no no no you you worried about the tongues he says yes yes Dad that was really nail biting Goose flesh stuff you could feel it brother said to him buly all did I say the same angel that told me sharks will swarm told me she's going to die then he added his own opinion he says you might not even get an old man so that was not thus sayith the Lord the Sharks was thus sayith the Lord and then two weeks after that Deus zakarian's sister died so if she died Los Angel because it's the same angel that says she's going to die said Los Angeles is going to sink it's going to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sink now can you see what God does to throw people off he makes brother Brenham say give his opinion and not thus sayth the Lord but we have a quote where brother Bram says you better listen to thus sayeth the Lord am I don't like this amen yet there's a little doubt in this [Applause] same no the cracking thing is when did Bully die what is October is October the 70th Jubilee we're going into the last part of the 70th Jubilee what's the 70th of 70th Jubilee it's Los Angeles going down because there must be an earthquake to open the graves and brother Bram takes Bly Paul and hook it up with a 70th Jubilee and he died in the time of the 70th [Applause] Jubilee [Applause] what is Jubilee going home going into eternity right am I right how old was bully what is eight [Applause] City come on man come on [Applause] amen we're going home in the midnight tree don't you want to go with me God is telling you it's time for Los Angeles to go down that's why I connected Billy's name with Los Angeles IST and how do you know the scientist says in 5 minutes or in 5 years those angels must be below the [Applause] sea Amen brother [Applause] Joel now how can I leave the message when I have the the answer to this question have you got to answer now tonight can't hear [Applause] you [Applause] no as it is above so it is below when Jesus was born it was above three stars came together and so it was below now what happened could we have it some of the US got the to see the Ring of eclipse Saturday October the 14th it showed in the heaven that the great man of God is going home few days after that but he said goodbye but it was showed in the heaven in the United States now you want to tell me this is coincidence it's not

about it uh the other thing is this um uh I don't even think brother Raymond remembered this tape it's the tape that we took out of the archives there a lot of tapes in our archives and uh but uh it is um it's encouragement praise God you may be seated at the time a certain lady one [Music] time she wrote a letter to Sister Brandon she said sister bam I want to thank you for your husband says I was in a nervous condition I was taking about 24 PS a day to car my nerves to cool me down and nothing would help since it went on for weeks days months years says but praise God I'm writing this letter of appreciation says because your husband was willing to go to forsake his family forsake his children he was prepared to lay himself and stand in the Gap says he was many miles away from your home he was in our country the doctors had given up hope there was nothing they could do for me but your husband came into the country God sent you there so there I was without hope my children was rued my house was rued say but because someone was willing to go so that night I came into the meeting he called my name he told me what was wrong with me I told you not to worry sister it's all over it say ever since that day I'm a perfect Norm person sister Bram I want to tell you these words it would never have happened if your husband wasn't willing to lay all on the Altar and I believe there's many yet tonight that feels the same way about our precious Pastor I know there's many sitting here tonight who you know through his ministry you've been set free God came into your life God did something praise God [Music] hallelujah praise God when your marriage was ready to break up and in the phone call in the middle of the night he came and set for hours and spoke and brought the two together who was it my brother praise God when that seems there was no God had a man God had a man [Music] amen praise God brother say God once God called man man that's not afraid of the fire of God and this church here tonight is the most you hear what I'm saying you we going to be the most responsible people before almighty God for what God has placed in our life tonight we're going to be the most responsible people tonight in the whole of the world tonight friends praise God oh when it seems like oh Hope Was Gone someone came driving up your driveway and knocked on your door and came and spoke and says brother you're doing the whole thing why someone was willing to go I think it said our brother Bram one time he came home and his own own child didn't even know him when he knocked on the door I think the daughter says the little baby says mommy he has some man at the door and it was his own father praise God what can we say words fail us tonight I'm a witness I like to give Witness what happened in Cape Town as we drove down to brother Layman's funeral tired and we as we got there and there are so many ministers and they gave each Minister a chance to say something there was all the Pentecostal ministers each of them got up and identified themselves and gave all the titles and who they were and what the churches was under them as he went from minister to minister eventually came to the ministers in the message and there were all the ministers and they got up and each one said each thing but there was just no fear some ministers got up and said some nasty things and Tred to stick the pastor I said there since God I've seen you anointing so many times Lord I've seen God with the seems like the the other was against him I see you anointing him Lord and it came to the time where the pastor had to speak brother I never seen something like that in all my life each M had 10 minutes to speak and the pastor came and he ripped out the mic and he says praise God he says Pastor OS he says I come from Jesus Christ praise God it says I got no church but his church and brother when he spoke the anointing of God dropped on praise God in the face of the critics in the face of all the forers in the face of all the HS against him brother the power of God came down and anointed him and the glory of God was in the place in 10 minutes time in 10 minutes time the presence of God the Angels was walking up and down the aisle the glory of God was there praise God the dropped down in 10 minutes time Hallelujah I'm a witness I'm a witness I'm a witness tonight that the glory of God came down all over the building in 10 minutes [Applause] time oh my God I think I believe from tonight on we know it's the truth it's the first time the pastor spoke like he did tonight and I believe from tonight we we're going to pray more for him we believe as his body is tired and weary and the eggs begin to come in the body we're going to be like Moses when he got tired to lift up his hands in prayer and pray for him every morning you get up you remember the pastor's name every morning you get up you call upon his family's name you pray for them and say God give him new Strength God give him a new charge God restore Health God give him a new burst of faith and strength will you do that friends I believe the Bible says pray for them who watch over your souls pray for them pray for them who watches over your souls pray for them brother that watches over your Souls praise God my as apostle said all over there looking for a man to stand in a gap and you know what's going around you know what's happening all over the country the news is out people want some man like this friends people is looking for someone that can bring down the presence of God people is looking for someone that's got reality the world is sick of imitations the world is sick of brother sister Social Gospel but God wants a god call man a God man on the face of the Earth with the anointing of God upon Him Do You Believe don't you appreciate the pastor tonight don't you appreciate his wife tonight let's give the Lord a hand in Praise thank you Lord oh hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God oh Hallelujah words will fail us tonight to go through the things that has happened and transpired through all the years but we want to say we appreciate him tonight praise God want to tell him we appreciate him we're going to stand with him like never before praise God and uh the pastor wants us wants he uh to thank the deacons from his side he appreciate the deacons that have stood with him all the years he wants to say appreciate them praise God from my side I want to say I appreciate the elders the de consy praise God I want to put my appreciation in with the praise God and knowing that the hour is here brother praise God charity never faileth the brotherly kindness is here the honey is here what to stick us together like never before to love your brother with such a Godly love why because godliness is beginning to pour into the Church of God and what is God is a God man praise God to express brotherly kindness you're going to love your brother love your sister love one another and brother says let nothing come between you nothing praise God you refuse to let anything come in between you and your brother you and your sister and you watch brother and sister when that church becomes one and the Revelation becomes one among them like the day of Pentecost when they were in one Accord it says the power of almighty God will drop down and signs wonders and miracles we see it but you're going to see it in a bigger scale brother if we dedicate Our Lives to him don't you love him tonight don't you want to say Lord I Surrender tonight praise God let us stand to our feet praise God there's some uh quotes I wanted to read but praise God everything has been said what can you say brother after such a meeting what can you say to know that Mark 14 the Bible says she did she did everything she could do praise God and I believe we're going to do everything we can do from tonight on we're going to pray like never before we're going to be sincere we're going to do everything the Bible says he did everything she could do and that was to anoint her master and you have it in your power tonight to do everything I don't care what is on your job at home at school you do everything that you can for the master tonight and the Bible says that he was pleased with what he did and I believe God is pleased with what has been done in this church praise God As we sing I surrender all tonight your head bow your eye Clos Lord I surrender all tonight just before we go into the communion tonight Lord I want to surrender my life I want to dedicate it I want to anoint your head tonight God praise God lord I want to I want to anoint it God I want to break the alabaster box tonight God and let the anointing of God flow tonight Lord Jesus we can say like Paul says time fails us to tell about B and all the Great Men of old and I believe time would fail us tonight if we would say and speak about the things that God has done in the ministry of our precious Pastor time would fail us but we want to show more appreciation from our sides more respect praise good so um I was uh told by a young preacher some time ago um what did you all the guys left for us what Legacy did you leave for us and he mentioned U brother becket's name and my name especially and um he um then went on to say all that you guys has left us is fighting and jealousy and bad mouthing one another and you had unkind words all the time against one another and to him it seemed as if this message started that way and that is what we all the brothers has left behind and that made me play this tape because if you listen to this tape here's Raymond Thompson for instance we can play you a tape of Solen and what he says to and it wasn't all dark and Gloom and uh fighting and fussing and at the beginning when we started we were actually watching one another's back way back there we were one in spirit truth way back there so young man if you think that we started with what you call backbiting and fighting and being jealous of one another and had unkind words I played you this tape to show you that at the beginning there was no unkind words on this tape there's no unkind words words on this St there is no ugliness and that was way back there when we started and that's the way it was so I thought I'm going to play the tape um to show these young men or young preachers that has come in it wasn't all the time Doom and Gloom and and bad mouthing we used to have conventions and we all go went to the convention and will convention we were there when uh brother Layman down in Cape Town had conventions we were there when we had conventions out in de Gloria we were there and uh I will admit that afterwards uh things happened and maybe up till now we still have that animosity and fighting and uh because everyone went with with his little Doctrine you know uh we had the peruja doctrine with brother Billy and brother Harold Beckett and uh then we had uh brother Raymond and them and myself with a seventh underd Doctrine and all that but um then afterwards we found out the brother Brenham didn't see a thing like for instance um would say you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and all that I wanted all the years is to see those words come out of brother brenham's mouth then I believe it but that's not a quote that's not what brother Bram says the same with the thund not so there's where the the the problem started and we started to break up and we had um our scages and uh people didn't greet one another and we don't visit one another's churches and uh because uh I think we got to a place where we were scared we going to lose members well I would say I thought that I wouldn't like to lose more members at that time but uh at before all these doctrines came we didn't have my brother all these fightings and stuff that you see so we left a legacy even our Legacy if I look at you then I ask myself how did you come in here you in the message what Legacy are you leaving have you done anything we were on fire for God we had Fellowship right through the night and uh you don't even have that anymore so uh we U we thought that we would um play this tape um so that you could um understand that when this message started we didn't have what we have today day uh we gave one another accolades like on the tap you heard brother Raymond giving out accolades he was we had conventions together and um we covered one another's backs we move freely to one another's churches if they were was other the churches and um even way back there with brother Beckett was in Joba before we went to Cape Town also we all were together so uh we don't um fight all the way from the beginning the fighting only started afterwards so I play the St to show you what happened way back there and um even the statements that brother Raymond made I'm sure there States out there too that I made statements about brother Beckett being my friend that's why he has in his um study there's nothing like old friends and I can tell you if I phone him uh all these years although we had our differences we still get together and have something to eat with his wife and what have you and we respect one another you know we have our differences so brother don't come with your own ideas about we leaving a legacy like that we didn't leave a legacy like that that's why I know that right now you know like u a certain prominent brother told me what's happening in the states there more people leaving the message than in the message I know things are very critical I know things are very bad but uh it wasn't so way back there so uh I hope that you would uh uh listen carefully how we covered one another's backs may God bless you and uh um maybe you could if you have an opportunity or a chance to uh thank brother Raymond for that accolades that he gave out on the stap may God bless you and there's nothing negative on the St thank you\n"}, {"id":

They had food provided. Short notice, but people are on the ball. People want to do something.

I don't know if you see the clips and the videos and the preaching. It's on another level. Can we stand up and give them a hand? And the reason why I want you to stand up and give them a hand, they travel the country to record the man of God. And the reason you need to give them a hand, it's easy to buy data to look it on your coach than to travel to the real live meeting. They make it possible for you to relax and watch it at home. Give them a hand. Give them a hand. [Applause] [Music] And they're doing such a good job that every so-cal message Pentecostal is on our stream because they doing a good job.

Look who anointing that man. &gt;&gt; There's a man anointing people here. [Applause] [Music] Then we want to thank the school. It's still standing. You know you here but the whole year there's people on the sides here. A school every day every year since we started the school is still here. [Applause] Not God in the prison only. God in the school. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We want to thank the principal, the vice principal, the teachers, and every worker here. They work every day to keep the school going. And you know how many made it because of this El Tabernacle. We gave up on the school, but God did not give up on. And by God's grace, we're going to open up again 2026. [Applause] You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great [Applause] from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. [Music] Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, [Music] fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. [Music] By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. [Music] El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school. All the grandchildren made it because God had a school. &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the principal. And behind that, thank the God of the apostle. The apostle saw it through for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Music] through that school and everything. Be patient with Edgar Roscoll. &gt;&gt; Be patient with him. &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, [Applause] we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then for the first time this year &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the people from far cleaned this place not as visitors. &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors. They cleaned the hostels and wherever they were the yard, the kitchen not as visitors. They told us now we are El Tabernacle. [Music] [Applause] Let's give them a hand. It's clean around here because people feel that this is their place. I'm almost done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then at this time I would like to where's brother Lloyd Ptorius. &gt;&gt; I don't see him.

Enjoy it, church. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Good evening and welcome back to E News Network, your trusted source for uplifting, inspiring, and informative news across Eban. I'm Rosanne Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. [Music] [Music] I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [Music] [Music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. [Music] And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year. [Music] Are you an expectation for the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco? I can't hear you, church. [Music] I can't hear you. [Music] Oh my. Can we just wave our hands to the great creator? Sing.

God bless you. &gt;&gt; Elimin, &gt;&gt; how you feeling? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] You look ready for the service tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. The last day of 2025 [Music] made another year &gt;&gt; to serve God. What grace? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, in case I don't get to it, I'll do it before the time &gt;&gt; by wishing you A graceful &gt;&gt; 2026. &gt;&gt; May May you serve him &gt;&gt; even better. Amen. &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. [Music] When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. [Music] That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. I knew how to dress and I had them flocking after me. [Music] Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. [Music] I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. [Music] And I said to myself, \"So far, my friend.\" [Music] Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? [Music] I cornered him one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [Music] The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [Applause] And they couldn't find his body &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. His old life is gone. Christina [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Because I hated myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. &gt;&gt; Who can save me? Hallelujah. [Applause] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers? Let us kill ourselves. and let us have a new life. Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession of a murderer. I can see all over the world. They say sh Never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My confession. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have your Bibles with you &gt;&gt; as you prepare to die next year, &gt;&gt; you came to die today. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. today. to be. &gt;&gt; I never gave you that one, Edgar, because I didn't want you to steal my Hallelujah. There's no judge that can sentence me. &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, \"Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer.\" [Applause] [Music] [Applause] He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. [Music] It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [Music] So remember, I say I hope. &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready &gt;&gt; to move. I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. [Applause] [Music] There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. [Music] And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [Music] on the wall. And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [Applause] [Music] The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [Applause] Every service she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. She didn't set stone and let it pass by. She grabbed it. Every service and now there is no oil. Hey, &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. The oil is here. Heat. Heat. And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. that that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, love. Hallelujah. There &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, [Applause] gets closed, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [Music] These foolish virgins was panomites. And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, \"Come into the ark.\" That means that God was already in the ark. Does that mean if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, \"Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us and here we are tonight. The door was open to us. The oil came and made us walk into the door. Aren't you happy? You didn't sit outside the door. You walked into the door and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. Come in and sap with me. Come into the wedding supper. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil because the oil is here. I claim it. [Music] And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, \"Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But but right here. Look at the oil flowing. And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. [Applause] Hallelujah. That makes 6,000 years. [Applause] And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, \"Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa.\" I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, \"Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, \"Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth.\" &gt;&gt; I said, \"It's finished. The door's closed.\" &gt;&gt; Shot. It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. And listen, &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. May he come here tonight and make you a murderer. May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Let's see the sketch. 6,000 years is up. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; They walked into the ark. &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the door closed, God was inside &gt;&gt; and then it rained. &gt;&gt; And then it rain. &gt;&gt; Watch out. It's going to rain after tonight. You are not going to be able to sit still, stand still because it's going to rain. Only in the bride is going to rain. The wise virgin &gt;&gt; and didn't rain. &gt;&gt; The rain came down in Torance. &gt;&gt; And I heard they singing the world. &gt;&gt; I hear them singing the world. Can't you see the rain is gone? &gt;&gt; Mhm. It's dry. So dry in every church. Can't you see the rain is gone? The Holy Ghost is gone. And as it rained, you know what the rain done? The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. &gt;&gt; The rain took the word and lifted it up. Oh, thank you. When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, the spirit of the Lord raises you up. This is my bride. Yes, she is. You lifted up in the message. They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. And they say there's no church like your church. [Music] Hallelujah. The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work amongst the Gentiles. Then only Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east putting a mark, the seal of God onto the 144,000, but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil. Oh brother. Tell me. Tell me, tell me that angel of Revelation 7:1, the ceiling angel, &gt;&gt; is it the same angel that you feel here now? He's here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7:1, &gt;&gt; that sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; seals 144,000. &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Edgar Ocon will seal off the ground. I take my stand. Oh, heat, heat. We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. The ceiling angel in at the rostel seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. Heat up Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Come on, let's go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Just go to Genesis 18. Where is the greater works, &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. Oh my. [Applause] [Music] 11. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Yeah. You see, I'm taking my time tonight. [Music] I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The wise version says, \"We can't give you our oil.\" &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Let's read. All two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, the oil. Again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Again. [Music] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. But the children in this house &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because a champagne epic. Champagne epic. &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [Music] A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time when the door of longsuffering gets some close. And this is not the time for the door to open. This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. Are you locked in? And a door, a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth dynamics and &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. Heat. Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. Have you got the seven thunders? &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [Applause] You can open the door. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you can Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; \"Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. &gt;&gt; And a voice says, \"Come up higher.\" Brian, &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. Come up higher. &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, \"Come in.\" Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. You had a body change &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed. The things you used to do, you do them no more. You had a body change. You had a body change. You don't like nice times anymore &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind the door. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out. Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [Applause] And the bridegroom said to her, \"Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. &gt;&gt; Get out friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message &gt;&gt; and the door tonight is shut. Will the pianos come? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [Applause] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, he's standing right next to you now. [Applause] You speak to him. as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza where the Jews are finishing the thing off. Let us keep the oil. [Music] I'm finished. Everybody. Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. America. [Applause] Oh my [Applause] search me Lord. Suit.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] as I finish [Music] off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, [Music] &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, [Music] &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. [Applause] [Music] If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. [Music] Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. [Music] You can't even save your children's soul. [Music] The foolish virgin said a half an hour [Applause] to fill up and it didn't fill up. [Music] And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. [Music] All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. [Applause] But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [Applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. [Music] And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. [Music] He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. [Music] A murderous confession. We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get too big for your boots [Music] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? [Music] None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, [Music] but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh [Music] and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, [Music] to kill the flesh. [Music] It's time that you search yourself [Music] before we go into this new year. [Music] A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. [Music] Children listens to us. [Music] They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. Search me. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. [Music] stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. [Music] You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? [Music] It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [Applause] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, \"When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close this eyes, you're going to find me here. [Music] You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps [Music] is God's word. [Music] [Applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [Music] [Applause] Wouldn't [Music] you like to kill yourself tonight? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [Music] Let's commit suicide. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [Applause] are shut. And the wise virgin says, \"I cannot give you any oil. [Music] I just got enough for myself.\" Brother Oscar, why don't you go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the door is shut. Brother Jonathan [Music] Let me see. Amen. [Music] Search me, oh God, and all my today. [Music] Oh, save. Oh my go [Music] see the be [Music] some Bring the light in me. [Music] Amen. Set me free. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

[Music] It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? [Music] Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my [Music] kill myself. [Music] There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be [Music] and [Music] Oh son. Oh God, [Music] my heart [Music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, \"No, that's not for me. Somebody else.\" But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? [Music] I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? [Music] Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [Music] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay? You feel okay? It's fine. [Music] You'll feel [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll be your next year then you [Music] &gt;&gt; say anybody I don't want to be a preacher tonight that expects you to worship and I don't worship when God speaks. I don't want to be like that. I want to tell you, but I'm not doing help the preacher tonight. Lord, tabernacle, it's later than what you think it is. [Applause] [Music] I believe the spirit spoke plainly tonight. It was not it was plainly speaking to us. He that has an ear, let him hear what God told you to know. [Music] Thank you. Spirit to the earth. [Music] Lord, speak to me. [Music] We are staring. [Music] I sing to you strange. [Music] Yes. [Music] So lovely. [Music] Please. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Dad, stop. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I wonder precious brother Ignatius come to read us the scripture for the communion. [Music] [Music] Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. When he has supper, saying, \"This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Father that we gave heed to the invitation Lord when it was said come unto me all he that are heavy laden and burden and I will give you rest Lord and we accepted the invitation Lord Father and tonight we find ourselves behind the shut door Lord Father Lord Jesus where we can s with the bride tonight Lord Father and we want to say thank you thank Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Father that we can come Lord and break bread with thee behind closed doors tonight Lord. Father Lord Jesus we had a foolish virgin will not have this opportunity Lord to come and break bread with thee Lord. Father tonight Lord Jesus we want to say thank you. Thank you Lord that we can come and break bread with thee tonight Lord. Father Lord when the world does not know Lord Jesus. Father Lord what they have missed out Lord Jesus the greatest thing that they have missed which is the Holy Ghost Lord. Father Lord tonight it is the Holy Ghost Lord that has called us to the tree of life Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, where we can have eternally suck with thee, Lord, may you bless, Lord Jesus. Father, the breaking of the bread, Lord, may you come, Lord Jesus, Father, and just Lord Jesus, make a way, Father, as we partake, Lord Jesus, of your table tonight, Lord, Father, that it will strengthen us, Lord Jesus. Father, Lord, that it will keep us, Lord. And the apostles said, Lord, Father, that it will keep us, Lord, in this day, Lord Jesus. May you bless the table, Lord.

Oh great eternal heavenly father Lord, how can we close a champagne epic such as this tonight? Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God. May you just bless us with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we pray Lord for our precious apostle that you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father, like never before, Lord. We've never seen a man such as this. Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us an odd pole. Thank you for sending us a man that we can see right through the footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray Lord that you'd restore all the virtue that has left his body. Remember our precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco family, Lord. God, bless and undertake for them even the more, Lord. May the same fullness that dwells upon the father dwell upon each and every one of them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord, may it reach from the head down to the beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even down to the skirts. And may we just be filled with more of that rain that Apostle says should fall upon us, heavenly father. May it rain so much upon us until we lose trace of our flesh in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may you take our flesh so deep in the sea of forgetfulness until we cannot even go and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this beautiful service. May you bless each and everyone that is here. And may we depart Lord in your shakina glory. We ask it not by might, not by power, but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the apostle in your infallible name of Jesus King God. Amen and amen. [Music] Amen. We uh deacons has picked up a cell phone. Anybody has lost a cell phone? And then there's a set of house keys with an E. This has been lost during the convention.
