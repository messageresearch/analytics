about a man named Jonah y there was a man named Jonah a prophet of the Lord he was going down the road one day when the voice of God he heard the Lord said unto Jonah to Nineveh you must go and tell to them my message for I have told you so Kenneth do you think Jonah did what he was supposed to do I don't know well listen real close down to the city of japa went Jonah running from the presence of the Lord sing sing it with me you guys city of so Jonah bought a ticket to sale Far Far Away what a nice vacation I will have the sailors heard him say the Sun was shining bright the sky was blue and clear but one thing Jonah didn't think the Lord was oh so near down from heaven came a storm so mighty blowing so hard upon the sea Ready set [Music] go so the Sea The Little ship was sinking the captain said to pray so they all Drew lots to find which man was the cause of such a day well the lot fell upon Jonah they cried what must we do throw me to the water and this storm will be through down in the belly of the fish went Jonah down to the bottom of the sea your turn down in the belly of fish Jonah down to the bottom of the sea now Jonah was in trouble he thought that he was through how he wish that he had done the things that God had told him to so Jonah started praying and then at God's command that fish Rose from the bottom and swam right to dry land up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the SE Jonah just came right out of the fish's mouth yep up from the belly of the fish came Jonah tumbling out upon the sand again God spoke to Jonah and this time he obeyed to the city called Nineveh he quickly made his way he cried to them of judgment unless they changed their ways in sack cloth they repented and peaceful were their days down from heaven came God's dear Mercy Mercy to all who will believe down from heaven came God's dear Mercy Mercy is that a true story sure [Music] is and that was good I appreciate that let's sing uh I've got so much to

mind when I thought about all this this evening and i' just like to read it to you before I tell you a little bit about this uh this song they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves they mount up to the heaven they go down to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their stresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men about a week ago I was uh having a hard time going to asleep and and a tune started just going through my head very similar to the chorus of what we just sang and it just kept going through my head and going through my head and oh so I got up and tried to grunt a little bit into a microphone and and capture sort of what was going on and there were words that were kind of in the background there that were coming along and so I wrote those down too and and then uh I I shared my grunting with uh sister Martha and she she put it to music and so by God's grace I want to try and find the right space maybe even on the keys this time I'm usually between them somewhere and and try and and and sing this song I'll put the words up for you it's it's very simple what you would expect okay we'll [Music] try I want to sing how I got that wrong I want to sing still got yeah shout Lord I love you I just want to praise your holy name I want to sing Hallelujah shout Lord I love you oh that men everywhere would praise your name when all all around you is trouble life seems such a struggle deep within the belly of the whale that's when to sing Hallelujah shout Lord I love you as long as I have breath I'll praise your name I want to sing Hallelujah shout Lord I love you I just want to praise your holy name I want to sing Hallelujah

believing that and I don't want to miss one of you thank you so much thank good evening on Wednesday's evenings we've been going through the books of the Bible as our Pastor Daniel has told us we're breaking the pattern a little bit tonight and we're going to have a short lesson from the Book of Jonah before we open our Bibles to look at this book Let's approach the Lord one more time in prayer together Lord Jesus it's such an honor Lord that we can be gathered together in your name in this place at this time to worship you to praise you to read your word to listen for you to speak to us Lord to answer questions to answer needs to touch hearts Lord to just move by your spirit in our midst as our desire Lord that you would accept our worship our praise our singing the thoughts of a heart be pleasing to you forgive us Lord of everything that's been incorrect in our life today Lord every sin every way that we have missed the mark and Lord forgive us place it under the blood of Jesus Christ and let us come before you pure and holy through your righteousness through your sacrifice through what you have done for us by your grace and your love Lord we commit the remainder of this service into your hands Lord help me to not cause anyone to stumble not to misspeak Lord and Lord if I say something wrong Lord anoint the ears that hear Lord that they'll receive it in the way that it's intended Lord we commit this to you and Lord all we can do is fall on our knees and thank you for all that you've done in Jesus precious name amen while you're standing and for our opening first verses I'd like to read two short accounts now if you've been here on Wednesdays you know that they're not going to be from Jonah the first is going to be from Genesis the second will be from the gospel of Matthew now the Book of Jonah focuses geographically on the Assyrian capital city of Nineveh in Genesis 10 Noah his sons and their wives have exited the ark After the flood we're given an account of Noah's sons and their descendants did I hit the wrong button technical difficulty there we are now these are the generations of the sons of Noah and I've highlighted Shem and ham because they play a part in our story of Jonah tonight Shem ham and yaet and unto them were Sons born After the flood verse six and the sons of ham Kush and misraim and F and Canan and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and the beginning of nimrod's kingdom was Babel and ER and aad and khna all in the land of shinar what we think of was Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq and out of that land Shar or Mesopotamia went forth Asher and builded Nineveh and the City of roobot and Kalah okay so you ask yourself who's Asher well going back to Noah's sons they're children of Noah's son Shem Alm and Asher and araxid and L and Aram from this we see that Nineveh was a very an ancient city one of the first mentioned After the flood it was located in the area we think of as Mesopotamia it was founded by Asher which is the Hebrew word for Assyria when you read in your Bible and it says Assyria the word is Asher this gentleman's name Assyria meaning prosperous or successful just a a little fun fact here in in the ruins of a library found in one of the first archaeological digs in what would prove to be Nineveh in 1853 was a set CL tablets and they contain the Epic of gilgames you you may have heard of that it includes a story about the Earth being destroyed by a flood and the tablet with that portion of the story is known as the flood tablet which you see here excavated from the ruins of Nineveh now from the gospel of Matthew Jesus is being challenged by his detractors Matthew 12 you read then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master meaning teacher show us a sign we would see a sign from thee and Jesus answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous meaning worshiping the wrong thing evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given to it to you he's in their face right now but the sign of the prophet Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the and the whale's belly the Greek word means a big sea creature with a gaping mouth Jonah was three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this evil and adulterous generation and shall condemn it he's going to these guys that we're going to hear about tonight are going to condemn you scribes and Pharisees because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold Jesus says look at me Behold a greater than Jonas is here please be seated I'm I'm sure their knees got weak and they were seated too we've been studying through the Bible and we're now in the area of the Bible that we call the minor prophet Jonah is fifth among this group and they're just called minor because of the short writings that they left not because of the lack of importance of what they said Jonah is one of only two books of the Minor Prophets The Other being n that deal not with Israel or Judah or an Empire like Egypt or Babylon or a neighboring Nation like Edom but with a single Gentile City and they both deal with the same city Nineveh we know very little about Jonah the Book of Jonah is four short chapters a total of only 48 verses the only other reference to him in the Old Testament is a oneliner that tells us where he was from a place called gath heer though separated by Jesus from some 700 years he was from the same part of the Galilee he wasn't from Jerusalem or some place like that he would have been a neighbor of Jesus if they'd lived in the same day I'm going to try and show you some of the many parallels between Jonah and Jesus one of the reasons or purposes of our brief overviews of the books of the Old Testament has been to see where Jesus is portrayed prophesied or otherwise present and we're pressed for time this evening I I was given 20 minutes and remember that when I did did the psalm and sang the song that didn't count against the 20 minutes so we're going to get right into this book okay so here's an overview the topics of the Book of Jonah it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City and if you fall asleep as long as you heard that song that the Petersons did you've got the book okay so I'm I'm just filling in a little bit in between the lines for you here it's a story of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile City Nineveh Jonah thought it was all about judgment and destruction on a terrible Place God knew it was about demonstrating his mercy and kindness his grace to those willing to repent and reform to change their ways and to show that such Grace was not limited to the descendants of Jacob so the first thing we read here is Jonah flees the presence of the Lord was now we'll start reading from Jonah 1:1 now the word of the Lord came into Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh that great large Mighty proud city cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me must have been pretty wicked for out of all the world this to come to send a prophet here we see the Lord is sending a Jewish Prophet to a gentile City we're given its name told it's a very large city and that the wickedness of it is Extreme and the Lord wants the people there to be warned God always warns Before Destruction giving people an opportunity to turn to him but Jonah rose up to flee flee that's what that's what Joseph did right with the baby Jesus when the angel came and told him about Herod flee to Egypt so Jonah Rose to flee unto tares from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa that's modern day Tel Aviv and he found a ship going to tarses tares immediate question comes to mind where's this tarish that Jonah was attempting to reach the short answer no one really knows many think it refers to a town on the southern coast of Spain I've seen that in many many references oh he was going to go 25 200 miles to okay this is 8th Century BC we know that ships went there but or maybe another name for Tarsus where the Apostle Paul came from we know of a tarses that Solomon sent ship to ships to every 3 years to get silver in gold and apes and ivory you don't find that in Turkey you don't find that in Spain so this does not describe a place on the Mediterranean but most likely on the east coast of Africa in Solomon's time so there's more than one tarses what we do know is that Nineveh is some 500 miles Overland From Galilee on The Tigress River and if you got there by boat or by fish uh it's about 500 mil from the mouth of the Persian Gulf so little hard to get to I personally suspect that it's the Tarsus of Paul it would be reasonable to find ships going up and down the Eastern Mediterranean coast and to be able to go down to a port and find a ship going that way because it was a lot of trade going on on that route It was a commercial route and it was heavily traveled much less likely to find one going to Spain or East Africa and having space for a passenger so let's continue on so Jonah paid the fair thereof went down into it to go with them unto tarses from the presence of the Lord now we aren't told why he thought tarses would get him away from God's presence only that it was his destination and he was desperate to get there as fast as he could to flee but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea lighten it of them you can see in in this uh slide that that ship ships weren't very large they had a single sail a shallow draft there may or may not have been limited cabin space on the main deck the picture in the upper right of the screen here shows how such Merchant ships were loaded they had a very almost flat a very shallow rounded bottom of a hall it's great if you're in calm water not so good if the WEA is choppy so the bottom of the hall because it's not a nice deep V like we'd have in a modern ship they filled it with rocks for ballast in order to keep the ship basically upright the inner deck covering the ballast was unloaded with Goods to be transported which were segregated and loaded in the HS passengers and Crews might be on this level as well the top deck had Goods lashed down and these typically be the lightest Goods again to maintain the balance of the ship so to empty the ship of its Wares especially in a storm the crew would have to unsecure the cargo crates and jars and carry or hand them up to the top deck to be tossed overboard and as we read in Psalms 107 a little earlier ships were very unstable in a storm Rising near the crest of the wave and down into the trough making this an arduous a very dangerous undertaking but Jonah was gone out into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship Master the the captain came to him and said Jonah what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not you recognize a similar situation with Jesus and the gospels he was sleeping on a ship being tossed about in a storm on the Sea of Galilee the disciples some of whom were experienced fishermen on that Lake were in fear of their lives and went to wake Jesus Mark 4:35 to 38 for those of you taking notes yeah so what's next Jonah is thrown into the sea so back to Jonah the the sailors determined that Jonah is the cause of the problem so they said unto him the Mariners said to Jonah what shall we do unto thee that the ship may be common unto us for the sea rought and was tempestuous and Jonah said to them take me up cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great Tempest is upon you nevertheless the men rode hard to bring the ship to the land but they could not for the sea rot and was tempestuous tempestuous against them and understand that in these days they didn't have compasses they didn't have navigation things they batteries were dead in their GPS so they always sailed close to Land close to shore where they could see land it was never far away which also meant that they were on typically pretty shallow water which meant that any storm coming was going to be particularly severe if you've ever done any scuba diving or just brought in a boat from the shore in the ocean where it's just a little bit wavy as you get close to short tends to get really choppy because of the of the of the slope and the currents in the motion and so forth wherefore they Cried unto the Lord why would they cry unto the Lord why would they cry to Jonah's God because they understood that it was Jonah's God that was mad with them it wasn't their gods they' already figured that out so they're crying to Jonah's God we beseech thee Oh Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life and let not Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh Lord Hast done as it pleased thee so they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased from her raging then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice under the Lord and made vows in Mark 6 we read of disciples rowing against a strong wind Jesus walks on the water as soon as he enters the boat the storm ceases like the Mariner and Jonah's both the disciples we were told were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered in Jonah's case he had to be cast out of the boat for the storm to cease in Jesus case he had to come into the boat for the storm to cease in both cases those in the boat were amazed well what happens next a great fish swallows Jonah so Jesus is in the boat but what about Jonah now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights and that brings us to the parallel from our opening scriptures where Jesus said that he that as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and nights so Jesus would be in the heart of the earth what's the first thing Jonah did he prayed he prayed to the Lord he couldn't see if the storm calmed or not he was an in a terrible and fearful situation the storm was the last thing on his mind at this point this is not a Disney cartoon of Pinocchio the puppet boy and monstro the whale this is a unique as they said in the song a real life event is it true yes it's true let's read then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord he's no longer running he's no longer Aid avoiding the Lord he's turning to the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice skipping down to verse N I will sacrifice unto thee with all that I have what does he have he's in the belly of a fish what does God really want from us the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord word and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land how he was kept alive or preserved or breathed inside that sea creature we don't know a brother random spoke about Jonah many times and said he didn't know what we do know is that after three days and nights Jonah was spit out of the fish onto the shore and he was alive well what happens next oh Jonah's not fleeing the presence Jonah goes to Nineveh we don't know how long afterwards we don't know ex exactly where he was but the Lord had Jonah's attention the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time saying arise go into Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose and again tried to flee from the presence no no Jonah arose and he went unto Nineveh according to the word of the lord we can only speculate how long it took by what means he traveled it seems likely that some people witnessed his ejection from the Monstrous fish and would have followed him to see what might happen to share the amazing Miracle of Jonah's arrival on their Shores God doesn't usually do things in the shadow but in the open further there were many tens of gods worshiped in Nineveh and a fish God was among them this would give further impact to Jonah's Miracle now we read Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey that doesn't mean it takes three days to get there it means it would take you three days to go through the place this is a big place remember it was about 500 Miles Overland from japa where he got on the boat about 4 450 mil from his home in giley it's like walking from Tucson to Albuquerque here's a satellite view to give you an idea of the perspective I've shown Jerusalem japa where he got on the boat and Nineveh where he was headed way up on the Tigris River at the time of Jonah this is a little hard to see but those of you sitting in the back understand why we always encourage people to sit in the front at the time of Jonah the Assyrian Empire was still expanding it included the two darker shades of green that you see here but that light shade of green it hadn't reached those borders yet it'd be some 40 years after Jonah's Ministry that Assyria would conquer Israel and subjugate Judah this is uh just one artist idea based on different archaeological things and and texts and so forth of what it might have looked like in ancient Nineveh it was not only the capital of the Assyrian Empire it was a major Center of Commerce on major eastwest and Norths South trade routes you might say all roads lead to Nineveh this is a picture of one of the gates of Nineveh that was uncovered and partially restored prior to the general destruction a decade or so ago from Isis you can see I've circled with an oval there a human headed bull at the lower right of the entry circled in yellow the arrow that I put next to it is about I've got shoes on about my height about six feet gives you an idea the size of that gate that is an impressive massive intimidating structure and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown interesting word overthrown we don't know anything other than this title of his sermon or sermons or prophecies to the people of Nineveh we don't know for how many days he was among them preaching proclaiming the word of the Lord if he was like any of the other prophets and if the Lord is consistent he would have been telling the people to repent so the people of Nineveh believed God that is they believed the word of the Lord that Jonah spoke no doubt influenced by the miracle of his survival inside the sea creature and proclaimed a fast put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them in this section we see that the preaching of Jonah saying what the Lord told him to say back in verse one is effective for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his Ro robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes this is a sign of mourning and of humility skipping to verse eight he said let man and Beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yay let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands the background in this slide is a detail from a bronze gate of Bell a city near Nineveh of the same era from a photo I took at the British museum the ninevites the Assyrians were an exceedingly cruel and violent people I'd left the text obscuring the image on purpose there's children here I don't want to scare them but there are heads hung around the city gate men with their hands and feet cut off piles of hands and feet on the ground another man impaled on a spike afterwards these are cruel wanly violent Wicked people this is embossed on this City Gate warning anyone who comes this is a powerful Empire tolerates no breaking of its rules you have no rights once you enter these Gates a place without Mercy a place that Rules by violence back to the king's Proclamation turn everyone from his evil away in from the violence who can tell if God will turn and and repent turn away from his Fierce anger that we perish not repent of course means to change direction to turn around not God repenting from sin but his happiness that the people were changing their Direction and God heard their words Lord if he'll do this and that I promise I'll serve you it's not what it says God saw their works didn't listen to what they said he saw what they did he observed their actions that they turned from their evil way and God repented of God turned from the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not this is an unprecedented event again Nineveh was the capital of Assyria the Assyrian Empire was vast the Army ruthless the laws were harsh punishment wanly cruel think of a rabbi today going to the IAH and Iran and telling him Terran was going to be destroyed by the god of Israel in 40 days how do you think he'd be received by the Ayatollah in tan today well that's the sort of place and the kind of regime that Jonah was sent to but the people of Nineveh did repent from the King to the lowest person even the animals were made to fast turns out that Jonah wasn't pleased with this result and the Lord then proceeded to kindly teach him a lesson about the value of human and even animal life but oh I'm out of time and wait wait I see someone coming in the main entrance of the sanctuary could it be Jonah did you hear what the rabbi said about these people of Nineveh did you hear how evil they were and how filthy they were and all the problems that they caused and all of all of the filth that's in Nineveh did you hear about that do you hear what he said he was kind they were bad they were immoral they were violent they were evil so here I am a servant of the Lord and God tells me to go to that filthy Wicked place of neveh did I get him right or did I get him wrong you have a place there's this place here in these United States it's called Los Angeles you know play have you heard of to that place has anybody been there to Los Angeles what's it like it's awful it's bad huh yeah have like nasty people walking down the streets and and and uh they have like stars in in the in the ground and memorials and monuments and and idols and all of that this place n of it was like that so then God tells me go to this Place Nineveh and cry out against it I'm not going to that place brother Joe it's nasty so I go down to Jaffa and I pay my money and I get a ticket and off I go to a place called Tarsus very nice fine Jewish people there it's a nice place this place tarus so I get in the boat and I'm going along and and we're cruising along I don't know how you sisters walk in these [Laughter] things almost fell back there you need a split now I can [Laughter] see so I'm going along and I'm in the boat and I want to get some rest it's a long way so I go down in the bottom in the middle of the boat and there's this nice bed there I lay down and I'm resting really well and I'm asleep and all of a sudden one of these Heathen Gentiles that were up in the boat one of the Mariners you know they're rough they cuss they do all kinds of bad stuff they're violent they would fit perfect in Nineveh but he comes down he says wake up wake up you sleeper get up get up come up with we're we're about to perish I was like what you know the boat's rocking I get up there and the the wind is blowing and there's lightning and there's rain and and there's water all over and the waves are coming up over the boat and I and I'm there and they're asking everybody what are you what's going on and everybody starts all of these heathens start praying to their own Gods my God yeah that's going to do a lot of good and this one's praying to that God and that one's praying praying to this God I almost fell off the side and this one's it's modest and then this one's going over this one and that one and and I say watching and they they have this way of finding out the truth and they take these like their Dice and they they throw them out and they knew that it was me and they're throwing all their stuff over overboard they're trying to lighten the ship and they look over at me and they say you're the one what do we do the ship's going to sink and I say well here's what happened you know you're praying to all your Gods I serve the true God I serve the god that created the sea I serve the god that created the land and my God told me to go to this place Nineveh but now I'm on this boat going to Tarsus I said are you crazy what are you doing if you're God's real and he told you to go to Tarsus or told you to go to Nineveh why are you going to Tarsus they said what do we do and I said well really the best way for you to survive this my God is the god he's the almighty Jehovah take me throw me over the boat throw me into this Raging Sea and then you'll be safe they didn't want to do it I saw that these men weren't what I thought they were and they started praying and they didn't pray to their God gods they prayed to the God that I told them about and they were asking for Mercy they said they said Lord Lord God we don't want to throw this man over I said throw me over so they took me they did as I asked they threw me overboard and then they made a sacrifice to the one true God Jehovah and the wind stopped and the rain stopped and the boat the men on the boat were safe and into the water I went and down I went and I thought my life was over and out of the depths comes this giant fish or whale swallows me up brings me down to the bottom and I thought I was running away from God I had left the presence of God and if you leave the presence of God you never know what calamity is going to come across you never know what's going to happen to you but I had left the presence of God and here I am in this in this whale stomach it was dark and terrifying there was seaweed around my neck neck and here I am and I cried out to God and he heard me and when I knew that God had heard me I said Lord one day I don't know how it's going to happen but one day I will again look towards your Holy Temple and I will again pray to that Holy Temple I had faith in God that he could deliver me down there for three days and three nights I was in the belly of the whale and my oxygen was running out and and my my death was upon me I was in the very belly of hell and yet God heard me fish swims up and spits me out on dry land came out smelling like whale vomit brother L brother Lionel you ever get whale vomit in your beard you can never get it out it just stays there forever it just it's smells bad it's gross you can't you can't get it out you never have don't it's terrible it is smelling and bad and and and then the Lord tells me again tells me the same thing that he told me at the beginning he said go to Nineveh and cry out to these people I I wish I would have done it the first time but now I go and I go to this place and I cry out to these people of neveh and I tell them that within 40 days God will overthrow this city and it felt good I was out there and I was I was prophesying against it and I figured here it comes brother Joe they're coming down and there these going to be these invading armies and they are going to overthrow this city but many times a prophet he will prophesy and he won't know the meaning of his prophecy he is just speaking in the name of the Lord he speaks it out Isaiah was a little bit before my time not much but he was a little bit before my time and do you remember when he prophesied a virgin sh conceive and bear a son you remember that that when Isaiah the prophet prophesied I can't speak for Isaiah because Isaiah didn't know him he was a little bit before me but I don't think he knew what he was saying I think it was the Holy Spirit speaking through his Prophet God's prophet and prophesying that this was going to happen so here I am and I was prophesying in the name of the Lord that 40 days and this city would be overturned overthrown and then the word gets to this filthy evil Governor or king of this city of Nineveh yeah it's going to happen to you man and you know what he did he repented and he said maybe maybe he didn't even know for sure he said maybe if we repent and we turn back from our evil ways maybe God will have mercy on us so he should a decree he said everyone fasts he said even the animals fast he said no one eats and everyone repents of their evil ways and everyone go back and I'm sitting there I'm like these people are sinners they're evil they're trash let them die but no they repented and they they changed their ways which is very odd to me think about Los Angeles think about the filth San Francisco or Las Vegas think about the filth that's there this Nineveh was like that I wanted it destroyed but God sent me there for a reason and now I'm there I go up on the hill and I sit down and it's hot sun's coming down the sun's beating down and if you're challenged on the top like I am you really know when the sun's coming down it's miserable built a little booth tried to get some shade and you know what God cared for me God loved me and there grew up this plant in the tender loving care of Jehovah it grew over my head to shade brother Manny bald head and it felt so good man I just love this plant that had grown and then night time came and a worm somehow got into this plant and by morning the plant was dead was dead [Laughter] sister Martha made that very well it was dead the Sun starts beating down on me and I was like Lord let me just die this is terrible I got the sun beating down and my my plant died I loved that plant it was it it grew up and it shaded my my head and Lord you gave me this plant and it was so nice and now the plant dead and I'm burning up in the sun Lord let me just die and sometimes brothers and sisters sometimes when that anointing will come upon you as It Came Upon me when the anointing leaves there's a depression that follows in a suffering and after I had prophesied in the name of the Lord to these people of Nineveh I came back and I just got down and I got sad and I got upset and then the Lord gives me this shade and then the worm takes it away and I love this PL I say Lord I this this is the best plant and now it's dead I just want to die just take me just kill me I don't want to be here anymore and then the Lord spoke to me Rabbi can you open your Bible up yes sir then the Lord spoke to me and he said you are more worried about this plant than you are about those 120,000 Souls that are in Nineveh he said is that right Rabbi can you read those last few few verses yes Jonah then said the Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou Hast not labored sorry which thou Hast not labored neither mest It Grow which came up in a night and perished in her night and should not I spare Nineveh that great City where in are more than six score, 120,000 persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle and us we have the end of my book and it ends with a question why are you thinking more about this gourd plant why is it more important to you than 120 Souls 120,000 Souls out there in Los Angeles I mean in Nineveh or Las Vegas or San Francisco and we think that and tucon we think that there are prophecies that are going to come there are prophecies from real prophets my prophecy that I prophesied said that 40 days in this this city would be overrun the Hebrew word Rabbi what is the Hebrew word oh give me a moment to look that up in my scroll son you appreciate our Rabbi amen this Hebrew word that I can't pronounce I'm sure I learned English and now I forgot my Hebrew oh we're wanting the over the overturned right overturned yes overturned okay I'm in I'm in the wrong place on this scroll it's these Scrolls I tell you I believe it's like uh maybe 3 seven yeah up up up up and it's I'm in the wrong it's it's three yes I'm in the I'm I I got the wrong scroll here over yes here we go when us rabbis get old we get slow the uh the the word is neet and it means to turn overthrow overturn to turn about to turn over to turn around to change to transform and here I am I am a prophet of God anointed by the Holy Spirit and I say 40 days and this city will be overthrown over what is the word again yes it will be kaak overthrown turned over I thought differently but it doesn't change the fact that I'm a prophet and I did prophesy and that city was overturned yes it turned from sin turned over to righteousness and then God had mercy upon that City and how many times just us brothers and sisters how many times have we thought of prophecies that were going to happen how many times have we thought that this world's going to burn according to Malachi how many times have we thought the prophet William brandom tells us that Los Angeles is going to sink how many times have we seen these things and do we want them to happen are we being a Jonah they're going to happen because they're prophets of God speaking these things but we should be crying out to the people that are there yes and asking for mercy and asking them to turn their ways as Jonah did and then maybe we can turn Souls maybe we can turn someone that is the worst of the worst and turn them into the best of the best as Jonah did Jonah's out there prophesying Nineveh didn't think anything was going to happen he thought they were going to be destroyed he leaves and God has Mercy because they repented and he goes down and he sits under the tree loved the plant more than he loved the people and that's the story of Jonah and that's the lesson behind this wonderful book this wonderful short four chapter lesson on Jonah we wonder why it's in there it's a wonderful story but it's not just to tell a story it's a powerful story a Supernatural story he was in the belly of the whale then Jesus's brother Lyall Rabbi Lyall Rabbi Johnson here as he said Jesus himself said as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so must the son of man be in the grave for that long Jonah is a very important prophetic book but it's also a good lesson judge not that you be not judged cry out to the sins of the world and then maybe they will repent I love what that King said what that King said was so beautiful he said you know maybe we don't know but possibly God would have mercy on us and he did and there was Rabbi Johnson was a 40 years later that Nineveh was finally destroyed it was 40 years later that they destroyed Israel oh that Nineveh came back and destroyed Israel yes and then in Nineveh was eventually destroyed another hundred years yeah the story of Jon Adam I'm going to pull on you one more time let's all stand Adam if you come up and um if you would close in prayer and also pray over the food okay oh before brother Adam prays over the food um can we show my picture this is this is this is a buddy of mine Brother Scott wnter he he he winners here sometimes Winters here but Scott wnter uh he his name is winter and he won the contest he beat me in the sides of the fish but this is a halet and this is what we're eating tonight for the fish [Applause] tacos let's bow our heavenly father we thank you for this story of Jonah that we

And how about you turn around and shake the hands of the ones you'll be spending eternity with and tell them you love [Music] them. and brother Lyall and the brothers, if you want to come forward and get ready to open the service in prayer and bring the prayer [Music] requests. Let's sing this song. He's Got it all in control. If you have a need this morning, he's got it all in control. Sing this. He's got it all. He's got it all in control. He's got it all in control. He's put that reassurance way down in my soul. He's got it all in control. I put my life in his hands. I put my life in his [Music] hands. I put my life in his. So every road, every road I walk down, it's in his plan. I've put my life in his hands. My father knows what I need. My father knows what I need. My father knows what I need. Everything I go through, he knows what's best for me. My father knows what I need. Does your father know what you need this morning? My father knows what I need. I need a lot. What I need is more of him. I need less of Lyall Johnson and a lot more of Jesus Christ. And we're just so grateful that we can be gathered this morning, April 6th, and together worshiping the Lord, uniting our hearts in prayer. We have one prayer request that's been turned in and a praise. Sister Hope asks for prayer for her dad, Brother David Puit. He's very sick with the flu. and from sister Amelia a praise. Thank you Lord for your many blessings and healings. I thank the brothers and sisters that made it possible for me to get another car. May God richly bless each and every one of you. I love you all. That's where we should be. Loving one another, doing our best to stand shouldertosh shoulder, to lend support, to give strength where we have strength, and to accept help when we need help. We're just I'm just in awe of him this morning. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Lord Jesus, it is such a privilege. It is such an amazing privilege to be gathered together with brothers and sisters in Christ. Lord, those that we'll spend eternity with and eternity with you together. Lord, I pray for this service this morning, Lord, that you'd continue to be present with us, accept our worship, accept our praise, Lord. And Lord Jesus, I pray for our pastor this morning as he brings the word, Lord, the lesson from the parables, Lord, that we take it to heart, Lord, that it would just become a part of the fabric of our being, Lord, as we draw closer to you and find ever more ways to please you, to make you happy. It's our desire, Lord, that you would look down with a smile on your face and say, \"Those are my children.\" Lord, we love you this morning. And again, we thank you for this privilege to be together. We ask that you bless the offering that's about to be taken, Lord, that it all be used in your service and according to your will. And we thank you again in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can all have your seats. We're going to sing that little chorus. He became me so that I might become him by grace. Nice and slow. He became me so that I might become him by grace. He became me so that I might become him by grace. He took my place. He took my place so that I through his love could take his. Yes, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Oh, he became me that I might become him by [Music] grace. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Are you thankful today? Oh, he took my place so that I through his love could take his. He became me so that I might become him by grace. Let's lift our hands and sing this again. Oh, he became me so that I might become him. Grace He became me so that I might become him. By grace he took my place. Oh, he that I through his love could take his. [Music] and he became me so that I might become him by grace. And a similar that song reminds me of another song we sing. And the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. Isn't that the truth? The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in [Music] you. With all life's frustrations, I need you. And I know I do. Cuz the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. Make this a prayer personal to him. Tell him this morning, the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. [Music] The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. With all life's frustrations, I need you. And I know I do. Cuz the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in [Music] you. With all life's frustrations, I need you. I know I do. [Music] Cuz the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in [Music] you. How many used to have the CD or the tape of Sister Green that she sang that song on? You can hear her sing it this morning. You know, when you sing and you and you talk to the Lord, he comes close. If we can make that personal, like we're really speaking to him, like he's really here, cuz he really is. He'll come near. And that peace you need is right there. Would you stand with me? And let's sing Gratitude. K of F. All my words fall [Music] short. All my words fall [Music] short. I got nothing [Music] new. How could I [Music] express all my gratitude? I could sing these songs. I could sing these songs as I often [Music] do. Every song must [Music] end and you never do. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a [Music] hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing [Music] hallelu. Let's sing verse one again. Brother [Music] Jordan, all my words fall short. I got nothing [Music] new. How could I express all my gratitude like you're talking to him this morning? I could sing these [Music] songs as I often do, but Lord Jesus, every song must end, and you never do. [Music] So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. Hallelu. And I know it's not much. I've nothing else fit for a king. [Music] Except for a heart singing hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I've got one response. I've got just one move. With my arms stretched wide, I will worship you. Oh, so I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing [Music] hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, come on my soul. Oh, come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song cuz you've got a lion inside of those lungs. Get up and praise the Lord. Oh, come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song.

God bless you. Welcome. Welcome to all of our visitors. We we love you and we we appreciate you coming. Today's a good day. Brother Josiah mentioned um Sister Green. If if you're new to the church, and many of you are, um Sister Green is uh was the wife of the pastor, the founding pastor of this church, um Reverend Perry Green. And uh there's many that are here, maybe half or so that are here that are um from Brother Green's ministry and they've stayed the storms and and continued on. And um also want to mention brother Green was converted under another man's ministry named William Brham and uh you'll hear me mention him every once in a while. And he was just a great great man of God also. He was the one that among other great things he started the the revival the healing revival in the United States in the 40s and 50s and it spread around the world. a great man. He was um my grandfather became close friends with them and they they heard they'd heard him minister and they William Brandon was a very gifted man, extremely gifted um and gifted in letting the the Holy Spirit really flow through him. and he had this gift that to increase the people's faith and he would the Lord would would really speak through him and and talk about how talk about personal things in people's lives that no no one ever knew and my family started going and in hearing him and following him around the country as was there was revival going on all over the country at that time there wasn't as many movies and television and and sports events like we have today. People would go to revival and there's just a a much more godly generation. My uh my family was in the service and my uh my dad who was the oldest in the family. He um he was sitting in um in the audience and his brother Jimmy, a young man, had was born with crossed eyes and I think he was two or three years old and he was um my my dad was just worried about him and he'd seen so many healings and and he saw his little brother with his with his eyes crossed and and he was bowing his said, and he said, \"Lord, help Jimmy's eyes. Lord, would you heal my brother's eyes?\" Can you imagine an older brother seeing his his his little brother there that can't see and that that has that eye problem and he he was asking the Lord and this man who he had never met before named William Brandham. My dad looked up. Brother Brandham was looking right at him and he said, \"Son,\" he said, \"God heard your prayers for your brother's eyes.\" He said, \"He'll be healed.\" Within within one day, my uncle Jimmy, my dad's brother's eyes straightened out. The Lord had healed the boy. The reason I'm telling the story is today's Brother Brham's birthday. April the 6th. And I uh you know, his his ministry has meant so much to me. And the last sermon that Brother Brandham preached before he got into a tragic car wreck and and died was a communion service and we are having communion tonight. So I thought I thought it was fitting to say a few words about brother Brandham. Um and uh and then also prepare for our communion service tonight where we take the uh the wine and the bread in honor of the Lord Jesus. We've been going through a parable series and I can't I uh every time I say, \"Okay, well, I'll move on to something else.\" And then I just another parable comes to mind and I I start reading about it and I start praying about it and I say, \"Oh, this is the best one yet.\" So, I just one more weekend and we'll stay in the parables and then maybe I'll move to something else after that. But we're back into our parables and Matthew chapter 13. And I really believe that this parable all of us know have heard these parables but when you really dig into them then you can apply them to your lives. Jesus, that was his ministry is telling these kind of stories. And what a parable is is you take something, Jesus takes something common that we see every day and he takes it and he teaches a lesson from it. So then every time that we see this thing that it will come back to our minds. Stephanie and I were out walking a couple days ago and I was talking about parables and the meaning of parables and I said like this prickly pair of cactus here and we were walking and there's landscaping um along the sidewalks and there was all these nice fat prickly pair of cactuses, you know, pretty purple ones and green ones and and they were doing really good. And then we go walking along and then we see this scraggly looking prickly pear that was all shriveled up and half of was laying on the ground and and I said, \"You see the difference between these and this one? These other ones are getting water and then this one over here, this cactus, it's not receiving any water.\" And that's how we should be. We should be watered by the word all the time. or else we will shrivel up and we'll die. And we want to continue on, always being in the word, always reading our Bibles, always praying, and then that water is just water in those roots. And that cactus swells up and it's healthy. But I tell you what, you take the water out and it shrivels up to nothing. That's what a parable is. And that's what Jesus he a lot of what was going on in that time was farming. So many of Jesus's parables were about farmers because that people would see this every day. Matthew chapter 13 verse 24. Another parable. Put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field. So remember from previous lessons, the the kingdom of heaven is God ruling over his subjects. To have a kingdom, you got to have a king and you got to have subjects. So this kingdom of heaven, we see that there's there's problems in these parables. So it can't be just in heaven. It's still God's kingdom, but we can be the subject of subjects of God here on earth and represent him. So the kingdom of heaven isn't necessarily eternity. The kingdom of heaven is both up there and it's also rep God representing himself through us here on earth. So again, we're talking about a farmer planting crops. We learned about in a pre in previous sermons and actually in this same chapter, we learned about a farmer who planted his seeds on the field. And those seeds, of course, they fell on the on the good soil, but then other seeds fell on the sidewalk and some and those just didn't ever sprout up. They they they just withered. They they they didn't have any moisture. And then others um fell among thistles and and other bushes and they they they came up a little bit but they didn't have a chance to grow because they were choked out by other plants. And then some fell on good ground and those are the ones that grew and bore fruit. So we've we've talked about that parable. Now we're going to talk about this new one. And this kingdom of heaven is likened unto liken unto a man that swed good seed in his field. But when the man slept, but while but while men slept, the enemy came and swed tears among the wheat and went his way. So someone who doesn't like this farmer snuck into his field and spread seeds of another plant that would cause damage. It was vandalism is what happened. And this was fairly common in Jesus's time. It was so common that there were actually laws and penalties specifically for this crime of sewing this bad seed in other people's crops. I mean, it wouldn't be like us playing a trick on somebody. Now, it's actually these people's livelihood. And uh these tears are not edible. In fact, they can be poisonous. So there were laws against this. This was something common. But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then then appeared the tears also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, \"Sir, did not thou sow good seed in thy field, from whence then hath tears?\" And he said unto them, \"An enemy has done this.\" The servant said unto him, \"Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\" But he said, \"Nay.\" He said, \"No, lest ye gather up the tears, you'll root up the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest.\" Very important part. Probably the most important part about this parable. Let both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, \"Gather ye together the f first first the tears and bind them into bundle bundles and burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.\" All right. So you sew this wheat, you you you sew the wheat, the wheat starts to grow. Then the the enemy comes in and he sews all of these bad seeds and then the people the workers out there, they see there's there's some sort of problem. Now, what do you think is the key to this part of the parable? Somebody, brother Aaron, what do you think the key to this is? There's a key that unlocks this. What do you think? Come on. You're a preacher. You got You got something. He's Yeah, he's teaching. Dan, what do you think? Huh? It's a parable. There's a key. There's a key to this. good. Yeah, he's he's separating the good and the bad. But there is a key that that I know you know that heaven is the field. You read forward. So, so yeah, that's part of it. But, but let me tell you, there's a key. Bearded Darnell, man. And he's like, \"Do I was going to say that next?\" Bearded Darnell. Does anybody know what it is? Who's this Darnell guy? No. Why does he have a beard? Okay, remember that you that's taking notes right now. Bearded Darnell. And I'm gonna we're gonna come back to this, but it's the key to the whole parable. Lionel's looking at me like, \"Man, you're crazy. [Laughter] Let's keep going. I'll come back to that. Another parable. So Jesus tells three parables right now. And then he comes back to this first one. So let's move on. Let's move forward on the scriptures. Another parable. put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and swed in his field, which indeed is the least of all the seeds. It's the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among the herbs, and and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air can lodge in the branches thereof. So Jesus is describing faith in another parable as this grain of mustard seed. So it's just just a tiny bit of faith can do great things. And here he's saying that this mustard seed, it's the smallest of all the seeds that all these planters, all these farmers plant, but it has the tallest crop. Bean seeds, you uh gardeners, bean seeds are big, you know, and even wheat seeds are fairly significant, but a mustard seed is tiny. And Jesus li Jesus likens the kingdom of God to a mustard seed. It's insignificant, the seed. And how many people, brothers and sisters, do I hear people tell me, \"I'm a sinner. I'm a nothing. I can't do anything. I'm a failure. What could the Lord do with me? You're just you're just a mustard seed, you know. Put some water on it. Plant it and you watch what happens. Mr. Miss mustard seed. It grows. So it's Moses when he met met the Lord met Jehovah at the burning bush. He said,\"Lord, I can't talk. I can't preach.\" God said, \"I'm the one that created your mouth. I'm the one that made you to speak.\" And then he sends a a a great preacher in Moses's brother Aaron to help him out. But it was God that was behind it. Moses may have been a mustard seed and he said, \"I can't I can't do anything.\" But God said, \"No, plant that mustard seed.\" And here's what Jesus is saying and it'll grow, but water it. Isaiah, one of the greatest prophets like Moses in the whole Bible, when he saw God there on the throne, he said, \"I'm a man of unclean lips and I live among people of unclean lips. Who am I?\" It was a mustard seed. And then he said, \"Lord, sent me. Send me.\" And it bloomed. And that's how it starts in your life. The Holy Spirit is a mustard seed that's planted in your heart. It may be ever so small. And it may lay dormant for years. It may be tiny now, but let it grow. Water it with prayer. Water it with the word. Water it with church. water it with good fellowship and watch that seed grow. And Jesus, he's saying that this you you you get down on yourself, but look at the size of these mustard seeds. And yet look what it turns into. And then he goes on to another parable. In another parable he spake unto them, the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took leavened is yeast. The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid three measures of meal till the whole was leaven. So she took a little bit of yeast and she put it in all of this flour. And we always think of levan as being a bad thing. And Jesus talks in Matthew chapter 16, I'll spend a few minutes on that. Jesus talks about levan and he is relating it to the levven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Matthew chapter 16 verse 6 it says this. Then Jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. So beware of this yeast from the from the priests that's being mixed into the bread. Verse number 11. How is it that you do not understand that I spoke it to you not concerning bread that you should beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees? Now he's going to tell them what it is. Then understood they how he bade them not to beware of the leaven of bread but the doctrines of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Tell you what, you plant those rough doctrines and it can ruin a congregation. It can ruin your life. And what was the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees? I mean, they were the priests. They said, \"We have Abraham to our father.\" They said, \"We believe Moses.\" All the rules and interpretation of the rules and all the traditions of the church, all the doctrines that harden the people's hearts. So when the truth of the Bible was manifested before them in the man of Jesus Christ, that leaven of the Pharisees, that doctrine that was in them, they turned down the Lord when he came. Pharisees, they in the form, their levan was in the form of these doctrines and it really ruined the people. Brother Brandham said this in 1963. He said, 'All that lived, he's speaking of the first coming of Christ. He said, 'All that lived right with the word, but they had formed their own way of it, and their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught it off of the real way. And they had made such an organization out of it till when the when the spirit tried to present the truth, they couldn't receive it. How true is that today? How true is that? It's the same thing today. How many churches have left the Bible, have left the teachings of Jesus Christ to following the teachings of a separatist sectarian theology? How many have left that they need to come back to Christ? We all need to come back to Christ. A brother told me that he had visited another church and he said, \"Nice people.\" He said, \"But man, I didn't understand anything that they were saying.\" I've been to the same I've been around. It's like, \"Wow, you know, is this Christianity or is this that Levan that has started to mix and has started to turn our eyes away from Jesus to something else. If someone comes into this church, a visitor and you don't know, someone that reads their Bible, someone that that has is is familiar with Jesus Christ and they come in here and they don't understand what I am preaching. It's a foreign voice to them. It's strange. What does that say about us? What does that say about people who who this this leaven starts going out and then they leave the very foundations of Jesus Christ and they go off into something else. That's really what happened with these Pharisees and Sadducees. They had gone into all of these different doctrines getting them from Moses the prophet and and all of these different doctrines and then it didn't even make sense. And then when the very Messiah came, he was so far off of what their doctrines meant, what their doctrines said that they didn't recognize him. But this parable that Jesus tell is telling right now, Levan is not a bad thing. It's it's He he's talking about that that this leavenan is a is a good thing in this in this parable that that we're going to continue on in Matthew chapter 13. Brother Lyle bakes bread. How would you like to bake bread without yeast? How would you like to have a pancake that that doesn't have at least it'd be a tortilla? You know how how would you like to have how would you like to have bread or or cake? Sister Lonnie made this cake yesterday. Oh man, it was awesome. And uh for for the um the the gathering that we had and it it was good, but imagine if you didn't have yeast in there. It would be this flat terrible thing. I was, by the way, I was cooking burgers yesterday and I got behind the line. So people were waiting and you know I was I was like man heat up grill go faster and I had all these people around me and now I know what a lamb feels feels like before it's about to get eaten by a pack of wolves. I was like you know I'll I'll finish I promise. Verse number 33. So, and another parable he spake he unto them, the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which the woman took and hid three measures of meal to the whole was leaven and the whole this this leaven was put in for a good thing or or they wouldn't the the the bakers wouldn't use it and that's how a church is or that's how any group of people is. You can put some lev some yeast in there. You can put some good stuff and the whole church will benefit from it. Even one person, one or two people when they come in, they can bring that spirit and it really all of us just rejoice over it. Or the same thing can happen with a negative spirit. You can bring in negativity and then everyone suffers. We can all We're all in influence. And these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables. And without parables spake he not unto them, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. He's referring to Psalm 78. Jesus fulfilled so many scriptures. I was talking um yesterday when uh when I was cooking uh there was a a guy I don't see him um named Jose that came uh he's a brother from Zion City Church and he was giving us his testimony. You were there and I think brother Jonathan was there also. I was listen brother Jonathan I think you were there listening to this man Jose's testimony and uh he was he said that all of these people he has seen they they preach all of these sermons about themselves or other things and they leave out Jesus. And then I asked him, I said, I said, \"Show me any sermon or any book or any chapter in the entire New Testament that's not about that one man, Jesus Christ.\" And then he went on and he said, he said, \"Brother,\" he says, he said, \"the entire Old Testament is about him too.\" And the brother started he started giving his own testimony and he talked about this thing. Do you remember when he said generational curses and how he had to overcome these curses that were in his life? He said his mother was a prostitute. His dad was a drug addict. And he said that's the life that he lived. went to prison and and all all of these things and that that had happened in his life. And I was as as he was speaking, I was looking at him and I was thinking, if I would have seen him 10, 15 years ago or whatever it was and the guy has tattoos up to his chin and his wife was looks the the same way, I would have thought there's no hope for this guy. But God knew who he was. and he saved this man. And now he's an usher in the biggest church in Tucson. Yeah. He's living for the Lord and testifying of the goodness of God that was that was in him. I I was at a youth camp I don't know probably 10 15 years ago and this young man named Fernando came in from California and he uh there was just nothing to that that young man and I I'd always want to talk with him and and try to talk about the Lord and and uh I got some time with him and I said to Fernando I said uh where you from. He told me where he's from in California. And I I said, \"Well, what are you here for?\" And he says, \"Ah, this girl in uh in the church signed me up to come.\" And I was like, \"Okay, all right, cool.\" You know, you having a good time? Yeah, whatever. And then uh then he says, um I said, \"So, what do you think about the Lord Jesus?\" He says, \"I don't know.\" He says, \"I don't I don't know if there's really a God or you don't know. It just never really resonated with me. I was like, \"Okay.\" And I I just kept talking and there was nothing. And it was like talking to a a a brick wall. And I went every way I could go down every road. And it was just dead end after dead end after dead end. And I was like, \"Lord, this there's nothing in this kid.\" And in my mind, it's like, well, there's the wheat and then there's the tears. There's the good and there's the bad. And there, this kid's really a zero. There's nothing to him. So, the the camp went on. We had a very emotional service where people were coming up to the altar and and crying out to the Lord and he sat in his seat, you know, looking around. I was like, Fernando, man, come on. enter in and he's just nothing. And then another service to close the camp, same thing. Nothing at about this kid at all. And then I didn't think about him after the camp. I was just like, well, the Lord blessed a lot of the youth. A lot of them, maybe some of them he didn't. Later on, I find out Fernando goes home. cuts all of his ties with all of his drinking buddies, with all of his partying buddies, accepts the Lord Jesus Christ as his savior, wants to live right. He says the my surroundings I I can't I can't live I can't live like this. gets up, moves, and then now he is serving the Lord and he's got a bunch of kids and a beautiful sweet wife and and just serving God. And I would have just cut him out. But God sees through these things. He sees things that we don't see. We look at the Apostle Paul, and I can relate to him. He was He was zealous, but boy was he hard. He was he was rough. And I look at my past and how doctrinal I was. Man, you got to see it this way. You got to only hear the pure, unadulterated word of God from the messenger himself. And all the rhetoric that we've heard so much, that was me. And it was here is how you do it. And then God got a hold of me and he changed me. That's how Paul was. This man Saul of Tarsus was later, his name was later changed to Paul. He was rough. He didn't want any of this new sect of Judaism. He didn't want them saying anything. He didn't want this, he wanted this stuff to die because it was hurting Moses's commandments. So, he comes against all of them. And there he is as a young man. And they cast this servant of the Lord Jesus Christ named Stephen. They cast him out of the town. They take up stones. And here is this defenseless young man named Stephen who had accepted Jesus Christ as his savior. And these priests and evil people, they pick up these stones and there is Saul of Tarsus saying, \"Do it. Do it.\" This is Moses's commandment for heresy. And they did it. And he watched them as they took those stones and they beat this man's head in until he died. And that zeal just started going up more and more in Saul of Tarsus. And he goes back and he says, \"Okay, that's starting to spread in this town of called Damascus. I'm going to get the letters from the Sanhedrin and I'm going to go and we are going to imprison all of these so-called Christians following this false Christ. We're going to imprison them and bring them back to Jerusalem in chains and either kill them or put them into prison. So, he gets the Sanhedrin, the the the priest. They sign the paper. Here you go. Saul of Tarsus. He's on his road out to Damascus and he is breathing curses to these Christians. It's flowing from him. The hatred is just swelling. And there he goes. Can you imagine how the people sought how the people thought of this man Saul, this evil man? And we'll learn if you read in the book of Acts that they were afraid of him. And there he goes. He's He's going along and he's still just breathing these curses out. And then God had a different plan. He was a mustard seed, man. God had a different plan. This light comes down from heaven. Heaven knocks him onto his back, blinds him, and says, \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\" Cries out, \"Who are you, Lord? And he says, \"I am Jesus who you're persecuting.\" Jesus was in heaven. So how could Jesus say, \"You're persecuting me. If you're persecuting one of Jesus's children, you're persecuting him. If you're persecuting one of Stephanie or my children, you're persecuting me.\" And he changed right there. He gets up. The people that were with him lead him into the town. He's there for three days and he doesn't eat. He doesn't drink. You imagine how Saul felt. He was just killing and wanting to destroy this group of people people. And over here now he's like, \"Whoa, this Jesus is right.\" God gives a vision to this other man. And he tells this man named Ananas he says in that same town he said he said uh go he comes to this man Ananas and says go to the street and to this man's house this certain man named Judas I believe his name was and ask for a man named Saul of Tarsus for behold he's praying wow even this evil man God was hearing his prayers and he says, \"I've already showed him a vision that you're coming. Lay your hands on him and he'll receive his sight.\" And Ananas knew exactly who Jesus was talking about because he said, \"Lord, wait a minute. This is a bad guy. Do you you know what he does, right? Talking to God. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. This is you know what he's done to all of the Lord's people and everyone who calls on the name of Jesus. This is that guy. Jesus responds to Ananas, go for Saul is my chosen vessel to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings as well as the pe the people of Israel and I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake. So Ananas goes to this man who we would have plucked out right there and Saul he calls him brother. He said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me that you might regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. And immediately what looked like scales fell off of Saul's eyes and he received his sight back.\" And he got up. And what do you think the first He hadn't eaten for three days or drank water. What do you think the first thing that Saul did when he got up and got his sight back? Yeah. He didn't eat. He didn't drink. He got baptized. And then after he got baptized, then he ate. What a great man. What would I have done? What would I have thought about this man Jose Hosea I met yesterday? What would I have thought of Saul of Tarsus? Same with Fernando. What would I have thought about these people? But God had something different. Now, we got to get to bearded Darnell. Who is this guy? Let's go back to um chapter 13, verse number 36 in Matthew. Yes. Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. This is after he had told them those three parables. And Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And his disciples came unto him saying, \"Declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field.\" They're like, \"Yeah, we understood the mustard seed thing. We understood that one and we understood the leaven, but that that parable that you told about sewing the different kinds of seeds in the field. Can you explain that one a little bit further?\" Let's go back and uh read Let's read it again. Go back to verse 24. Thank you. Another parable. put he forth to them, saying, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in a field.\" And when while the man slept, his enemy came and swed tears among the wheat and went and went his way. Then when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tears also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, \"Sir, does thou not sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tears?\" And he said unto them, \"An enemy hath done this.\" The servant said unto him, \"Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\" And he said, \"No.\" He said, \"Lest you gather up the lest while you gather up the tears, you root up also the wheat with them. Let them both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of the harvest, I will say unto the reapers, gather ye to gather ye together the first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn. Now skip to verse 37, brother Dan, where you were at before. Verse number 37 says this. He answered and said unto them, he that sweth the seed, the good seed, is the son of man. Jesus refer referred to him, this is very important. Jesus referred to himself usually as son of man. It means that he was basically born from the womb of a woman and he's a human being. It means that he was a man. Jesus wanted to be associated with mankind. He could have said he was a son of God. He did say he was the son of God once or twice, but he wanted to lower himself to be one of us. So he called himself son of man and he and he uh he was saying that basically I'm the guy that planted this field in the world. The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tears are the children of the wicked one. Now there's this good seed and there's the tears. What do you think the tears are? I always thought that they're like this sticker bush and if you go in and you pull out one of the weeds that you pull out the roots of the of the good plants. That's not what he's saying. That's what I've always thought my whole life that that's what it is. When I was in living in Jeffersonville, I I planted I I used to like my garden and I would plant rows and the first time I planted my garden, I planted like mustard greens and beans and kale and spinach. Well, this row right here, I watered them and in a couple days some clover started coming up. And clover is like the stuff in the grass, you know, and it it popped up and I was like, man, I started picking it out. How did the clover seed already get into my garden? All these weeds already. So, as time went on, a couple days and more and more came and I kept picking them out and picking them out. And then I noticed, wait a minute, this clover's growing in a row. I was picking my mustard greens because they looked just like clover. Bearded Darnell is exact it's it's a type of wheat and it looks exactly like wheat. If you show a picture of of what it is, on the left is wheat and on the right is Darnell. So they look almost exactly and when they're young, when they're little, you can't tell the difference at all. Even an expert can't tell the difference. So Jesus is saying that if you go and you pick it out, that you're going to pick out the good stuff, too, because you don't know. You can't tell what's good and what's bad. Remember Jose? Remember Fernando, the Apostle Paul? You don't know what's good and what's bad. So just let it grow until it matures. The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tears are the children of the wicked one. So what a as it grows, as this wheat and these tears grow, as this darnell and this wheat grow, it when it gets mature, then you are able to tell a difference. Because why? Because it's fruit that it's bearing. It bears wheat. a wheat plant will come up and bow its head full of that seed. The Darnell just shoots straight up and it it's it's sitting there right there. And even the seed is poisonous. So when this enemy of this man spread this seed, he was not only vandalizing the guy's crop, but it could have also poisoned his family. A very, very, very evil thing to do. And the enemy that swed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels. So Jesus says, \"You don't do it because you don't know. Leave it to the angels when they come at the end.\" And they're going to bind the good and they're going to bind the bad. As the tears, as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of Man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all of the things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace. There shall be wailing and nashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the kingdom of their father, who hath who hath ears to hear, let him hear. So not notice the master of the field told the workers, don't pull it up because you might pull up the good seed. And the reason he said that is not because the roots are tangled together. It's actually good when you pull a weed out of your garden. It kind of airates the soil and and loosens it up so that that plant can can dig down deeper. And that that weed is is competing for the the nutrients. It's competing for what what the the soil has and and the the Bible says that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. So, as the rain is falling on this fake wheat and this real wheat, they're both rejoicing over the presence of the Lord. They're both getting something from God. They're both growing because of this these nutrients in the soil and this rain and the sunshine. But when they mature, one has good fruit and one doesn't. One group will be burned with fire and the other group will enter into the kingdom of of God. And then Jesus makes the statement. He says, \"Whosoever has ears, let him hear,\" which means all of us. And this parable has been read over and over and over. And Jesus saying these things like everyone should be listening to me. And as you're thinking about this parable and as we are thinking about it as we get older, are we maturing? Are we maturing in God? And the realization of who we are, is that really manifesting itself? Am I becoming more like Christ? Am I becoming more holy? Or are you becoming more like the world? Are you looking more like the world as you get as as you as you grow older? Are you acting more like the world? The wheat, brothers and sisters, the wheat didn't have a choice where it was planted. God just planted it there. He planted us here and we are maturing and the weeds are maturing. This wheat, it's a it's a parable. So, it's not he he's teaching us a lesson, but this wheat didn't have the opportunity to change. It was wheat. It was born wheat. It grew up wheat. And neither did the tear have the opportunity to change. But we do. And that's the wonderful thing about the gospel. Jesus says, \"Have faith.\" Jesus tells us to believe. All the prophets tell us to believe. And if we are to believe, then we have a choice to make. And we choose this or we choose that. And the choices that we make really prove who we are. And there's a new birth that changes. It can change a tear into a wheat. It can change us. But I had to make the choice. You have to make the choice. Am I going to be something that's just fruitless that's going to be gathered and burned or am I going to be a wheat something that helps other people something that's a blessing to others? We have that choice. the musicians can come and we're close. A bearded Darnell that sorry I thought you'll never forget it. [Laughter] It's a um it's it's actually it's it's got a a lot to it, but it was common for people to do this back in Jesus's time. and to ruin crops. And it wasn't until recently that a combine now can separate the different seeds between wheat and this false wheat. And that's really that's how God's combines are. That it can grow up together and then let God sort it out. There's friends, there's it's not up to me to sort even as a pastor of the church. So many pastors try to do it. They say you are and you aren't. It's not up to me to sort it out because so many people would be if it was up to us, how many people would be lost and just say, \"No, that person there's no hope for that person.\" And then that person turns out to be one of the finest Christians you've ever met. One of the most influential people in the whole Bible was the Apostle Paul. You know his name was Saul of Tarsus. Jesus called himself son of man really because he wanted to be associated with the human race. Saul of Tarsus his name was changed to Paul which is the Roman name, the gentile name. for Saul because he wanted to be associated with that group of people. He wanted to grow among them. He wanted to he loved them. And that's why his ministry was the most successful really in history is because of how much love that he had. And he didn't separate. He just let them all grow together. And boy, there was a lot of wheat in his ministry. Brothers and sisters, there's wheat in this building and there's Darnell. Every every congregation has both. And it's up to you if you want to make the choice. Lord, I want to be a wheat. I want a new birth. I want to change this person that I used to be. I want to change it into this Christian that I hear preached from the pullpit that I read in the Bible. I want to change it to that person. God already knew the decision that you were going to make. He's the one that called us and we many of us answered that call. God bless you, brother Josiah. [Music] Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bit me. Come to thee, oh lamb of God. I come. I come. That verse again. Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me, and that thou bid me. Come to thee, oh lamb of God. I come. I come. You know the ministry of the great evangelist Billy Graham. He would close a sermon very often, I'd say usually with this song. And how many millions of people came to the Lord Jesus Christ from this song that was calling them just as I am. Poor, wretched, blind. Think about Paul. Just as I am. And there Paul is laying there. Poor, wretched, mean-spirited and blind. And yet God had mercy on him and turned him into one of the greatest servants in the world. Friends, he had mercy on Paul. He had mercy on me. He had mercy on you. Let that mustard seed, let it bloom. Let it sprout. Because if you do, you have no idea what God can do. He can do great things with all of us. But if we got to we just we got to make that decision first. Lord, I give my heart to you. I stand with you, God. Whatever you require, I'll do it. Saul of Tarsus, he had that attitude once he knew that Jesus was in fact the Christ. And if we will do the same, friends, there's no telling what God will do. We're in this field of the world. We're not going to change the whole field. It is what it is. But we can have an influence just like that leaven in that that bread. We can have a le we can have an influence on the whole loaf. And I want to do it just as I am. Just as I am. For [Music] wretched blind, sight riches, healing of the mind. Yay. All I need in thee to find all of God I come. I come just as I am in waiting not. [Music] just as I am and waiting not to rid it my soul of one dark blood to thee whose blood can cleanse each God, oh lamb of God, I come. [Music] That verse again, just as I [Music] am, waiting on to my soul. of one dark. To thee who blood can cleanse each [Music] fall of God I come. [Music] Worship him. When he calls you, come and say, \"Lord, here I am. Send me, Lord. Lord, water that that seed that's in me, Lord. Change me. Change me from a weed to a wheat. And never never look around you and judge anyone else and think that they are not that pure wheat of God. Even though they might look like something else, God can change them. He changed you, Manny. He changed me, Lionel. He changed you. He's changed He's changed so many of us. changed us from well the person that I was to the person that I am. And the best thing about it with me, he ain't done. There's a whole lot more of growing. And that weed's going to keep blooming. It's going to keep coming. Let's Let's all stand and sing it again. Brother Josiah. Just as I am, thou wilt receive will dwell, cleanse, relieve because thy promise I Believe oh lamb of God I come. I [Music] come. My chains are gone. I've been saved. Praise God. Thank you Lord. My God, my Savior has ransomed [Music] me. And like a flood his mercy raise, unending love, amazing grace. I was speaking to a young man yesterday and I was talking about the Lord and he said, \"Well,\" he was talking to me about all the rules and regulations and all that in the churches that he's been to. And I said, \"Brother, let me tell you something.\" I said, \"When you truly accept Jesus Christ as your savior, those chains are gone. There is liberty and freedom in Jesus Christ. You mis you misunderstand. There is liberty and freedom in Jesus Christ. And it's the world and Satan that binds us. It may he may work through he may work through addiction. He may work through your church. But God sets us free. Amen. The liberation of Jesus Christ. One more time. Amen. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. Was blind but now I It was grace. It was grace that taught my heart to fear. and grace my fears relie. Praise God. How preious did that grace appear the hour I first believe. My chains are gone. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransom [Music] me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace. Are your chains gone? If they're not, you have the opportunity to drop them right here. Then you can leave them in this church. We'll throw them away. You never have to put them back on. That's the liberty of Jesus Christ. Bow our heads. [Music] If there'd be anybody here, man, woman, young lady, young man, or child that would want to give your heart to Jesus Christ and shed the chains of the world, now would be a good time. Our father, you know the hearts of every person here. Lord, you know our needs. You know our faults. And Father, you know if we're a weed, if we're a wheat or if we're a tear. Father, I can't help believe that every soul in this building here is a wheat. Father, bless each one, I pray. And if there would be Lord someone that you're working on their hearts, I pray that they would receive what you have for them. May the Holy Spirit enter into that person or those people. Go with us, Father. Prepare our hearts. We pray for our communion service tonight. May it be pleasing to you in Jesus name. Amen. The Lord has promised good to me. His word, my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy brings unending love, amazing grace. is the earth. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow. The sun forbear to shine.

that I appreciate and I've said this before and I I said it last weekend about brother Ryan the thing I appreciate brother Ryan is I don't believe that his understanding of this book is in any way swayed by any type of a narrative or any type of a u trying to fit the mold of a certain type of preacher and I think that's why brother Ryan is such a blessing is because he is going straight to the author amen and he is blessing us with his understanding and with his revelation of this word so let's stand as I introduce my friend brother Ryan brother [Music] Josiah thank youate can use me Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me take my heart take my life as a Living Sacrifice and though my dreams all all my plans Lord I place them in your hands I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can my life is not my own my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you I give myself away just sing it to him if you [Music] [Applause] would I give myself away I Give Myself Away so you can use me let's just bow our heads as they continue to play that this morning I truly believe it's each one of our desire to be used by God to be a part of God's kingdom to be part of his economy and to be used by him in whatever way he sees [Music] fit the song is very approp roate we have to give oursel away in order to do that I have to give up my ways I have to give up my thoughts I have to give up my actions so I can take on his and Lord we come to you this morning not Lord with our ability Lord if we have any ability Lord would you just take that and set it to the side Lord help us to surrender that to you lord lord if we have our own ways and our own thoughts of being a Christian Lord being a person Lord worthy of your love let's set that aside this morning Lord would you help us do that and Lord would you just open your word to us this morning Lord yes amen not only just open the word but may it become a personal word not yesterday Lord but today a personal word today Lord for every heart Lord that wants to hear

morning amen Lord we worship you and we praise you Lord would you just inhabit our Praises now this morning in Jesus name amen just appreciated that song brother Josiah just uh just seems like it was the right song at the right time and really appreciate you the church here in Tucson and want to say good morning to you and God bless you and ask if you're just feeling all right this morning you know and and if if you're not feeling right and I I I seem to ask this all the time when I'm at home but you came to the right place if you're not feeling right if you're feeling down if you're feeling a little beat up you came to the right place this morning if you're feeling good you came to the right place this morning and if you're not feeling like a Christian sometimes I I don't know if you ever feel that way um I'll just be honest I do um this is the place to be this morning you know maybe when you don't feel like being here the devil will tell you you need to go somewhere else you're not you're not worthy to maybe even come in the doors you ever gone through that before I might be the only one brother Dan you ever feel like you're not worthy to even walk in the doors of a church because of something you thought something you did something you said that's just the devil trying to keep you right from a change from deliverance from something to take that that thought or whatever it might be from you and set it aside and and I I'm I'm so glad that you came this morning maybe despite what you have going on maybe despite what you feel you came this morning and and uh I certainly came here despite what I felt despite what I think and and I'm counting on the Lord as much as you are counting on the Lord maybe a little bit more maybe just I think a little bit more and I appreciate brother Dan as always is definitely definitely a true friend um just appreciate and love the people here in Tucson um so good to be here thank you for the invitation as always brother Dan um to those that that put in all the work last night I know you're standing a little bit and if that's okay I just want to take the time to thank those that that put in time yesterday set up the sound set up uh the the electrical the those that were practicing here for the last few days um the sisters and and that put it together the food and serve that it you know maybe somebody may not notice it but God notices it and I certainly notice it and I want to say thank you for that effort it it it just means so much and you just never know what a little action might do for somebody you know somebody might just come off the street and hear something and it it didn't come from a preacher right I say that again it didn't come from a preacher it came from a Believer but I'll tell you this you are all able-bodied men ministers you are all Ministers of the Gospel you may not stand behind this little 3-ft section of wood right here but you're a minister correct and what I saw last night was a Ministry I just wanted to say thank you I appreciate it it it was definitely a blessing and I hope that you continue it uh we'll read a scripture I know you've been standing for a little bit and um I just wanted to settle my nerves a little bit um you know just I I would ask you to say a little extra prayer for me this morning Lord just take these uh this nervousness away give me the right words to say that are his words you know I have notes and have scriptures but brother Dan as you know you just come up and you say Lord I want to surrender even these notes that I have even these scriptures to you may you just say what you want to say this morning let's turn to Matthew and we'll just move forward and trust in the Lord this morning how many how many came to receive something this morning all right so that's the best sign I could ask for right there because then I don't have anything to do with it I don't have anything to do with it the Lord's GNA use whatever instrument or whatever speaker he wants to to get to you if you have an expectation and if you have an expectation strong enough to raise your hand you say it's just raising my hand well the word says that that could be the difference between you going to heaven and going to hell it's just raising your hand up because you know what it is it's the song we just sing it's a lord I Surrender and I'm going to show you that I Surrender and that's what I got have to do as a minister that's what you have to do is sit and where you're at if we do that there is no telling what God could do in our presence today on there there there is not a soul that's low enough that he can't pull up to literally say you will be with me in Paradise today and and I'm that Soul I'm that Soul let's turn to Matthew 5 this is uh I I just I don't want to talk to you about anything new this morning I don't have anything new I just have what the Lord put on my heart it's it's a scripture I think I mean I think there's people who recite this scripture maybe don't even know it's from the Bible but I but I still want to read this scripture because it's what the Lord put on my heart this morning Matthew 5:13 Jesus is preaching a Sermon on the Mount maybe the most famous sermon ever preached and in the middle of it he says you ye are the salt of the earth and I want to tell you this morning that if Jesus was standing here preaching to you he would tell you you are the salt of the earth correct amen and and I don't I don't want to I don't want to break this down too much but it does not say you will become the salt of the earth brother Daniel I want you to try to be the salt of the earth this morning that's not what it says it says you are present tense the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his Savor wherewith shall it be salted what a question it is thenceforth good for nothing to be cast out and be trodden Under Foot of man and I want you to notice this next to me he says you are the light of the world now now think about this Jesus himself God in flesh is standing before a multitude of people and and brother Dan I would expect him to say now I am the light of the world but Jesus instead under in insiration says you are the light of the world while he yet stood there before them and maybe that's just you say well that's just the way it was written if we could just grab a hold of how Jesus was thinking and what he meant by that I think it would change our lives you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you may be seated I I just love to take these little scriptures and I just read past them I'll just be honest sometimes I just read right over them brother Aaron and and and you know somebody else will read it and I thought I didn't even know it said it that way if I just we just take the time and slow down and examine each one of these words he says let your light shine amen okay I I I just I just want to start with this do you believe that that these words that we just read come from God right that there's no trick question not right here do they come from God okay is God does God know what he's talking about amen this is good this there easy questions does God lie no okay so when God says something does he mean it yes okay that's good so then do are you the salt of the earth that's good it's sometimes it's a little bit quieter but it's still there are you the light of the world do you feel like [Laughter] it right I mean sometimes I do sometimes I don't amen that's the truth for me sometimes I do sometimes I don't and and I I want to I want to go into what the word says because you think okay sometimes I do sometimes I don't I must be a make believer I must be a doubter I must be this I must be that because if I don't feel like it all the time there must be something wrong right but does God lie does God know what he's talking about when God says something does he mean it yes okay then it doesn't matter I know this is just so so basic and rudimentary it doesn't matter how I feel if God is not a liar and God knows what he's talking about then I can look myself in the mirror and say you are you're you're no good you're no good but yet God is not a liar God knows what he's talking about and God said that I now I can't claim it for you this morning that something that that that that not even God can do for you is make a choice did you know that you know the I want to I don't want to get ahead of myself here but but when God asks you or tells you to do something in the Bible you know that he is there to do that for you we'll we'll I'll read you scripture for it but there's one thing that God cannot do for you and that is make a choice because if God could make you make a choice then it's not a choice if God could make you love him then you're not choosing to love him you're just you're just you're a train on a track and there's nothing you can do about it God puts before you a choice between good and evil between him and not him amen and we make that choice now when I come to that decision what are we going to do I think all of us will say well I choose God right I choose God but then hard time set in right hard time set in and then we start to question did I really choose him or even worse did he really choose me there's another scripture with this is similar and I just wanted to talk to you a little bit this morning about Salt and Light and there's a scripture this this this is the one I think we all know you're the salt of the earth but if the the salt has lost its Savor brother brother Brandon mentions this many times but over in Luke um and not to say that contradict but I just kind of like another perspective of this and Luke is talking about this same scripture if you want to write it down you want to turn to it's Luke 1434 and he says salt is good but if the salt has lost his Savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dungill but Men cast it out and he says now if you have ears listen to what I'm telling you and and you know all the maybe the sermons I've heard about salt and and things they they talk about salt being a seasoning amen a seasoning that if you put a little bit of salt in in maybe a food if you put a little bit of salt in a situation it changes that situation and I believe that if you take just a little bit and sprinkle it here and you know maybe sometimes uh if you've ever heard a sermon on salt you you kind of like liken yourself to the salt and you say if if I just place a few Christians here and there it will make things better and that is true but there's so much more to what Luke is saying here about salt he says that if the salt lost its Savor that it's neither fit for the land or the dungill and if you really start to look into that and you start to to to study that a little bit salt has more uses than just a seasoning what they used it for in this time I'm I'm not a historian I won't I won't go into anything I probably get fact checked brother Dan but but you could look this up they use salt they had a they had a source for it the Dead Sea and the reason why it was so valuable is they actually used this salt as in their Gardens and in their plants and if you take salt I'm I'm not a chemist but if you take salt there's anybody ever heard of potash okay s in the Bible that is salt potassium chloride and they would use it because it actually promoted the growth of plants Hallelujah when they took salt now you would not think if you put salt on Plants it would do something but in this form if you took salt and you put it on your plants in your garden in your trees life would come forth to God gives you maybe another view of salt right now now what did he say in the first scripture you are what you're salt how many is that all right we got there was less hands but it was we got a few hands how many is salt am does God know what he's talking about does he lie okay so if he says you are the salt of the earth let's figure out what salt does and and I know I know maybe what you're thinking because it's the same thing I'm thinking brother the more you describe what salt does the less I feel like salt right oh salt does that too well I don't know if I do that but it's so beautiful because God doesn't say try to be this right you know maybe work on becoming salt what he's telling you is that you as a Believer how many can say you know what despite all my struggles despite all my doubts and despite my unbelief I'm a Believer that's in the Bible I I Lord I don't know what it is I I fail every day but I believe you okay then if you do that and you truly mean that then God is trying to tell you that you already have in you the ability to do this correct you already are the salt of the earth amen now I want you to notice he didn't say you were the Earth you are the salt of the earth and salt has another property it says here so in one sense the effect of salt is that it it causes life to grow yes and I'm not making a stretch of that that's literally the use for it but it says here it's not fit for the land if it lost its ability and the other thing it's not fit for is the D hill now you could say what is that for but you actually look up that word that is that is not the manure pile we're just going to get a we're just going to get a little bit country this morning that's that's the restroom and what they would do is they would take they would have a area where they where where the restroom was at and when they were when they were done they would take salt and they would spread it over that area because what salt did is it killed anything that was corrupt anything that was bacteria anything that was toxic the salt would would inhibit the growth of that and if salt has lost its Savor it's neither fit to inhibit the growth of something bad or to promote the something good does that make a little bit more sense now what it's it's salt well brother I just want to be I just want to be salty yes but what does that look like what does it look like to be salty what is it what is it actually to be the salt of the earth and and and if we believe that these words from God and we believe that he's saying something true but we don't quite feel like the salt and where is the problem at right and anybody that has any humility you would you any Speck of humility you would read that you are the salt of the earth you are the light of the world and if you had a little bit of humility you would say I just don't know if I'm in that place right now am I'm struggling with this I'm struggling that I'm supposed to be the salt I'm supposed to be the light of the world and yet sometimes I can't even be a light into my own path path wow I can't even see where I'm going and I'm supposed to be the light for somebody else am and what is happened when we have these thoughts what has happened in that moment when you think that it's because you think and I think we have something to do with it Hallelujah right there we think that it's because of my ability that I'm going to be the light to the world because of my ability that I'm going to be salty but salt is just salt it is what it is it doesn't have to try to be salt it doesn't have to try to be turn into salt it just is salt amen and I think the mistake that I make a lot of times and I don't know about you but the mistake I make is trying that's it is trying am I saying go do nothing am I saying just go out into the world go do whatever you feel like until God does something with you well there's people that have tried that in the Bible and the ones that belong to God got turned around real quick now that can happen but I'm also telling you that if you feel if you think and you believe that you are not doing what God is supposed to be doing maybe stop trying to do what God wants to be done and let God do it this song I Give Myself Away Hallelujah means that you don't have anything to do with with it Hallelujah it means that your ability is exactly what is getting in the way of God's ability sometimes we try to be the salt of the earth and just end up the Earth amen and and the problem can't be with God right does God know what he's talking about yeah he does know what he's talking about and I think sometimes this translate over that that we we think that we have to do something in order to receive God into our hearts now I know this is n just for the young people today but I I but I know that they are sitting up here and it's maybe it's for everybody but I but I want to talk to the young people because I want to tell you this that the young people today are special and I want to I want to read you something if it's okay I didn't I didn't really I didn't know if I wanted to read this or not just wanted to make sure that the time was right but my wife had sent me this years ago and I've never ever forgot it and I've kept it you mind if I just read this little thing she sent me and it's not only to you young people but it's to the parents that have children which I need to hear I I need to hear Brother Kurt because I'll tell you I'll be honest sometimes I have a fear for my own children I fear what's going to happen to them I fear what they're going to be around that's not of God the only reason I'm afraid is because I'm trying to do something out of my own ability for my children God says this don't feel sorry or fear for your kids because of the world they're going to grow up in now I don't know about you but I can look I can I can look at the world today and think it is so evil it is so bad this is 10 times worse than when I was a young person maybe a hundred times worse mostly because of this right it's not just the young people that struggle it it's adults too but because of this this little thing is oh I I can't even I don't know if you've ever said this I can't even imagine being a young person today and you know the truth is that's right because you weren't meant to be a young person today you know who's meant to be a young person today right here you can raise your hand you were meant to be a young person today in this generation why because you were made for it brother Dan I wasn't made to be young person in 2024 and God knows that that's why he had me a young person in in the '90s and the 80s amen but but our youth today are special because God made them to withstand The Temptations of today that's correct he made them to be salt when it seems like you cannot be salt he says God created and called them for the exact moment in time that they're in amen you think how am I going to I don't know if you think this as a young person how am I going to live in this I want you to know that God made you able to overcome this time when Maybe somebody else could not have done it and I want to tell you this you are the first generation that's going to overcome this age because the last generation had their age to overcome and you can glean from them and you can ask them for wisdom but you you are as the Bible says a chosen generation you are a generation that for the first time will overcome this evil age their their life it says wasn't a coincidence or an accident raise them up to know the power that they walk in as children of God train them up in the authority of his word yes amen teach them to walk in faith knowing that God is in control yes I meant to start a timer brother Dan I'll take I'll take a couple minutes off of it I know you didn't ask me to I just realized I I was meant to start when teach them to walk in faith knowing that God is in control Empower them to know that they can change the world you say I can't this world is is is lost I believe this world is lost but I I I was talking to my son maybe a week or so ago and I said I H I've had the wrong mentality for for quite a long time and the Lord corrected me through a a minister you might none of you would know him but a minister that came and spoke with us and the Lord just straightened me out I used to have the mentality of you know what this world is lost this world is doomed there's nothing we can do to save it just let it go I know that sounds awful when I repeat it to you but that's what I was thinking you know what you can't save the political world you can't save America you can't say it's turned its back on God all these things and then I got straightened out by a minister who said well we still have families that live here we still have communities that we can take we still have cities that we can take we still have states that we can take because God has not losten and I have this I have this mentality that that God just lost and not lost but you know the world is this and we have another kingdom but I live here now I live here now and I'm not going to be defeated in this world and then maybe go to the next World and I'll have Victory there we are going to be a Victorious people here I'm not going to be amen I believe that I'm not going to be the salt of the earth in heaven I'm going to be the salt of the earth here I'm not going to be the light of the world in heaven no the lamb is the light there where do I need to be the light H I need to be the light right here and there there there's there's people there's families who are struggling and they need to hear about Christ and to have this mentality that I had of well the world is just going to to Hell in a hand basket that's not the mentality of a Believer the believer has a mentality you know what I don't care if if 99.9% of the world is against me I'm going to go out and I'm going to witness about God because if I can turn just one person to him it's worth it and I'll tell you it's worth it because you were that one person corre that somebody took the time to tell you about God oh I was born in a message church so was I and I still had to hear about God I still went out and did whatever I wanted to do and still had to come to God you can change the world now this is not a a a you know a raw just get your motivation up this is the truth God knows what he's talking about God knows what he's doing and when he says it it means something amen it's not just God saying okay I'm going to Rally them up so they'll feel good no no you're going to come you're going to come to a test yes amen and God and the kind of God that I serve is going to be there in that test and say just step to the side give yourself away just a little bit and watch me go to work don't teach them to be fearful and disheartened by the state of the world but hopeful that they can do something about it every person in all of history has been placed in the time that they were because of God's Sovereign plan correct he knew now I love this now he knew Daniel could handle the Lion's Den that's correct amen oh Daniel poor Daniel he got plac no no he put him exactly where he needed to be because he equipped Daniel to be able to handle that how much more you amen how much more are you amen sometime do you feel like Daniel sometimes no not you you're actually Daniel do you feel like Daniel in the Bible sometimes do you feel like you can handle Lions Den sometimes I do sometimes I don't he knew David could handle Goliath he knew it's funny I had this down brother brother Dan he knew Esther could handle hymon you want talk about you know sometimes I think our sisters get left out a little bit right we have all these examples in the Bible but God used Esther God used Ruth God used Rahab God used women all through the Bible and and and you're and there's no there's no lesser amen it's all through the Bible amen he knew Peter Peter could handle persecution he says and he knows your child can handle whatever challenge they face in life he created them for it don't be scared sced for your children but be honored now this is for us parents don't be scared for your children or your grandchildren whoever it might be but be honored that God chose you to parent the generation that is facing the biggest challenges of our lifetime rise to the challenge it says raise David's raise Esther's raise Ruth's that's that's what we have to do as parents and we don't do that by telling them stay away from the danger ous things amen there's there's something else there's something else about salt that just it's just so beautiful salt has and this is you can find this is not my words this is right in the message salt has no effect unless it comes in contact with something man says this you have a piece of meat here and a barrel of salt here I imagine he was doing this and you've got to get them together the salt to the meat or the meat to the Salt to preserve the meat that's the way it is now if you don't you don't hear anything else I'm going to tell you listen to this sentence we've got to get the believer with the unbeliever yes sometimes that just sometimes I I think sometimes we hear no no we just need we need do we believe in assembling together yes we do but sometimes assembling together just becomes an assembly correct am we just become another assembly we assemble ourselves together so that you can regroup so that you can re-calibrate so that you can heal so that you can come together to go out and be salt to the Earth because salt in a group salt in in a container in a box doesn't do any good to anybody as powerful as it is the ability to promote life the ability to destroy evil does no good as long as it's in the Box amen I know this is so simple that you brother that's what you're preaching on is salt but but yet we have the ability to do this and sometimes we go I'm just going to I'm just going to be with those who think like I do who believe like I do well then I'm sorry but but but salt isn't doing anybody any good amen the salt has to come in contact with that thing that needs the salt in order for it to change it even has to come in contact for you to recognize that what God was saying was the truth because you can think oh God tells the truth and then God says yeah but you're the salt of the earth well well I think brother Dan's the salt of the earth amen that's not what he said he said you were the salt of the earth and I think sometimes we need to actually see this working in our lives we need to go out and actually be salt in order for us to go wow God know really knows what he's talking about yes because we're we're never going to say God doesn't know what he's talking about and yet do we go and do what he says there there's a disconnect somewhere and why oh I don't have the ability you don't need the ability you have one thing to do amen you have to choose amen that's the only thing I I I want to tell you this there's not one thing in the Bible that God asks you to do or tells you to do or commands you to do that he doesn't then come and give you the ability to do did you know that it's so beautiful the Bible says this I wrote down some examples he says the Bible says to have faith amen hallelujah right we I mean that's like the basis of our of our Christianity is our faith the Bible says have faith faith is the only thing that will please God and I don't know maybe it's just me but sometimes I find myself Lord I don't know if I have faith for this or I'm trying to I'm trying to have faith think about that statement I'm trying to have faith but if we search out the Bible it says that he delivered the faith unto the Saints that's corre so he tells you to have faith and then says oh by the way I came and I brought it to you it's my faith exact I want you to have my faith because my faith in my word doesn't fail amen he says the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you am right anybody ever have any trouble resisting the devil amen I'll raise my hand amen amen the word says that if you have problems resisting the devil brother bam says then you don't have the resistor capital r inside of you yet you can go look it up he tells you to resist the devil but he's the one who comes in and resists the devil GL to God it's not my ability amen the Bible says to seek Him search it out though and he says you can't even seek him unless he seeks you first amen the Bible says to love oh that's a hard one it's easy to love those that you like it's easy to love those you get along with it's easy to love those you agree with and the Bible says to love even your enemy but then the Bible says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon you he tells you you need to have love and it says by the way I gave you the love that you need to have so if you're doing it it's because I'm doing it yes the Bible says to confess him when the Bible says that if you confess him before man he says I'll confess you before the father there's not one thing that God asks you to do that he hasn't already done and is going to put in you the ability in fact he's already put the ability in you because you are not going to be the light of the world you are the light of the world and what do you have to do you have to choose he says we've got to get the UN believer and the believer together that's right you've got to get them into the church into the salty bunch of people you know salt makes a thirst doesn't it and if you eat salt you get thirsty and God wants his church so salty till the whole world will thirst to be like them just think oh if I can only live the way that woman lives she if she ain't the most sweetest peaceful person never out of humor never fussy she's always kind trying to do something to help somebody else why she's a credit to any man's Church yes sir that man's used he's he's a neighbor he's a gentleman he's just so full of the love of God you can see him at all hours of the night on his knees somewhere praying it's time to check up it's time to check up this morning he's always ready to do something he's always talking about the Lord and his Mercy that's the way to make the world salty you do not become you do not have an effect on the World by being like the world salt has an effect on the World by being completely different than what the world is that's the only way it can have an effect you you are influencing the world not the other way around it it says if you try to be like them you lose lose the Savor now you know salt never stops Becoming Salt you know if you are salt you are salt but I love the Scripture it says it starts it it's thrown out into the road and it's just walked upon what happens is all that salt just gets mixed in with dirt and you can't tell it apart you can't even tell it apart from the dirt even though it's set aside if we've lost what makes us salty if you try to be like the world if you try to talk like the world if you try to dress like the world if you try to think like the world if you try to act like the world then your salt has become of no effect to the world Amen they say well I'm going to go and I'm going to I'm gon to I'm going to be like them so that I can influence them over that's not how salt works I'm going to become like meat so I can salt the meat right no and I know this is just so simple but it's but but but I've done this I I've I've tried to be a light in to the World by taking on darkness and and and then then sometimes it's worse we try to isolate ourselves with other salt also no effect to the world Amen it it's just salt it's just light but it it it it it means so much when you really look at the ability that you have to literally you have the ability to promote life the word goes so far as say that you have the ability to create an atmosphere around you I don't know if you've ever done this and and I think I more and more I need to be careful about how I pray for what for the things I pray for I don't know if you've ever prayed this way Lord I want you to give me uh now you can plug in what you want Lord I want you to put me in a workplace where there's Christians at Lord I want you to put me in a school where there's people who believe like me Lord I want you to create Lord I want you to to just just keep me safe when I go to college keep me safe when I go to school you know may there not be anybody who comes up against me may I not have to deal with Spirits that's not that's not the right prayer you know that sometimes God will put you in a place where nothing else good is at because you are the light of the world amen amen I I think we need to be careful Lord uh we need to be careful about the way we pray Lord just put me in a place where there's no there's no unbelief or put me in a place where there's other Christians that's good it's not wrong to work with other Christians but what if God wants you in a place where there are no Christians because you are the salt of that place amen because you are the light to that place just a little bit of salt can change a workplace it can change a college it can change a high school it can change a church just a little bit of salt that's where it it's powerful what it can do why because it prevents by its own ability evil from growing and it promotes The Life of Christ prise the lord and it's like well sometimes we want to shy away from that I I want to challenge you this morning no no no you need to look pray to God lord where do you want me to be salty at I saw last night on the middle of on a street corner people wanting to be salty that's what I saw in a worship service and guess what happened people who were thirsty started to come they might even know I I imagine those those the Mormon Brothers didn't even know why they were drawn but you know what it is I don't know why but I'm thirsty I didn't think I was thirsty but all of a sudden I'm thirsty I'm going to stay well that's a good I'll just stay maybe just maybe just a minute longer and maybe just a minute longer and maybe just a minute longer is it because is it because we did anything oh sure there was singing there was music but it's because God he came down in an atmosphere that was made for him and God works the ability of us not us H uh the scripture says may they when they look at you may they see your good works and glorify the father I love that scripture because if the scripture had said if they see your good works and glorify you there's something wrong but imagine when the world can see your good work and the first and only thing they think of is wow there is a God not oh man this is a great sister this is a great brother oh I just really like them but no when they see your life they know there's a God praise the Lord and I'm telling you that's what it's like to be the salt of the earth I I I need to move forward if we're okay here fine what are the characteristics of somebody who is salty and it's right in the same exact sermon he's preaching he says if you want to know if you want to know what it's like to be the salt of the earth you want to be the light of the world we think I don't know what you think but sometimes I think okay I need to be I need to be strong in the Lord I need to be I need to be a a minister I need to be an evangelist or I need to be just uh I need to be uh so zealous for the Lord I need to be have this this Mighty faith I'm just telling you what I think I don't know if you think this way I I just need to have this this powerful Faith that's never defeated I need to uh all all of a I need to do this I need to do this I need to do this and he says let me tell you what the characteristics of somebody is salty it's right in the in the Beatitudes it says uh it's poor in spirit well I can say Amen to that one poor in spirit those who mourn you know what that means well well everybody Mourns brother no it means those who are grieved when they do something against God does that mean I'm I'm telling you the way that I think sometimes is well you would never do something to upset God right and then right out of the bat I fail well I guess I'm not the salt of the earth because I I said this I did this I know he's not pleased I must not be the salt but yet he says no no when you're grieved that you do that it's actually a good characteristic it's not the characteristic that you don't oppose the lord it's that you are grieved when you do am cuz many times our thoughts our actions not even intentional are opposed to the Lord sometimes I pray for things and it's the exact opposite of what I should be praying for and I had a good motivation to do it and yet when he comes if you will listen and take the correction that is a characteristic that I'm sorry it's not a characteristic that you could have naturally it is a god-given characteristic gentle merciful Peacemaker well I started to read these and I thought do I have these characteristics I I have to say I fall I'll fall short pure in heart and persecuted that's the characteristics of somebody who's salty and I don't It's just sometimes it's the opposite of what we think sometimes we think it's this powerful powerful Christian and to God this is powerful yes it is yes it is to God this is powerful being gentle being merciful you say no no you need to be able to preach and you need to be able to speak eloquently to God this is powerful and to God this is something that any brother any sister any young person can have in their life and I want to tell you something you already have it in your life correct amen otherwise the Bible would say become the salt of the earth amen but it doesn't say that and I just want to move forward it says um how did Stephen do it talking about Steph in the Bible brother manam says this and let your let your light so shine before men he never we're talking about Steven now the first martyr he never performed any Miracles although he know that Christ was a miracle performer correct amen kind sounds like sounds like me a little bit I don't know about you sounds like me a little bit he knowed all these powers and things but what did he do he just presented his life in such a way that they saw it was the power of Christ not the power of Step not the power of the church that Steven belonged to the power of Christ and I want to tell you this this is for everybody but this for the young people because I know what goes through your mind I know what goes through your mind you start to self-examine what you do you start to self-examine how you are and immediately you disqualify yourself from being salt right he says you may never see a vision okay but you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again you may never do that you may never see him standing Yonder in three and four rainbows now listen that sounds Grand you may never see his image how about this you may never hear his voice I'm telling you there shouldn't be one person now that's disqualified you may never hear his voice but you can still be a signboard that will reflect Christ yes amen amen by a life that's been so pure and unadulterated from the world not cluttered up with dirty things around your life but a pure thing think about those words a pure thing that'll cause the Hungry Heart to hunger and thirst to be like you you are the salt of the earth and if the salt has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted that's right let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works see what you do and glorify the father that's in heaven signboards reflecting yes he says you are the light of the world I had this written down but for time I don't know if I want to go into the there's there's just real quickly I think sometimes we think of light in in different ways but the but the word talks about three different lights talks about the sunlight now we have a great example this weekend man when that sun is shining it's hot it's warm we feel we feel the sun race it gives life to things it causes it causes nature to renew it causes plants to renew but as soon as the clouds come over that Sun's gone that light's there but it can't be seen I think sometimes our light to the world is exactly the same way I think sometimes our light to the world is just like sunlight when it's good brother Daniel it's good it's good but then Storms Come and and I felt so good a week ago or I felt so good a month ago maybe a month from now you'll feel good about the song service you had last night but a month from now will you feel the same way Lord Lord I felt so good when we were doing that worship or I felt so good in that service what happened a storm cloud came over because that was that was a light that wasn't sustainable although good and it has its place the sunlight is not what we're trying to be we shine forth like Christians we look like Christians we read our Bible and pray and then sometimes one thing happens and that's all out out the window let a little let a little sickness come let a little heartache come let a little crisis come and all of a sudden we forget to be light to the world and the and the world no longer sees a Christian they just see a person and he talks about he talks about another light he talks about the light inside the inner Court he says that's when you're in the outer court and you're walking around in in in the sunlight he says but you enter into the inner court and now you have the seven candlesticks that are lit he says and those seven candlesticks are lit by Theo that the oil is the holy spirit he says that's that's not a light that being covered up by clouds he says that's that's a whole Holy Light that's when you've had an experience with God that's when you could say Lord I I know that you're real I know it's not just a flash of light outside I know it's just not a sunlight Lord I've had an experience maybe I'm not where I should be but Lord I know you're real lord I trust I believe that you're in my heart but I don't know that you're in my heart because he says sometimes those candles although they're great he goes sometimes they get a little bit smoked up amen sometimes he the candle goes out and you have to relight the candle amen he says but there's another room Oh Glory Hallelujah there's another room Beyond the Veil amen he says that light when you enter into that light amen it can never go out he says it's not and I I I had this in a quote I I'll have to find it for you if you want but he says it's not even this bright light he says it's just a a dim constant light always Shining and he says when you enter into that you're actually hidden inside that light am and he says he references the scripture when you enter into my rest because I'm telling you there's nothing that is more stressful than trying to be the salt of the earth when you're trying to do it there is nothing more stressful than trying to be the light of the world when you're trying to be the light of the world I I I'll tell you right now there is no rest in that amen it's constant stress constant worrying constant worrying about what you look like your image but when you're hid in Christ you don't have to worry about those things let let clouds come that doesn't affect the light that's in you let sickness come let death come I I I just love the word because he says well brother Brandon we uh I had a family member that got sick and they died he says praise the Lord anyhow I lost all my money I lost my finances my house he goes well just praise the Lord anyways there's there's a light that cannot be affected by what happens to you only you can have an effect on the world not the other way around there's sometimes that there's a our hunger our joy and our worship sometimes gets covered up by clouds and crisis and we start to think Lord am I even one of yours am I even a child of God do I even have the light and I'm telling you we're trying to we're trying to rely on our ability amen we're trying we're trying to be the light of the world we're trying to be salt but that's not how light works and that's not how salt works and maybe you'll even start to question whether you're really a Christian maybe you'll start to ask is it really worth struggling and fighting when it's just easier to give up right amen I know how it is to be young person and I think there's even I don't even say just young people there's us adults that feel that way am amen how can I be the light of the world when I can't even be a light for myself Jesus said in John he says are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not it's good when we're walking in the day brother Kurt oh man when it's sunlight oh it's good to be a Christian when it feels good when everybody agrees when there's amens he says but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there's no light in him what happens when it's night what happens when the light goes out what happens when the clouds come when he says that you're the light of the world that holiest of holies is what he's talking about evil thoughts will come to afflict you but they don't have an anchor habits try to get back into your life they have no foothold over you why because you're hidden from them and it's such a paradox he says that there you'll be like a city on a hill whose light cannot be hidden and here's the Paradox of it is not your light you're hidden inside of that light think about that when you think about for that for a minute you think about Peter walking by the Gates of Jerusalem and he walks by I believe it was Peter I fact check myself on that one and just the shadow of him passing over somebody and that man is healed was it Peter's Shadow and how is a shadow cast when a light hits an object I I I could just picture it now if maybe if I were sitting there and I look up you just see light you don't see Peter you just see light because he was hidden in the one who has the ability to raise a man from his from from his feet from his crippled State it's not Peter amen but at that moment Peter was a light to the world Why by being hidden in the light it it's so simple and yet if Peter would have tried to be the light to somebody that's not how it works if Peter would have tried to be the salt of the earth it wouldn't have worked that way Jes you've entered into his rest he said and I I I just want to close I know this is maybe simple and it's maybe short I don't know how you feel about the short part button he says notice let us remember he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him that's that goes back to does God lie no does he know what he's doing okay then what's the problem and I think sometimes the problem is and I'm just I just want to be honest with you I think sometimes the problem that keeps us from being light and being salt is that we're ashamed of things that we've done and every time we try to be salt and say Lord I'm I I want you to be the salt I want to give myself away shame of things that we've done comes right up before our face and we turn around we walk away from the opportunity and and and that's the beautiful part about the Lord is that he creates I I think he creates the whole situation so that the thing you're ashamed of comes up before your eyes and he's right there and he says okay now I can't take it from you you have to give it Oh Glory and I created this whole situation I preached a whole sermon on a mountain about you being salt about you being light so that the thing that kept you from being it comes up before your face so I can take it away from you praise the Lord and and you maybe that's too simplistic but I think that's how the Lord works because I'm telling you when I picture myself Lord I I want to be the salt of the earth I want to be the light of the world the things that I think prevent me from being that come right up before my face and it's I'm telling you in those moments it's never what somebody else did it's always what I did and that's when you know it's true yes when you know it's the Lord showing you because we could sit here and think oh I got problems and it's you don't know it's because of so and so and it's because of my family and it's because of this my past it's because of all these things we have legitimate traumas we have things that have happened to us but if the thing that comes before your face I guarantee you will be the thing that you do the thing that you think the thing that you say and and and and it's the Lord creating a whole sermon a whole situation just to reveal to you the thing you need to give him Hallelujah isn't that powerful he's he's just so gentle about it though he doesn't come and say oh I don't know look at you you're just so you're you're so bad and if you give me this thing I'll make you good no he tells you you're already good amen you're already good it says salt is good that scripture yours the salt of the earth you're the light of the world and then when your own unction which is the holy spirit in you creating that that unction that says I don't know if I can be that because of this he goes ah there it is there is the thing that was keeping you from being the light of the world let me just take that from you but guess what you have to give it to him yes amen he say I don't know if I can give it to him I'm telling you this is the moment for you to give it to him yes now you could wait for some meetings you could wait for a prayer line you could wait for an altar call or you can just do the one thing oh Glory that is yours to do Hallelujah and that's make a decision Hallelujah and you say well that sounds like good good Baptist Doctrine yeah but there's truth in that there's truth in making a decision amen there's truth in saying Lord I don't deserve you I don't deserve to have this thing that I do taken away from you but Lord I need it gone and you can't do that until you really just face what you struggle with and say Lord I do this because I like to do it Lord I I like to do it be honest with them otherwise it's just hiding it from him it's saying well Lord I'll give you this little piece but I'll keep this other piece back here and then we expect to be the salt of the earth sometimes it doesn't it doesn't work and he cares so much and he wants to take your burden more than you want to give it to him yes amen that he'll create a whole situation that is thousands of years long for you to come into a situation where your own shame the things you do are right before your face so that he can gently remove them from you yes he does very good he says you surrender your thoughts to him Surrender Your Life to him Surrender Your Faith to him correct and watch that body obey what he says if that doesn't happen then he's not God and I believe he's God if that doesn't happen then he's liar and I don't believe he's a liar if you're a drunkard and you can't quit surrender that life to him and watch you'll drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and tried to get up give it up and can't do it Just Surrender that to him and watch what happens I'm not going to add to the word here but let's just make it for 2024 if you can't control this give it to him or is it better for you to walk around saying oh I'll defeat this I'll overcome this but if we read the Bible and you search it out you can't overcome unless you have the Overcomer inside and and I'm so and you know what I I'm I'm so tired of the devil telling telling people especially our young people you know what you need to get clean enough to get the Holy Ghost amen I believe in sanctification I believe in justification but there is nothing that cleans you out like the Holy Spirit now I want to ask you a question if you can live a life good enough to be worthy of the Holy Spirit then why do you need the Holy Spirit that's the question if you can live a life worthy of it then why do you need it Lord I want to be clean let me get cleaned up so you can come inside and God's saying let me come inside so you can be clean Hallelujah Lord let me let me be the salt of the earth let me be the salt of the earth so you can be a sweet Savor and he's saying let me in so you can be the salt of the earth Lord let me let me get cleaned up let me get good enough for you to come in and how are we going to do and I know maybe we don't think that or say that but we act that way sometimes we act that way sometimes oh Lord I I when I really really feel good enough I'll go up and I'll get prayer how about right where you're sitting right now you can make a decision and say Lord I'm no good but I believe your word and I believe you're not a liar and Lord if you say that I'm the light of the world Amen I don't see it I'll just be honest with you Lord I don't see it but you got to make it happen you want me to be the salty of the earth I'll go and I'll be willing to go where you send me but Lord you better make me salty cuz my salt it doesn't do a single bit of good for anybody my light oh it'll fade it'll fade I'll go out and I'll be a witness in my light as soon as a storm comes that person will stop seeing a Christian but but if I'm hid in Christ he says if you make that body come back in subjection to the word how are you going to make it subjection to the word if you're not in the word amen how do you even know what to make it subjection to get into the word oh we got preachers that's I'm sorry but that's not enough the preacher not enough it's not enough to come here on a Wednesday and on a Sunday and that's how you get your food amen right amen get into the word I'm preaching to me I should just sit right down there with you and say it that's the truth but you've got to surrender to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies they obey his will do you believe that he asks if you're a Christian you'll have to he said you say oh he makes our bodies obey oh I I don't I believe we have jurisdiction over them you know what that is I believe that I have the willpower I believe that I have the faith I believe that I have what it takes to overcome he says you're not fully surrendered yet you might have given part of yourself away but you haven't given yourself away for you are not your own you are dead amen amen dead and hidden in Christ and I'm so grateful that I don't have to rely on my ability to be the light I I I've never been more grateful than today that I don't have to rely on this person's ability which is none to be salty amen you yourself are dead and your life is hidden God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost how are you going to get away from that I think we need a Revival he says our lives are dead we are dead your own thoughts are dead he says you think pure thoughts and I know I I know the first thing that comes up well brother I I might have a thought that's not pure it's got to go to die we're not exempt from having thoughts attack us but salt it it in inhibits the growth of that evil you might be attacked all day long but salt does not allow it to grow sure there's sure there's evil sure there's bad thoughts sure there's filth but salt doesn't allow that to grow you'll come in contact sure you'll come in contact but you have a power an overcoming power in you and your life is hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit until the next Revival no he says until the day of your Redemption and we know we've passed from death into life I I had other I'm just going to leave it there if you just I I just want to ask you I I'm I'm never never been one that had the ability to to inspire people for an alter call for for any of that but I could ask you a simple question you have one thing to do and that's make a decision now you said maybe you say I made that decision years ago you have one today you have another decision today he's a new God today he's a new God today am amen you say I decided I decided years ago I decided a month ago I decided a year ago but what about today and I maybe if we just close our eyes because you know I I don't know sometimes we get a little bit ashamed to even raise our hand maybe ashamed of what somebody would think about us maybe somebody would say well what do you have in your life I won't even I won't even have my eyes open but if there's somebody who would just raise a hand you say it's just a it's just an act it could mean the difference between life and death amen because at the bottom of that hand is a heart yes amen and and and I'm telling you that you are not going to become the salt of the earth you are the salt of the earth but if you have something that is in the way if the Lord's put it before your face and he's done that no man can do that no preacher can do that only God can bring up what you know is in your heart and put it right before you and I want to ask you would you give it to him this morning and I promise you that your body your mind your spirit will come into obedience to him if you just surrender everything to him it's such a simple request it's a simple message and yet sometimes I think we miss just a little bit of a surrender and maybe we surrendered but we built up our ability we built up our faith we built up our way of doing things and the Lord says no but today I want want to work through [Music] you and with nobody nobody looking around would you just if you feel that way if you believe that if you're sincere in your heart and I think he knows your heart would you just raise your hand to [Music] him and God you only are Lord looking at these hands and you're looking at a heart behind those hands and Lord you're looking at Lord a desire for somebody to be your light Lord for somebody to be salt like you are salty Lord and Lord I I I just I pray Lord that it's not just an emotional workup Lord Lord we could we could have an emotion and we can leave Lord and be gone a day later Lord but that real genuine change comes into the life of a person behind a hand Lord if they know you Lord would they just be able to raise their hand say Lord I know you but I want to know more of you Lord I've lived in your light but Lord I want to enter in and be hidden in that life forever Lord Lord maybe I've basked in your sunlight Lord in your candl light Lord but I want your Holy Spirit Lord Lord I want to be so filled with it so filled with it Lord that when someone sees me Lord when you walk into a workplace when you walk into a school room or you walk into a business Lord there's your people are drawn to these lives father and Lord we cannot do that of oursel Father Lord takes you doing that and in a simple prayer Lord just a simple request it it it's not a motion lord it's not a working up of the people Lord It's a simple belief Lord only believe in you and I believe that there's hands raised and I believe there's Hearts behind those hands Lord and Lord we have no ability to do this except you give it to us Lord and I trust you'll do that work father Lord would you just Lord speak to the heart if there's a hand raised Lord would you just speak to their heart Lord you can do it like no one else can do it Lord Lord no minister no mother no father is like you Lord no friend is like you Lord [Music] Lord just help him don't let him back away Lord don't let him be satisfied with just a feeling Lord let them know Lord let them only be satisfied knowing that you've come in Lord Lord that they're hidden inside of you it's not a process lord it's not years long it can be right now father would you come in Lord and clean up the [Music] house clean up the building Lord from the inside of out Lord those that raise their hand Lord wherever they walk Lord may they be a light unto you the world may they be a reflection of you lord lord may you just take simple words Lord simple message Lord but just drive it home drive it home Lord we love you Lord we thank you Lord we appreciate all you do Lord [Music] all the way going all the way all the way going all the way all the way I'm going all the way going all the [Music] way going all the way all the way way going all the way oh all the way I'm going all the way oh I'm going all the way with the Lord I've made my decision made my decision I'm going on I've made my choice i' I've made my choice I'm going all the way oh I've made my decision I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with the Lord brothers and sisters it wasn't brother Ryan that said that you are the salt of the earth it's not brother Daniel that says that you are the salt of the earth Jesus Christ said that you are the salt of the earth he said that you are the light of the world oh Hallelujah if he puts you in a workplace be the salt it's an ungodly Place change it you are the salt of the earth you are the light of the world yes how beautiful it's not me that's saying it yes it's our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that says it our brother said he came here and he preached things today that are not mainstream what we're used to he was bold in what he said and let me tell you something he told the truth today when we go and we're raising our children brothers and sisters and they go in amongst unbelievers you kids change them invite them to come and have the same spirit that you have you be the light of the world you be the salt of the earth and if you hate this world if it's sinful change it there's got to be a change Jesus Christ himself he said in the evening time that there would be light I want to be that light that he talked about the Apostle our brother mentioned Stephen Stephen was that light and he made an influence on people he lit up the world and there was a sinner young man there that hated Christianity he hated this religion and Stephen was that light and he spread his light before and this young man saw what he did and that young man took what stepen sacrificed and that young man in the The Sinner that he was that young man changed the world his name was Saul of Tarsus and God used the testimony of stepen because he was the salt of the earth he was the light of the world let's all stand brothers and sisters as our brother said it's not me that says it and you know what it doesn't matter if you think it or not you are the light of this world well I don't believe it I sin and I I do all these things it doesn't matter you were born that way I am salt I am the light of the world you know why I was born that way God made me that and may be you were reborn that way but you are that light of the world you are that salt of the earth let me ask you and I want to witness before Jesus Christ Christ today our brother said it he started a sermon with it I want to witness how many people here and don't just raise your hand you think about what I said how many people here are the light of the world don't forget you raised your hand and be that from this point on and have confidence and be bold when the disciples they asked for boldness and God gave them boldness to preach the gospel and when they as asked for boldness you know what happened the walls of the whole building shook When the Spirit came down because they asked for the right thing you know that you're the salt of the earth you know that you're the light of the world now be bold in spreading your light I made my my decision going all the way I've made my choice I've made my choice I'm going all the way oh I've made my decision I'm going all the way I'm going all the way with the Lord all the way all the way going all the way all the way I'm going all the way oh all the way going all the way going all the way with the Lord if you you are the light of

After all, they are grateful that the doctors and all the different ones can help and do what they do, but there ain't nobody that can do what he can do.\" You know, you can be without you can be missing a body part and he can he can cause that thing to he can make it whole. You could be three three days in the tomb and he'll say come forth like he did with Lazarus like he did himself. Lord, what a blessing to get to know him. Amen. We appreciate his goodness. If you do have a prayer request, something before the Lord, Lord, you know what this need is. You know what my heart is. And sometimes you you don't have the words, you know, but there's something there, Lord. So, as as we bow our heads and just bring that need and and you know, maybe today you don't have a need, but consider someone else. Say, Lord, my friend, my family, somebody could use. Let's just bow our heads. Lord, we we just sing this song. Great is thy faithfulness. Lord, there's no shadow of turning in you, Lord. You never had to stop and say, \"Let me reconsider this. Let me look at it from a different angle. Let me study it some and see what we can do about this, Lord, but it's already been provided.\" When you cried out, \"It is finished.\" Lord, you knew everything had come to be fulfilled, Lord. Every promise, Lord, you saw each hand raised, Lord. You You know that those may be listening in this evening, Lord, and have a need. Lord, would you minister to them personally, Lord? Would you go and let them realize, Lord, that you're mindful of them, Lord, in whatever that need is. And as brother Lyall prepares to minister this evening, Lord, may you just give them that assurance even right now, Lord. As we appreciate your goodness in your grace, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Brother Jordan has a a song special and I think something he wanted to share and he mentioned that yesterday. And let's just sing as he they're getting ready. Greater than all my [Music] sin. Greater than all my sin is the blood that still [Music] cleanses. Is the grace that still set me free. to praise [Music] him. I know the blood of light. Walking in newness of love. I cannot fall is greater than all. The blood of the lamb. Just one more time. Greater than all my sins is the blood that still cleanses me. Grace that still sets me free to praise him. [Music] I know the blood of walking in newness of love. I cannot fall straighter than all the blood of the [Music] lamb. Amen. I guess I should spe clarify a little bit. I wouldn't consider it a special song. We could call it a congregational special. About a year ago, I told brother Daniel, I said, \"I've got a lot on my plate with things and I don't need to necessarily song lead unless, you know, there's a need and I need to be a help in that regards.\" And so, but occasionally I have a song that's on my heart and it's not to so much sing it as a song special, but to sing it as congregational. So, if you know these songs, feel free to join in. [Music] Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king when he comes. He's coming in power. Oh, hail the blessed hour. We shall see the king when he comes. There's a blessed time that's coming coming soon. It may be evening, morning, or at noon. The wedding of the bride, united with the groom. We shall see the king when he comes. Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king when he comes. He's coming in power. Oh, hell the blessed hour. We shall see the king when he comes. Are you ready? Should the savior call today? Would Jesus say, \"Well done.\" Or go away. My home is for the pure. The vile can never stay. We shall see the king when he comes. Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king when he comes. comes. He's coming in power. All hell the blessed hour. We shall see the king when he comes. Oh my brother, are you ready for that call to crown your savior, king, and lord of all? The kingdoms of this world shall soon be before him fall. I shall see the king when he comes. Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king when he comes. He's coming in power. All hell blessed hour. We shall see the king when he comes. Amen. As brother Jordan was singing that song, I was just thinking, we shall say the king. And right now when the king is crowned, there's just so many people all around looking at him. But really, how many of them know the king? They know who the king is. The king looks over them, but that's about they give. But do you know the king? Do you know his name on that day? He's going to call you by name because you're precious in his sight. Just a thought that came to me. Can you imagine be before the King of Kings and he calls you, \"Hey, Daniel, I know. Come on over. Brother Josiah, come on over. Sister Terry, just come on over. He's going to call you by name.\" What a wonderful thing. Amen. Amen. Brother Lyall prepares to come here. Let's just do that. We shall see the [Music] king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king. We shall see the king. When he comes, he's coming in power. All hail the blessed hour. We shall see the king when he comes. I shall see the king. Yes, I shall see the king. I shall see the king when he's come. Coming in power. I'll hail the blessed hour. I shall see the king. Let's stand. Oh, I shall see the king. I shall see. I shall see the king when he [Music] comes. Oh, hail the blessed hour. I shall see the king when he comes. and I'm gonna see him when you see him because we're going to see him together. Thank you so much and good evening. Uh just a reminder, a handout of the scriptures and so forth tonight are at the booth in the back. And uh if if anybody walks through the parking lot and sees a broken mirror on the side of our car, we were driving down from Phoenix after a graduation of our granddaughter from ASU. And yeah, and and and I think a wild cat left a left a rubber mat on the highway and the car in front of us kicked it up and it smacked against our car and and uh took the mirror cover off and oh well. So, we went to the place today to make an arrangement to get it fixed. So, in the meantime, if you see the the internals of the thing all exposed there, it's okay. I know about it. It didn't happen in the parking lot. You may recall the last time we met about David. It was the 5th of IR on the Hebrew calendar, which is celebrated as Israel's Independence Day, Yoma Atzma, the 77th anniversary of the date in 1948 that the modern nation of Israel was declared. and within minutes formally recognized by the United States under President Harry Truman. Tonight is also the 77th anniversary of the date in 1948 that the modern nation of Israel was declared and within minutes formally recognized by the United States under President Harry Truman. Brother Lyle, what are you talking about? The Hebrew calendar is lunar. Our calendar is solar. we put in a a leap day every four years to kind of keep things synchronized with the seasons. Well, when you have a lunar calendar, that doesn't work. So, the Hebrew calendar inserts a leap month uh roughly seven times every 19 years to get things back in synchronization. So, two weeks ago, April the 30th of 2025 was the 5th of IR, but in 1948, the 5th of IR began the evening of May 14th. Tonight, we meet on May 14th. So again, happy birthday, Israel. And why do you I'm sure some of the kids in the audience tonight are listening very closely because they're thinking, \"If I can find out the Hebrew calendar date when I was born, I can have two birthday parties every year.\" Cool. Thanks, brother Lyall. I'm sure your parents won't thank me, but you can thank me. Enough about calendars. Tonight, we continue to explore the life of David in the years before he became king. As we begin our study tonight, let's join together once more in prayer. Lord Jesus, it's an honor and a responsibility to stand here in the midst of people that you gave your life's blood for. Lord, even when we were just your enemies, we didn't know you. We didn't know about you. We didn't care. But Lord, you came and paid the price for each one of us. And Lord, to stand in this group is just such an awesome honor. Lord, I just pray that you'd forgive us each, Lord, of uh sins, the cares of this world. We can just set them aside. And Lord, we can just enter into a spirit of fellowship and worship and love with you. Lord, we thank you for your word. Please be with us. Please continue to be with us. And Lord, just help this Rascal Liyle Johnson to not get in your way. We thank you in Jesus name. Amen. While we're standing and for our opening verses, I'd like to read from Psalm 138. It's not tied to any specific event or period in David's life, but it fits the current time of his life as we're studying. It begins, I will. I will. It's my desire. It's my intent. I want to praise thee with my whole heart before the gods. In other words, not to idols. I will sing praise unto thee. I will worship toward thy holy temple. Many psalms talk about this. Psalms of David. The temple didn't exist in David's day. Solomon's temple was built after David was deceased. So, he's talking about something else when he's talking about the temple. I think David realized that God was not contained in an ark or limited to his special sight or had to be in this particular tent or tabernacle. David often spoke of the house of God and praised thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth. Recall these attributes which the Lord proclaimed in Exodus 34 6 and 7 which we examined in part two. For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. In the day when I cried, you answered me and strengthened me with strength in my soul. You encouraged me, replacing despair with hope and confidence. All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, oh God, when they hear the words of thy mouth. Yay, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord. prophetic words we long to see that day come. Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly, the humble, the meek, us. But the proud, the arrogant, the self-sufficient, he knoweth a far off, the NLT says he keeps his distance from the proud. Though I walk in the midst of, though I am surrounded by trouble, thou will revive me. You'll keep me alive. Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save, will deliver me. David did not rely on his own strength, his own ability. Neither did he deny his strength or his abilities, but he depended on the Lord and recognized the source of his gifts. The Lord will perfect, will complete, will fulfill that which concerns me. Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth till the end of the service. No, endureth forever. Forsake not the works of thine own hands. Don't abandon me. Please be seated. This evening, we'll be reading a lot from the book of First Samuel. My hope is that we'll be able to complete our look at David's formative years before he became king. We've already established the context of the times in which David lived. So this evening, we'll add a few maps where it's appropriate. We ended uh last time in part three, we started with David being alone in a cave in Adelum. He was alone. We read a psalm he wrote at that time showing his feeling of abandonment. We ended last time with David and his men rescuing the inhabitants of Kela from the Philistines then fleeing to Ma. Saul heard about David being in Ma and took some portion of his army to pursue David. And just about the time he had David surrounded to take him, we read in 1st Samuel 23, there came a messenger under Saul saying, \"Hasty, come. The Philistines have invaded the land.\" Remember, it was the time of harvest. Philistines were trying to weaken their enemy by taking the grain among other things. Saul should have been protecting his borders, not chasing David. Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sahamak Lot, rock of the divisions. And David went up from there and dwelt in the strongholds at Engeti. Recall a stronghold means a difficult to access place. Um and Getti is on the western side of the of the Dead Sea. There are springs of fresh water there, but it's desolate. This is modern Engeti, a nature reserve in Israel. Looks a bit like portions of the Grand Canyon. The Dead Sea, 1300 ft below sea level, the lowest place on planet Earth that that is not underwater. The cliffs rise some 2500 feet above the Dead Sea, an elevation of about,00 feet. Well, chapter 24, we'll pick up tonight picks up the story and it will inspire another psalm. I'm reading the chapter rather than summarizing because it contains speech by David which helps us understand his heart. And that's what we're looking to to understand the heart of this man that God said was after his own heart. We read in the Psalms where David wrote poetry and songs about this sort of thing. And there are times when he has portions of speech in the text of the narrative that also reveals his thinking, his heart, where he's coming from. 1st Samuel 24:1 It came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, it was told him, saying, \"Behold, David is in the wilderness at Engeti.\" Then Saul took 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. Remember, David has at most 600 men. Saul is better armed, has the resources of the fledgling nation behind him, and is going after David, outnumbering him five to one. And he Saul came to the sheet coats enclosures for for sheep by the way along the road or the path where there was a cave. And Saul went in to cover his feet to take a nap to to rest a while. And David and his men, some of his men, they were in multiple caves. None of the caves are particularly huge. David and his men remained in the sides of the same cave. And the men of David said quietly to him, \"Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee,\" it's not recorded elsewhere. \"Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.\" Then David arose and cut off the skirt, a little corner of the edge of Saul's robe, privately means secretly, stealthily, unnoticed. And it came to pass afterward that David's heart smoteed him because he had cut off Saul's skirt. In other words, David felt remorse. And David said, I'm sure again quietly to his men, \"The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.\" David uses the Lord's name three times, the fact of Saul being anointed or chosen or selected twice in this very brief sentence. He also acknowledges that as long as Saul is alive, David is Saul's servant, but the servitude has its limits. David refuses to cross the line to attack or kill Saul. God made Saul king. It's up to God to bring Saul down, not David. So, David stayed his servants. He restrained his men with these words and suffered them not to rise against Saul. Remember, these guys are rebels. They're wanted men. Saul isn't just after David. He's not likely to show mercy to any of them. This is their golden opportunity to be rid of Saul, to install David as their leader, as king, already anointed by the prophet Samuel to succeed Saul. that David could restrain them with his example and his word speaks both of his leadership and their recognition of it. But Saul, I'm sorry. Yes. But Saul, oblivious to what had happened, rose up out of the cave and went on his way. David also arose afterward and when Saul was a safe distance away but within shouting distance to hear David went out of the cave. David went out of the cave and cried after Saul saying my lord the king and when Saul looked behind him. David stooped with his face to the earth bowed himself. And David said unto Saul, \"Wherefore, hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh I hurt.\" Why do you listen to this nonsense, Saul? Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into mine hand in the cave, and some made me kill thee, but mine eyes spared thee. And I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my Lord, for he is the Lord's anointed. In other words, that's the only reason you're still alive. Moreover, my father, not only Saul as king, but now appealing to their relationship, Saul was his father-in-law. Moreover, my father, see, yeah, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not. Know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand. I have not sinned against thee. Yet thou hest my soul to take it, to take my life, to kill me. The Lord judge between me and thee. The Lord avenge me of thee, but mine hand shall not be upon thee. David absolutely wants Saul out of the way. He wants his vengeance for Saul's behavior toward him. But there's a red line David will not cross. that is to lift his hand or the hands of his men against the anointed king of Israel. He goes on, \"As sayaith the proverb of the ancients, wickedness proceedth from the wicked, but mine hand shall not be upon thee. After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom dust thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. The Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.\" And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, \"Is this thy voice, my son David?\" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept, cried aloud, Saul is tormented. He said to David, \"Thou art more righteous than I. Thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded the evil. Thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me. For as much as when the Lord hath delivered me into thine hand, thou killedest me not. For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go well away? Wherefore the Lord reward thee good, for that thou hast done unto me this day. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord that thou will not cut off my seed after me and that thou will not destroy my name out of my father's house. Saul's always looking for an angle. He asked David to promise to not kill his sons after Saul's eventual death. He's still hoping to establish a dynasty, a a house, and he trusts David to keep his word. And David swear unto Saul that he wouldn't kill Saul's sons or destroy his line. And Saul went home. But David and his men got them up into the hold. David doesn't trust anything Saul says. He's not going home. He's returning to Engeti. David wrote a psalm about being in a cave, fleeing from Saul. It's unclear if this is when he went to Adelim or Engeti, but unlike Psalm 142, which we read when he went to the cave at Adelim, in this one, he's not revealing loneliness. So, I associate this with his time at Enghetti. Psalm 57 to the chief musician als means it set to the tune of a song of do not destroy. A mik a poem of David when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful unto me, oh God, be merciful unto me. Show me gracious favor. My soul trustth in thee. Yay, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed. I will cry unto God most high, unto God that perforth all things, who fulfills all his purpose for me. He shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Complete Jewish Bible says he will send from heaven and save me from those who would trample me down and mock me. Saha means think about it. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. My soul is among lions. I lie even among them that are set on fire. Even the sons of men who whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword. Be thou exalted, oh God, above the heavens. Let thy glory be above all the earth. Let thy glory shine over all the earth. They've prepared a net, a snare for my steps. My souls bowed down. They've digged a pit and my path before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Sa my heart is fixed. Oh God, my heart is fixed, steadfast, confident. I will sing and give praise. Awake up my glory, my soul, my heart, my inner self. Awake sultry and harp. I myself will awake early. I will awaken the dawn with my song. I will praise and thank thee, oh Lord, among the people. I will sing unto thee among the nations. For thy mercy, thy thy unfailing love is great, reaching unto the heavens, and thy truth, faithfulness unto the clouds. Be thou exalted, oh God, above the heavens. Let thy glory be above all the earth. Again, we see how David's plea progresses from a cry for help to a cry of praise. Good example for us. David was not immune from stress. As brother Daniel taught last week about Saul being guilty of making hasty decisions, so does David in this next chapter. In the interest of time, I'll I'll summarize parts of chapter 25. Verse one tells us Samuel died. All the Israelites were gathered together, lamented him, and buried him in his house at Rama. David arose and went down to the wilderness of Piran deep in the south. You can see Rama is this little town that's just north of Jerusalem, maybe five miles or six. And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. And the man was very great. He had 3,000 sheep, a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel. Until last week, I assumed Carmel met the same location as Mount Carmel. Quite a distance outside Saul's kingdom. You can see it in the north. If you're familiar with modern Israel, that's where Kyifa is. And my own is down here well south of Jerusalem. I was wrong. When it says Carmel, it doesn't mean Mount Carmel. If it means Mount Carmel, it'll say Mount Carmel. So where is Carmel? Turns out Carmemell was a town at a crossroads just north of Mahon perhaps a mile. If you step out of this church out of the front, walk down to the corner Grant Road and walk back you've traveled the distance from Mone to Carmel. about a mile, about a 20-minut stroll. Now, the name of the man was Nibbal. The name of his wife Abigail. She was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance. But the man was chish and evil means he was sirly, rude, harsh, rough, badly behaved. He was this way in his doings. And he was of the house of Caleb. Caleb was a descendant of Judah as was David. So these guys are distant relatives in some way. And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did sheare his sheep. It turns out that David's men were in the vicinity of Nibal's shepherds and they apparently moved together. David's men took nothing and their presence scared away anyone thinking of stealing sheep or stealing from the shepherds. At sharing time, a time of feasting and celebration, David sends 10 men to Nibbal to ask him to share in his bounty. And he tell them that they've been protecting his shepherds. And you can ask the shepherds, they'll tell you that. Well, Nibal will have nothing to do with him. So they return and tell David in verse 12. So David's young men turned their way from Nibbal and Carmel and went again to Mon and came and told David all those sayings. And David, temper flaring, said unto his men, \"Gurge ye on every man his sword.\" And they girded on every man his sword. And David also girded on his sword. And there went up after David about 400 men. 200 abode by the stuff. But one of the young men who worked for Nabal told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, \"Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master.\" And he railed on them. Abigail then very quickly gathers several donkey loads of food stuffs and proceeds to intercept David on the road. Verse 19, she said unto her servants, \"Go on before me. Behold, I come after you.\" But she told not her husband Nabal. And it was so as she rode on the ass. As she came down by the covert of the hill, behold, David and his men came down against came down toward her and she met them. 41 angry men, armed warriors, experienced in battle, tempers high. Now David had said, \"Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him, and he hath reququited me evil for good.\" So, and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. David is determined to kill Nal and all the men of his household, of those who belong to him. And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, lighted off the ass, fell down before David on her face, bowed herself down to the ground, fell at his feet, and said, \"Upon me, my Lord, upon me, let this iniquity be. Let thine handmade, I pray thee, speak in thine audience. Hear the words of thine handmmaid. Let not my Lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Bile, even Nabal.\" She goes on to plead for her household, tells David she's aware he'll be king someday and wouldn't want his hasty action of vengeance on Nibal to be a stain on his heritage. She concludes her plea, verse 31, that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my Lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my Lord hath avenged himself. But when the Lord shall have dealt well with my Lord, then remember thine handmade. And now we see how David can humble himself and accept correction and recognize the hand of the Lord in it. David said to Abigail, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me. Blessed be thy advice. Blessed be thou which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand. For in very deed as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hast hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left under no ball by the morning light any that pissth against the wall. So David received of her hand that which she brought him and said unto her, \"Go up in peace to thine house. See, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.\" She goes home, tells Nibal what she did. Apparently, he has a stroke and dies 10 days later. And when David heard that Nibal was dead, he said, \"Blessed be the Lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach, of my insult from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant David from evil. For the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nibal upon his own head.\" I don't pretend to understand the dynamics of what appears in a 21st century context here in America as a case of extortion. The various commentaries I have read all seem to be handwavering. Regardless, David took Nibal's refusal for payment for protection to be evil on Nibal's part. So did his men and Nibal's household and Abigail. So we'll leave it at that. David sent and communed with Abigail to take her to him to wife. And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmemell, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife. I can think of a more romantic way to propose to somebody, but and she arose. I guess these days it to be texting, but she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said, \"Behold, let thine handmade be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.\" And Abigail hasted and rose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her. and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife. David also took a hinowim of Jezrael and they were also both of them his wives. But Saul had given Michael his daughter, David's wife, who loved him, risked her life to save him. David loved her, gave Mel to Falty, the son of Leesh, which was of Galilee. Saul really doesn't like David. Chapter 26. David is once again pursued by Saul. David takes Abashi, one of his trusted men, enters Saul's camp during the night. They take Saul's spear and water jug, and David again refuses to harm Saul or allow Abashai to do so. Uh Saul is being guarded by Abnner and his men, but they're all sound asleep. It was made very clear to me when I was in the military that if you're on guard duty, if you're on watch, you don't sleep. There are repercussions. So David took the spear and the cruise of water from Saul's bolster like like a pillow near his head. And they gapped them away. And no man saw it nor knew it, neither awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them. Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill a far off, a great space being between them. And David cried to the people and to Abnner the son of Nur, saying, \"Answerest thou not, Abnner?\" Abnner answered and said, \"Who art thou that criest to the king?\" David said to Abnner, \"Art not thou a valiant man? Who is like to thee in Israel? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? For there came one of the people in to destroy the king, thy lord. This thing is not good that thou has done. As the Lord liveth, you're worthy to die because you have not kept your master, the Lord's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is in the cruise of water that was at his bolster. And Saul knew David's voice and said, \"Is this thy voice, my son David?\" And David said, \"It is my voice, my lord, O king.\" And he said, \"Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in mine hand? Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering. But if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the Lord, for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, \"Go serve other gods.\" Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as one death does hunt a partridge in the mountains. Then said Saul, I have sinned, \"Return, my son David. I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly.\" David answered and said,\"Behold the king's spear. Let one of the young men come over and fetch it. The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the Lord delivered thee into my hand today, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed.\" That red line he would never cross. And behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord. And let him deliver me out of all tribulation. I spared you, Saul, only because you are anointed of the Lord to be king. God placed you, so I leave it in his hands to displace you.\" Then Saul said to David, \"Blessed be thou, my son David. Thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way and Saul returned to his place. In spite of Saul's claim that he would not harm David in verse 21, David's heard this before. He has zero trust in Saul. David now reveals his thinking about all this. David said in his heart, \"I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul.\" He's lying when he says he will not harm me. There's nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines. Saul shall despair of me to seek me anymore in any coast within the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand. David arose, passed over with the 600 men that were with him unto Akish, the son of Maul, king of Gath. Now, this is the same Akish that he fled to before by himself with Goliath's sword. As we read earlier, David pretended to be insane to escape. Akish appears to be somewhat easily manipulated. David dwelt with Akish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household. So, this is a large group. It's not just David and 600 men. It's David and his two wives and 600 men and their wives and children, likely about 2,000 total, even including David with his two wives, Ahinoam, the Jezelitis, and Abigail the Carbalitis, Nabal's former wife. And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath, and he sought no more again for him. So David was correct that this would finally stop Saul's pursuit of him. He can go back to being king of Israel. David said unto Akish, \"If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them, the plural, thine eyes, give me a place in some town in the country that I may dwell there. For why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?\" flattering the king, looking for a way to be safe from Saul and at the same time not under the watchful eye of the Philistine king. Then Akish gave him Ziglag that day, about 25 miles south of Gath. Wherefore Ziglag pertainth unto the kings of Judah unto this day, this day is when the book was last compiled and edited. And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. He was there for 16 months. So David is somewhere between the age of 27 and 29 at this point. And now that his movements aren't being observed by Akish, David and his men went up and invaded the Gisherites and the Gazites and the Amalachites. for those nations were of old inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shore, even unto the land of Egypt. I wanted to show these places on a map, especially Geisher and Gzra, but there's little agreement as to where these places were. There's no sign sticking up that says it was here. The text states it was on the way to Egypt. So it had been in the south of the Philistine territory and bordering the kingdom of Israel and the territory of Judah on the south. So the red arrows show the general direction of David's raids to the ultimately protect Judah's southern border. And David smoked the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to Akish. So we see David could be as brutal as Saul. We saw the same in Joshua centuries earlier. He brings some of the plunder to Akish and Gath and Akish says whether have you made a road today? who' you attack to get all this stuff? David said, \"Against the south of Judah, against the south of the Germalites, and against the south of the Kennites.\" So David's telling Akish that he attacked the southern borders of Saul's kingdom that is near Philistine territory. In other words, he's working for the Philistines. He's posing as an ally, a dependable person, and bringing wealth to his benefactor, Akish, when in fact he's strengthening and defending the territory he will eventually rule. As a result, and to protect his cover story in Roose, David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath, saying, \"Lest they should tell on us,\" saying, \"So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.\" So David is practicing deception at great risk. And Akish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel, utter to abore him. Therefore, he shall be my servant forever. It came to pass in those days at the end of the 16 months that David was in Ziglag, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with Israel. And Akish said unto David, \"Know thou assuredly, thou shalt go with me to battle, thou and thy men.\" David said to Akish, \"Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do.\" H I wonder what he's implying there. And Akish said to David, \"Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head, my bodyguard forever.\" I love this. Saul sees in David a conspiracy against him when there is none. Akish fails to see in David an ongoing conspiracy against him. I really like that sort of thing. I I just we're going to skip the remainder of chapter 28 tonight because it pertains to Saul. Chapter 29 we read, \"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aph and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezrael. And the lords of the Philistines, you remember the Philistines, they aren't a nation like we think of it. There's these citystates that are kind of a loose confederation. So they're gathering the armies from all of these citystates under the general banner of the Philistines. The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands. But David and his men passed on in the rear reward, the rear guard, the last troops to pass in review with Akish. So this gives you an overview showing some of the locations. You can see Saul's army at the top of the map in Jezreel. The Philistine armies are gathering together at at Aphic there. So David comes from Ziglag about 25 miles up to Gaff. They march about another 30 miles with uh with Akish's uh troops on up to Aphik and that's where they're having this big gathering to get this large army put together. Gives you an idea of the of the territory. Then said the princes of the Philistines, what do these Hebrews hear? Akish said unto the princes of the Philistines, \"Is this not this David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, which had been with me these days or these years?\" One year and four months, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day. It's great. David is on our side. The princes of the Philistines were angry with Akish. And the princes of the Philistines said unto him, \"Make this fellow David return. He may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him. Let him not go down with us to battle, lest the battle be an adversary to us.\" Wake up, Akish! No wonder you're bringing up the rear. For wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? Should it not be with the heads of these men? Is not this David of whom they sang one to another in dances saying Saul slew his thousands and David his 10 thousands? These guys have a bit more insight than their buddy Akish. Then Akish called David and said to him, \"Surely is the Lord liveth. Thou has been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me and the host is good in my sight. I have not found evil in these since the day of thy coming unto me and to this day. Nevertheless, the the Lords favor thee not. Wherefore now return, go in peace that thou displeas not the lords of the Philistines. And David said unto Akish. Familiar words from David. But what have I done? What has I found in thy servants so long as I've been with thee unto this day that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king? Again, I love how he words that. It's clever. It's ambiguous. Which person is my lord the king? Akish or Saul? David's trying to sandwich and hit the Philistines from the back while Saul hits him from the front. That plan is being thwarted. But the way that he expresses it, Akish thinks that, \"Oh, I wanted to go fight against Saul.\" Again, I I just love this stuff. And Akish answered and said to David, \"I know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of God.\" Notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, he shall not go up with us to the battle. Wherefore now, rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee. And as soon as you be up early in the morning and have light, depart. So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezrael. So the Philistine armies are marching from Aph up to Jezrael to confront Saul. David is now going the 50 or so miles, 55, 60 miles from Aph back to Ziklag. about three days since he's left. And it came to pass when David and his men were come to Ziglag on the third day that the Amalachites that the the ones that uh Saul had not defeated as Samuel had commanded him to do. that the Amalachites had invaded the south and Ziglag and smitten Ziglag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were therein. They slew not any either great or small, but carried them away and went on their way. So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire. Their wives, their sons, their daughters were taken captive. David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep. Put yourself in their place for a moment. Can you imagine coming home and your whole neighborhood, your whole town, your whole area is burned with fire? Your spouse is gone. Your kids are gone. You've been you've been out on the job for three days and you come home and this is what you see. David's two wives were taken captives. Oham, the Jezraelitis and Abigail, the former wife of Nabal the Carmealite. David was greatly distressed. For the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. It was your leadership that brought us here, David. And now look what's happened. But David encouraged himself, and the Lord is God. I wonder if this might have been the time he wrote the sixth psalm. Psalm six. Oh Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasen me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, oh Lord. I'm weak. Lord, heal me. My bones are vexed. My soul is also sore, vexed. But thou, oh Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. Save me for thy mercy's sake. In death there's no remembrance of thee and the grave. Who shall give thee thanks? I'm weary with my groaning. All the night make I my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye is consumed because of grief. that waxes old because of all my enemies. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity. The Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. The The Lord has heard my supplication. The Lord will receive my prayer. Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed. Let them return and be ashamed suddenly. Back to chapter 30 of 1 Samuel. David said to Abathther the priest, a himc son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. We talked about that priestly garment before. Abathther brought thither the eod to David. And David inquired at the Lord, saying, \"Shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them?\" And the Lord answered him, \"Pursue? Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all. So David went, he and the 600 men that were with him and came to the brook Bessor where those that were left behind stayed. It's hard to see. I see everybody's got their binoculars so you can see it. There's uh this little blue thread here actually flows this way. That's the brook of Bizor. So they're heading from Ziklag to get to the brook of Mizor and then they'll continue. But David pursued he and 400 men for 200 abodeed behind which were so faint they could not go over the brook bizore. They are so overcome with grief with sorrow. They have no strength. And they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he did eat. And they made him drink water. They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread or drunk any water three days and three nights. David said unto him, \"To whom belongest thou?\" He realizes this guy is not a local person, therefore probably a slave of some sort. To whom belongest thou? And whence art thou? Where are you from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalachite. My master left me because three days ago I fell sick. We made an invasion upon the south of the Kathites and upon the border that belongs to Judah and and upon the south of Caleb, that part of Judah, and we burned Ziglag with fire. They raided and destroyed along the southern border of Judah and surrounding areas. David said unto him, thou bring me down to this company? And he said, \"Swear unto me by God that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I'll bring thee down to this company.\" And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah. And David smokeote them from the twilight even into the evening of the next day. There escaped not a man of them except for 400 young men which rode upon camels and fled. David recovered all that the Amalachites had carried away. And David rescued his two wives. There was nothing lacking to them. neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them. David recovered all. David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle and said, \"This is David's spoil.\" David came to the 200 men which were so faint they could not follow David whom they had made also to abide at the brook Bessor. And they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him. And when David came near to the people, he saluted them. Hi guys, we're back. then answered all the wicked men and men of Balile of those 400 that went with David. Here we see in that congregation and these 600 guys, there's some questionable people amongst that group. They're not all upright, the kind of people that you might want for a neighbor, right? That's all the people that were unhappy, all the people that were basically running from the law and had come to David. answered all the wicked men of Balile and said, \"Because they went not with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, save every man can have his wife and his kids, that they may lead them away and depart.\" David said, \"You shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the Lord hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.\" I appreciate you guys's effort, but it's the Lord that did this. For who will hearken unto you in this matter? As his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his heart part be that carth by the stuff? They shall part alike. Everybody gets the same pay. If you're a warrior, good for you. If you're a supply sergeant, good for you. Everybody is treated the same. And it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. And when David came to Ziglag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even unto his friends, saying, \"Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord, to them which were in Bethl and South Ramoth and Jat, and Auror, and Sifmoth, and Echo, and Rael, and the cities of the Germalites, and the cities of the Kenites, and Horma, and Corusan, and Aic, and to them which were in Hebron, to all the places where David himself and his men were want to haunt. So he didn't just share it with his guys, he spread it around. The next chapter, chapter 31, is solely about Saul, not about David, and concludes the book of 1 Samuel in the time before David became king, which is next time. What lessons can we take away from this part of the story of David that we can apply? In this portion of David's life, we see behaviors that tell us he was very human. His faith in God was strong, but it was tested time and again. Samuel had anointed him to be king to succeed Saul. But God wasn't done with the training and preparation for David to become king. He needed to see what Saul was doing both from being a favored person inside the court as well as being a hunted person innocent of the crime for which he was being persecuted. He needed to see that within Saul's entourage as well as among his smaller cadre, there were persons of evil intent. In chapter 24, he spared Saul's life, and his conscience bothered him for even snipping off a small corner of the border of Saul's robe. So small that Saul and whoever was with him didn't even notice it had been cut until David pointed it out. Similarly, in chapter 26, when David took Saul's spear and water jug, he made it perfectly clear that he would not harm Saul or allow his men to harm Saul. The red line David would not cross was to attack or injure the king God has chosen. God placed Saul as king. God would have to displace him in his own time. David made it just as clear he wanted God to avenge him of Saul. He asked God to do this again and again in the Psalms and in the text of the speeches that he's made. Between those events and chapter 25, David felt insulted and and these days we'd say he was disrespected. He was dissed by Nabal. And his immediate reaction was to kill Nabal in his entire house. Kill all the males associated with him, cut off his line forever. We recognize David was under extreme stress and had been for years. Saul chasing him to kill him. Having a company of about 2,000 people with the responsibility to see they had food and shelter, provide leadership, settle disputes, being a shepherd to such a crowd made up of people who were discontented to begin with. The musicians would please come. We also saw an Abigail, a person who recognized the danger of her husband's reaction to David's request. Brother Brer might tell us it was a mother's love to protect her children. In any case, she immediately responded to David's original request of Nibal, intercepted him and his troop of 400 angry armed men, and said, \"Let me take the blame, the punishment for the wickedness of this man.\" She was displaying, we would say, the nature and spirit of Jesus Christ, an innocent one willing to take the punishment and bear the reproach on behalf of another who was unaware of the intervention and was guilty. She is such an illustration of the gospel. Finally, when David returned to Ziglag and found the town destroyed and the people gone, he was stricken by profound grief on one hand and the griefdriven anger of his men on the other. Men who would follow him anywhere were now thinking of killing him, death by stoning. David turned to the Lord for soloulless, comfort, and strength. Let's close this portion of the service with a song from Psalm 19. A psalm of David. The love of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure. making wise the simple. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than honey and the honey cold. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. [Music] Sweeter also than honey and the honey cold. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring [Music] forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous allto together. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. [Music] Sweeter also than honey and the honey cold. Moreover, by them is thy servant warm, is thy servant warm. For over my is thy serant war. And in keeping of them there is great reward. There is great reward. There is [Music] great song of Psalms 42. [Music] Why my soul are you downcast? Why are you trbled within? For I will hope in my savior my God and will praise him yet praise him again. Repeat that again. Why my soul are you downcast? Why are you troubled within? For I will hope in my Savior, Michael, my God, and will praise him yet praise him again. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will praise him yet. Praise him again. One more time. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I will praise him yet praise him again. Morning by morning, new mercies are streaming. I trust in your goodness where I cannot see. You have been faithful whenever I wonder. Lord, give me the hope that I need. Morning by morning your mercies are streaming. I trust in your goodness where I cannot see. You have been faithful whenever I wonder or give me the hope that I need. Hallelu hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will praise him yet praise him again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I will praise him yet praise him again. The first verse. Why my soul are you [Music] downcast? Why are you troubled within? hope for. I will hope in my savior my God and will praise him yet praise him [Music] again. Beginning of that psalm says, \"As the heart panth for the waterbrooks, soul my soul after thee, oh God.\" Lao said that he he liked and and one of the things that his his mind liked was the irony of Saul and David and how David was loyal to Saul and yet Saul wanted to kill David because he thought he was disloyal. And then Akish thought that David was loyal and David actually wasn't loyal to Akish. He was loyal to Saul. And and the irony there and brother was closing. I was thinking, Lord, I I have something that the the way that I think too, and it's something that maybe doesn't make sense to me. Why would you have the Philistines leave Ziglag? And why would you have David leave Ziglag? And then an invading army, the Malachites, come in and burn their homes and steal all of their possessions and steal their wives and their children. And then David comes back and he he goes after the Philistines and he says, \"Should I go after them?\" And the and the answer came back from the Lord, \"Yes, go.\" and he goes and and this man comes out of basically out of nowhere and shows them where they are. And I look at it and it doesn't say that it served a purpose. Why did David's family, why did why did they all have to suffer for that time when it was just a circle? And and and what purpose did it have for these Malachites to to invade and and take the families and cause all this suffering and this hardship? And then David goes and gets them and bring it brings them back. Like Lord, what did it purpose did it serve? The Bible doesn't tell us. And we can look at all the suffering friends that we go through many times and we might wonder why why do I suffer? Why have I been put through this? Why has my life taken this turn? And it's because God has a purpose in it. And he had a purpose in that whole situation with David. We don't know what that purpose was, but it was a divine purpose. And then David during these times, he just cries out praises to God. And I just think, Lord, I what a man this man David was. And he was one of the greatest of them all to be loyal to that man that hated him. And all the while working and being a benefit and being a blessing to the kingdom. And it wasn't even his kingdom yet. He but he he was a great man. And he just did what was best not for himself, but he did what was best for the Lord. I think, wow, he was truly a great great man with all of his faults and the Lord truly put him through a many, many hard times. But God had a purpose in it. We can say maybe it was to build his character, maybe it was for something else, but he had a purpose. And he has a purpose, friends, in everything that we go through. God has a purpose in all of it. We may never know when we're on earth, but one thing I will promise you is when David got to the other side, he probably said, \"Thank you, God. Thank you for Ziglag. Thank you for the the caves of Engeti. Thank you for all all of this happened. Lord, I suffered, but now I know why.\" and we suffer and we go through things and we may not know why, but I promise you God has a purpose in all of it just like he did with David. Let's all stand. [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I want to depend on his word. Oh, through it all. Through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, our world depend upon his word. Man, we've learned to depend on God's word through it all. for whatever whatever toils and tears, whatever problems this word world may throw at us, we can just turn right to this blessed Bible. Say, Lord, I may not understand why I'm going through this. I may not understand why these things happen, but I do believe that you're in charge, and I do believe that you have your hand on it all. Brother Joe Miller, would you come close, my friend? I said I said, Miller, I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend on his word. One more time. That's good. Oh, through it all. Come on now. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all. Through it all, I move to depend upon his word. How about Brother Johnson? Wasn't that amazing? [Applause] That was really amazing. Um Um You know, the our family's been through a lot um this past couple weeks. Um, I know you've seen my little grandchildren and one of my grandchildren lost their mother just recently and uh, you know, they're young. They're young and when the young pass, it's really really difficult. But, uh, you know, it seems like everyone's going through an awful lot. So, um, with with all that we've learned in in in here, let's let's go to the Lord. But let's also think about all those the young ones that are struggling and and trying to make their way. Heavenly Father, thank you for this night. What a wonderful night to to give us the the the pleasure of being here and listening to your word, Lord. It's so such a it's it's it's it just fills your cup up. You you you work so hard and then you come here and it wasn't that hard, was it, Lord? it. It's it's it's just a pleasure to be here with in in your house with our brothers and our sisters. I ask that you uh that you watch out for those that that couldn't be here tonight. There's so many people that want to be here and just just can't be here. Have a special place for them. And you know, we all have people on our hearts and we know that you've got it. But we need a little encouragement, Lord. Would you just build our our faith? I mean, these little signs that you've shown us, oh man, on Sunday and tonight, just the word, just your word is just so comforting, Lord. I know, um, a lot of people are coming to the end of their school year. and teachers are getting pretty excited about that. But the kids are are getting promoted and graduated, moving on, and it's really changing their lives. And would you be with there with them, Lord? Would you would you make this night the day that they remember you and and give you thanks, Lord, for everything that's happened and and how you've been there for them each step of the way. And then we can celebrate with our our friends and family and and rejoice the good things as the graduations, the promotions come. And as it gets warmer out here, we might complain. Lord, help us not to complain so much to really see that you have a plan and we don't quite understand your plan, but we trust in you. We have faith in you, Lord. We we we are so appreciative of you. Please watch us as we go on our way to home. please bring us back and um on Sunday so that we can gather and uh if we have to wait that long and uh hopefully we'll meet with you before then but if not we'll we'd love to be back here on Sunday. So thank you Lord and we we we love you so much in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Oh through it all. Oh, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I come to depend upon his word. [Music] All is well. Oh, all is well. We have heard the message shalom and all is well. There is a place of perfect rest behind the inner show rest for all is well. One more time brother. All is well. [Music] All is well. We have heard the message. Shalom and all is well. There is a place of perfect rest behind the inner man. So rest little bride rest for all is well. All is well. No matter what happens, brother Joe, all is well. With David, he had lost everything. That day when he came home, it was all gone. But yet all was well. First thing he did is he went to the Lord and then the Lord provided. God bless you all. It's good to see you all. Tonight, I pray that the Lord will go with you. Remember, um, Saturday night, we'll have a youth gathering in the upper room. Don't forget, and all the other youth, Sister Hope, don't you forget. Um, and then our normal service, Sunday morning. And, um, think on these things that Brother Lyle has brought before us tonight. ponder on him. Ponder on this great man, David. All that he went through and and the great battles that he won. And I don't think the the hardest battles, Brother Ly, I don't think were on the battlefield. I think the hardest battles that David won were those battles to keep his character. Yes. And and to keep keep serving God. Yes. and not to fall for the the tricks of the enemy. God bless you, brothers and sisters. You're dismissed. Oh, all is well. All is well. We have heard the message, Shalom, and all is well. There is a place of perfect rest behind the end.

you w welcome home sister Sarah's gone through a hard time we've been praying for you and you're a fighter I'm GNA talk I'm going to talk about a fighter today named David and Sister Sarah I think maybe you have his Same Spirit go God bless you it's it's good to have you back in in the in service coffee family God bless you welcome brother I don't know your name behind the coffee family there what what's your name Mike Gibson Brother Mike God bless you welcome it's good to have you in service I think uh I got all the visitors I um the the prayer requests there was many they were talking about cancer and what a what an evil demon that cancer is one day the bride of Christ will sit at judgment and judge that demon and cast that demon to the place that it deserves to go how many people has that demon tormented over the years that is the one sickness when brother brandom received his commission there at Greens Mill that angel came to him and he said if you can get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and he singled that he singled that one disease out because it is a horrible disease and I'll tell you what there was many times that that disease got cast out and brother bram's and during his ministry and during his prayer lines and the same God that William brandham served is the same God that we serve and he's a he's a healing God he's the great physician and he is on the scene today and now we claim those we claim those healings we know that he can do it we know that he's done it and now Lord we just place it into your hands as was done earlier and we trust that all will be well in according to his his word we um appreciate I watched brother Ryan's sermon last night I think he did a really nice job I I really appreciate all that he said I really I really love that that young man he's he's got a calling in his life and and I often kid his Pastor um brother Steve Robson that uh I'm recruiting and um we uh we're going to make a deal to get him to come down here permanently and brother Steve fights me on that I don't know why um we we had a nice time when we went to Los Cruses um it was uh they're really sweet people there and uh brother Caleb has been a good close friend to me for a while now um they've really supported us here at the Tucson Tabernacle and I always want to do the same to them and uh going there it's nice but I'll tell you in ministering to the Believers there I it's not the same I just I love them and they they really love me especially to the youth and they're just they're just a a wonderful group of people but whenever I'm gone I just long to come back home and see these precious people in this audience and just see what the Lord's doing here and my place is here this is where I need to be Brother Martin your place is around all over the place all over the world but my spot is right here in in serving you people I think probably the highlight of my trip was the time I got to spend with brother Josiah and sister Katie on the drive and the numer family the Taylor stit family fryo uh kids it was just and uh sister Gracie your your son Eric what a what a good boy it is just really um really nice being with him and I tell you what they they play basketball when we got there and you know the kids walked out and there was this hush and all this sister Grace's son brother Eric he's like 6'5 and and I mean there's a great basketball player and they're like whoa Tucson Tabernacle has this professional basketball player so so I think he had a really good time since gra we we all had a good time but um brother Josiah and were talking on the way there and I was telling brother Josiah really about the vision that I have for this church and really what I think is the most important there's many churches around the world there's and and every church has a different Spirit not one really any better than the other I never want to compare them but with the Tucson Tabernacle is not a place that I think that especially here tonight brother Joel the pillars in the church seem to be more visible on Wednesday night it's really the a lot of the people that really put their shoulders to the wheel and really work hard and the Tucson Tabernacle I was telling brother Josiah it's not a place that you just come and sit back and hear how great you are and hear how much better you than you are than the denominations or or how you are the elect and you're you're God's chosen people and all that we hear that but you come here to the Tucson Tabernacle to have a Ministry yeah you are here to serve and to work and to go out and bring people to Jesus Christ and to make a difference in the world this is not the place to come and sit back and hear how great you are you are great I believe you're the greatest in the world okay I said it I'm not gonna say it anymore I'm just kidding you are a great people but there is so much work to be done brother Josiah gave me a scripture out of 1 Samuel before we get started I want to read it brother Jordan it's 1st Samuel chapter 22 verse 1 and I thought and I know brother Josiah was thinking the same thing when he gave it to me just now back there I believe this is part of the ministry that we have here at the Tabernacle it says this David therefore departed then and escaped to the cave agela and when his Brethren and his father and all his father's house heard it they went down tither to him and everyone that was into distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men and let me tell you those 400 did things that they went through the fire with David they did great things and they didn't lose a battle they they overcame great odds and that's what we should be here at the Tabernacle there are many people to serve there is a lot to do and never be afraid make a step brother Joel make a step go and if you fail you fail it's okay but try do everything that you can so this book this is our Wednesday night bible study it's not a normal service this is where we're going to go through every book of the Bible from Genesis and we'll go through at least the Old Testament all the way to Malachi we're in 1 Samuel now we just got through with the Book of Judges and Ruth now this book of Samuel is right after the Book of Judges some even say that Samuel was the last judge so after Israel was re rescued from Egypt by God they were brought into the promised land with Moses brought up to the Jordan River and then over with Joshua Israel was supposed to be obedient to God and follow his Commandments but Moses had died before they went into the promised land they went over then Joshua LED them he later dies and all that knew Joshua had died the Book of Judges can be summed up in this statement every man did that which was right in his own eyes basically there was very very poor leadership in the land of Israel at that time and it showed the importance of wise and godly leadership everywhere the books of first and first and 2 Samuel show what can happen with good leadership the book is a transition basically from the very lowest time in Israel's history to the very best time in the reign of King David and King Solomon and it's it's a history that goes through this transitional time and this man Samuel plays the pivotal part in taking them from the depths of sin into fellowship with God now there are four main characters in the book in this book of 1 Samuel there's Eli the priest there's Samuel the prophet there's Saul the king and then towards the end there's David and David is the answer to the question about good strong Godly leadership so it starts with a couple Hannah and her husband Elena Hannah was a tremendous sister she was a very f faithful lady a prayerful lady eleno was a good husband always encouraging his wife the problem is El that Hannah couldn't have children so Hannah was made fun of by by the elen's other wife and and she was just she wasn't treated right Elena loved her he even told her one time he said he said he said honey he says am I not better than 10 Sons just trying to make his wife know that that he loved her even though she couldn't give him children verse number 11 chapter 1 and Hannah vow a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give unto thine handm made a Manchild then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head so Samuel like Samson had a Nazarite vow from his birth and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth so Eli noticed her mouth moving now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken so she's praying and she's just mouthing the words and the priest seesar and he says this isn't normal that she must she must be drinking but really what was happening is she was in prayer and and praying to the Lord my friends sister Patricia God bless you it's good it's good to see you welcome my friends um we had a uh sister Patricia and the the fros and I had a little bible study the other day and it's good to have you sis in the family I'm looking forward to meeting your husband back there God bless you we're talking about this book of 1 Samuel and we're talking about we we just started and this sister this lady named Hannah couldn't have children and she's praying at the altar and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord she's just crying out Lord give me a baby I I just every everything that I have Lord It's just poured out before you count not thine handmade for a daughter of bile for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hither to that word bile it basically means worthless so she saying here don't regard your servant as a worthless woman then Eli and Eli is the priest Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou Hast asked of him and she said let thine hand made find Grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad look at the faith of Hannah so she was praying there and just the words of the priest when he said sister receive what you're asking for so she gets up and she remembers what the priest said and she has faith in her prayer so she gets up and she's feeling good and not sad anymore and her faith was raised up and now she is going to receive her prayer so who is this priest that said those words to Hannah this man Eli now remember as I said we're freshly out of the Book of Judges where every man did what was right in his own eyes and there was no strong leadership in Israel which allowed sin to just freely spread not only through the country but right here in the Pulpit through Eli's Sons so Hannah has her child she names him Samuel thus we have the book the name of the book 1 Samuel now first 1 and 2 Samuel let me stop right there first and 2 Samuel they're actually one book they were all written in one big long scroll and the reason that they're split into two is simply because they were too long so they were split into two separate books in 1 and 2 Samuel but they were actually originally written as one so remember there was no strong leadership in Israel and this resulted in sin so whatever you wanted to do you did it without receiving any correction from the church any any correction from the government or anyone else it was just a really bad time in Israel and at this time God is angry with the sons of Eli he's angry with the sons of this priest and his sons are also priests and God calls these men the sons of bile worthless Sons so God is calling the the young men the priests worthless and Hannah saying Lord Eli don't don't call me worthless so why were they worthless these priests these young men they would take the choice cuts of meat so they would bring in the offering the burnt offering to the priests and they would give this this meat for a burnt offering on the altar as we've learned from previous Bible studies what these burnt offerings were about so they would bring these offerings in and these priests they take the prime rib and the T-Bones and whatever the good cuts of meat were and they would bring them home with them not only that but they would take the money from the church and use it for their own personal gain and further they use their positions as priests to sleep with the young women that would come in to the sanctuary sinful but it's a carryover remember from This Book of Judges and things are about to change do this baby that's going to be born so a man of God comes to Eli remember Eli's kids Eli's Sons were these priests so a man of God comes to Eli and he prophesies this in in um 1st Samuel chapter 2:35 so this man comes to Eli speaking on behalf of the Lord and he says and I will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in thine heart in mine heart and in my mind and I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before my anointed forever that faithful priest was a young boy at the time and his name was Samuel and he would be one of the greatest prophets that has ever lived one of the greatest prophets in this Bible so after Hannah had given her son to the work of the Lord remember she promised that I give my son to to the the priest I I'll give him to the work of the Lord so he was trained under this man Eli and one night the young boy was laying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark was now the ark this is the same Ark that Moses built is just this wooden box is about 45 in Long long 25 in high 25 in wide there was Mana that had fallen from Heaven remember when they were wandering in the wilderness there was Mana that had fallen from Heaven inside of this Ark The Ten Commandments were in there and Aaron's Rod that had budded and bore almonds was also in there this is the ark that went before the Israelites and caused them to win the battles in the Book of Joshua this is the ark that went before the priests when they came up to the Jordan River and they were going to go across when the water dried up this is the ark that went before them and the priests walked into the river and they walked across on dry land while carrying this Ark this Ark was a big deal this is the ark Where They Carried around the walls of Jericho and these of this great walled City and the walls fell down when they blew the trumpets this is the ark and here is this young boy Samuel and he is sleeping near this Ark young Samuel was in the room and a voice called him said Samuel the boy got up and he went to Eli the priest and he says here I am he said you call me Eli said go back to bed I didn't call you then again a voice calls him Eli it says Samuel he goes back and he says here I am Eli he said you call me and he said go back to bed I didn't call you then it happens again a third time Eli was a man of God he understood these things and he understood that God was calling the young man so he says if this says if this calls you again then say Speak Lord for your servant heares now remember this is a little boy this man s this young man Samuel so God spoke to Samuel again and this started a relationship this is the first time that God had spoken to Samuel this started a relationship between God and His Prophet that really that the world had not seen since Moses from then on Samuel the the young boy would hear this voice of God and move forward and as Samuel grew he rose to the most prominent leader in all of Israel he provided strong leadership remember the leadership that was missing when everybody did which was right in their own eyes in J in judges well this man Samuel Rose and he provided good moral leadership for the Israelites then so the Israelites went to battle against the Philistines the Philistines are mentioned in the Book of Judges and they seem to be the most powerful force in the area at this time and right now they can be considered at this time they could be considered Israel's biggest enemy so they lose the battle and without praying or considering what they were doing they go to Shiloh where Eli was and they take the ark because they knew what had happened when this Ark goes before you they the Israelites take the ark and now they're going to go back to battle so remember the sons of Eli these worthless Sons they're still priests and they go with the ark so they go into the B they go into battle and the F Philistines end up capturing the ark bad bad deal that was that was that was not a good time this is the Arc of the Covenant I described what it was before so Eli who is now 98 years old and when when this this battle and when when these Philistines had captured the ark they also killed Eli's Sons so Eli who is now 98 years old and blind and fat the Bible says he's sitting in his chair and he's worried about this Ark and he's worried about the Battle and a messenger comes to Eli and tells him that Israel has lost the battle tens of thousands are dead and his two sons were killed buil but it was the last news that made the difference that the Ark of God had been captured by the Philistines when Eli heard this the 98-year old man fell backwards in his chair he hit the floor broke his neck and was dead and that's the closing of the chapter of this for this priest Eli so God ends up bringing curses so they take these Philistines they take this Ark and they put it next to to their God dagging in the same room so the next day they put it in there the next day this God dagin had fell down so they they set him back up and then they come back in the next day and he had fallen down again but this time his head was broken off and his head his hands were broken off so it scared it scared the Philistines to death because it's like okay well this is beating Our God so then they started to get sick many died tumors came on the people so they ended up bringing the ark back to Israel they got to get rid of this thing and they brought gifts with the ark you know what they brought you know what happened to them they got tumors and stuff they brought back five golden tors and then five golden mice so Samuel grows and Samuel leads Israel decades pass Samuel as I said before he provides strong leadership he provide he brings morality and repentance to Israel and he wins the confidence of the country through both his integrity and his relationship with the Lord this power and Leadership produced peace in Israel and the country was strong in military might and strong in in the spirit of the Lord so as Samuel Grew Older he started placing his sons in prominent positions now remember Eli Samuel's Sons were also not moral men and the people saw this and they saw how Samuel started to get older and it worried them that they were going that Samuel was going to pass away and they were going to be ruled by his sons so the people see the other countries around them how they have Kings and they go to Samuel and they asked him to find them a king to rule over them like the other countries had now remember there had never been a legitimate king in Israel so Israel they had never had a king and they always had a man of God who would speak on behalf of God and Lead but rejected that system now and they wanted to be like the other countries and this really grieved Samuel so Samuel he thought that they were rejecting him and they thought he thought that they were rejecting his leadership so you can see both sides right here put yourself in Samuel's position he's like hey he says have not I led you right and have not I been moral and did I ever take any your any of your money or anything like that and they're like no Samuel we love you but you're old man man you're getting old and your kids they're not you they don't have the character that you have so put your your um self in the people's shoes they're like what are we going to do when Samuel passes away the people were wrong in this but I can understand why that they said that so God tells Samuel to warn the people that they are going to regret this choice and they are going to get their King but this king is going to be about himself and he's not going to be concerned with your well-being and you're going to suffer and believe me they did regret this decision 1st Samuel chapter 8: 19 it says this nevertheless the people refused to refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the other nations all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles and Samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord so he heard what the people were saying then he goes before the Lord and he says Lord here's what the people are saying and the Lord said unto Sam said to Samuel into their voice listen to them and make them a king and Samuel said unto the men of Israel go ye every man unto his City so then God tells Samuel he says go and he says choose this rich man from The Tribe of Benjamin the best looking man in all of Israel Head and Shoulders taller than the other men the people had the wrong idea of what a leader should be they wanted a tall goodlooking strong Warrior to rep represent them to other countries and that was the desire of their heart to have a man that the world would respect rather than a man that God would respect Samuel brings all the people together to Crown Saul King and he tells them that this is your choice and you have disobeyed God 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse 24 says this and Samuel said to all the people see ye whom the Lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people so he's he's got Saul here and he's like look at what a great good-looking guy you have to lead you and all the people shouted and said God Save the King King then Samuel told the people the manner of kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord and Samuel sent the people away every man to his house so Samuel wrote some church bylaws here he wrote maybe what we would call a constitution he said you've made your choice but here are thing how are things going to run so he put this in writing and and then Saul also went home to gibba and there went with him a band of men whose Hearts God had touched it shows that Saul's Reign started off right really as far as him as far as Saul personally and God gave him every resource that he needed but the children of bile said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought no presence but he held his peace again worthless people and people complain you know they really do they're going to complain no matter what and here they are they got exactly what they wanted and they complained about it and right here maybe they were right brother martin but right here he says no these are worthless people the Bible says it these are worthless people that complained about that now when when I describe David I want you to notice the difference between what man would choose and what God chooses so Samuel is still upset he's hurt about the People's Choice for a king rather than God and he wants to make his point strongly so he does a miracle in front of the people so that it's a time of harvest so he he looks out and he brings down thunder and lightning and rain so the people notice that this man Samuel is bringing a miracle before us God is is with him and in 1st Samuel 12:19 all the and all the people said unto Samuel pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king 1219 is the is the scripture so do you see the repentance of the people and even though they made the wrong decision watch this God honors their humility and Samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the Lord will not forsake his people what a statement for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people I'll stop right there for moment and say we sin we make mistakes but it doesn't change the fact that we are God's people God's people are made up of individuals it's not like it's a it's the Tucson Tabernacle it's not like it's this group of people or that group of people it's individuals and it pleased God to make us his people and we always don't forget that no matter how many mistakes that we make never never forget that moreover Samuel speaking here he says moreover as for me now this is the man that was offended as for me God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right way what a sweet thing to say what a nice what a what a leader right there he says he says you done all this you're not going to you're not believing me you you've sinned in the sight of the Lord but I won't cease praying for you I will continue and I will continue to teach you the good and the right way no matter how much you stray I'm still going to do my job as the priest as the prophet of God only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he's done for you but if you shall do wickedly you shall be consumed both you and your king so it deeply really deeply touched me I've read that a few times over the past week but this morning I almost brother Jeremy almost cried thinking of Samuel and the kindness that he showed right there and loving the people so no matter how offended he was that they didn't trust him or trust the Lord for all that he had provided for them he still loved the people and he still prayed for them so star so Saul the king over here he started humble and he started little in his own eyes he won some battles and he made some good decisions he did a good job at the beginning but things started to change it started to be more about Saul in his ministry in his kingdom rather than serving the people and although a king he was a king and a spiritually Gifted Man he thought he could take the place of the Prophet So within a couple years of being King Saul makes his first big mistake and he performs a burnt offering that the priest Samuel should have performed he just got impatient first Samuel 13:13 says this and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue sa you made a big mistake here the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him him to be Captain over his people because thou Hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee thee that man after his own heart was this boy named David I was talking to my wife earlier and reading these and I said honey I said that mistake would have been very easy to make he was Samuel was running late and he's like we got to get the battle we got to get this we got to get this church done we got to get this an offering done so I'll just do it God took the Kingdom from him because of that what I would think is a little mistake but it was important to God so Saul continues in his mistakes and the last straw really for Samuel is when the Lord instructs Saul to go fight this group of people called the amalekites and here's what Samuel says but be first but first let me let me tell a story that's that's sandwiched right in there so Saul has a son this son's name is Jonathan so Jonathan turns out to be this great warrior in the Army so Jonathan and his armor they're going to battle against these Philistines so Jonathan and his armor Bearer armor Bearer is the guy Jonathan was important so he had a guy to carry his armor and his sword whatever he didn't he didn't want to carry this guy would carry it so he tells his armor Bearer he says they they come they come down this this Valley and there's these two big boulders on each side and Jonathan knows that there is a group of 20 Philistines up on the hill now remember these Philistines are big dudes they're not like little little guys like little Israelites they're big strong Warriors so Jonathan goes to his armor Bearer and he's like hey um let's you and me let's go up and fight these Philistines like just you and me so armor bear is like uh okay whatever you want to do Jonathan I'm with you so he says okay here's what we're gonna do we're we're gonna we're gonna sneak up there we're going to climb up the cliff so they the the Philistines had The High Ground so they were already at an advantage AG so he says here's what we're going to do we're going to climb up here and we're going to get up close to them and we're going to show ourselves it's like here we are two guys and if they say why don't you just stay down there and we'll come down there and fight you that means we'll go back but if they say hey why don't you come up here and fight us then we'll go up and and fight him so they're like armor bear is like okay I'm with you Jonathan imagine what this guy thought this armor bear Jonathan had Faith but this armor bear he's going up so Jonathan and the armor Bearer they come out from behind The Rock Says here we are the Philistines look down and they say ah the rats come out of their holes he said come up here and fight us you know that armor bear was like oh great they climb up to the top there was an acre of land Jonathan and his armor Bearer laid waste to these 20 seasoned Warriors and it caused such a stir among the Philistine Army that was about to fight the Israelites that they they got so afraid and they got so discombobulated that they started fighting each other so then Saul sees all this stuff going on and he's like let's go to battle so so the Israelites go to battle and these Philistines are fighting each other so the Israelites come in and they just destroy the whole Army so they they put him on the run so here comes Saul and Saul makes a great decision for a general he's got his Soldier they've been beaten and fighting and he makes he does something really smart and he says let's fast your guys are going they're fighting they're winning they're tired they're thirsty they're hungry and you're going to tell them they can't eat sometimes it may sound good to us but all sometimes it sounds that's a good idea let's do that as as a church I that that that'll really please the Lord but while it may be right over here it may not be right in this instance so he he says he said we're going to have a fast and anyone that breaks this fast is gonna die so Jonathan was doing his thing he's up there fighting and he comes down and there's a bunch of honey in this honeycomb he takes the tip of his Rod dips it in the honey and eats it witnessed by many people so what happened was it gets back to Saul that that someone had broken his commandment one thing leads to the next which leads to the next which leads to the next and then Jonathan comes before Saul and says I'm the one that at when you said not to so Saul said my commandment and you see the narcissist personality come out in Saul right here he said my commandment was that everyone fast and whoever breaks this fast you will be put to death so put Jonathan to death so the people said we not going to do it did you see what he did to those Philistines and you want to kill him they disobeyed the king and you know what it did it produced fear in Saul so Saul continues his mistakes and then the last straw was when Samuel gives instruction for Saul to go fight these amalekites and here's what Samuel says in chapter 15:3 he says go and smite amalec and destroy all that have have all that they have and spare them not very important here but slay both man and woman infant and suckling infant and little baby ox and sheep and camel and ass Saul goes to battle and defeats the amalekites but he doesn't kill the livestock the people wanted to keep the sheep and the goats and the cows so he lets them do what they wanted to do rather than what God had instructed and you can see the fear in Saul right here he fears the people again remember they had just told them we're not going to do what you say so the old Prophet shows up not only that but Saul had not killed the king of the am malachit this guy named name AAG so the old Prophet shows up and he's talking with Saul and he he hears the bleeding of the sheep Samuel does and he hears the sound of the livestock and he's like hey Saul what's that that I hear am I hearing sheep am I hearing cows Saul says yeah the people wanted them and and really I was afraid to tell him no so Samuel says bring me the king AAG told you to kill him too so the king walks up to Samuel very carefully he's in prison he walks up to Samuel and he's like um the killing's over right well killing was not over 1 Samuel 15:33 and Samuel said as thy sword speaking to this King AAG as thy sword has made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hewed AAG into pieces before the Lord in in in gilgal then Samuel went to Rama and Saul went up to his house in giba of Saul and Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the Lord repented Ed that he had made Saul King over Israel wow while the king of Israel Saul is showing all the wrong character traits of a king there's a young man from the tribe of Judah the youngest son to a man named Jesse who God was working on behind the scenes building his character this young boy was named David Samuel anoints David King when he's between 10 and 15 years old God what brings that what brings that to be is God sends Samuel to this man named Jesse with the instructions to anoint one of his sons King over Israel when the oldest son came before Samuel the first one the best looking one the oldest child's always the best looking one he had all the gifts that Saul had he was the perfect choice 1st Samuel 16 Verse 6 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab and said surely the Lord's Anointed The Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said to Samuel look notd on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused used him for the Lord Lord seeth not as a man seeth for a man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart then Jesse called abinadab and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shimada pass by and said neither hath the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen these he had eight Sons seven of them came before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse here are are here all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down until he comes hither and he sent and brought him in now he was r and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at and the Lord said arise and anoint him for this is he so Saul continues on the throne so he anoints this young man David a very strange thing King but yet Saul stays on the throne for decades after that goes to show that God may have chosen any of us to do a great work for for him but he has a perfect time for that work to come to pass David although he was the rightful king of Israel from that moment he always had the utmost respect for King Saul and the position that the king held in Israel you never talked bad about him and as you'll see here in a few minutes he protected the king so David is a man full of gifts he becomes a great leader a great warrior and he's also a gifted musician and eventually he finds himself playing music in Saul's home Saul loved King Saul loved David and he loved the music so much that David became Saul's personal armor bear D this man Saul he struggled and he would get really down and and you see this this person personality of kind of a narcissist in Saul that he was always thinking about himself he was always worried that somebody was going to take his kingdom or take something that's his and it really started to ruin his life so Goliath so David becomes in Saul's court and he starts playing for Saul and Saul really enjoyed David's playing David's musician U musical Talent so Here Comes This Philistines this Army of Philistines and here we got another War Brewing so we have the Philistines they come and then and then we have the is is the um Jews they come this way and they meet in this Valley and they are going to go to battle and the the Jews are hooting and hollering and they're saying we're going to do it we you know we're going to kill them and we've got the upper hand and then as they are cheering Here Comes This giant almost 10 feet tall they went whoa and they ran away this man comes out with this Shield this sword and this Spear and he comes down and he says Hey Saul why don't you come down and fight me he says why don't you just send one person to come out and fight me why do we all have to die why is there going to be so much Bloodshed just have one come against me me and if I win you serve us and if you kill me then we'll serve you and the Jews were scared to death and he keeps taunting them this giant very intimidating man so David he's out with his sheep his dad's sheep and he's cruising along and his dad says hey son he says hey bring your brother some bread and bring uh this Captain bring him some cheese and David says okay so he takes it and and he's cruising along and he comes down and he's like hey guys what's going on and he sees this giant out there and everybody's afraid of him so David looks and it disgusts him David is a man of great faith and he says listen this this uncircumcised Philistine this uncivilized man is taunting all of us and you're all afraid of him so he starts talking and Saul starts hearing who is this guy what's this this little guy so this little guy comes up David's like I'll fight him I'll fight that guy God's with us why are you so afraid so Saul's like I like his Spirit you know I like I like this kid so he says okay um and then you know had to be thinking well he's going to get killed so then David says listen Saul he says one time I was keeping my father's sheep and he says a lion came to get my father's sheep now who would you bet on would you bet on one of those big African lions or would you bet on Goliath I don't know it would be a good fight but David said this lion came in and he says I took my sling and I killed him and he rose up to get me and I kill killed him with a knife and he says and another time a bear did the same thing he says I can do it he says I've done it before I'll go kill that guy so Saul looks down and he says well let me put on won you put on my armor Saul's like seven feet tall and David's like five feet tall so he puts on an armor he's like man this is way too big I can't even walk in this stuff David says just let me do it let me do it my way so he takes off the armor and he goes down there with his little sling and he walks down to the creek picks up five Stones puts him in his script bag he looks out across and he sees this giant there this giant says oh he's like come on you're sending that guy to fight me this little squirt he doesn't even have armor on you're sending him to fight me so all the Philistines are watching this too too so David listen to the watch the faith of David David doesn't just like walk up and David takes off running at the Philistine look at the faith that is in this man David this little this young man David and he's he's running at the Philistine he takes his sling he takes one of those smooth stones that he got out of the creek puts it in his sling throws it and this rock goes right and hits this Philistine right in the head the Bible says that it sunk into his head the giant goes down it also says this is the literal version the AL It also says that David didn't have a sword with him here's this here's this giant he's laying there David Goes takes Goliath's sword and chops off the Giant's head the Philistines were like whoa that's like the smallest guy in their army I'm out of here they take off running the the Israelites go after them and the Israelites just lay waste to these Philistines so that's David just shows David's faith in God so Saul sees this young man and he starts promoting David and David makes friends with Jonathan remember the warrior remember Saul's son David makes friends with this Jonathan and they become really they become best friends like really close and everywhere David went he was successful he won battle after battle after battle for Saul and one day when David was returning from Battle the women were singing this is a bad deal for David the women were singing Saul's sin this guy come in he's like oh you want again here he comes and the women sing this song they say Saul has struck down his thousands and David his 10 thousands Saul took notice and a spirit of jealousy began to form inside the king and from that day on Saul hated began hating David and trying to kill him the first time the anger came up in Saul he picked up a javelin and he said I'll pin him to the wall and he Chucks this Javelin David Dodges it sticks to the wall and David gets out twice Saul did that Saul was afraid of David because the Bible says he knew that the Lord was with him so Saul gave David a thousand men and send him to battle with the enemies thinking that David he's going to go out and he's going to come back dead so he sends David out and he over and over David fights battles and it was insurmountable odds yet David would come back Victorious so D Saul I forgot to mention had made a promise that whoever kills this giant would get to marry his daughter so David this humbleness of David he said he says I'm not worthy to be the king's son-in-law this is the same man that was anointed king I'm not even worthy to be his son-in-law he ends up going to the ends of the Earth for Saul and winning the impossible battles so that Saul hoped David would die in these battles every time he'd send him on suicide missions David would come back Victorious Saul even plotted to murder David when he returned home from the battle and Jonathan Saul's son warned him and that Spirit would come and go from Saul that hatred of him so cha Saul chases him so it's D D um Jonathan ends up warning David that's hey Saul's coming at you this time so David takes off Saul goes out after David to kill him he brings his army to chase down David and David this man's done nothing except support Saul twice David has the opportunity to kill Saul once Saul was in the cave David and his men were hiding in the cave Saul didn't know they were there Saul comes in to use the restroom David's hiding he comes up to Saul cuts off the bottom of his skirt Saul leaves and another time Saul and his army were asleep and David slips in and steals Saul's Spear and his water bottle while they're asleep both times David repented felt bad for dishonoring Saul what a man this man David was I was reading about him the past few days and thinking Lord how could how could so much character be in one man how much he respected this man was trying to kill him and yet David would never raise his hand against him he even felt bad for stealing a spear sneaking in chapter 25 David meets what would one day David's on the run which is most now the second half of the book of Samuel 1 Samuel David's on on the run and he meets what would become his his second wife he married Saul's daughter this lady named Abigail who at the time was married to an evil drunk guy named nabal David asked for food from nabal and he insults David and his soldiers and this angers the whole Army to where they're like hey we're going to go kill this dude and Abigail his wife comes to her husband's Rescue by sending out food and begging for mercy for her husband nael ends up getting drunk and when he sobers up his wife tells him that she sent help to David and his soldiers and the man ends up having a heart attack and dies 10 days later so so Saul is keeps trying to kill David and David's always a step ahead of him David goes through horrible times hiding in caves and seeing his friends killed just for helping him and yet through all the evil that Saul did David David never turns on Saul he finds a little bit of Peace when he lives with with the Philistines for a year and four months but all the while David was helping Israel secretly killing Israel's enemies right under the nose of the Philistines what a man still helping his people right under the nose of the of where he found peace yet still fighting for the king and for his people Samuel dies in chapter 28 just before a big war between Israel and the Philistines Saul wasn't serving the lord so when he tried to pray God wouldn't hear God wouldn't answer answer him so he ends up going to a witch who he thinks will let him talk to the dead man Samuel remember Samuel just died so he goes to this witch and he's like hey I I need to talk to Samuel and somehow it works the witch tells Saul what Samuel says and basically it's that Saul would die in battle and that God would give the kingdom to David and that Israel would lose this battle against the Philistines and that tomorrow both Saul and his sons would be with Samuel on the other side very strange story I really don't understand it at all but the thing that I take from this story is that God had mercy on this King Saul even at his death because he says that Saul after his death would be with one of the greatest prophets in history the prophet Samuel so Saul loses the battle as Samuel said and he along with most of his sons die and it's sad what they do to Saul's body if uh the musicians would come and we'll close with this 1st Samuel chapter 31 verse 8 says this and it came to pass on the marrow when the Philistines came to strip the slain that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount gaboa and they cut off his head and they stripped off his armor and sent it into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people just desecrating Saul's body and putting it on display and they put his armor in the house of ashteroth their God and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth sham and when the inhabitants of jabis Gil Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul all the Valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall at ban and came to jabish and burnt them there and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabus jabish and fasted seven days let's all stand we'll close that is the end of the first book of Samuel this is a great time in history Samuel as I showed was one of the greatest men that's written in this whole book and I've never have read with the exception of the Lord Jesus I've never read about a man that had such character and that had such patience and really that had such love as David this young man you can see why that it says that he was a man after God's Own Heart so that's the book of 1 Samuel brothers and sisters let's continue on with our Bible study I was telling Stephan on the way here that I wish more people would have would have come and enjoyed the book of Acts because it it really was it was a blessing in all that we learned about that now we are going through this Bible and it's building this knowledge in us and we have to have knowledge whenever we talk to someone and we don't speak like we un understand or know this Bible it hurts our testimony the more we know about this word the more that we are able to use this word and to witness now now it doesn't understand or knowledge doesn't take the place of worship but then worship doesn't take the place of knowledge either we need both of them so let's continue on continue on studying if we get through this we're gonna have read our whole Bible so let's continue on brother Josiah if you could sing us a song in closing well victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan get me behind Victory today is mine when I woke this morning when I woke this morning I didn't have no doubt I knew that the Lord would bring

I It reminded me the one time I've been out on the boat in the ocean as I was just singing that song as just a young boy. Dad's boss took us out on the out there in the the Pacific. And we went out what seemed like forever, but it wasn't that far. Just when you're little, everything is different in perspective. And we got out into the waves up and down. And uh it's like, \"Lord, don't let this boat flip. Lord, don't let this Nothing happened here.\" Yeah. And those that have been on the boat, knew how the boat worked. They were not worried. Right. The owner and the the pilot, they were doing fine. It was us young ones who were in there the first time were holding on this side. But when you get to know him, and you know, he anchors you. Amen. You can take a hold of his hand, say, \"I'm safe ever more.\" Amen. And that chorus of through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. You know how you learn? By experience. Oh, through it all. Oh, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Oh, through it all. Oh, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon.

Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Through it all. Through it all. I see Chloe and Asher. They're here. And they're getting old enough to understand that Papa and Mama do mess up sometimes. But there was a time that daddy, papa, mama, grandpa, grandma could do no wrong. You know, they they could they could solve everything, take care of everything. And that was when $1 was so much to them cuz they didn't know the value of money yet. Now it's papa. How about a 20? You know, but you know, when you when you learn you get to know him, there is no fear. Through it all, I've learned to trust him. [Music] So I see that I missed the other song. There's the look I was waiting for. Okay. Thanks. The battle is the Lord's. It is. We make it our battle sometimes. But he says, you know, give it to me. And sorry, I'm making the the sound people there work a little extra today. So We can get the words up [Music] there. I don't know them off the top of my head. [Music] There is a soul in time of need that gives me hope. That brings me peace in every trial. Through every turn, my savior stands in my defense. So when the road you walk, leaves you tired and warm, all your strength is gone and your heart feels torn. Remember, God is greater than the [Music] storm. Take courage for the battle is alone.

Remember, God is greater than the storm. Take courage for the battle is the Lord. Remember God's greater than the storm. Take courage for the battle is the Lord. Amen. And he's never lost a battle. That's right. He's never come close to losing a battle. It looked like when he was on the cross that oh this our deliverer has lost. No. The greatest deliverance was getting ready to come. One you could not do for yourself. So he said I'll do it for you. Yeah. Amen. And you know why? Because he loves you. Oh how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me.

Good evening and welcome once again to our Wednesday night Bible study. As I'm sure you know by now, we've been studying the life of Joseph. This evening is part eight, and tonight we'll conclude this series. We'll also look a bit beyond his life and review some of the lessons we can take from his life and apply to our lives. Before we resume our study, let's join together one more time in prayer. Lord Jesus, our sufficiency lies in you. Lord, I'm certainly inadequate to stand here and say anything, but Lord, it's your grace. It's your mercy. It's your love that empowers and enables us. It's it's the blood that you shed. It's the price that you paid to redeem us to yourself. And Lord, we're so grateful. There truly is no one else no one else like you. Lord, as we're studying the life of Joseph and seeing how he models, how he types, how he how he shows attributes that you would fully manifest when you were here and that you're still manifesting today through your Holy Spirit in each of us. Lord, we pray that you would forgive us where we fall short. Open our hearts, Lord. Help us to be receptive to your word. guard my lips, Lord, that I say nothing that would cause anyone any difficulty, anyone to stumble, anyone to be misdirected in any way, but Lord, we just our desire is to draw closer to you, to be yielded to the spirit of Christ. And Lord, drawing closer to one another. We're so grateful for this opportunity and this privilege that we have. We commit the remainder of this evening now to you in Jesus precious name. Amen. While you're standing, I I'd like to start by reading a short passage from Deuteronomy chapter 32. It's about the Exodus. But there would have been no Exodus from Egypt if under Moses if there had not been a migration to Egypt under Joseph. Moses is reminding the people he has led for many decades about their history, about their roots. He says,\"Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask thy father and he'll show you thy elders and they will tell thee.\" Do we do this? Can we summarize our history as Christians from its foundations in Genesis to the present day? The Jewish people divide their Torah, the five books of Moses, into 52 divisions. and they read the entire set every year in their synagogue services. How often do we read and review the Gospels, for example? How can we know the God of the word if we don't know the word of God? Hence our review of the Old Testament last year and now looking at the lives of some of its major characters. Moses goes on, \"When the Most High divided the nations to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people, the the borders of the land according to the number of the children of Israel. For the Lord's portion is what? his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. And Paul likening Israel to an olive tree tells us we Gentiles were grafted in not to replace, not to supplant, but to join into the inheritance of eternal life through Jesus Christ. Lord, the Lord found Israel in a desert land in the waste howling wilderness. He led them about. He instructed them. He kept him as the apple of his eye. As the eagle stirth up her nest, flutterth over her young, spreadth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange God in him. Please be seated. We ended last time with Jacob and his extended family relocating from Canaan to Gan, the best of the land of Egypt. To use the metaphor from Deuteronomy, the place where the eagle built the nest and would raise the chicks. Also, last week I indicated I said something probably a little strange. I said that Joseph was the master publican. But I hope I hope you've considered that statement, given it some careful thought. The Bible studies we doing are not intended to be one and done or enjoyed and quickly forgotten. I use the word publican deliberately. Why? The word publican simply means a person who is a collector of public revenue. But this word has a very negative connotation with us. It's a pjorative term because of the New Testament perspective on publicans. They were hated in Jesus' day because they had a reputation for overcharging and lining their own pockets. Now, Joseph did collect taxes. We read in uh Genesis 41, Joseph was 30 years old when he interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and and stood before the king. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt. And in the seven plenteous years, the earth brought forth by handfuls. Joseph gathered up all the food via 20% tax of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities, the food of the field, which was round about every city, lady up in the same, in the granaries near those cities, within the cities. Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number. It was more than their number system could accommodate. But he did not line his own pockets. He collected and protected the grain. We're accustomed to an economy based on money currency used as a means of exchange representing value. And ancient times economy was more barterbased. Swap grain for bricks for example. Abraham's wealth was described in terms of livestock, as was Job's. Gold and silver were used as well, but measured by weight. The first coins were minted in Lydia, part of modern-day Turkey, and approximately 630 BC, more than a thousand years after Joseph. When the time came to sell the grain, we read Joseph gathered up all the money, that is the silver and gold that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the silver and gold into Pharaoh's house, not Joseph's house. And when the money ran out, Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. For the Egyptians sold every man his field, because a famine prevailed over them. So the land became Pharaoh's not Joseph's. Though it was through this mechanism that Israel had land granted by Pharaoh on which to live and to thrive. Joseph was a man of great personal integrity. When writing the account of Joseph's life, Moses never even hinted that Joseph was ethically dishonest as in his role as the vizier of Egypt, the viceroy. Finally, note what Joseph said his mission was. What he said was his understanding of why God sent him to Egypt through the treachery of his older siblings. It was not for personal gain or to create generational wealth to be hoarded or invested. The first was to save many lives. If he had not done what he did during the years of plenty, hundreds of thousands of people would have perished. Amen. Joseph said unto his brethren, \"Come near to me, I pray you.\" And they came near. And he said, \"I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. Now therefore, be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither, for God did send me before you.\" Why? To preserve life. The second was to preserve and protect Jacob and his descendants. Joseph's family through the political system that existed in Egypt at that time in history. He was able to secure land that was ideal for them to settle in, flourish, and become a nation. He said, \"God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\" Skipping to verse 10. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gan, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast. Why? For what purpose? To exploit them, to lord it over them? No. And there will I nourish thee. For yet there are five years of famine, lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty. Pharaoh became extremely wealthy and powerful as a result of Joseph's efforts and this enabled Israel to survive and flourish. God then used Egypt to provide for and protect them while the chicks were growing in the nest and go. We learn later in the Torah, the Pentatuk, the five books of Moses, that God sent in motion events that would eventually force the nation of Israel to leave the security of Gan and Egypt and return to Canaan. Pull the feathers out of the nest, make them uncomfortable, make them willing to leave. That was the territory, the land of promise to Abraham. And the return would be under the political and spiritual leadership of Moses, followed by the military leadership of Joshua. We read about this in our opening verses in Deuteronomy. Last time we stopped at the end of chapter 47. Let's pick up our story with the last five verses of chapter 47. Verse 27. And Israel, Joseph's dad, also known as Jacob. Sometimes we get confused. Israel is a nation. In this case, Israel means Jacob. It means the man. It means Joseph's father. Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Gan. And they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly. It was a good nest. Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years. So the whole age of Jacob was 147 years. How many years did Joseph live under Jacob's loving care before his brother sold him to be a slave in Egypt? 17. How many years did Jacob live under Joseph's loving care in the land of Egypt? 17. And the time drew near that Israel must die. And he called his son Joseph and said unto him, \"If now I I have found grace in thy sight, uh, put, I pray thee, thy thy hand under my thigh, deal kindly and truly with me. Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt, but I will I want to lie with my fathers. Thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.\" And Joseph said,\"I will do as thou hast said.\" And Israel said, \"Swear unto me.\" And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. Chapter 48. It came to pass after these things that one told Joseph, \"Behold, your father's sick.\" And Joseph set off to see his father and took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. Notice Joseph and the son's order. Manasseh, Ephraim, the birth order. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. It it's so easy to just read this as a story, some historical event divorced from our lives today. But this is a personal story. It's filled with emotion. Yeah. Joseph's dad is very, very old. And now Joseph learns that his dad is really, really sick. How many of us have had a similar experience? Going to see an aging parent taken ill, wondering if it's the last time we'll see them, be able to let them know we love them. share final moments. And Jacob struggling to sit on his bed, he's too weak to get up and go sit in a chair, said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at L, later known as Bethl, in the land of Canaan. At the time, he was fleeing for his life from his brother Esau. And God blessed me. And God said unto me, \"Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee. I will make of thee a multitude of people. I will give this land to thy descendants after thee for an everlasting possession.\" That's Genesis 28:10-19. And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Notice Jacob and the order. Secondborn is listed first. Jacob is Jacob. Which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt. They're mine. As Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. Joseph, I'm adopting them. and thy issue which thou be getest after them. Any sons you have after these two. Keep in mind Joseph is almost 60 years old now. And Azeneath his wife is likely at least in her late 40s or early 50s. Any children you have after this shall be thine. And now referring back to Manasseh and Ephraim shall be called after the name of their brethren and their inheritance. In other words, they have the same status and rights of inheritance as their two oldest uncles, greater than their cousins. And then the focus of Jacob's conversation seems to begin to wander. Where where was I? He starts to reminisce. As for me, when when I came from Padanaram in Syria, your mother Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephereth. And I buried there in the way of Ephereth, the same as Bethlehem. And Israel became aware of the presence of Joseph's sons and said, \"Who who are these? I I thought it was just you and I here.\" the the fellow said, \"Joseph is coming. Who who's there?\" And Joseph said unto his father, \"They are my sons whom God hath given me in this place.\" And Jacob said, \"But bring them. I I pray thee unto me. I I will bless them.\" Now the eyes of Israel were dimmed for age. In other words, he had cataracts so that he could not see. And Joseph brought Manasseh and Ephraim near unto Jacob to Israel. And and Jacob kissed them and embraced them. And Israel turned and said to Joseph, \"I had not thought to see thy face, and lo, God hath showed me also thy children.\" And Joseph brought them out from between Israel's knees. They were probably at the foot of Israel's bed and likely bowing to him just respectfully there. And Joseph bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph then rose up and took them both Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto him. Now, we sometimes envision these two boys as children being led by the hand. They were born during the years of plenty. So, around 10 or 12 when Jacob arrived. This is 17 years later. So, they're close to 30 years old as this scene unfolds. And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manass's head, guiding his hands willingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. The young men are probably kneeling next to the bed on either side so Jacob can touch their heads for the blessing. And Israel blessed Joseph and said, \"God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the the angel which redeemed me from all evil. Bless the lads. Let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. When Joseph saw that his father had laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head, put it onto Manass's head. Joseph said unto his father, \"Oops, not so, my father, but this is the firstborn. Put thy right hand upon his head.\" Dad, your mind was wandering earlier. Now your hands are wandering too. You crossed your arms when blessing my sons. You're confused. This is important. Let me help you. And his father refused and said, I know it, my son. I know it. He also shall become a people. He also shall be great, but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations. Brother Brandham referred to this multiple times in uh in the countdown from 1964. And he Jacob or Israel had to take Joseph's two sons, Ephri and Manasseh, the the prophet's children, and bless them. And when he did, his hands crossed and and Joseph said, \"Father, not so. Put your hands on Ephraim. It should be on Manasseh.\" Israel said, \"God crossed my hands.\" Taking it from the older son, the law. And putting it up over on Christ. And through that come through the cross come the change of the birthright. Amen. To the younger son. Oh my, how wonderful. Back to Genesis. And Israel blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And Israel set Ephraim before Manasseh. And is Israel said unto Joseph, \"Behold, I die. But God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\" The way things were in those days, the firstborn would inherit a double portion. Jacob has made clear Joseph's position as having the rights and inheritance of the firstborn in that society at that time. And adopting Manasseh and Ephraim, they will get two territories in the eventual return to Canaan under Joshua rather than one, which would have been to Joseph and have been the case if Israel had not adopted these two. The reference to taking from the Amorites by violence may be a reference to the destruction of Sheckchham, although Jacob disavowed this action and condemns Simeon and Levi because of it. However, Joseph's remains will eventually be buried near Shechum and the plot of land Jacob bought before the slaughter of the people of Sheckchham because of the treatment Dina had suffered at their hand. Chapter 49. And Jacob called unto his sons and said, \"Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together and hear, you sons of Jacob. Hearken unto Israel your father.\" And now Jacob speaks to each of his 12 sons, not including Manasseh and Ephraim. surprise. I'm not going to read these this evening. Our focus is the life of Joseph. And many of the things said by Jacob are difficult to understand, particularly in the context of the last days. Brother Brandham referring to this section of Genesis a few times basically said that they would all be in the land of Israel in the last days. And that's what Jacob said. He never broke down any of the individual blessings that I've been able to find. So he blesses each of his sons. And we get to verse 28. All these are the 12 tribes of Israel. And this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them. Everyone according to his blessing. He blessed them. And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people, bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hitittite, in the cave that is in the field of Mella, which is near Mamray, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hitittite, for a possession of a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebecca, his wife. There I buried Leia. The the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from from the children of Heath. When Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost, the spirit was gathered unto his people. The story of Joseph is deeply entwined with that of Jacob. Recall the opening verses of chapter 37 when we started this series. 371, Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. Interesting way to introduce Joseph. Verse three. Israel loved Joseph more than all his children. Back to our story. Jacob has just died in the presence of his sons. Chapter 50. Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him. Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. And the physicians embombed Israel. It's the the mummification process of Egypt. And 40 days were fulfilled for him. That's how long it takes to perform mummification. For so are fulfilled the days of those which are embaled. And the Egyptians mourned for him for three score in 10 days. 70 days was a standard period for mourning a VIP in Egypt. Remember what we think of as Judaism, Old Testament burial practice had not been originated. This is all hundreds of years before the Exodus. And when the days of Israel's mourning were passed, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh. Joseph didn't speak to Pharaoh. He spoke to the house of Pharaoh to speak to Pharaoh on his behalf, carefully observing Egyptian protocol for his request, saying, \"If now I have found grace in your eyes to the house of Pharaoh, speak for me, I pray you, and the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My father Jacob made me swear, saying, Lo, I die, and my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.\" Now therefore, let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again to Egypt. And Pharaoh said, Go up, bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. And Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father Jacob. And with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt. The Egyptians are bestowing a huge honor, recognizing Joseph's importance by honoring his father in this way. and all the house of Joseph and his brethren and his father's house, only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of Gan. Further evidence to Pharaoh that Joseph will return as he has promised. And there went up with Joseph both chariots, solid wheeled carts as we've discussed before, and horsemen. And it was a very great company. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan. And there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. And Joseph made a mourning for his father. Seven days. Seven days. Mourning is standard practice in Judaism to this day called sitting Shiva. Shiva is the word for seven. Notice something interesting here. The company did not go the most direct route to Canaan, but went a longer route, requiring them to cross the Jordan. This is most likely a similar route used by Moses, with the exception that Moses deterred much further to get to Mount Si. There's extensive Jewish tradition regarding this route, the order in which the 12 sons carried his cactus, the dates, and so forth. I I put a URL at the bottom of the slide if you want to find out more about these traditions and also in tonight's handout. It's uh it's listed there as well. Joseph did not return to Canaan along the route taken by the spice traders 40 years earlier. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites saw the mourning and the floor of a tad, they said, \"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. Wherefore the name of it was called Abel Misraim. Abel meaning morning and Misraim being the name of Egypt, the morning of the Egyptians, which is beyond Jordan. And Jacob's sons did unto him according as he commanded them. for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Mechilla which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephron the Hittite before Mamray. And Joseph returned unto Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father. Notice the route back is pretty direct. The rabbis also say that Joseph returned on the same route of the spice traders. This of course would have a profound effect on his brothers as well as bring back many unhappy memories for him. Now, the next few verses we're going to read may be a flashback to when Jacob died during the embombing and mourning period rather than after the return of the journey to bury his remains. Kind of a sidebar, something to pay attention to, to notice when you're reading in the Old Testament accounts of uh of different characters and the gospel accounts as well. They're not always chronological. The writers were more concerned about finishing a a thread of content than keeping all of the events in strict time sequence. Each thread tends to be in time order or sequential, but the various threads are often interwoven in time with many flashbacks and many flash forwards. You see that especially in the Gospel of Luke. It's it's very apparent. So from Genesis 49:28 that we've read when Jacob says he's dying through to 5014 that we just finished reading the family returning to Egypt, the threat is of Jacob's dying wish and its fulfillment. So Moses wanted to carry this all the way through and not interrupt it with other considerations. The attitudes of the brothers aren't relevant to this. But the next verses we're going to read from verses 15 to 21, that's another thread that tells of the brother's attitude and Joseph's response. In terms of storyline threads and lessons, it's it's a separate thread. Chronologically, it may have occurred at any point after Jacob's death. Just because it's presented after the return to Goan doesn't mean that it necessarily took place after the return. Back to our story. When Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, suggesting that this was concurrent with Jacob's death early in the inbombing period, clearly they didn't need to go to Cain and bury him and come all the way back to realize that he was dead. When they saw the father was dead, they said, \"Joseph will probably hate us. And even if he doesn't exactly hate us, he will certainly requite us. He will certainly pay us back for all the evil which we did unto him.\" So, so from their fear, they said about being their father's sons. They sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, \"Thy father uh did command before he died.\" It's doubtful that he did. Did command before he died, saying, \"So shall ye say unto Joseph, forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren in their sin, for they did unto thee evil. And and now we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.\" And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. Joseph wept. What's happening? The brothers cannot accept the grace and love of the brother they hated and had mistreated. They are afraid. It's maybe it's just all an act for Joseph to reunite with Jacob, the father who loved him so much. With Jacob gone, they've heard that Joseph will now punish them harshly. Here's a related little story fragment from brother Brandham about an incident in the Civil War where an unnamed man came to President Lincoln sinking seeking a pardon for a soldier who was to be executed from tested faith produces goods. And Mr. Lincoln, kind-hearted, generous Christian gentleman as he was, said, \"I'll do that.\" and he wrote on a little piece of paper, \"Pardon so and so, Abraham Lincoln.\" And the man rushed back as quick as he could to the prisoner and he said, \"Sir, I have your pardon.\" And he laid it before him. Oh, he said, \"That's not a pardon. It's just a piece of paper.\" But he said, \"It's your pardon. Look, Mr. Lincoln's name is on it. He's the president of the United States.\" He said, \"If it was Mr. Lincoln's correct paper to be gold trimmed. It would have a seal and so forth. He said, \"But but sir, that's the president's signature.\" And he refused to receive it. Thought the fellow was only making his life even more miserable. The next morning, he was shot at sunrise. Then there was a signed declaration from the president of the United States that the man was pardoned the day before. And here he was shot. Now what? It was tried in the federal courts of our land. And here was their decision. A pardon is not a pardon except it be received as a pardon. That's what every word of God is. It's salvation to those who receive it that way. It's healing to those who receive it is healing. His brother's rejection of Joseph's forgiveness is what drives Joseph to tears. He cannot understand why they continue to reject him, his love for them, his grace towards them. And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and they said, \"Behold, we be thy servants rather than be prisoners or or executed for their evil deeds of the past. Joseph said unto them, \"Fear not. Am am I in the place of God?\" It's so much like us. Sometimes we so often hide behind, Lord, I'm not worthy. Another way of saying, \"My sin is greater than your power to forgive. So I have to do something besides repenting to earn your favor.\" Joseph goes on, \"But as for you, you thought evil against me, and that's what motivated your actions toward me. You're correct in knowing that I've not forgotten. How can I?\" But you are wrong in believing I have not forgiven you of your sin against me. and as you have seen and experienced. But God meant it unto good. Paul perhaps thinking of Joseph's life would later write Romans 8:28. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose. God meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. Now therefore, fear ye not. I will nourish you and your little ones. Again, a model of the Christ, who would later say in Luke 12:32, \"Fear not, little flock. It's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.\" And Joseph comforted them and spake kindly unto them. And now the the final thread of this story. Moses summarizes the rest of Joseph's life, the final 53 years. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house. And Joseph lived 110 years. Took 12 chapters to cover 57 years. Now we take one verse to cover 53. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation, his great great grandchildren. The children also of Mahair, the son of Manasseh, were brought up up upon Joseph's knees as great grandchildren. And that doesn't mean that he raised them on his knees. It means he lifted them up upon his knees. Hey kid, oh, you're getting too big for my lap now. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die. God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to Abraham to Isaac to our father Jacob. Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So, Joseph died being 110 years old and they embombed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. Genesis opens, \"In the beginning, God encloses in a coffin in Egypt.\" What a contrast. Genesis spends only the first two chapters describing creation and quickly getting to the first people. The next 48 chapters deal with people. This tells us something about God and the reason for his creation. Of the 48 chapters of Genesis that deal with people, 12 of them, fully one quarter, are about the life of one man, Joseph. Now, at the end of our story of Genesis, it's 1806 BC. Joseph has died, but his story isn't over. Notice, when Jacob died, Joseph was allowed to travel to Canaan and bury him. Pharaoh not only gave permission, but sent a high ranking delegation and an honor guard. But when Joseph dies, he extracts a promise from his people to carry his bones, not his body. but his body long dead, reduced to bones when they leave Egypt. Let's take a closer look. Why not just take his coffin to Canaan and bury him then as was done for Jacob? Let's take a closer look at that that one verse, that last 53 years of Joseph's life. Here we have a timeline of Joseph's life like we used in part four. And by now you all know to bring binoculars or opera glasses or or you have you know really superior vision there in the back so you can see all that. This time I've added Jacob's death age 147 1859 or 1860 BC and Joseph's death age 110 in 1806 BC. There's another important moment in time that we have not yet shown or discussed. First a review from Exodus. It relates Jacob's entry to Egypt with the Exodus, that time anchor of the Exodus. Exodus 12. Now the sojouring of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years. And came to pass at the end of the 430 years, even the self-same day it came to pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. So that was 18. That was 1446 BC of the Exodus. 1876 is when Jacob came. But there's another one we hadn't talked about. Genesis 15. The The Lord said to Abram, \"Know of assurityity that thy descendants shall be a stranger and a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years.\" 400 years, not 430. and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance. So this shows the approximate start time of the oppression 1846 BC. It's 30 years after Jacob arrived and 40 years before Joseph dies. And this this time of oppression, the beginning of it, it's not necessarily slavery and making bricks without straw. That's to pull the feathers out of the nest and get them out of there, but the beginning of restrictions on their freedoms. Here I've added the pharaohs that we saw before along with a time anchor that we had from uh establishing the year of Senorus threat 3 so we could synchronize all of these pharaohs. But let's add the rest of the pharaohs of Joseph's life. We see that Senus 3's son, Amenhat III, took the throne of a transformed Egypt about the time of Jacob's passing. This could also be part of the reason Joseph used intermediaries to seek permission to bury his father in Canaan. Royal succession is always a time of some uncertainty. You just look at the turmoil in our nation after a presidential succession. Many Egyptologists, people that study ancient Egypt, assert that Senus 3 spent some years in a co-regency with his son. He brought him up and they ruled jointly. And they say it could have lasted as long as 20 years. I don't know if it's true or not, but I suspect if it was true, it lasted more like 15 years, coinciding with the beginning of the 400year period of oppression. By the time Joseph dies, yet another pharaoh is in power. And Joseph has been in retirement for many years. The freedoms of the Hebrews living in Gan have been under some form of restriction for some 40 years. 1846 BC to 1806 BC. You notice periods of 40 years seem to pop up a lot. We're told this number 40 is associated with judgment. The word judgment is often used to mean punishment. It generally has a negative connotation. Well, let's in our mind, let's move forward 360 more years to 1446 BC. God has been working for 80 years preparing another special person, Moses. And Moses has to deal with another Pharaoh. This time instead of a prophet interpreting a pharaoh's dreams and working with the receptive Pharaoh to save Egypt, we have a prophet performing miracles to persuade a reluctant Pharaoh and in the process wreaking havoc on Egypt, fulfilling what we just read in Genesis 15:14. That nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out with great substance. Exodus 13. It came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, \"Perhaps the people will repent when they see war and they'll want to return to Egypt.\" No perhaps about it. But God led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea, just like we saw in the route to bury Jacob, that map that I showed earlier. And the children of Israel went up harness carrying all their goods out of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, \"God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\" They took a really long route. It was 40 years before they entered the land of Canaan. Moses took them to the threshold. Joshua took them in. For several years after that, they fought the Canaanites, taking control of only a fairly small portion of the land promised to Abraham. But after some years, they stopped fighting. Joshua 24, we read. And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Sheckchum, and a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamore, the father of Sheckchham, for 100 pieces of silver, and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. Sheckcham is located in Nablus, a city in the West Bank, presently under control of the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, it's been severely damaged in the last 25 years. Jewish worshippers are generally prevented from entering. Usually, if any go in, it's between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. They kind of sneak in because they are not welcome. Well, this is a physical memorial of Joseph. But what about a spiritual one? of all his accomplishments, his character, his integrity, saving his people, providing the place where the family could be turned into a nation. What stands out the most? Paul tells it. Paul tells us what it is from God's perspective. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph, as we read, and worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff. By faith, Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones. From God's perspective, it was his faith in the promise that they would return. From our perspective, what are the Christlike attributes we see and most value? For me, the ones I most value are forgiveness and grace. There are so many lessons we can learn from the story of the life of Joseph. Here are some. And by the way, this list I'm going to read is on the reverse side of this evening's handout. the musicians would would please return. The Bible is not about coverups. It's about honesty and accuracy. It's about real people in real situations in real life. Not comic book superheroes, but people exactly like us. Our actions and our words have consequences. God chooses and uses broken people to show his will and love, his power and love and care. People like me, people like us. We are all affected by our heritage and our childhood. We see and imitate characteristics and behaviors of those who raised us. We need to live a good example. Don't play favorites with your children. Don't let hatred or jealousy into your life. If we love the Lord, all things good and bad, work together for our ultimate good. The bad, the difficult things can help build character. In all situations, good or bad, God's will is that we follow that which is good. Rejoice, pray, give thanks. Even when things seem insurmountable, the situation seems impossible. The Lord comforts us. Comfort is a promise. Rescue is a hope. We are being sent. Just as Joseph was sent, just as Jesus was sent, neither had an easy journey. We should not expect ours to be easy either. It's so easy for us to see our lives and the circumstances in which we find ourselves and lacking the larger picture to misunderstand others, even those closest to us. Be all God made you to be and don't allow yourself to limit him. Joseph had to confront the ones who tormented him and that he had to see what he himself was really made of. We see those who were his enemies, his brothers who hated him, receive grace at his hand. They didn't know who he was at the time, but he knew who they were. Joseph had to forgive what he could not forget and save those who tried to destroy him. Our motivation should always be based on love, not fear. To close this portion of the service and this series on the life of Joseph, I'm reminded of a song that that was true for him and it's true for us. The faithfulness of God, his love, and his grace. If we could stand and sing together the goodness of [Music] God. I love love love you. Your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in the darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. [Music] With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. One more time. I love your voice. Love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In the darkest night, you are close like no other. Know you as a father. I know you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. [Music] Amen. Brother L was speaking. I was jotting down as fast as I could. The type between this man Joseph and this man that we call Christ. Brother Lyle said at the end, he said, \"What are the what are the Christlike values in Joseph?\" Listen to this. Joseph was the most beloved of the father just as Jesus was the most beloved. Joseph was betrayed by his brethren just as Jesus was betrayed by his brethren. Joseph was given a coat of many colors and Jesus was seen in the book of Revelation with a rainbow over his head. Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver and Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver. Joseph dreamed that his brothers would bow down before him. And Jesus, every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Joseph was falsely accused in Piper's house as Jesus was falsely accused. Two prisoners were in prison with Joseph, a baker and a butler. One was condemned and one was saved. Two thieves were hung on the cross with Jesus and one was condemned and one was saved. The king the king gave Joseph a gentile bride and Jesus took a gentile bride. Joseph ascended to the right hand of Pharaoh and Jesus ascended to the right hand of God. No one could see Pharaoh without coming to Joseph first. And Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man can come to the Father except by me.\" Joseph's brethren did not recognize him. I got to read a scripture in closing. [Music] Zechariah 12:10. Remember, Joseph's brethren did not recognize him until he made himself known. And I will pour out I will pour upon the house of David and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. And they cried. And Joseph wept when his brethrens came to him. And Joseph, this is my favorite part. And as he was comforting his brothers, Joseph told them all, he said, \"No, God did it that he might preserve life.\" And Jesus Christ himself came to this earth that he might give us eternal life. Amen. Brother Lia, wonderful, wonderful job. Yeah, I loved it. That was so good. So, I I I uh I put a request in. We do David. Maybe another wonderful type of Jesus Christ. I was so blessed by this man, Joseph. I I knew the stories but wow the way brother Lyall put them together is just just absolutely inspired anointed and those type of studies don't come without a tremendous amount of work and study and prayer that our brother put in. So I appreciate I appreciate brother L. I appreciate what he did. I I do want to make an announcement this this Sunday. Um I want to have a meeting with the youth Sunday after service. It'll probably be about 12:15 or so. We'll come back in here into the uh the sanctuary and we'll get lunch. I'll get pizza or something for the kids after Sunday morning service. I want to talk to you all about uh some plans for the youth. And um I I just feel in my heart it's time to start moving forward w with our youth and our youth ministry. You feel good? It's a special day for me. This day my son Daniel was born, [Applause] you know. how much I love my son and how proud I am of him. You know, Sister Lonnie, how much you love your kids and how proud you are of them and and you want to see them prosper and and and you're just so so proud of them. I think our heavenly father looks down upon us. Wow. And I think our love even the love that we have a child for a child is nothing compared to the love that he has for each one of us. Another birthday boy, brother Jeremy, would you come up and close? It's his birthday, [Applause] too. I like March 12th. Good good buddy of mine. It's his birthday and my [Music] [Music] boy. Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father, we just thank you again for opening your word to us that we can [Music] see see history itself state so many things that are true. We just ask you, Father, to be with us the rest of the remainder of this week. Lord, thank you and bless everyone here that come. We just ask you to bless all the birthdays in March. Be with us, Lord, in your precious name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] It will be worth it all when we see Jesus. Life's trials will seem so small when we see Christ. One glimpse of his dear [Music] fame. All sorrow will rain. So bravely run the race till we see Christ. [Music] It will be worth it all. When we see [Music] Jesus, life's trials will seem so small. When we see [Music] Christ, one glimpse of his dear face, all sorrow willy rain so bravely run till we see [Music] to be [Music] land. this song. I I was I was actually I was it was in my study yesterday and I was just thanking the Lord and and I thought about how a lot of times we sing more modern songs and and sometimes it doesn't resonate with the um the older folks and then sometimes we sing the older songs and and sometimes those don't resonate with the uh the younger folks. folks. And I was thinking I was like, Lord, there's one song that I think resonates with everybody, and that's Bula Land. And then just after that, Brother Aaron sent out his list and it had closing with Bula Land. I asked Brother Lyall what the the word ba is. So he pulls up scripture and he looks bulering to a land where they are married and they're together. And I didn't know that. And that's why we're longing for that. Be with him forever. Amen. I'm kind of home. for a [Music] country to which I've never been before. No sad goodbye will there be smoke for time won't [Music] last anymore. Oh, build a [Music] land. I'm longing for you. And someday on thee I'll stand. There my home shall be [Music] turned. Build the land. Sweet ma land. I'm looking out across that river to where my faith will end inside. Oh, there's just a [Music] few just a few more days to labor. And I will take my heavenly flower. [Music] Oh, beautiful [Music] lamb. I am longing for you. And someday on thee I'll send there my home shall be turned. [Music] You [Music] love sweet land. A chorus one more time. Oh lamb, I am longing for you. And someday on the [Music] sand there my home shall be eternal. [Music] the lamb. Sweet land. God bless you, brothers and sisters. You're dismissed. God bless you. [Music] be holy and long and [Music] someday on the sand. There my home shall be eternal.

now I flee oh now I lean on his arm I'm secure from all harm for he reach down his hand for me brother Jordan if you want to come up oh and he reached down his hand for me oh and he reached down his hand for me oh I was lost and undone without God for his son when he reach down his for me you love the Lord this morning brother Daniel I asked him if we could I could share this testimony probably doesn't need much introduction but this is my uncle brother Russell Wallace shared this testimony on our family chat last night about 10 30 last night he says I have a testimony that is beyond any scientific explanation it is a miracle straight from the hand of God I'm ashamed to say that I can be a bit of a skeptic and my faith is often quite weak eight years ago when the good when fire swept through here I'll always remember the morning that the fire reached our property line Wesley his son and I got on the quad to take the back rout out of here and my faith was very weak I said to Wesley everything we have is going going to burn to the ground and there will be nothing left this is a precious memory I'll have forever Wesley said dad even if it wasn't God's will to preserve our property he would change his mind because so many Saints are praying there were Saints around the world praying and the fire came right up to their property line and then just went around their property one week ago you were all gracious enough to ask the Lord's blessings on the new well we are drill we were drilling I think this is their third well they've drilled in three or 30 about 30 years on their property as you recall I told you 10 days ago that our old well had been diminishing for years and was the worst ever currently at less than one Court per minute I know this well like an old old friend for years now I have regularly tested the output and kept a chart in recent history in March 2022 we were at 8/10 of a gallon per minute in October of 20123 down to 66 gallons per minute and then in August of 2024 4.55 Gall per minute and then this month January was this past month 2025 was. 23 gallons per minute so this has been our worst month ever with the well only producing 14 gallons per hour so here's the testimony this afternoon I went down to the well head to do another volume test for the test I bypassed the safety switch and kick the pump on full time in less than 10 minutes the water is all pumped out and the the pump starts sucking air I then turn it off let the well recharge for 15 minutes to turn turn it back on and check the volume today after 10 minutes it was not sucking air after an hour I it had still not pumped dry it's been on for 8 hours now and it is still not sucking air I checked our storage tanks and we have pumped 1,00 gallons in the last 8 hours this is an impossibility the impoverished well was only producing 112 G in 8 hours it could be proposed that the new drilling activity affected the old well but there's no chance of that the new well is on is on the farthest northeast corner of our property 60 Acres away from this one hope his granddaughter was quite excited and went down with me regularly to check the output today she said to me we were all praying for the new well and the Lord healed the old one too he says I'm so humbled and thankful to the Lord for a supernatural intervention and then this morning he posted this update at 7:00 a little after 7:00 this morning he says this morning's update our 3,000 gallons of storage tanks are all full and the water is overflowing onto the ground it is so surreal to be in the middle of a supernatural event thank you Lord what a testimony I imagine brother Daniel's going to have something to say about that if he wants to come out let's all stand to our feet and let's sing that old Hymn of the church only believe all things are possible no matter what it is we just heard that only believe only Bel all things are possible only be with all your heart only believe hear us Lord Jesus only Bel all things are possible if we'll only be again oh be oh only believe all things are possible only believe oh only believe only believe all things are possible only bless you my friend God bless you amen let's bow our [Music] heads Our Father we are grateful once again to come into the house of the Lord Lord to give you praise and to give you Thanksgiving and Lord just to learn of these testimonies that you still do miracles and father that we can trust in you that if we pray Lord you will hear our prayers and then father you will answer those prayers Lord may we get ourselves out of the way when we ask and may our prayers and the things that we ask may they be not for ourselves father but according to your perfect will and may it not be us that speak our prayers but it may be the Holy Spirit speaking through us that is our desire father bless our service this morning I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you brothers and sisters you can be seated appreciated that testimony from Brother Jordan I appreciate all the testimonies God God's God's good um first I want to welcome our visitors there a few sister AA good to see you again God bless you welcome home um look around and I I see brother Tony good to see you my friend brother seven back there God bless you welcome brother John Martin and family where are you oh there you are over there God bless you brother welcome it's good to have you good uh good to have you visiting with us um sister nah God bless you it's good to good to see your friend here sister N I used to when um I was Stephanie and I were going back and forth and I'd have to come for a couple a couple days a month between Jeffersonville and Tucson i' I'd always sit behind nah in church and I'd always look at over over her shoulder and she draws so well and she draw these pictures so I don't mean to embar embarrass you but uh I always enjoyed that watching watching you draw welcome to uh as I said to to all of our visitors if I didn't um but didn't recognize you we're still thankful to have you brother Dan sister Jacqueline good to see you're back at it and you're over the sickness God God bless you um that testimony from Brother Jordan uh you may know a little bit about your pastor you may know that I'm a I'm a a scientist um you may also know that not only am I a scientist but I'm an environmental scientist well what you probably don't know about me is I'm not just an environmental scientist but I'm a hydrologist that actually studies groundwater groundwater and surface water interaction groundwater flow through different aquifers and that and uh when brother Jordan read the um the testimony from his uncle uh the brother said that it's beyond any scientific explanation um well when I look at it I don't see any way that something like that could ever happen and when he says scientific explanation I mean without as a scientist you say well I haven't done a study on it I haven't collected these data but I don't see any way something like that could happen it is an absolute true and Bonafide Miracle he said 23 gallons per minute you can drink .23 gallons in a minute That's how little was coming out of that well and then I mean the granaries of Heaven just opened up and it just started pouring out water and filling up the tanks it's a miracle that's that's one of those real ones you know you you can you can question things we always want to give God credit and some but we don't we want to be careful we don't want to give God credit for something that he didn't do which is is often the case but wow that's impossible for that to have happened so yeah we got to be part of it and we've been praying for the family and uh we got to brother Aaron my prayers are in there so so praise God that was that was really really tremendous testimony um I uh I won't tell who wrote the note but brother Aaron gave me a note that he wrote from uh saying that it's Unison Sean's 14th anniversary dear friends personal friends to Stephanie and me and uh just just beloved loyal members of this church and and uh and precious family and um it's uh it's been a long road are you the same place you were 14 years ago God bless you I'm glad that we're where we are now brother Sean we still got a long way to go but we're on the we're on the right Road brother Lyle uh he uh he mentioned something last time he ministered on Wednesday night and uh I was like I'll brother a while and we kind of laughed at it when he said it but he uh the previous week he said uh and I forgot the the situation the story but he said you know it was like a bunch of government workers and and then and then the next week brother ly said listen I'm sorry that I said that I shouldn't have said that we all kind of laughed and um but uh then after that we started seeing the uh these all of these executive orders starting to come down from the president and uh it's it's really shaking things up in the government and it's uh some of these things are are kind of hard to accept and then other other ones are um are like well you know this this is really good but it's uh it it's been just amazing and that's what I want to talk about um in this sermon is is executive orders and one thing that uh president Trump did a couple weeks a couple days ago which I was really blessed with is he took he he gave an order to take the pronoun signature off of your emails that's a big deal that pronoun signature is basically us saying that I bow down to somebody who was maybe born a man and wants to be called a woman or born a woman or wants to be called a man or they they don't know what they are and it has been strongly encouraged as in the government brother Tony you're you're a fed too it's been strongly ENC encouraged in the government to put your pronouns on your signature page that's wrong what that is is saying you know what I bow down to someone being saying that they are not what God created them to be and it just it the whole thing is has made me sick and and Donald Trump said the other day take that off of your signature page I appreciate and admire that man's courage of course I'm not against I'm against sin homosexuality is a sin some people struggle with that other people struggle with lying other people struggle with with stealing other people struggle with um with adultery people struggle that sin I don't believe is necessarily any greater than the other but I don't have to bow down to any sin I don't put on I don't put on my signature page Daniel Evans liar or Daniel Evans thief and you got to accept it I don't do that and neither should we have to do this either so I really appreciate that executive order that the president president has has done and what he's doing is he's trying to rebuild our country and the reason this country is failing the reason any country fails is not necessarily because of financial decisions not necessarily because of military decisions the reason countries fail is because of sin in they fail because of dishonesty they fail because of immorality that's why they fail look through history and that is why a country fails and I appreciate our president trying to get us back on the right track I might not agree with him in everything and I've said a number of times from the pull pit that I don't necessarily support before now that he's president I fully support him because he's our president and the Bible teaches us that we should pray for our leaders but God bless him God bless him for trying and what we have seen is 60 70 years ago when brother Brandon was here we saw the enemy come in to society and come into the family and try to take the mother out of the family try to pull her out and that motherly influence on the children take her out and put her in the workforce put her away away from the family so that then the Satan the enemy could come in and get in the children and now we are seeing times change God doesn't change but times change now I believe we are seeing the same attack on the American man and we see that Satan if he knows that if he can get in and take out this man and demasculinize take away his manhood then we know then he knows that he's got the country the man has been degraded and put down more than ever in this past decade or so and I want to see strong men raise up I want to see Godly men raise up the man that will get his family together no matter how tired everybody is and how there's things going on on Netflix and we want to see all the this this all this other stuff get these this man get his family together and say we're going to read our Bible tonight we are going to pray as a family tonight we're going to pray this morning I want to see that return to our families I want to see a man stand up I want to see the power of the American male rise up again godly man I I just I see it in attack and this pronoun thing was just a another step to confuse this next Generation I appreciate somebody sent me a picture I appreciate um president Trump I heard this morning that he maybe is he has just signed a new um a new presidential order a new um executive order to get us back to church I love it man way to go Donald I know it's it's it's Photoshop but it's still it's still good I uh things are going on it's it's it's really it's really strange everything that's happening in the in the country in the world today but I I do appreciate I appreciate striking those pronouns I I appreciate the stand for the American worker the stand for the American Family the stand for men the stand for women and getting us right back on track you know as I was talking about these pronouns this isn't new Jesus said in Luke chapter 17 he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was was in the days of Sodom show so shall it be in the second coming of Christ what was going on in Sodom homosexuality has has really it's always been here but what was going on in Sodom is the power of the homosexual Lobby you notice that lot I'm sorry it was I think it's as in the days of lot but it's the same thing lot was the governor of the city and remember when the homosexuals came to his house he was afraid of them even though he's the most powerful man in Sodom he was afraid of their voice he was afraid of their power and he tried to make deals with them and we and Jesus said when you see this start to raise up as it was in the days of lot then look because the second coming of Christ is at hand and here we are and I I just I do pray that this Administration that we have now we'll stay the wrath of God we'll bring back some semblance of godliness so we can continue this work and continue to bring people to the Lord Jesus it's instead it's they're they took prayer out of schools a long time ago because it was offensive but you replace it with transgender athletes and and with with swearing and and cussing and and with pornography and passing out birth control in the high school schools what message does that send to our young people it sends the message that sin is not sin and I I just I do appreciate that we have a little bit more boldness now in being able to serve the Lord and like I said I don't have I'm not against any certain group of people but I want godliness I want godliness in this church church and I want godliness where we work I want godliness in this country because God will continue to bless us if we have godliness if not we've gone through the Book of Judges we're going to see the same thing happen there well our country will be destroyed and it's destroyed from within from sin within um one of the executive orders that came down recently and brother Tony you probably got this one too that that we are not to um work remotely anymore meaning that we are not allowed to um work from home when we could go into the office or even if we can't go into the office there there won't be any more working for home from home and he's trying to increase productivity in the government and when you do that so he issued this executive order and when you do that it's issued at the top and this could be it doesn't have to be the government it could be the corporate world so this comes down from corporate that there will be no working from home anymore that you have to come into the office and as it trickles down questions start to come up and then there they're very valid questions uh like here's some of the questions that we've have what if I'm sick but I want to work I'm contagious but I want to work I need to get stuff done can I work from home or do I have to take a sick day and what if I only need to work a couple hours do I have to drive all the way into the office and work from there what if what if we're behind and I need to work on the weekends can I work from home doing that so the there's all these questions that come down and then they'll come down to finally they they trickle down they come down finally to the employee and this employee will have a set of questions and he will ask his boss or her boss what about this what about that what about if I'm sick what about this so then that boss will either answer the question and make a decision or send it back up the chain let's say in this case that the boss answers the question and let's say it's can I uh can I work at home on Friday then later on that person gets caught breaking the rule breaking the law breaking the executive order and here comes the enforcement down and says dan you on these days you have been working from home there was an executive order said you are not allowed to work from home so then Dan takes his email prints out his email and says no listen right here my boss approved me to do this so then that that responsibility now no longer rests on you it rests on the one who approved it the one who stood for you it's the same thing with sin you can say you swore you cussed whatever it might be or let's say you stole from you stole from work you came into the office and you took things that were owned by the company and you you took them for yourself and sold them and made money on them or whatever and then your boss comes in and he says you did this you stole it but I'm going to approve that that you were given this then when they come to get you again whether it be the police or whether it be the higher-ups to fire you or to put you in jail you said no no no here's my email from my boss I had permission to do that and then the punishment rests upon the person that approved it and that would be it would be resting on that person and that person would have to pay the bill would have to pay for what was stolen you tracking with me and it's the same for us the same with Jesus Christ the the third commandment the third executive order says you shall not take the name of the Lord in your God in vain for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless who takes his name in vain how many times have we heard somebody somebody say oh my God or Jesus Christ in a derogatory way right there you broke that executive order you broke that commandment and there must be punishment and the punishment for it would be death same with adultery if you committed adultery the Bible very plainly says that you are to be stoned but in this case somebody stepped in front and said no I'll take the blame for that I will take I will pay for the the sin I'll take the blame so when God the father comes down and says you have done this and you have done that you have sinned here you have sinned there you have sinned there my word my executive order which can't can't be done away with says that you must die and then something steps in someone steps in and says no it's my fault they're Justified I put my name on what they did and when you put your name on what they did if I put my name on one of my employees that stole something I say no I approve that now I have to pay the price and the price was death the price was hell and so my sins there was somebody that took my place and that price did not go unpaid that's the thing we don't think of very often every time I sin every time I do something wrong there must be a price paid because that was the executive order that was the Commandment somebody has to pay the price so now we have this one this Advocate comes in and says yeah I did it I'm responsible for it and he had to die he had to suffer what I should have suffered so these executive orders that we're seeing right now we've been talking about Parables it's a perfect example of a parable a parable Parable is something that you see every day that you relate to the word of God and we see executive orders coming down we see orders coming down from corporate that we all have to adhere to and if we don't do it there is punishment either we get fired we might get thrown in prison or whatever it might be the same with our lives we sin we do things wrong the executive order here says sin requires death and then somebody stepped in took my place and says I approved it I did it it's my fault and then we go we say father um he signed for me I'm Justified he had to Die the death that I should have died he had to be condemned of the sins that I did he had to be condemned of the most filthy things it might be homosexuality it might be pornography it might be stealing it might be lying it might be murder he did it and not me and that's what Jesus Christ means to us he took that place Matthew chapter 22 Jesus if we truly do love Jesus Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments Matthew 22 verse 34 I'll read out the new King James version says but when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they gathered together then one of them a lawyer asked him a question testing him and saying teacher which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said to him so he's saying what is the great executive order what's the most important of all these that have come down and Jesus answered and he say you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so on these two executive orders h all of the Bible and all of the prophets if Jesus Is God which you believe he is right if Jesus Is God and he say he says if you love me remember it said Jesus said the first commandment the great commandment is to love the Lord God with all your heart and Jesus says if you love me then keep my Commandments basically if you you love me then do what I tell you and in the context it says his second commandment is to love each other and many of you don't know each other here so it's hard to love someone if you don't know them but it says it says to love your neighbor as yourself so you can't really love someone who you don't know but you can love someone who you do know whether you like them or not whether they're nice or not whether they get on your knee your nerves or not whether they do you right or they do you wrong if you know them then you are obligated to love them like you know your neighbor if you know your neighbor some of us don't know our neighbors very well but we know them so if you know your neighbor then you certainly know each other and we have to love one another and some of God's executive orders are truly truly awesome he gave those orders to us and we we we hear God and we see okay Lord you taught us out of this Bible to do these things and to set aside everything else and to concentrate on those and let these things from this Bible let them take preeminence over everything over my own desires over whatever I want to do but he also o had some really some pretty stellar executive orders and I'll read a few of them and uh you don't have to follow me back there because I'll go fast Genesis 1:3 God said let there be light and there was light an executive order straight down from God I love it let there be light and the there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and he called the day day in the darkness he called night so the evening and the morning were the first day what a commandment it's really the first one in the whole Bible he says let there be light and a place that was dark became light Genesis 1:26 it says this then God said let us make man in our own image according to our likeness let let them have dominion over the fish and the Sea over the over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creep us so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them all of us are in that boys and girls men and women and how that we are created in the very image of God and if he created us to be like him then shouldn't we be like him Abraham in Genesis 17 when Abram was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him him another commandment I am almighty God walk before me and be blameless and I will make my Covenant between me and you and I will multiply you exceedingly then Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with you and you shall be a father of many nations a man who couldn't have children we know the story God created the Jewish race and well really all all the race is right there and then when Abraham showing that that this promised son that he just Pro he just promised him right there this promised son was born then God tells Abraham go up and sacrifice your son lay him on the altar get a bunch of sticks just like you would a lamb or a ram get a bunch of sticks take this sacrifice like you would a a ram slice his throat kill him and then burn him Abraham does so and when Abraham but the angel when when Abraham laid him there he raised up the knife to kill his son now listen to this executive order and this one came right at the last minute but the angel of the Lord called him to him from heaven and and said Abra Abraham Abraham and he says here am I he said don't lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him for now I know that you fear God since you have withheld your son your only son from me Jacob at bethl in Genesis 2811 so he came to a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set and he took one of the stones of that place and put his put it at his head and he lay down in that place to sleep then he dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on the earth and its top reached to heaven and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said an executive order from the king from God himself I am the Lord God of Abraham your father and the god of Isaac the land which you lie you're laying on now I will give to you and to your descendants also to your descendants shall be as the the dust of the earth you shall spread abroad to the to the west and and the East and the North and the South and in you and in your seed all the families of the Earth shall be blessed behold I am with you it's God speaking executive order from the top behold I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and when will bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken to you then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it and he was afraid and said how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and then still to this day being fulfilled we see two a 2,000 years span where Israel this promise that that God made to him Israel Was Defeated and spread around the world and then recently in the 1940s we see that Israel fulfilling this prophecy that God made I'll bring you back and forming another another Nation a powerful nation and now we're all blessed because of it because of this nation Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3 Moses goes down and and he sees this bush burning and he goes down and he bows down before it and God says I am the god of your father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt the story of The Exodus coming out from bondage so I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land to a land flowing with milk and honey to a place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the pites and the hites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come to me same as our cries come before him when we cry out sayl help my well on my property Lord help my sick son or my sick daughter Lord help me and he says I hear the cries of my people an executive order from the top and I have also seen the oppression which the Egyptians oppressed them now come therefore and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt there's a lot of them but I'll I'll finish with this one on the executive orders from God Isaiah chapter 7 verse1 14 one of the most important orders one of the most important thing that God set forward therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and Emanuel means god with us and 740 or so years later this executive order came to pass this commandment came to pass but how was This Promise This commandment this man this Messiah to be manifest itself really how's it to manifest itself in my life and how could it save me how could he save me from my sins Matthew chap 1:8 let's go there familiar Christmas scripture but a very good one for this on God's executive orders now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when he when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with ch a child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph th son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she brought forth a son and thou shalt and and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins this is the order that came down I am sending this one you will call his name Jesus because he will save them from their sins the the very word Jesus comes from the Hebrew word we pronounce it Joshua Yeshua it means savior now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord by Spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God With Us I talked about the mediator between the law that comes down the executive order that comes down and the law breaker the mediator that that stands in the place of the person who stole from the company but someone else paid the price the scripture says and he shall save his people from their sins now let's get into how this is implemented to me how it's implemented to you how it was implemented in the past in St John chapter 8 this is going to be so now the executive order came down you can't work at home or whatever it might might be it came down and now it's down to the employee to the government employee or the corporate employee in this case it comes down to one of God's elect one of God's people St John 8 verse one Jesus went up under the Mount of Olives early and early in the morning he came into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in their midst they said unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us we're going to hear the seventh commandment here now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have accused him but Jesus St down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so he ignored them when they said it and they're like Hey listen the the the executive order comes down the command the seventh commandment came down from Jehovah God himself through the prophet Moses now Jesus what are you going to do about it and they knew that Jesus loved the people they knew that he had a burden for sinners in fact they criticized him for for fellowshipping with Sinners so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her so there they are standing there they're ready to exact judgment on this woman judgment according to the Bible and he again stooped down and rode on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience thank God that they had a conscience convicted by their own conscience show that there was something in them went out one by one beginning at the eldest probably the wisest and even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee imagine how she felt there she was she deserved it don't forget we always want to talk about this woman as as being um you know just a blessing and and being sweet and and being innocent and all that she was not innocent she was a sinner sleeping with another woman husband and caught in the very act you know I've heard the question asked well where was the man in all this how come he didn't get punished you don't know that he didn't get punished he may have very well been stoned he may have very well been killed or he may have got away with it somehow but the fact is that this is that this is concentrating on this woman because she was a Believer I believe if the man was a Believer he'd probably be written in here but this woman was real she was she was special she said where are thine accusers she said no man Lord and Jesus said to her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more so the adulterous woman who according to the letter of the law the letter of the executive order should have been stoned to death but as this trickled down this this commandment came down from God and she was at the person that deals directly with her this man Jesus Christ there is no mediator between God between God and man except for the man Christ Jesus and here is a perfect example of that woman dealing as we would say directly with her boss and him taking him taking the responsibility for it and he says here right neither do I condemn you you're justified in this then spake Jesus and then neither do I condemn thee and then he says this go and sin no more you know if you keep doing it then you're showing I really don't believe in my salvation I really don't believe in this so I'm going to just keep doing this because it's not really real to me but Jesus says no he doesn't just give her a cart Blan he says don't do it again don't sin anymore then Jesus spake unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life he's saying that I am the Fulfillment of the law I am the word made flesh I am the light of the world I am the one who brings understanding to the word I am the one who brings the spirit of the law to your understanding if we just follow the letter of the law in in Le in legal terms you have the spirit of the law which is what we should be doing and then you have the letter of the law and no one can survive the letter of the law but God wrote the law in a certain spirit and it wasn't to destroy God wrote this the the law in the Holy Spirit and it was for salvation so that means you don't take the Ten Commandments now you don't take the Old Testament I hear so often well that's Old Testament we have Grace now that's true to a certain extent but we still do have that Old Testament Jesus said that thou shalt not commit adultery as I said the seventh commandment but then he said but you still commit adultery if you look at a woman and you want to have an affair with that woman you're still committing adultery that's the spirit of the law you may not have done it but you're still guilty if we walked in the spirit of the law then we wouldn't have to worry about the letter of the law because we wouldn't be sinning because we would know that that spirit is speaking through me I shouldn't say this because that's a lie and then that we wouldn't need forgiveness of that sin if we walk in the spirit of the law but the letter of the law is hard and it says you lied you're going to hell but if we walk in the spirit of the law we see that oh I'm getting close and if you walked in the if if people that cheat on their wives or cheat on their husband if they would walked in the spirit of the of the law they wouldn't have even got close to that because Jesus said if you just if you just want to if you just desire to that you've committed adultery with her already in your heart then you would not step over that line because you know that this this spirit this holy spirit that wrote the law I need to stay far away from that that's the difference between the letter and the spirit Jesus produced the spirit the Pharisees said to him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true so when we have an executive when we have an executive order the seventh commandment Thou shalt not commit adultery then you should be stoned this came down from the headquarters and they said listen your testimony isn't true because she should be stoned you're speaking of yourself you're wrong Jesus and Jesus answered them and said though I be record of myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and whether I go but I cannot tell whence I come and whether I go you judge after the flesh now listen to this this is good you judge after the flesh but I judge no man you know why he judges no man because he was judged he was judged for me he was judge for you he took the judgment and yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I and the and the father that sent me he's saying that I'm not in this by myself I and the father are one we're in this together so why is if we are in this together and we look and Jesus went to the cross for us he took that blame so why is the cross so important why do we have it sitting here in the back of the in the back of the church why do you see crosses on Christian churches because it's everything it's when the law came down I should have been judged I should go to hell as all of you should and any person that's really walked the earth except for Jesus Christ we should all be condemned but because of the Cross because he went there and he took that that punishment for me I don't have to go and then he says to the woman he says now go and sin no more don't do it again look at what I did for you and if you really love that person that that take that took that from you would you want to keep doing it so he has to keep taking your blows and he has to keep paying your debt if you really love Jesus no you wouldn't want to do it he says if you love me keep my Commandments why would he say that I'm going to keep having to answer for you I'm going to keep having to take your punishment if you love me keep my Commandments your life will be better and you'll be a better you everything will be better and then you won't be always you you won't always be condemned by the grace of God we not the Lord Jesus he turned he came with a message that just turned everything upside down people had never heard the things that he he said he says if someone hates you then you love that person these are Commandments these are executive orders from Jesus if someone hates you then you love that person someone steals from you then you give them more than they stole pray pray for your enemies not just your friends who are having trouble that means pray for the weasel young man who's trying to take your daughter out that's rough and don't kill him either it's another commandment I've gotten close pray for the IRS agent who's auditing your taxes pray for the person who is tormenting you at work pray for the woman who's gossiping about about you pray for that person who is a problem to you Jesus commands it it's an executive order you have to pray for them you have to help them even if you can't stand them and you need to love them so change the way that you think Executive Order says Thou shalt not covet and Jesus is very plain remember he turned everything upside down the thing that you want the most in the world sacrifice I your desire for that thing to God again straight from the top don't covet the thing that you want the most thing that you desire the most give it to God it may be your family it may be riches may be popularity it may be a position it may be a job Lord I give it to you I'm going to work as hard as I can I'm going to do everything that I can I want to I want to be right but in the end Lord I give my desires to you we went on Wednesday night we talked about prayer and the key to prayer and the key to having your pray prayer answered is to get down before the Lord and get into the spirit of God so now it's not your desires not your Covetous desires that you want something but now God begins to speak through you and it becomes his will and that's the key to prayer and that's the key to every that's that's the key don't covet if you want something give it over to God remember I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 21 my 21st birthday and the thing that I asked I want to get married I wouldn't have a family the one thing I ask God I said Lord I'm giving my life to you I'm not living this sinful life anymore would you give me a wife and I said but even if you don't I'm still going to serve you for the rest of my life that's and then he gave me the best wife I could ever have imagined I never I never knew being married could be so great but I sacrificed and I was fully willing if if I never get married it's fine Lord I'm going to serve you now in closing I want to go through this Parable we've been go we've started on the series of Parables and I think it goes well and that's the parable of the tower Luke chapter 14:25 it's probably one that that if you don't read your Bible um a lot you probably don't even know this Parable Luke 14 verse 25 and there went great multitudes with them and he turned and said unto them now let me just stop right there and there went great multitudes with Jesus so there's thousands of people with him remember that when he fed the 5,000 there's 5,000 people and here it says there's great multitudes so there's all of these thousands of people they're they're all following him and he's going along and all of a sudden he turns and he said to them so the spirit must have said tell them this very important he turned right around and all of these thousands of people started listening let me ask you this if there were thou thousands and thousands are following Jesus all the time why why were there only 12 in the upper room think about that all of these people following Jesus and all when he came into Jerusalem on his on his on the on the donkey and they were singing hosan and throwing their garments and throwing the Palm leaves on PA Palm Sunday this triumphant King and all the whole city was was celebrating why only 120 of them stayed with it wow Jesus turned with all of these people and he said If any man come to me and hates not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sister yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple that's Jesus is that's a I think it's called by the Jewish idiom it means something else he's not saying that you have to hate anybody what he is saying is that you that Jesus first of all he was all about love and he told us many times not to hate he's saying that if you don't love them less than you love me then you're not worthy of me love them less love everything less than you love me if you want to be my disciple and I I know that because it tells the same story there's a parallel scripture in Matthew 10 you don't have to turn there we can stay in Luke Matthew 10:37 says this he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me basically Jesus needs to be the first person in our life and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple what does that mean bear the cross the cross was the most feared thing in the Roman Empire it was this heartless terrible punishment it struck fear into everyone when you saw someone carrying a cross down the road you knew that person was condemned to death that person is soon going to be hanging up there and dying a slow painful death the most painful death that the Romans had was the cross so you see somebody walking with the cross to the city you know that person is going to suffer like you would never believe and then Jesus says if you don't take up your cross and follow after me then you're not worthy of Me Jesus said earlier in Luke he makes a statement we'll stay in Luke 14 but in Luke 99 he says and he said to them all if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me this is not a one-time thing I can't go back to the day I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus I can't go back to my 21st birthday Jesus requires more than that he requires every day going back to the day that we gave our heart to the Lord going back to that we have to be careful that we'll just stay there that is the beginning of a journey that go goes on really into eternity every day should be serving the lord every day should be taking up that cross and following him you may you may go back to the to the day that you came to the altar you may come back to the day that you spoke in tongues or you were filled with the Holy Spirit but you need to keep going past that how can you move Beyond it how can you have a closer walk with Jesus it's if it's not an everyday thing I know that we can go back to those times as as a point of faith and I do often but continue on and Jesus said you bear that cross that shame you bear it every day he requires that and we wonder why we haven't moved past we wonder why we haven't progressed as a body of Believers as Christianity why why have we not progressed because you're not taking up your cross daily every day and following him the musicians could come and uh I'll be a few more minutes and sister Jessica also Galatians 2:20 says I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not set aside the grace of God he's saying I don't set aside that for if righteousness comes through the law then Christ died in vain if righteousness comes down just from that executive order then Christ done died in vain because we all fall short but it's that Spirit of the law that Jesus Christ fulfilled and then he paid the price back to Luke ver vers 28 for which of you intending to build a tower said is not on let's uh sister L let's wait just a minute um for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest happily after he laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that be that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish so he's saying and you start this journey you make this decision right that this is going to be your life and you are going to finish this this whole thing and you're going to be completely surrendered to Christ do you ever see that Stephanie and I moved away in I don't know what was it like 2004 that we moved to Jeffersonville and before we moved there was this guy on I 10 that uh he bought all of this land on the west side of I 10 between Tucson and Phoenix and he had he started putting up these towers in the desert you've seen it if you have ever driven there and he was putting up signs that said wanted used Carnival equipment and he wanted to build this this great big amusement park well he put up some towers and and when Stephanie and I came back we're drive driving through Phoenix it's like wow the towers are still there and the guy did absolutely nothing over the past 17 years and he becomes a laughing stock you started this project but you won't finish it you started being a Christian but does everybody at your school see you as a Christian does everybody at your work see you as a Christian or do you become a laughing star do they make fun of you they should be looking up to you and admiring you or what king is going to make war against another king sth not down first and consult whether he be able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the other is yet AAR off he sendeth an ambassage and desired desireth conditions of Peace So what he's saying here is if you're going to go to battle with this other Army you better be ready because if you're the King Kings were not treated well after they lost a battle in the Bible you know that um zedekiah I believe it was lost the battle with Nebuchadnezzar Here Comes NE Nebuchadnezzar lines up his sons kills them all in front of him then gouges out his eyes in other places they would parade this King through through the through the The Village or through the kingdom have people put their foot on his neck because he lost this battle he's saying before you go you better weigh this out this is an important important decision that's how it is with us I put up the funny picture of trump quit skipping church church is part of it church is important consider the consequences of ignoring the executive order to take up your cross and follow Jesus consider the consequences of not forgiving your brother consider the consequences of speaking gossip about a sister consider the consequences of your language consider the consequences of giving your life to Christ and not sticking with it consider the consequences of putting God second or third or fourth or last in your life are you really too busy are you really too busy really are you too busy to come to church are you too busy to pray are you too busy to study your Bible is getting your way what is really important to you or is it following Christ's leading attending church tithing lending a helping hand taking somebody out out to lunch who just needs a shoulder to cry on and listening to them a ear just lending your ear here to someone means so much I know brothers and sisters I I counsel people I know a lot of times people just they need to get it out they need somebody who really cares but are you too busy for that you're too busy to do anything that doesn't serve yourself that's the world and I say that a lot but that's the way the world teaches today Jesus says so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple Jesus requires everything go [Music] back he said you might ask what do I need to do what do I need to do brother you you you talk about this but you never tell me what exactly I need need to do Peter at the day of Pentecost he gave an executive order from God when they asked him the same thing he said repent he said go back from your sins May there be something inside of you that you know that you are a sinner that you know you've done something wrong go back repent and then be bap AP ized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins for take the taking away of your [Music] sins the executive Authority from God was death Hell In The Grave for every one of us and here is Jesus and he says she's Justified with what she did she's justified in her lies she's justified in her immorality he is Justified in all of his sin sins because I take the punishment for it and that's no longer and then we say Lord I lay my sins on you you took you took the authority there this came from the father it came down to me you wiped it away and now Lord what I want I don't want it to be no I don't want it to be me any longer I read that scripture in galations I have been crucified with Christ now I'm taking out my cross now I am following Jesus Jesus a cross is a shameful burden that we have to bear I'm taking up my cross I've been crucified with Christ then Galatians 2:20 says it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not set aside the Great of God for if righteousness comes through the law then Christ died in vain once again and no longer I who live but Christ in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me sister Jessica sang that song so beautifully at Harmony in the desert and I asked her to close with that if you could sister Jessica no longer I who live but Christ in me for I've been born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah you brought me back to life I won't forget the moment I heard you call my name out of the grip of Darkness into the light of Grace just like Lazarus oh you brought me back to life where there was dead religion now there is living Living Faith all of my hope and freedom I found in Jesus name just like Lazarus oh you brought me back what noer I live but Christ in me for i' been born again my heart is free the the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah you brought me back to life when something says I am guilty I'll point to the price you amen when something says I'm not worthy I'll point to that empty gra just like Lazarus oh you brought me back to life no longer I who live with Christ in me for I've been born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah you brought me back to life how can I begin to thank you for all that you've done for me Jesus to fully praise you it will take all eternity just like Lazarus oh you brought me back to life no longer I live the Christ in me for I've been born born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah you brought me back to life the enemy thought he had me but Jesus said you are mine the enemy thought he had me but Jesus said you are mine the enemy thought he had me but Jesus said you are mine the enemy thought he had me Jesus and you are mine prise longer I who live but Christ in me for I've been born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah You Brought me Back to Life long the I who live the Christ in me for I've been born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave behind Hallelujah you brought me back tonight one more time you sing sister Jessica let's all sing it I who live for Christ in me for I've been born again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before me the grave Hallelujah you brought me back to life amen the song written after that scripture in Galatians how beautiful he did he brought us back to life I was dead in my sins I was dead in my trespasses I was living a life that was meaningless but God brought me back and he brought me back to life did he bring you back to life brothers and sisters it means so much it's a simple simple story brother Braham said one time Christ preached the whole sermon on it Christ is the mystery of God revealed all the mysteries of God they are represented in Jesus Christ and if we can just know him if we can just understand him if we can just understand what he did in our lives that's the most important thing it's not all of this stuff we love all of we we love all of the Bible we love all of the word but it's all based on this it's all based on Jesus Christ and him alone and if we can Tru truly understand that and truly understand what he did for us the simple analogy of an executive order coming down and your boss taking the blame for you Jesus Took the ultimate blame for us so your sins in your life the things that you have done wrong that man 33 years old he answered for us Brother Juan there's nobody else there's no other mediator between God and man only the man Christ Jesus he is right there between the law and me if it's the if it's the letter of the law I am condemned to hell but I'm not condemned to Hell by his merits I am saved by the blood of Jesus Christ are you a Christian brothers and sisters are you Christians brother James are you a Christian this morning it's so important man he is everything and he did it he won the battle and he saved my soul just then sings my soul my Sor God to thee oh yes how great thou [Music] are how great [Music] thou then sings my soul Oh My Savior God to [Music] thee how great thou are how great thou art oh Lord my God when I H all awesome Wonder consider all the world thy hands have made I see the star I hear The Rolling Thunder th power throughout all the universe display then sings my soul my savior God to thee

sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art and when I think and when I think think about this that God his son not sparing sent him to die I scarce can take it in that on the cross my birth and gladly bearing he bled and died to take away my sin then sings my soul my savior God to thee how great great thou are How Great Thou Art when sings my soul my savior God to me how great thou how great thou let's bow our heads ask with all of our heads bowed thinking what God did for us the son not sparing he didn't spare his own son that we might be saved and what that man Jesus Christ did for me [Music] if it was just for me I think he would have done it if it was just for this man standing in the pull pit I believe he would have done it just for me but he did it for you too friends if there is sin in your life that you want to get rid of if there was something that is hurting you that's separating you you from this man Jesus Christ don't let the devil do it place it into his hands and do your best and then it'll help you if there's something that you need from God and he's looking down now if there's something you have on your heart that say Lord I need this from you would you just raise your hand and hold that thing that you want help with just hold it in your heart say Lord here is my confession before you with an uplifted hand Lord I need you and I commit this day to taking up my cross and following in your bloody Footprints Heavenly Father the Son of God came and saved us from our sins and how great Lord that sacrifice was Lord let us hold that sacrifice dear to our hearts today and all that Christ did for me and father those hands that were raised Lord you saw you saw those with that were sincere with that hand raised you saw the hand go up and you knew the secret of the Heart Lord we bring those requests before you in the name of the one that gave his life for us the name of Jesus Christ Lord we pray that you would answer every prayer that you would answer every request that's here this morning that you would soften the Stony heart and Lord that you would comfort the the weary father that you'd have your way Lord it is written in your word if you love me keep my Commandments thank you Father we will and we will move forward from this day better people and then tomorrow Lord I want to die to myself again and the next

any of us brothers and sisters it's good to be a Christian it feels good I pray that the things that I said today will stay with you knowing that every time every time that you step across that line that somebody has to pay for it and that you should love that man that paid for it more every time that you sin every time you do something wrong you should love Jesus Christ more and then the more that you love him the more you'll keep his Commandments and then one day I pray that everyone here is on that day when that wedding supper comes and he wipes those tears from her eyes and he says

Katie and I were having lunch with brother Bobby on a Sunday afternoon and if you've ever had lunch with brother Bobby you know he just talks to everyone a lot the people serving him he he talks to him asks them what they do not just surface level he tries to get in deep conversation with everyone he sees people would walk by and he'd make eye contact and he'd just start talking to them so we were out in front of the restaurant it was cheddar over on Broadway and uh brother Nehemiah walked out and turned and it was like him and brother Bobby were best friends like they'd never they'd never seen each other never met and like in front of Cheddars I think we started singing and brother Nehemiah came to church here that night and since then he's been a wonderful friend and when when I when

together and worship I want to mention also brother Bobby today's his birthday brother Bobby we love you and there is something powerful about coming together and singing we might not think it we might think well there's power in prayer and there is power in prayer and there's power in the word and there is power in the word but there is power in a song There's two men I'll tell a story there was two men their names were Paul and Silas Paul and Silas for they were preaching the gospel and they took them they beat them they beat him almost to death and then they they Paul and Silas wouldn't give up what they believed so they took them and they they took they they put their feet in stocks and their hands in stocks in ch s and they took them and put them all the way to the center of the prison not just on the on one cell but they took them and they put them all the way in the middle and there they are maybe in the dark Paul and Silas two brothers in the gospel as we are brothers and sisters in the gospel here loving the lord and there they are they're bruised they're beaten enchant s and what did they do they began to sing what songs did they sing let me see our list Winds of Faith Palms of Victory believe for it didn't I walk on the water water they start singing these songs praising the Lord and the Bible says that everyone in the prison they started listening all of the prisoners they started listening to Paul and Silas singing these songs and the Holy Spirit must have come in we know it came in because the Earth began to shake and the doors of the cells began to open up and the the chains that were on their feet and the chains were on their hands they all broke off because they were singing brother Nehemiah they were singing a song and they were praising all the stalks were off and all the doors of the cell were open the Jailer came and he sees he sees the doors are open and he sees and and all everything's loose and he takes his sword he puts it there and he's going to fall on his sword because he knew that he would surely be put to death for letting all of these prisoners escape and as he put that sword to his him his bosom he hears brother Paul cry out do yourself no harm brother stop we're all here all of us are here brother minnow it wasn't just Paul and Silas that were there these songs these are all criminals these are all prisoners and these songs converted everybody in the jail so they didn't leave imagine a prisoner the doors open they'd be out but they all stayed they all stayed and worshiped with Paul and Silas look at the power of a song it converted these Sinners that were in the jail and the Jailer looks and he says they're all here and what does he say the power of a song what does he say he said Brothers how can I be saved Paul looks at him and he says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and he didn't just stop he says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your family will be saved how wonderful all from a song we take it lightly we come to we come to church we worship we've had Harmony in the desert we've had three days of worshiping what power is in our voices As we sing brother minow there is power there is power in these things and let me tell you when we sing We Sing in the name of the Lord Jesus when we pray we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus when we get up in the morning we get up in the name of the Lord Jesus when we go to bed we go to bed in the name of the Lord Jesus and you watch the Power of Jesus Christ not only in US it'll take our these bonds they may be sin the bonds it may be a job it may be sickness it may be cancer whatever it is the walls will shake when we begin to sing if we have that same faith that the apostles Paul and Silas had I speak [Music] Jesus let's all

brother Kim as you cloth could you also bless the food it's been such a blessing to be here with you these few days and I want to say something sometimes I say a little bit awkward so I hope you'll take it in the spirit it said in but a few years ago I met brother Daniel here in this church maybe two years ago I think when we had Harmony here and the growth I've seen as he's begin to relax in his ministry in his calling it was a new thing for you yeah and I've just seen such tremendous growth and I I hope you take that in the right Spirit of that that just seeing him relax in his ministry the the the comments and the way he's LED these these meetings has been just tremendous and there's another one standing behind me here are you there Joey I'm going to stop calling them Joey you know I think I think Joey is what Australians call a baby kangaroo they're Joys aren't they but you know this was one of my students wow you know and to see where God has taken him and allowed his life to Blossom you know when you have a student in grade six you have no idea what's there it's just all potential he was actually Joey then he was like a little kangaroo but but uh you know Josiah I'm just so thrilled to see where God has taken you and as I was listening to the young people singing all through these meetings and just seeing young people that um brother Caleb's daughter singing you know it's cool to be uncool just stand up and make a stand and says see all of you young people declaring your faith in God and living for God you know what I felt through the whole thing thing the future of the church is secure that's right come on because we've seen young people born again filled with the Holy Ghost and you know sometimes we worry what about the future I'm not worried about the future because I see a whole crop coming up that's just pushing forward pushing forward and you know those of us who are getting a little long on the tooth well we're just thanking God for that that this generation coming behind us and I'd like to do a little tradition brother men you would remember this years ago we never closed a meeting without singing I'll see you in the Rapture if we never

durksen and his wife sister Holly is that right did I get that [Music] right looks like that's what brother Dan wrote with visiting with us so God bless you good to have you now is with brother dawn your father okay I think it was around 1976 77 the first time he preached here at the Tabernacle and we ever just had just come to Tucson and then him and my father got to spend some time together cuz my dad had done a little bit of work for a family that was moving up to South Dakota and he gave him the message while he was talking to him um one the the little boy the little brother was was choking and the other brother dad said Daddy he got that glass what he thought was water was bleach and he had just drunk it and your dad and my father went and prayed for him and all the symptoms disappeared right then and there so the family's looking at and said well this God you serve is real now when he moved I don't know where where they went and I don't know the name but it was a testimony and it was it was your dad that was there praying for him so God is still the same yesterday today and forever amen he's so good to us let's look at um Joshua CH 24 vers 15 16 and 17 Joshua is saying here and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose ye this day whom you will serve it's whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but then Joshua says but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and I like the answer here back from the congregation on verse verse 16 there and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods 17 for the Lord Is Our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great Great Signs in our sides and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed so I choose today to serve him we know him as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen so we had no prayer requests that were were written or turned in but if you have something you would say Lord remember me I have a need I have a desire let's just bow our heads Lord we we come this evening Lord on a Wednesday night and a midweek service and Lord uh with the things that have gone on through the day maybe at work or at home or traveling whatever it might be Lord but we're set the sight of time because you said where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be in the midst Lord so we're trusting in that you saw each hand that was raised Lord you know their hearts desire their need Lord so that you would come by even as our brother Daniel would prepare tonight Lord to begin to to lay out the books and the scriptures and the in this word of God Lord that is true and and it is still as powerful from the beginning as today as it ever was Lord May Lord you just have your own way Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen what

he said well if if it'd be okay so I I got that in the morning and I was thinking about your sister all all morning and then when I broke for lunch I said well I need to call her and when I when I got in touch with sister Grace she said brother she says I was just praying she says I was praying that that if the pastor would call me that and invite me to church that I'll come to church so sister you're are welcome to come it's it's good to have you and from now on you don't need an invitation okay just just come to church it's good to see you it's good to meet you in person Brother David sister Sharon family God bless you welcome it's good to good to see you here my friend brother Paul sister Holly durksen uh we listened to uh about a week and a half ago uh week ago on Sunday we listened to brother Billy Paul's testimony and brother Paul I believe it was at your church wasn't it I saw you in the background there it was a real blessing to to everyone and um we just uh I know I miss I'm sure you do too I miss our friend brother Billy Paul I know you were close with him and uh he's greatly missed I am the first time I met brother Paul um that I remember meeting you is we were in Zimbabwe and I had just started I just came um from the US GE iCal survey and I had just got a new job at voice of God Recordings and Brother Joseph sent me and a group of us over to Zimbabwe and uh there I got to meet and spent some time with brother Paul Dirks and that was about 2006 I believe and uh I still remember that everything was going good and I was feeling great and we had like a youth meeting and and I got to talk a little bit to the youth and it's feeling good there's a maybe maybe a couple hundred and then we had meetings um I believe they were Friday Saturday and Sunday at the rainbow Towers in Harari and I was supposed to to speak and we walked into the auditorium and there were 8,000 people there I was like whoa and I was just on the job for two months brother Paul didn't seem bothered at it at all you you did a a great great job brother Paul would you mind coming up and saying a few words to the people brother Paul is a pastor in canisto and he's as I said he's a dear friend and he's somebody that he knows brother brandom's message like no one I've ever met and the brother knows he knows how to rightly divide the word there's a book that's required reading for most young people it's um courtship and dating marage marriage courtship and dating brother Paul is the one that put that together it's something that was sitting on my desk when I was in Jeffersonville all the time and I would always refer to it when we get questions about courtship and dating so brother Paul if you bless you my friend good well it is a privilege to be here brings back lots of good memories we uh first heard heard about the message in 1973 and we came down here to see what we could learn about brother brandom and we came down here and my goodness we found people that actually believed that there were prophets in the 20th century and we thought we were in a in a hot bed of of a cult or something and we wanted to get out of here but God had supernaturally led us here and my dad says no let's just stay and and see what we can learn here and we we went from here and we brought some tapes back home and started listening to them and God moved and we had a group of about 75 young people they all embraced the message and from that day on just a couple years later my dad was pastoring that's when he would have been down here 7677 we'd come to the meetings every year brother Perry would have it for quite a few years so I have memories of this as a young man and and it's good to be here and I have memories with brother Dan as well just uh we made a point when we'd go to to uh Jeffersonville there to uh the vgr offices to to just stop in and see brother Dan I've always appreciated that genuine Christian love and warmth that I felt there and we just had good Fellowship all the time and it was a real privilege and so we've had chances even now that he's left the vgr and his is over here we've had time too that we get together and can just really just Fellowship around the word and with the Lord and we're thankful for that so we wanted to make sure we had a chance to stop in and just to see how things were going and I know he's just been been here a little while the church has kind of had some changes the last couple years and so I thought we'd just stop in and just put our shoulder to the wheel and and bring our lick a little lick of fire and and put it with yours and just see if the Lord would move what's on my heart as a pastor and as we see things going you look at what's taking place in the world right now yes Amen to it it's it's beyond comprehension amen the anti-Semitism that is all of a sudden exploded around the world there is no logical explanation for that that is demonic and I believe that it is the the things that the scriptures the thing that the message talked to us about and told us and prophesied it is fixing to happen we are in the process of it now and I believe that it is lamp trimming time for us I believe that it's time that we need to check up and make sure that there is nothing because things could be different in the morning and we need to be ready constantly and so just don't let anything keep our take our eyes away from the things of the Lord and and to for his soon coming and we want to just be about our father's business I've been emphasizing when I have U been speaking for the last two years and it just keeps coming up and coming up but from Ephesians 4 where he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit that is the vocation wherewith we've been called that is our vocation what's a vocation well it's could be our career what we do for our job our life our living could be a farmer could be an engineer that would be our our vocation in the natural but as Christians our vocation is to be a a an example and an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ and he says to walk worthy of the vocation which we've been called it has to do he says with meekness with humility with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and I just want to leave this thought with you we have a Unity of the spirit I I like to do this I I'll ask brother Dan have have you maintained your U 200 foot yacht this this year yet no cuz he doesn't have one you can't maintain something that you don't have we have the unity to spirit because we've been born of the same spirit and therefore we have our part to do to maintain it and that takes humility death to self longsuffering forbearing one another and patience and so I believe that that's more important than ever we are in the closing hours days of time let's make sure we have our eyes on the prize have our heart right with the Lord and so the Lord bless you as we come into His presence tonight I'm looking forward to what the Lord would use our brother Dan to bring God bless [Applause] you one thing about brother Paul and uh and our conversations that we've had over the past few years is we are both exactly we see things exactly eye to eye on what brother Paul just said and I think that so often in in the past we've we've had different doctrines and we've had these wonderful Revelations that have come forward and they're they're but when a revelation separates the body of Christ it doesn't do us any good and I look at brother Paul and brother Paul is a master teacher he hopefully brother Paul you can preach for us sometime soon it would it would be a great honor to hear this brother I've heard him many times to hear him break down the word of God and brother Paul sees that the thing that is missing is a Unity of the Gospel as I've preached many times from this Pulpit that Jesus said that he would know us by our love for one another and not even that not so not even more than that that the world would see that Jesus Christ is the Messiah because of the love that the disciples have for each other the world hasn't seen that yet but it will see it and I want to be part brother Paul I want to be part of that Unity of the gospel and we are moving in that direction like you said it's there we just have to it has to come together we have to do our part each person each person whether it be husband and a wife whether it be a brother and sister whether it be friends we have to do our part and if everyone starts doing their parts then the Lord will come I really believe that with all my heart I appreciate brother Paul and his stand and brother Paul it's not always so easy to make us stand for Unity you think if we're standing for Unity that oh everybody's going to love us it's not like that is it brother Paul no it's not Unity requires leadership brother Paul is one that I've have seen he provides leadership for his group there and if uh he'll be speaking I assume at brother po this weekend let's make sure friends that we go and hear Brother Paul speak I think it would do all of us a lot of good and I sent out WhatsApp this morning that uh brother Israel's um services at Shalom Tabernacle Friday night Friday night at 7 Saturday night at 6 and then Sunday morning at 10: Sunday afternoon at 5: so please let's let let's go over there and and I know that uh brother Pro is a tremendous speaker and um I know that whoever is going to be speaking it'll be a blessing but um I think he's my favorite um God bless you all it's it's important brother Paul what we've been doing over the past about nine months is on Wednesday night I wanted to do a Bible study and we started with the book of Acts and we went chapter by chapter verse by verse word by word all the way through I believe there's 28 chapters in the book of Acts we started with chapter one and we went we went all the way through and we finished it we did a couple Recaps and in praying about it I thought that it please the Lord in doing that and and in moving the church forward thought Lord what would be the best thing that we can do first of all as as I said last last time I ministered I I said that the word is a lamp into our feet and it doesn't light the way all the way down to the end of the trail it just lights our next step so what that means is always be ready to change directions as we're learning so what I feel to do is we're going to start in Genesis and we are going to learn every single book in the Bible now we're going to do this we're not going to drill down too far we're just going to kind of fly over and and as as something that uh is a highlight we can telescope down in on that point but I want this church to learn our Bibles I wanted to I want you to learn what is Genesis Genesis is obviously means the beginning what is it what does that word mean what is what is the book about I me we all know Adam and Eve are in there but but there's a lot of others there's Enoch is in there there's Methuselah that I'll talk about today there's all the way there's Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph it's it's a beautiful book and it starts The Narrative of the Bible brother brandom said that the devil hates two books in this Bible the most he hates the Book of Genesis at the beginning and he hates the Book of Revelation at the end because it exposes those two books more than any other book in the whole Bible those two books expose the devil more than any other because the Book of Genesis Genesis shows where he began and the Book of Revelation shows where he ends and if the Lord carries we're going to get all the way through but again this light we may change directions the Lord may lead us in another Direction but tonight we'll start with the Book of Genesis so let's turn in our Bibles this is an easy one to find Genesis chapter one now Genesis has two distinct different parts it has basically how everything got started and how everything got ruined at the beginning the first 11 chapters and then from 12 to 50 it talks about about pretty much one man in his family and that man's name is Abraham and the rest of the book goes from from 12 to 50 talks about this man family this man Abraham's family so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to get all the way to chapter I'll try to get all the way to Abraham maybe dig into a little bit of Abraham and then I'm gonna pass it over to brother Lyall next week and brother ly will bring us from Abraham all the way way to Joseph next next week so if the Lord's willing that's what we're going to try to do tonight Genesis chapter 1 verse one says this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that scripture right there friends is probably the hardest thing for anyone who wants to serve the Lord to accept is that all of this it's proba the hardest step to take in our walk with the Lord for all of this that we're in we look up at the stars and we say that yes God created those Stars we look down at the ground we say that yeah God created the Earth he created the heavens and the Earth and he is able to do anything and that's the thing that's hardest for for any man or woman to believe that he is able he's able to accomplish anything that he sets his mind to in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters here just in the very second sentence of the book we have excuse me the godhead being explained we have in the beginning God the father created the heavens and the Earth and then this was all without form and it was void and there was chaos and and all of this that was created had no order to it but we see now the holy spirit moves on the scene and upon the face of the waters and it starts setting things in order and I think about excuse me how the holy spirit in a Christian God created all of us he loves us and and he placed us on this Earth and then we get so worked up in society we get so worked up with problems and our families and and everything that's going on and we forget that that Holy Spirit is sent to set everything in order when you receive that Holy Spirit you are set aside to service of our Lord and in the church and here right here right at the very beginning of the Bible we see this Holy Spirit start to set things in order in the world I mean if God can take a hydrogen atom and add a proton and a neutron and a electron to it make a helium atom and then you can take a helium atom and make another atom over here and all the way way to carbon and oxygen and all this and then put them all together and make water with a couple hydrogens and a and an oxygen and then put some carbon in there and make and make a a amino acid or whatever it is and all the way to to higher forms of life if he can do that certainly he can straighten out our lives if they get messed up and God said I love this part and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day in the darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day so on the second day God creates the sky and the atmosphere and he separates the liquid water from the water vapor and on the third day God creates the dry land separates the sea from the land creates plant life and grasses and trees and day four the celestial bodies are formed he creates all the stars and the heavenly bodies and it's so beautiful because he says that man can even tell what time it is by these celestial bodies that are in the sky and then on day on day five he creates the life that lives in the water and the fish and the whales and and he creates the birds and the insects and then on six on day six he creates the animals that are on dry ground and every other animal that wasn't created yet on day five and let's skip to verse 26 here I summarized that for time sake and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them notice he mentioned twice that God created Mankind in his own image and many of the times when I'm ministering and I'm talking about communion I talk about how if God if we are made in God's image and we want Fellowship as a father with my son Daniel my daughter meline my wife how I would like I like to be around I like to have fellowship with them and if we are made in God's image do you think maybe God would like to have fellowship with us and how we should spend in time with in prayer in the father talking to him and fellowshipping fellowshipping with him and speaking to him and and not always asking him Lord please bless my food and Lord please bless this and please bless that and help me out of this problem and that problem but how about sometimes saying Lord I love you and here is God as he created this man for fellowship with himself God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them remember God said remember Jesus said in John 4 4:24 he says God is the spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth so this first creation you'll see in the Book of Genesis here there's two this first creation here is in God's Own image which is a spirit because God as Jesus said is a spirit and God blessed them and God said un them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good in the evening and the morning were the sixth day notice as you read this when you go back and you read it God keeps saying and it was good and it was good and it was good Genesis chapter 2 verse one thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and sanctify it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God had created and made these are the generations of heavens of the heavens and the Earth where they were created in the day that God had made the earth and the heavens every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for God for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in the in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed let's ver let's skip down to verse 17 then he God gives Adam this man he gives him all of this creation this beautiful garden that he had planted and he says it's yours and he said of every tree on I'm sorry in verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May free thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die right now God is right here God is giving mankind a choice we always have a choice and our choice is always whether are we going to sin or are we not going to sin we have a choice and we can do either we can turn against God and to turn against God is to embrace death but to make that decision that we love God and to do what he says is to embrace god notice that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it had both in the tree so there's good and there's evil there and you see that that he says stay away from that he says he says don't eat of that fruit even though that there's good there because he he doesn't want us to have the attitude of I can make my own decision I can do it myself you know it's good and evil I'll just pick good but no God says no stay away from that and the warning but Paul this is beautiful this warning is in perfect context because it tells us what this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is the very next verse and the Lord God said it is not good that man that the man should be alone I will make him a helpmate a helpmate for him so right here he's saying touch this don't go in this direction he doesn't say don't touch it there but he says don't eat of this fruit and then right afterwards he says Ah it's not good that man's alone I need to make him a mate I need to make him a wife and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field let's skip to verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her under the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is the first marriage that was ever performed and God performed it right here notice he said cleave unto his wife so this man Adam and this woman eve were married and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed that verse 25 is important it's foreshadowing of something very important that will come to play into play just here in a little bit now so Adam and Eve they're in this beautiful garden everything is going well they have they have dominion over everything and they're eating of the fruits of the trees and they're enjoying in Adam's naming all the animals and and things are going well and then we see something come in right here verse chapter 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any east of the field of which the Lord God had made and he saith unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of every fruit we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die now do you remember before just before Eve was born just before Eve was formed God spoke to Adam and he said don't eat of the fruit of this tree not Eve he tells Adam this and then God forms Eve so here Eve is saying listen God said that ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it so I assume that this was her husband telling Eve because this was told to Adam before Eve was born before Eve was formed that Adam said listen God said don't God said don't eat of it and he said don't you even touch it he said stay away from this warning his wife and the serpent said unto to the woman remember she said that we're going to die if we eat if we do this thing now here is the Serpent's Seed this is how the serpent acts and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die exactly what God Said No God said don't do it and he said it's not that bad I know the word says this but it's not God didn't mean it like that here is how the serpent gets in and he gets his claws into the people and it's when you know the word says something and then you go and you do something through the councel could be of a pastor it could be of a friend it could be your own desires but you do something that the word prevents uh prohibits you from doing for God doth know that in the day that this is the serpent talking for God doth know and he's not a snake by the way snakes don't talk it's a uh this is a man this is someone that that is talking to Eve and reasoning with Eve in fact he's even more Sly than a man is so this is this is for all intents and purposes this is a man speaking to Eve for God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto her husband also with her and and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew they were naked so they knew so whatever happened between this man The Serpent and this woman Eve and then to her husband it caused them to cover certain parts of their body very strange result from eating metaphorically of fruit and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord called and the Lord God called unto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told you who told thee that thou was naked God immediately knew what they had done hast thou eaten of the tree where of I commanded thee that thou should us not eat there's only one way that you could have known that you were naked and that is if you had done this certain thing exactly what God said not to do and the man and the man said the woman whom thou gave Gest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat so God asks Adam and then God the Lord God said unto the woman what is that that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat notice that God has respect to his two children for an explanation but he didn't give the serpent the same the same thing he didn't ask the serpent for anything and the Lord God said said unto the serpent he didn't ask he didn't ask what have you done and he said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast and above of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now he's changing from this manlike creature into a snake and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bre bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now I mentioned the godhead in chapter one where we have God created the heavens and the Earth and then we see the Holy Spirit move on the face of the deep and now we have the third part of the godhead mentioned right here but notice it came after sin it came because now they have sinned now they have fallen now they need a savior and it says this and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now here right here is the fall of mankind and now we need Jesus Christ on the scene and immediately God prophesies that this man is coming and right here we see that it couldn't be the seed of a man that it would come through usually you would you would think we're going to get to Abraham's seed and we're going to get to all of these different genealogies that go through and they're very important but it couldn't come through that it had to come through the woman because she doesn't have a lineage if it came through the man who would be like oh my dad's name is Joseph like like Jesus like they thought Jesus was but no it had to come through a woman because it had to be a virgin birth without a Earthly father and right here is prophesying of the coming Messiah because of a sin that had been committed the sin of adultery how do we know that it gets even better watch this verse number 16 God speaking and he said unto the woman he says you've done this and here's his children standing before him he curs the snake The Serpent and here's his two children and he said unto the woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception right here he's saying Eve daughter you're pregnant and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children not a child but two twins children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which I command thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistles shall it bring before thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt return ashes to ashes and dust to dust and Adam called his wife wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living and again we know that because this was the sin of adultery here Adam is not the all he's the first man but he's not the father of all living but she is the mother of all living and unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them here we have a very another very very important the reason I'm spending so much time on just this first little bit of Genesis is because it is so important and it goes all the way through the end of the Bible this very this start right here we have the first sin we have the prophecy of the Savior coming and now right here the scripture I just read we have the first sacrifice unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them you can't take an animal's skin off of it without killing it so God goes and it was probably I would assume it was a lamb that he he took he killed imagine this was God's his his animal his pet his his beloved creation that he had made and here he goes and he kills it rips the skin off of it wraps up Adam and Eve and thus we have the first sacrifice and we see that Sacrifice from this point we see it now through the rest of the Bible now then so Eve's pregnant she has these two kids she has Cain and Abel one of them understood things and you'll look with when Abel makes when when they make sacrifices to God Abel understood God killed those animals took the skin wrapped Mom and Dad up with it so I understand now that I have to take the not the not just a lamb or not just a animal but the very best lamb the Bible says and he took the the flock and the the fat thereof so he took the very best one the fat one the good one and he took that and he sacrificed it on the altar to God and his brother Cain over here he probably number one the the vegetables and things that and the flowers and pretty Altar and everything that he made it probably wasn't worth a whole lot this fatling was worth a lot and he goes and he makes this beautiful Altar and God says I refuse your offering and I accept your brother abeles because abeles was right so many times we try to make an offering to God sometimes because it pleases us oh I think I'll do this but make sure when you were making an offering when you doing something something for God make sure that it pleases him or else it's it's done for not so we see Cain and Abel we go through and we see all of a sudden now right after this fall people start multiplying they start breeding and and we see C's line going over here and these these great men and they they they built great buildings and we see even down the line with Cain the there's violence in the cities that they're building and there's problems and even all the way down to one of these people down the line of Cain he's the first one to take more than one wife showing you that polygamy even though it's through the Bible it wasn't right in the beginning and it was actually a descendant of Cain that started polygamy so we go through if we go to chapter five this is great if you go to chapter 5 we see the lineage of Adam so Cain gets mad gets jealous he kills his brother Eve and Adam have another son this man's this man's name is Seth and it's and it's strange she says that God has appointed me another seed outside of Abel if really if Cain would have been Adam's son then that lineage would have come down through Cain but because it wasn't Adam's son Eve she understood she said that God gave me another one because Abel was killed so he so God gives Seth and then through this line of Seth we see how long these people these people lived it said here it says in verse eight that Seth was 912 years and he died and you see this in this chapter five you see a common occurrence that had never happened before and he died and he died and he died all the way through and he died 900 years 950 years 920 years 890 years and he died and he died and he died and death started there in the Garden of Eden all the way down 2,000 years or so this one's maybe 1500 years thousand yeah 1500 years we get down to this man named Methuselah let's go to verse 21 this is very very interesting a lot packed in these next few scriptures and Enoch lived 65 years and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so here we see a Rapture take place a man that was not sick that did not die God just took him happened again with Elijah and it's going to happen again very soon because as brother Paul was saying we are getting right to the end we're we're seeing everybody start to turn on this country Israel which I believe is in Ezekiel or Zachariah that says all nations will come against Israel we're getting to that point for a Rapture of more than one but many and I want to be part of that so Enoch God took him and then we have this guy Methuselah that's born very interesting thing right here we have Enoch his son was Methuselah then Methuselah is born and the name Methuselah means it means a couple different things but this is what struck me when he is dead it shall be sent yes so Methuselah is born and then 969 years later what happens how old was Methuselah when he died 969 years so meusel is born 969 years past about there's I mean wasn't maybe to the day but then something big happens so imagine if you knew Methuselah and you knew that his name maybe under prophecy said when he is dead it shall be sent and you're thinking okay Methuselah is getting kind of old in fact he's probably older than anyone has ever lived in their life and there's a prophecy that says his name means that when he is dead it shall be sent um continue feeding methusa that organic food because you want this guy to live a long time because what is going to happen when he dies I mean it can't be the end of the world right it was Methuselah lived 969 years and in that same year that Methuselah died it something happened that had never happened in the history of the world it rained not only did it rain from the skies the water gusted up from the ground and killed every living creature on earth including every human being except for this man named Noah and his family an amazing thing that happened 969 years after methusa was born so then Noah is Noah is on the earth and and right before it started to rain God looked out upon the Earth and things were just going bad you know it started it started there when when Adam and Eve were there and The Serpent and he messed everything up and now we have death and we have fighting we have murder and we have all of these problems and and these these young men are starting to marry outside with these worldly girls and vice versa it was just a big mess and it got worse and it got worse and worse and all of a sudden now there was more violence than there's ever been and God looked out upon the Earth and he sees that it's filled filled with violence violence verse number 10 verse number 11 chapter 6 it says this and the Earth was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said to Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me and the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth and Jesus Christ himself said before I return in the time that I return he says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be we see all the violence we see the hatred as brother Paul said the anti-Semitism against these people these are descendants of Noah these are descendants of Noah Noah's son Shem these are descendants of of the man named Abraham and violence all through it all hating these people and now it's all coming up and Jesus said when I come back it's going to be like it was in the days of Noah so then God floods the Earth kills all the people the ark floats Noah and his family to safe they after I think it was 150 days or or it was a lot of days um they they finally land on dry ground and God verse chapter number chapter nine God blessed Noah and his sons and he said unto them be fruitful and multiply when they came out of the Ark and replen the Earth exactly what had happened there at the in at the beginning In the Garden of Eden verse number 14 and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of All Flesh and the wat shall be shall no more and the water and the Waters shall no more become a flood and Destroy All Flesh and the bow shall be seen and the bow shall be in the cloud and I I will look upon it that I may remember the Everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of All Flesh that is upon the Earth and God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and All Flesh that is upon the Earth but sin already had a foothold but I think for everyone here and for the young people here when you look up and you see that rainbow remember God's looking at the same rainbow and he's reminding himself he's remembering that no I am not going to destroy this Earth no matter how angry he gets I'm not going to destroy this Earth anymore with a flood but Peter said the next time it's going to be burned with fire so then they started building C ities again as the Book of Genesis goes on they started building more cities and again sin had a foothold and they started to cause problems and and and then they build this great Tower of Babel they were so advanced in the way that they were living and in their technology they build this Tower and God looks down and he says the same thing that he says when it was in the Garden of Eden he says now look at they're becoming like us here and just like they had done when they ate of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so he comes down and he comes down in a different way this time and he confounds their language and everyone couldn't communicate the tower fell chapter 11 we'll get to Abraham and the earth and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and Tara lived 70 years and begat Abram nahor and Heron now these are the generations of Tara Tara begat Abram nahor and Heron and Heron begat lot and Heron died before his father Tara in the land of his Nativity in the in the land of his Nativity in her and in the caldes and Abram and nahor took them wives and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai and the name of nahor's wife milka the daughter of Heron the father of Mila and the father of Isa but Sarai was Baron she had no child and Tara took Abram his son and lot the son of Heron and his son's son and Sarai the daughter-in-law and his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from ER of the Cales to go to the land of Canaan and they came to Heron and dwelt there and the days of Tara were 205 years and Tara died notice something that happened right there very strange so from Noah's time everyone was living to be 900 years old and then when it started raining all of a sudden very quickly lifespan started to shorten I don't know if it was an atmospheric thing I don't know if it was a physical thing I don't know what happened but the lifespans of the people began to quickly shorten until Abraham was about 125 years old so they went from 900 all the way down to 125 years in a very short time and once so Abraham starts or God starts to deal with this man Abram Abram later as you know his name was changed to Abraham and he tells Abram to come out as I just read of this land and go into this land of Canaan so Abram goes and he goes with his nephew lot as I just read they they go out and they started squabbling all of his people Abraham's people and lot's lot's people all the herdsmen they started squabbling with each other and Abram's like hey we can't get along you need to go your way and I'll go my way where do you want to go Abram looks down and he sees this ferle Valley in this city down there called Sodom so lot takes the fertile Valley and then Abram goes and goes his way to another place now in verse 13 they they separate ways that I'm sorry then in chapter 14 Abraham lot gets in trouble he gets down there and immediately he gets in trouble he gets taken captive by these Four Kings and Abra Abram must musters up an army of his soldiers arms them and they go down and they defeat these Four Kings rescue lot and then they come back and they meet this mysterious ious man called MDC just a couple verses about MDC mzc brings the bread and the wine and they have communion there and then from that time The Book of Psalms mentions this man mzd the book of Hebrews mentions this man mzc you've heard brother Brandon preach a whole sermon on who is this man mzc he's a very mysterious person but it turns out that this man is the almighty God in the form of a human being that meets Abraham so in chapter 14 he he meets he meets this man mzc and Abraham had been promised as I read earlier that his seed was going to spread throughout the world and that God was going to make a great nation from his seed from his children but there was just one problem and that problem is Abraham and his wife couldn't have children so it got of course Abraham was was really down and uh we'll end we'll end with this chapter 15 and then I'll turn it over to brother Lyall next week after this but I thought that it would be really nice to read this chapter 15 Abraham's down he had just met this man mzc conquered these Kings rescued lot and after these things chapter F 15 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elaser of Damascus so Abraham had this servant in his house and it was the custom back then that if you did not have an heir if you didn't have a son that that Steward of your house would act as your son and inher be the inheritance elzer was a great servant we'll get to I'm sure brother ly will get to him in the next the next service Abraham said behold thou Hast given me no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be this is a man that couldn't have children aging and he believed in the Lord and counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of UR of the C to give thee this land to inherited inherited and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heer 3 years old and a she goat 3 years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided not and when the fowls came down upon the carcass Abraham Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low a horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a in in a land that is not there and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years but the LI will be talking about that at the end of his seron his sermon next Wednesday and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance now we go into the book of Exodus God is prophesying here and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace and thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it shall come to and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto the thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river of Euphrates it's fitting let's all stand it's fitting that the Battle Cry for the Philistines is from The River To The Sea and we read right here that no no no no no that land was given to Abraham to his son Isaac to his son Jacob and to all the sons of Jacob was it given and not to anyone else and they are in their inherited land today brother Aaron if you could sing a song as as we um close in this beginning of the book of Genesis we see the fall of mankind we see the genealogies come through and we see how God after Noah that he took this man Shem and from Shem this man Abraham and now the rest of the book is about this man Abraham and his Descendants the whole Bible he's there with Aaron for my soul would be had it not been for a [Music] man for the old rug C had it not been for a man called Jesus then Forever My Soul am man he he's mentioned this man Jesus as I said is mentioned right there in the Garden of Eden saying that that he was going to come and and he was going to crush the head of that serpent he's going to crush the head of sin but before that was finished that that sin would bruise his heel and he would die on the cross all the way through friends all the way through the Lord Jesus Christ from the start to the Finish he's in the Bible This Book of Genesis we see where Satan started he caused sin to come into the world we see it all the way down through the genealogies but we see that God had chosen his his people to serve him and now we have gotten to Abraham and the closing of the rest of the book is about this man Abraham and his family brother Paul would you come and close in prayer I want to pull on you one more time [Music] amen let's bow before the [Music] Lord heavenly father as we heard these important scriptures Lord that the devil hates so much because it does reveal where he came from it also reveals the beginning of our promises Lord that we today we are the royal Seed of Abraham through Christ and so Lord we know that even as that first commission was given there in the Garden of Eden was given to a spirit man before he was placed in flesh he was commission to be fruitful to multiply to replenish the Earth because as brother Bram said it was a spiritual Eternal commission we saw it tonight as Noah came forth from the ark that Commission Miss was repeated to go forth into the Earth to replenish and Lord that was not just and most importantly it didn't really involved the the bringing forth of the bodies and the temples of man but it was the spirits of man that would dwell in those temples that was what was of interest to you Lord and here we are father that commission is still ours when Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel there's that commission again we're under that Commission I pray Lord that we would have a burden in our heart for lost souls yes Lord we see the end Upon Us gross darkness is on the land lord we don't know maybe there's just one or two left that need to come in but may we have such a burden on our heart to reach out to let you work through US father as we see these scriptures these first chapters of Genesis Lord it brings down the reality and the importance of of where we're at today now this whole story is coming to its final end and then we go once again Immortal Eternal and we'll see you face to face thank you for being with us here tonight Lord I pray that this won't just be a simple Bible study or Bible lesson but Lord that you would reveal it to our hearts that it would change us increase our faith and give us more love for you and for one another we ask it all in jesus' name amen amen [Music] amen had it not been for a Hill Called Mount [Music] calary had it not been for the old R it CR had it for a man Jesus then forever my soul will [Music] beong I want to read just one more time as brother Paul was was praying and friends there are lost souls that are out there that need the Lord Jesus Christ in their lives we are seeing history play out before us pretty soon there's not going to be anymore it's going to be over this Rapture that happened to Enoch that I read about that happened to Elijah it's going to happen to a group of people and I want to be in I want to be in that Rapture but I want others to come reach out for first to our friends our families Members First to our loved ones and then reach out to more again it said God promised the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates I gave you this land and they are in that land today standing strong flying that star of David and pretty soon one one of these days it's going to be over so as brother Paul said let's get that last one in God bless you brothers and sisters pray that the first part of the Book of Genesis was a blessing I pray that you learn something remember it says in the Book of John that that the Word was God so as we learn more about this blessed old book The more we're learning about our Lord God bless you all you're dismissed oh Lord you are so preious to me and Lord You Are so preious to and I love love you yes

verse 25 sister hope if you can continue to play just for a little bit until I pray Acts chapter 20 verse number 25. foreign and now behold this is the Apostle Paul speaking and he's talking to a group of brothers he said and now behold I know that that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for this I know that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified let's pray Lord God those important words of the Apostle Paul and on my heart father for weeks now I pray Lord that your anointing would be here in this service and Lord that you would bless us father with your presence Lord help me to minister your word I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated thank you Daniel if you'll stay for just a minute um I uh before we get started first let me agree all of our visitors brother Gabriel bless you my friend good to see you hey the freyjo family there in the back for the angel and sister Priscilla and family welcome it's good to see you all again God bless you and there's there's probably a few more here that I'm missing well it's always it's always sister hope I mean sister Holly your mama God bless you welcome and and brother I always forget your name what's your name yes God bless you welcome also I am I told Daniel to stay um because Daniel just went to this Camp up in Cloverdale and he came home and his he was all hoarse and and he could barely speak and uh he told me the testimony of him being there at camp and there was a reason that he was hoarse and I thought you know brother buddy I want you to I want you to tell the church maybe if you could just give a just a report of the camp that you went to this past week up at up at Cloverdale up at Mount Baker and then then we'll get into this into the message this morning God bless you all um I just wanted to give a quick testimony about what happened to me at Camp it really blessed me um so I I got I go to Camp last about two weeks ago I think on on a Wednesday and we immediately go up to camp and you know we go up there we start hanging out with the youth and then we had our first service on Thursday night and I was going and I was really excited to go to Camp I'm like you know what Lord I really want to get something from this camp and so I go to service and I just had the hardest time getting in the spirit like I I couldn't like I wasn't feeling the Lord and I was like Lord I was like what's wrong with me I was like maybe I'm nervous but then the Lord on Thursday night he um there's this young brother there who was a new Christian and uh he just got baptized like a week before the camp and the Lord put it on my heart and he said he said you need you need to be Prayed by that brother his name was leilar and I was like no I was like not not a new Christian I was like I was like I was like what can a new Christian do for me and you know and that of course is the wrong Spirit to have amen and so I was like I was like I was like maybe not Lord that's that's a little embarrassing I was like he's a really cool guy I was like you know you're becoming friends I was like maybe not and so uh Friday rolls around and we had two services in the morning and the evening and let me tell you I was just struggling with both of them I was like Lord I was like I was like what's wrong with me and I you know I started didn't get a little scared I was like you know I was like you know brother bear talks about whenever you you know lose that feeling of the Holy Spirit and I was like Lord I was like what's wrong and so you know Friday both of those Services I just couldn't get in the spirit and then Saturday Night comes around and you know it was a great great speaker great Minister and had a prayer line and I was like okay Lord I was like this this is where I'm getting it and so I go through the prayer line and they're just Godly brothers that prayed for me but I I go through and I I still didn't feel anything I was like Lord I was like I don't know I go down to my seat and I'm just defeated I'm like Lord I was like it must be me it must be I'm nervous I'm not right I was like I was like Lord I'm sorry and then I look up and it's laylar and a couple Brothers standing by the altar just praying in the circle with their arms around them and I was like I was like you know what Lord I was like I'm gonna go up there I was like I'm Gonna Stand by these brothers so I'd go up there I get my arms around these brothers and I look at lailar and laylar looks at me and he just makes a b line for me and I was like I was like oh I was like Lord this is you and so he came over and prayed for me and let me tell you guys I've never worshiped like I've worshiped like that in my life it was just such a blessing and so it ended up to where we prayed about two two and a half hours after service and we were all just calling on the name of Jesus praying for each other and it was just such a just a rejuvenation for me I feel like I got so much strength from it absolutely thank you [Applause] he was hoarse from praying that's that's how I want to be hoarse amen you know that's why it's so important as Daniel was talking I was I was thinking about this new believer and and how it was the Lord wanted him to pray for Daniel and he the Lord has his way of doing everything we have our way of doing doing what we want to do but he has his way and we need to get in line with what he wants us to do even though it might not make sense and seeing this seeing these these new people come in they bring an energy they bring life so when they're coming in welcome them and just like this young man the kids like um he's a world-class athlete that Daniel was talking to and and he just had a Zeal he had an excitement and and Daniel when he came in when he was just so excited he's like Dad this guy he just he loves the Lord and and he gave a testimony about this young man how I believe he's from Thailand I believe he came to the um to Canada and and he was in athletics or I don't know exactly what it was but he he finally found the Lord Jesus in Canada and and he's all excited and he's just he's just so happy that he finds the Lord Jesus and he's and what happens friends what happens when we receive the spirit of God into us immediately we have a burden for others that's that is what it does every single time we've been going through the book of Acts it's in the book of Acts every time they receive the spirit and then they have a burden to reach out so this young man he receives the Holy Spirit he gives his heart to the Lord and what's the first thing that he wants to do he wants his family back is it Thailand back in Thailand he wants his family to come to the Lord So Daniel did he go back there did he call him okay so so he gets excited and he wants to lead them to the Lord and have them find this same joy that he has in the Lord Jesus Christ he goes and he starts talking to him witnessing him and they're like son we gave our hearts to the Lord Jesus also his family at the same time his family had given their hearts to the Lord they knew nothing about Christ before so everybody the whole family yes God working on both ends with this it's a miracle brother John just like you just did it's a miracle God working on both sides and seeing Daniel come home and I just feeling that energy how he's so excited Lord let that not let it not become stale that's why we need more coming and then they can bring their lick of fire and this fire starts to brother Tony is fire starts to build starts to get hotter and hotter and hotter and then it affects more and more people I just I was just so bless sister Irma where's sister Irma you sang that song sister Cheryl beautiful song too oh the words of that song are are just incredible and then sister Irma where'd you there you are sister Irma sister Irma singing that song I was thinking that he hung these planets in the Solar System the miracle that happened that God whether it was a big bang or it was a big bang no matter what God Said let there be light and I guarantee you there was a bang something happened but he set all of these planets in the Solar System as their song was going and he he hung he hung the moon and the stars and and it goes on for so long I remember looking at these Stars one time and the Lord was dealing with me and I said Lord every one of these stars that I'm looking at is bigger than the rock that I'm standing on right now and you created it all and I have a problem I have problems you can handle everything Lord you are so great and I was worshiping there now and and just thanking the Lord for all of that he's done in hearing sister Irma's song but yet the greater miracle was not that he hung these stars in the sky the greater miracle was that he saved a Wretch like Me that's the greatest friends because let me tell you something those stars are not eternal they will pass away it may be billions of years but they will pass away but this right here will never pass away because I am in Jesus Christ and he is eternal and if he's Eternal I'm Eternal with him I want to be associated with this man Jesus Christ that died for my sins it gave me eternal life Mr Shirley I love him so much for it I look at my son and my daughter and serving the lord and I'm I'm just I'm so grateful I'm so thankful that that he's done so he's just he's given us so much and I was as I was thinking on I I ministered on Wednesday night on this Acts chapter 20. and what was I read the scripture at the beginning and what had happened is this man Paul he came to this place and he wanted the elders from the church at Ephesus to meet him over in this place so he gets everyone together and they they come and they have like an elders meeting or a Minister's meeting and this is Paul says this is the last time I'm going to see you and they wept because there was prophecies knowing that that when Paul left this place he was going to go to Jerusalem and there were bonds waiting for him in Jerusalem and it was going to be and everyone knew it was going to be hard but but Paul stayed with it and he said no the Lord is leading me there I know I'm going to suffer I know it's going to be hard but I'm gonna go anyways and he said but when I leave he said wolves are going to come among you and I thought about as I read that scripture over and over and over I thought about who are these wolves that are going to come in and Scatter these sheep as Paul prophesied he said that they're going to come from the outside and he said they're going to come from right in among you and I thought who are these Grievous wolves that this apostle was talking about and why was it so important for him to warn us of these wolves our lord Jesus warned us also more than once about wolves that would enter in among you it was I was thinking on this and I was thinking about Lord what do wolves do when the Bible talks about wolves it's always talking about sheep too that there's sheep out here and these sheep are defenseless and these wolves come in and they kill the Sheep and and I've had this continuing anxiety attacks since January and it's almost daily worrying about the church and just and and worrying about these precious people that are in this building now and thinking about every one of them and and thinking about Lord this is the Lord's flock of sheep as as he says many times in these Jesus constantly makes the um the comparison of us and sheep and and thinking about Lord if I was the owner of these sheep if I had a hundred sheep and I lost a couple of them it wouldn't be that big of a deal it's like well they're my sheep I'll I'll make the money on these other ones and and you know you lose one or two but these aren't my sheep these are God's sheep and God places pastors over the flock and he says you watch out for these sheep they're mine you don't lose one of them wow and you know I just think about Lord this is scary if they were mine it would be different but they're yours when you come back and say where are my sheep I had a hundred of them um they'd better everyone be there because that is what he has tasked a pastor with scares me to death I'm thinking about about these sheep and it's like Lord and there's each one of them it's different even each one of us has a personality and Lord I I pray for them and and they need help and this one goes this way and some of them I don't even like every time I walk by them they try to bite me or kick me or step on my foot or do something but they're not mine it doesn't matter I was just kidding about not they're not liking it [Laughter] I really was kidding brother Joe all of them they'll they lash out and they bite and they kick but it doesn't matter and we see sometimes that that these Shepherds that they will look at these sheep and they will try to control these sheep try to dominate these sheep for what for their own benefit and it's the way that they control them is almost always by fear I was I was thinking of as I was thinking about the sheep and I was I was thinking about Lord You're so so good you are the great Shepherd and and we we want to follow you and I was um I was thinking about that song psalm 23. and I I was thinking about it's obviously about a shepherd and and sheep and it says this it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you you can probably say it by by memory he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for his namesake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me think about that Shepherd for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me as I was thinking on that I thought thy rod and thy staff they're different they're two different they're two different things that this Shepherd uses so I started thinking about a staff I know that Jacob leaned on it on his staff when he was when he was out and and Moses had this step but Moses also had a rod and Aaron had a rod different than a staff Aaron's rod was made out of um almond wood it's a very hard wood and inside the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant is less than four feet long and less than two feet wide so Aaron inside that Arc were two tables of stones the Ten Commandments a bowl of manna and Aaron put his Rod inside that Ark so it was small and when it was inside inside that box it butted and bore almonds so I got thinking what is this Shepherd's law thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and I thought Lord I really don't understand that so I was I was looking a little bit further and I could see that this staff this Shepherd staff he uses a tool that that when the Sheep were going he would he would take him and he would nudge them when they would get stuck maybe in a thorn bush or something some of these staffs had a hook on the end he could go and you've seen the pictures of the ones that go up and they have the hook he could go and he could grab the Sheep maybe if the Sheep was on a cliff or in a thorn bush he could go and he could pull it out to safety very kind thing with this this the staff but a rod was different this Rod was a club and so we see that dive rod comforts me Lord because I know that you have power in this rod and your staff that kindness so so this Shepherd he's got the staff and he's got this rod and this Rod sometimes had Nails sticking out of it and let me tell you the rod was not for the Sheep sometimes they use the rod on the sheep but it was not for those sheep that Rod was made to fight off the Wolves it was a club so we see that that there are two things at work this this rod and this staff and as as we go through this Valley it's shadowed by death we see sin all around us and we're here in the shadow of this and we're looking around and we see all death and destruction and horrible things around us and we're going through and we see that this great Shepherd his rod and his staff is his staff points us and his Rod fights off our enemies for us every time and this evil world that we live in fearful thing very very fearful as we go through this Valley but he says he is with us and his Rod fights off those wolves but who are these wolves that Paul was talking about to the elders at Ephesus Matthew chapter 7 listen to this verse 14. he says this the Lord Jesus speaking he says because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it wow he just narrowed it down this is a perilous time that we're in beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistle meaning grapes don't grow in Thorn bushes and neither do figs growing thistles they grow on trees the Amplified version of this the Amplified I sometimes I use the Amplified version the Amplified means just expounded on there's some there are some extra words in there that the author took from the original translation and he put it in context for us and it says this it says by their fruits you will recognize them that is by their contrived Doctrine and self-focus do people pick grapes from grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles I think about what has happened over the years and over the past 60s 70. years and I think about Lord we you sent a messenger you sent a shepherd to help us and then we see that things have changed and many times that that wolves have come in and changed the original meaning of what this man taught and it's very it's a perilous time and it's happened it's happened over time I read this quote last Sunday night but I want to read it again brother Brown said this in 1958 sign of the Messiah he says now he was speaking of Jesus he said I am the van the vine and you are the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit of itself it only purges the branches and the branches bears fruit do you know that well then if you went to a grapevine thank you if you went to a grapevine what would you expect to find grapes if you went to watermelon vine you find watermelon if it's a fertile Vine if you went to a peach tree you'd find peaches but then if you if Christ is the vine and his members of the churches the branches what ought you to find in the church think about that The Works that I do shall you do also More Than This shall you do for I go to my father that's what we should see in the church but what do you find when you go to the church we are the Presbyterian we are the Baptist we are the Pentecostals we got the message we got this that's not Christ Christ is love because he was God how much have things changed to where even we ourselves and I know this offends people I know it doesn't and I don't I don't mean it mean to say it but the Lord keeps I really believe it's him that lays it on my heart that what have we done we have a name just like the methodists and just like the Baptist and we say oh we're on the message and what does it do it does the same thing that it's always does it divides and it says we are an elite group and you're out the quote right there puts us right in with the others I was I have a friend I know brother that he and he went on a missionary trip with this with his other brother and before they left this is way back around 1980. before they left to go on this trip they the one brother minister went to visit sister Mita Branham brother Brown's wife I don't remember if it was here in Tucson or if it was in Jeffersonville but he goes and he spends some time with her he wanted to talk with her about the message and about brother Branham well they he spends time with her he meets this other brother they get on a plane and they fly to go overseas and they had this long time to talk and he says I was talking with brother branham's wife and he said these words he says you know he said it's amazing that his brother branham's own family didn't understand his message think about that it's amazing that brother branham's family didn't understand his own message and then after and after just 10 or 15 years this brother goes and he visits with sister Branham and and brother branham's own wife let me tell you Stephanie knows my message better than anyone I talk with her about it every day and after just 15 years even his own wife didn't even recognize the message what it had become because it had changed so much and now after all of these years it has changed to the point where I don't even think brother Branham would recognize it and it's not what he preached don't lay a lot of this stuff on him that man was a great man and he preached the gospel and not only did he preach it he showed us what happens when the Holy Spirit is in a man could it be could it be that these wolves that were prophesied to come that they came in preaching their own message that would benefit them and ruined it thank God that we have the prophet on tape could it be Jesus warned us brother Branham said he says we are Presbyterian We Are Baptist we are Pentecostal we got the message we've got this he said that's not Christ when Jesus was was with his disciples it was the closing hours of his life on Earth and Jesus in Matthew chapter 23 and 24 he goes to the he goes to the temple and he preaches to these Pharisees and Sadducees he says things like you try to honor the prophets of old and he says your fathers are the ones that put them in there in the grave he says you honor them he says you garnish their tombs and and and you you take you build these monuments to them and he said your fathers are the ones that put them in there one after the other he he he tells them he says he says this he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers or sepulchers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them of the blood of the prophets sounds familiar wherefore ye be witness unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets this is Jesus talking this isn't me wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them that killed the prophets fill ye up then a measure of your fathers ye serpents you Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell wow he's talking about these wolves that would come in and Destroy these prophets message and then you know the disciples were probably like whoa wow that was intense up there on that Temple mount so they get alone with Jesus a little while later they're up in the on the Mount of Olives which is just across the Valley from the temple Matthew 24 Jesus says this as he set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Matthew 24 verse 4. and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you he's warning the same thing Paul warned in the scripture that I read earlier there's coming he's saying that there's coming a deceiving spirit in the church and that deceiving Spirit can take many different forms it says take take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many it says so many shall come in my name and say that I am the Christ unto Steve many whose name are they coming in Jesus they're preaching Jesus and they'll come in my name and he says it's many I've never met maybe I don't I don't ever remember me ever meeting anyone that said that he is Christ and deceived anybody but but Jesus is saying that many will come and do that so many will come in my name and maybe they're saying that Jesus is the Christ and shall deceive still deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another so Jesus is saying that this spirit and it's a religious spirit this spirit is going to come into the church and it's going to cause hatred and Division and I'm not saying that this is message churches I'm saying that this is Christianity all over the place and saying that this is going to come in but we do see that spirit and deceive many and you look at what happens inside the churches and you see that they fight and they gossip it's not normal we shouldn't do that you see within the families you think you see the fighting and and all that that's not normal we shouldn't do that you say I don't hate anyone but then you get offended at any little thing it's not right Jesus here is saying that all these things are coming into the church and you are going to be out there as sheep among wolves and many Prof false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold so all of this we see this coming in and what it is we see that that this Spirit gets such control over the people and we see it Through the Ages you just read history we see that this Spirit gets such control over the people that it and and the people are so afraid of of the hierarchy they're so afraid of of the pastor or the church or whatever it is they're so afraid of getting kicked out or being or being ostracized that they'll sell their own family out that that what what the most important thing is that they're accepted and they'll look at their family and betray them the love of many shall wax cold and we see it we see it today and I think many of us it hits close to home that the fear that Satan puts over the people and and we're so afraid of the church or we're so afraid of the pastor where's the fear of God brother Leo that's who we should be afraid of and don't and and stand and and it's to stand up against against these things brother Branham said himself he was when he dedicated the the Branham Tabernacle he had this Vision beautiful vision and the Lord he said basically Lord where's my church and he showed them all the skies and and brother Branham wrote second Timothy chapter four on a piece of paper and put it just as Paul did saying wolves are going to come in put it in a piece of paper and put it on the on the in the Cornerstone of the brown Tabernacle I'm not talking about the Tabernacle Church I'm talking about the ministry that was to come I'm not saying anything about the Bram Tabernacle I'm saying that brother Branham put this in there and it says this for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they heat for themselves teachers having itching ears that scripture these teachers having itching ears they shall Heap for themselves the congregation shall put these teachers in place and they will dictate what is said from the pulpit you know why because the pastor is afraid that if he if he crosses the line that the people will leave he fears that I know I I have feelings that I've never felt before in being in this position so I know I can I can relate to that and brother Branham put that in there saying that this Spirit was going to come and it's the spirit of of division in this the spirit of not standing up for what is right with God we see that the way of the world today is never making a stand for anything I talked about on um Wednesday night I talked about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs have you seen have you heard about this new this new uh I don't know if it's out yet or whatever new movie about Snow White you heard about it there's no doors there's there's no little people because they were afraid that if they have seven dwarfs that they're going to offend the little people so what did it do it upset them because these poor actors they don't get the job and it's all because everybody is afraid of offending anyone else and when you do that you offend everyone because there's no one that will make a stand there's no one that will really stand up for what's right and then it says that they shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned to Fables we worry more about what our friends are going to think rather than our decisions that we make rather than these things that please the Lord I was really friends it's really in my heart we have to have that relationship with Christ that is what a church is for this church comes together to support each other to have that relationship with the Lord Jesus and don't fear don't ever be afraid if you are afraid Satan is the author of fear we should fear God of course that we should please him but not man so if we really are fearing something who do we have faith in do we have faith in Satan or do we have faith in God never fear fear is is the opposite of love I remember I was years ago we were living in Jeffersonville I want to make sure you know I'm not saying anything about any church when I said that brother Ben placed that scripture in the Cornerstone I'm for everybody I I I I'm for the church is getting people together and loving the Lord but he placed that there saying that that the people we're going to turn from what's the truth to fables not so much not that church but I believe my interpretation of it that they would turn to something that was not true I was this is a sad story I I was um we lived in Jeffersonville and we came out to Tucson and uh some uh some people that I knew that that I used to go to church with they um uh one of the brothers died and the kids were all there and none of the kids were serving the lord anymore and I went there and I talked to them and and I said what what what's going on why why aren't you why aren't you serving the lord why don't you why don't you believe anymore and they said listen they said our dad the girl said that if we put makeup on our face that our faces would fall off they said how could we believe something like that threatening them all the time this Dad threatening these kids that if you do this then it's you're gonna that Satan's gonna attack you not not not presenting it in the right way not presenting it in love presented in in the way that it should be presented for First Timothy Chapter 2 says this it says Paul says I exhort therefore I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving thanks be made for all men Paul's going to give some correction here and it's correction that we in our message churches that we use for Kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all goodness godliness and honesty First Timothy chapter two brother Jeremy for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior verse number four who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself for a ransom for all to be testified in due time not anyone else the Lord Jesus himself where unto mine or brother Jeremy am I in the wrong place I'm sorry I meant First Timothy yeah thank you First Timothy chapter 2 verse 7 where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles of faith in faith and Verity I therefore that all men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting how many of us are doing that other translations say that I desire that in every place men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger and without quarreling we leave this part of the message out there shouldn't be any fighting there should be any anger among us there shouldn't be any attacking each other Jesus told us that we're in the last days and the love of many would wax cold verse number nine in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-facedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or Pearl or costly array but which becometh the women professing godliness with good works so in Even in our very lives even in the way that we dress we should represent our lord Jesus in every way that says let a woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer suffer not a woman to teach nor a serp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed and then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness and sobriety so in this chapter that's used so much Paul is bringing out the reason why even in a very close that we wear should represent the Lord Jesus and a man should be praying all the time with with with sincerity of heart not quarreling not fighting but doing his best to serve God in every single way then that's when we see things happen but wolves friends have taken these scriptures out of context and taken what brother Branham said out of context and used it not as a staff but use it as a club to beat people and drive them away and put fear into them well excommunicates you if you don't line up we'll kick you out of church if you don't do it it's not right there are reasons to do that and Paul laid those out but it's not because of my Ministry brother Aaron it's not because of what I say remember with my kids growing up and Daniel and Madeline and saw that like all kids they stray and they do things wrong and I remember my daughter was talking to this young man that I knew this was not right and and I'll tell you in in parents growing up a lot of times when it's a boy or a girl that's when you see your children leave so with my daughter I laid down the law and I said you will not see this young man in fact I called him and I say if I ever see your face again it'd be the worst day of your life and I I was serious that Rod had Nails in it and and what kept my daughter at home what kept her from running off there was a foundation built and it's in that first Timothy that I just read that it was a foundation built not because of me telling them and threatening them you're gonna you're gonna do this and your face is going to fall off and and all of these nonsense things and me not living the life but she had love at home and we we build this this church and we we build our our lives and Friends it is so important that we are representing the Lord Jesus Christ at home first and when my daughter told me she listened she she did what I I said and I told her I said it's me or him I was firm on it because I knew and thank God I did it I'm so grateful that I did it because she's got the best husband that you could ever meet as far as a as far as a husband and a good kid now and and when I was talking to her just me and her we we set up a date night that we would go out once a week once every couple weeks and it was just me and me and her and it and I would we would talk and and I said sweetheart I'm just proud of you and you know what she said she said Dad she said Do You Remember when you'd pray she said you know I heard you I said I said what sweetie she said you'd go into the middle bedroom and she said I could hear you through the wall and that's what built it up it wasn't what I told her it wasn't that I threatened her it wasn't that I took a staff and beat her it was because she witnessed her dad in that other room praying she said I couldn't hear what you said but I knew from the tone of your voice that you were praying she said she said dad and and she said you know I would listen everything that I could say every scripture or every quote or whatever it was it would be meaningless if I didn't live that life to back it up we should be living that life or our testimonies thrown right out the window how many times do I hear criticism hear criticism of people not looking like like people think that they should look or or this person's not he doesn't she he doesn't line up the way I think it should be or she doesn't line up the way that I think it should be and I look at their lives the people that are saying that you're gonna be kidding me that's what did it for my daughter was her dad in that room praying even though she couldn't even hear what I was saying I didn't know she could hear what I I didn't even know that's why I went in that room because it was private and yet that's what won my daughter was her dad living I look at my son so proud of the kid you know and then and the Lord dealing with him and going there you know what one him is the four o'clock in the morning me getting up and studying and praying and the little guy getting up with me for years doing that wasn't what I told him it was the example that I set and even with all my failures and the kids knowing my wife knows that I've got many of them but setting that example and then when the wolves come in get them dad I'll pull that club in no way not my kids and the same thing friends with all of us in this church we're all Shepherds to a certain extent and we're all sheep there's a time to pull that club and you better have the life to back it up you better do it because Jesus warned brother Branham warned that these times were coming this they wouldn't endure sound doctrine that all of this strangeness and all of this weirdness would would follow and and we see people are so afraid that they're going to be kicked out and they're so afraid what other people going to think what about what God thinks of your life he knows what you're doing in your private time you can point all your fingers all you want God knows exactly what you are doing and let me tell you let me give you a warning don't be pointing fingers because they'll be three point right back at you I've made that mistake let me tell you I lived as legalistic and as right and I still do as I can but I've realized that Lord I'm a failure just like sister Irma singing that song wow I am the miracle I Lord I don't know how why what but thank God you saved me thank God that you did it for me that that you took care of me because I'm a failure I'm a sinner and I've done I've done everything wrong and I look and the reason was a simple thing and being in prayer you go into your closet and pray in private and then God took takes care of it with our kids and it's never too late it is never don't ever think that that because you're old or whatever you will always be a mother you will always be a father if you have children those that time never ends and you always watch out for them you always take care of them and when those wolves come in and try to ruin everything then you can fight them off because you have set that example when I said that about sister Brandon when I heard that I thought Lord this is exactly what he said don't do I read the quote Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal the message and what do we do we go and do the same thing and what does it do it cuts people out and it puts fear in the people that they are trying to please man rather than pleasing God and it destroys everything you know what it does it takes the love out of the people it takes the love out of the believers there's there's one more scripture I wanted to read I'm so far off my nose brother Jeremy if you could put up first John first John 4 17. it's dominated by fear herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us the musicians could come friends I want us to get back to this original word to get back to Pentecost to get back to to what God has ordained for us but then when we go and we we change what he said and we we denominate it it pulls the spirit out because there's no love there it destroys it the reason my family is was as close to brother Branham as any other family both sides and the thing about brother Branham was when they would get around him he had absolute love no matter what they were doing I look at the two sides of my family look at the one side that was a rough group now look the other side my mom's side was a very very clean and very um Pious group yet he treated both of them the same and how much he how what an example he sent to the people so much that they would do whatever he said because he had such love and there is no fear and love he would never beat the people like we see today and try to instill fear in them think about I just I want to say it people get hurt they get hurt because of being condemned and being beaten down and then they do what we call they leave the message how can you leave something if it's not a denomination how ridiculous is that statement they leave did they leave Christ that's different but they leave this what they're doing is they're leaving they're leaving it because it didn't take hold at the beginning and maybe it wasn't presented in the right way in love so we need to present this in love and present this to our children and you young people when you grow up when you have a family put God first all of the time that we spent in our devotions studying the Bible all of the time that my family and I we spent praying together that we spent listening to the message to to reading and and all of that it pays

[Music] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. [Music] My garments are spotless. Yes, they're white as snow. Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Oh, are you washed in the blood in the so cleansing blood of the lamb? Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? &gt;&gt; Let's all let's stand for prayer. One more time, brother Michael on that chorus. [Music] Are you washed in the blood? [Music] &gt;&gt; In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, Lord, to be washed in that blood, it means salvation. It means eternal life. Lord, it means everything to us. Lord, we are grateful that we can call ourselves in this day Christians. Father, be with us tonight. We pray. We thank you for a good service this morning. We pray that you're with us tonight, Lord, as we open the word. May it glorify you. And Lord, may it answer questions that are on our hearts. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. I got two friends. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You know, I was standing outside And the deal with not having hair on your head is that if you don't if you stand out there too long, the top of my head sizzles and uh so yeah, got too much sun. Fellowship's been outside this morning. Um it's a it's a special service tonight. I got two two friends here and I want both of them to say a few words. Brother Matt has met. We have uh he's Zach and Zeke's dad. It's good to have you here. And then my dear friend Michael McKenzie from the Carolas from Brother Gerald Gerald Hughes's church. He's a brother Gerald's a good friend. Brother Michael's an old friend. I've known him for a long time. I want both of you if you could both come up and and greet the congregation. Jamie, it's good to see you. God bless you. Welcome. I totally took credit this morning for your marriage. I I said that you met at my house, so I Yeah, I took credit for it. But it's it's good to see you. God bless you. Welcome. Of course, Zach. Good to see you. Brother Matt, come come on up. And if you'd say a few words, Brother Matt goes to a church in Washington State and pastored by a good friend of mine, Brother John Andes. And I asked I said could you just come up and greet the congregation from the church we we would really appreciate it. So brother M bless you. Thank you. Bless you. All right. Well hello everybody. Thanks for uh giving me a couple of moments, pastor. And uh yeah, just wanted to greet the saints on behalf of the church of End Time Message Tabernacle and brotherh John Andes and on behalf of the officers of the church and the saints there, we greet you. It's wonderful to travel about and see other people that are growing in in Christ and uh following and uh so just yeah, we want to greet you and I'll I'll send your greetings back to them when I return. Um I just wanted to pastor said if I had just a couple couple little thoughts and so um I part of also what I wanted to do is thank you as a congregation on behalf um of a father and a mother and my wife just uh some of the role that you played in my son's journey of faith. And so he um well it's a wonder how how how the Lord works in marvelous ways. and he took um I'll back up just really slightly to myself. Uh I was at the age of 18, I said to my parents, I said, \"When I graduate high school, I also graduate church.\" And uh and I and I had a firm belief. I I said I didn't want um a Lord to be over my life. And so uh the Lord has an interesting way to humble us because uh you know, I I just thought I wanted to go my own way in life. And uh and so the Lord by his grace sees me from that point all the way until now and only by his grace humbly trying to walk with him uh to keep humble before him. And so it's a wonder it's a wonderful thing when you see a similar process unfolding in the lives of your sons. And uh and so that's and the Tucson tabernacle plays an interesting role in that because a couple years ago my my son Ezekiel he was finding a different way as well. you know, he was he was away from the church a little bit. He wasn't coming to church so much and um he was just seeking his own way. And so we had a conversation a couple years ago and I could just tell, you know, the enemy wants to put a little bit of fear in there like, you know, your son is wandering and and so you go to prayer as parents and um and sometimes it takes a while. Well, fast forward a couple of years and there was an event here that Katie and Josiah AOT spoke with my son to maybe come video. And so he comes down here and he videos it and then the next thing I know he's he's home. I can't remember the time span. The next thing I know he's thinking about packing his car and headed towards Tucson and and so yeah, and I understand and and then there's an opportunity to live in the the little apartment right next to the Tucson Tabernacle. So, you're just thinking to yourself as a father, well, Lord, I mean, you had a plan all the way along. And so, you know, it's just it's amazing to see how the Lord works. It's um I wanted to encourage anybody who has young one or loved ones that they're praying for. Uh that God is a God of miracles and a God of grace. And sometimes he takes the whole mountain and he moves the whole mountain instantaneously. Other times he takes it dump truck by dump truck. And uh so in my son's case that was it was a little slower process but uh by God's grace his his his journey is headed in a very wonderful direction and uh I'm so grateful to the Lord for that. Um, you know, I was thinking, uh, pastor, that um, you know, the same the same God who those seraraphim were covering up and that was such a I've never really thought about that how they were covering up their face and uh, as if to say, yeah, don't don't look here, you know, look there. But it's that same God who said uh, in the scriptures, you know, is anything too hard for me? And so I I was thinking about that verse this morning or during the afternoon when I was speaking and I I said surely Lord the there is nothing too hard for you. And so yeah, we put our faith in that God who declared that and and we can just say, \"Father, I may not know how you're going to do things, but I'm sure interested how you're going to resolve this situation.\" And we just we just hold that in faith and we trust in the Lord and we put our head down and we keep praying and we um and and I also love be still and know that I am God. And so bless you saints. I will now uh yeah that was [Applause] tell you. So Zeke came down. We all know Zeke. We we love Zeke. And uh Zeke came down and yeah we we put him in jail in the Tucson Tabernacle and he had to he had to live right over here so he couldn't get away. Brother Matt, I do I do appreciate appreciate the family. And you know, when we're praying for someone, our children especially, or maybe a spouse, we never want to put God in a box and say, \"God, you have to do it this way.\" Because it's so easy for us to do that. It's so easy for us to have a path that we think that the Lord should do and we have a destination for our children or our loved one and he never does it like we want it. He's sovereign. He has a way. So, the best thing that we can do is take it out of our hands and we place it in the hands of God. Because let me tell you something. If you didn't already know this, God's hands are much more capable than our hands. &gt;&gt; He's been doing this for 6,000 years. And he knows very well how to bring a soul out of the world. And he can he can no matter how bad things look. I mean, things weren't bad here, but sometimes they are bad. Sometimes you have no idea. Lord, I I have no idea what you can do. I have no idea what's going to happen with this, but Lord, I need this. My son needs this. My daughter needs this. And then you just put it into his hands and watch what he does. He is a miracle working God. He's been doing it for a long time and he does it today. They they say sometimes that, well, the days of miracles are over. No, they're not. Miracles happen and they happen all the time. They happen every day. And really, we've seen miracles in this church. We've seen the sick healed. But when a soul is saved, &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, something something changes. Let me let me give a testimony I was given to the kids at lunch. We know that Alex, the Russian guy that uh that was coming, has been coming. I don't know for six months, eight months. We know Alex's wife, Joy. And Joy, she was Joy did not represent Joy. She was not a happy lady. And she would, boy, she she was rough on me and I think she was rough on quite a few of you. And she would wait outside the church and she'd let us have it. and just not a nice person most of the time. Well, I get a text from someone. Maybe it's from Joy. No, because I blocked her on my phone. This is how bad it was. You laugh, but I did. There was a reason I did. And it was because I had to. So, somebody tells me that, hey, you know, Joy, she's finished. and and I was I was she said she's finished with it and I was worried about her. I was worried about maybe she was going to take her own life. I was worried about what was going on in her life. So the next morning I told um I told brother Ed I think it was I said make ready for baptism because I don't know what joy was meaning and you all were most of you were here about threequarters of the way through my sermon Joy walks in. She's never stepped foot in this church. Joy walked in and she sat right about behind where sister Shirley is and she sat next to her husband. And as I was ministering, you know, she has that real firm look. As I was ministering, I could see the face soften up and I could see that she was really thinking. And towards the end of service, I I could see the hard shell The Bible calls it a stony heart. I could see that stony heart start to break a little bit. And then I looked down at her and I said, I think I said, it's on video, you can go back and look at it. I think I said, Joy, I said, God cares about you. God knows you. He knows everything about you, and he cares. And then the tears just started coming down her face. and talked to her for a little while longer right in front of everybody and I said, \"Do you want to be baptized?\" And she was puckering. That bottom lip was going up and down. And she shook her head. And we brought her up and and a couple of one or two others brought them up and baptized them. This just a few weeks ago. And I'll tell you what, that woman changed. She changed that day and she is the sweetest person now. And I unblocked her and everything everything is is okay. And I'll tell you what, she was hugging the sisters and brother Joe, she came up to me and she grabbed me and she rubbed the top of my head and said, \"I love you, pastor. You're not allowed to do that. I love you too, Joy. And and she is she was telling me this morning, she said, \"I want to lead my dad to the Lord Jesus.\" And I just thought, you know, is it worth it? Is doing this. That right there makes it all worth it. That woman had no one. She was by herself. Her husband and her did not get along. He would come to church. He was referred here from another church that we we don't even know. They said Tucson Tabernacle has changed um over the past couple um couple months. And and they told um Alex, they said, you know, you should go try it out because we heard that there's a lot of people starting to go over there. and and he came and you know Alex he's real firm and he's Russian and and you know you go to give him a hug and just I shake hand you know and and but now he's got a wife that loves the Lord and she's happy. She's still going to have troubles. We're all going to have troubles. But things changed in that lady's life. I don't know if I've ever seen a change so much as in Joy. I don't know how many how many know Joy? How many? A lot of you do. Has she not changed? It's it's really a miracle. So, I see that the Lord can do things and he has his time and he has his way. And Joy made the decision herself and she walked down in there and she gave her heart to the Lord Jesus. And now it's like, well, praise God. Praise God. And I will I'm going to have brother Michael if you could come up. Um, but I'll I'll talk about in a little bit the old question that says, \"Can a can can you lose your salvation? Is once saved always saved?\" Is that correct? Before I want Brother Michael to greet us. Brother Michael's originally from the Congo and he's lived here for a long time. As I as I said, I've known Brother Michael. He's a good friend. He's got a precious family. His do Where's the daughters? Where's the girls? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, next time they're going to come, right, sister? Good to see you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's a joy and a privilege for me to be in front of you, the redeemed of his blood. Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Yes. As brother Daniel say, he's a good friend of mine and I am blessed to be a friend of yours and to be in our midst, your midst tonight. I just wanted to read one or two scriptures to greet you with those scriptures. And at the same time, I'm bringing greetings from Pastor to you and the whole congregation and from my children. So my wife is sitting over there, sister Stella. She's right there in the back. So I want to read Um in the book of Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 it says let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. That's one of the scriptures I love the most because it talks about the word amongst us, dwelling amongst us. That's where we we draw our strength. And the other one is second Timothy that would be chapter 3 verse 16. It is the same about the word. It says, \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, &gt;&gt; for reproof, for correction, for instruction, in righteousness.\" &gt;&gt; So everything is laid out there the way the word is going to do for you in righteousness with love. So we love you and we appreciate the grace that the Lord has given to brother Daniel here. I've been in this church. It's been six years. We didn't have any pastor but I had opportunity to visit here. That's what I had to greet with these few words from scripture. God bless you. [Applause] Praise the Lord. God is good. So now I asked for some questions and and I got some really really good questions from the congregation and I I thought that that I could take about 15 minutes, 20 minutes and answer one of these questions that someone wrote in. I don't know who it was but it it's it's an excellent excellent question and and it goes back actually it has divided the Christian church for a long long time and one and one of the things I want to say on these questions that if you have you you probably won't on this one but if you have a really strong feeling one way or the other don't Let a doctrine divide you. &gt;&gt; We have learned that we have no book but the Bible, no law but love, and and no book but the Bible, no law but love, and come on. No creed but Christ. Thank you. And that that's how we believe. And if we can be separated by simple doctrines that even the highest theologians separate on then friends the the spirit of Christ really isn't there. It really isn't among us. So when we are talking about these questions and I'll do my best to answer. Brother Brandham said if there's a Bible question then there's a Bible answer and I'll do my best to answer according to the Bible. But make sure that as we are going through these, take the scriptures that I read, bring them into your heart and then apply them to your life. My interpretation, I could be right, I could be wrong, but the most important thing is that the Bible is read. And then what I want to do is I want to place it into your hands and say, \"Now, what do you think about this?\" and let the congregation dig into the word. That's my role. My role isn't up here isn't to be up here and have you listen to me as the pastor and you put all of your trust in my interpretation or my revelation. That's not a role of a pastor. It's not the role of a priest. That's not the role of a leader in the church. The the role is to get you excited about the word, to get you to dig in, and then you will receive the blessings from the Bible. The Bible is just full of blessings. Our brother said that all doctrine, all scripture is given by inspiration from God and good for doctrine. So we are permitted by that scripture to open up this word wherever we want to open it up &gt;&gt; and learn from it. &gt;&gt; And it's a blessing to be able to do that. So the question if you were once saved are you always saved? Is this a one-time thing or can you lose your salvation? So we what we here have here is we have a classic um disagreement between Calvinism which is basically you're saved, you're predestinated that there that basically almost you don't have a choice in the matter that you either are or you're not. And then we have the other side we have Armenianism that says no you have to continue to work. You have to continue to serve. You have to con you you can't when you fail you have to repent again and you have to always strive for perfection and yes you can lose your salvation. So let me read some scriptures from both sides and then I'll give you my opinion but it's up to all of us individually to decide. So these passages I'm going to I'm going to read now, these scriptures emphasize emphasize eternal security. Okay? Eternal security is once saved, always saved in salvation for true believers. It says this, and I'm sorry I did not give you these, but let's see how fast you are on your sword drills. John 10 verse 27, Jesus said this. John 10:27, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish. Neither shall a man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand.\" So he's saying, \"I gave them eternal life. I saved them. I have them in my hand. And there's no one that can pluck them out. There's no way that they could be lost.\" Romans chapter 8 verse 38 says this, one of my favorite scriptures, and I read this often in closing. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. No matter what sin you commit, there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 says this speaking of the Lord Jesus I'll read the New King James Version. It says, \"In him you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory.\" The Old King James says, \"In whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. In whom also after that you believed Josiah, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, what we were talking about earlier, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory.\" So you were sealed after you believed. You gave your heart to the Lord. You were sealed. All right? And who can break a seal? Satan can't break that seal. So I believe the author there is saying now other scriptures. Now let's look at the other side. Brother Michael, you probably knew I'd go to this one. Hebrews chapter 6 verse4. It says this, \"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away to renew them unto repentance, seeing that they crucify to themselves the son of God aresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Little difficult to understand. And let me read the amplified version of that. For it is impossible to restore to repentance those who have once been enlightened spiritually and who have tasted and consciously experienced the heavenly gift and have shared in the holy holy spirit and have tasted and consciously I'm sorry experienced the good word of God and the powers of the age to come. They've experienced of the world to come and then have fallen away. It is impossible to bring them back again to repentance since they again nailed the son of God on the cross. Amplified says, \"So as far as they are concerned, they are treating the death of Christ as if they were not saved by it and are holding him up again to public disgrace.\" So the Apostle Paul here, author of Hebrews, he says, \"It's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of this heavenly gift, if they fall away, it's impossible for them to come back. John 15:6. I know it's a bit of a downer, but it's what the Bible says. John 15:6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered, and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in me and my words also abide in you, then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. New Living Translations a little easier to understand on that one. It says, \"Anyone who does not remain in me, remain in me, is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned. But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want and it will be granted. So remaining is staying which means you are there. Now stay there. But he's saying here but the ones that don't remain they are cast away. 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 27. 1 Corinthians 9:27 says this, \"But I keep under my bo under my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be cast away.\" English standard version of that says this very very direct. It says this, \"But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified.\" Oh, so now we've seen the other side. You can see how someone can be an Armenius. You see how they could say, \"You could lose your salvation.\" What about Judas? Judas walked with the disciples. Brother Ram said he lost his salvation. His name was taken off the book of life. So what's the answer? Listen to this. Let me read that. Judas when Jesus is praying for his disciples he's in the garden of Gethsemane he says this St. John 17:9, he says, \"I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine.\" Verse 10. All are mine. I'll read the You know what? All are mine. All mine are thine and thine are mine. and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep them through thine own name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one. Now watch verse 12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them is lost. So he's saying that those that you gave me, none of them has lost, but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled. So one was lost, that the scripture might be fulfilled. So this he's Jesus is saying now he's praying down there in the garden but he hasn't yet completely been betrayed. Jesus hu uh Judas hasn't walked up to Jesus and kissed him to identify him to the soldiers. So it hasn't quite happened yet. But here Jesus said that he's lost. So what is it? So, can we lose our salvation? Was Judas ever really saved? It's a good question. It says in Revelation 22 verse 18. says this,\"For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, that if anyone if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of the of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the book of life, from the holy city, and from the things that which are written in this book, shall take his part from the book of life, out of the book of life. So again, you see how there can be two sides to this. You can you see how these theologians, they go back and forth and back and forth for years. Is it or is it not? So what do you think? Has anyone changed their mind? I think we had a almost a consensus before that you can't lose your salvation. Has anyone changed their mind? Michael says, Let me uh let me give you my thought on this and studying and studying the message and and it's it's back and forth and in studying the the theologians and and what they say really it's back and forth. But listen to this. God is talking to Job. All right. Job is complaining. He Job had gone through a really, really hard time obviously. And Job is kind of complaining to God. And God tells Job, he says, \"Listen.\" And watch the story that God tells Job. He says, \"You think you're good, Job? Where were you when I laid the found?\" I'm going to read the New King James. Job Job 38:4. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding. He says, \"Tell me if you understand.\" &gt;&gt; Who determined its measurements? Surely you know, Job. Surely you know these things. If you're so good, sure you surely you know how I created the heavens and the earth, right, Job? Who determined in the measurements? Surely you know. Or who stretched the line upon it to what were its foundations fastened or who laid its cornerstone. So he's talking about the creation of the world. He's going way back. It's it's important to set the context here. He's this goes way back. Now watch what he says. Verse number seven. When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy, the sons of God were there. They were shouting for joy when God created all of this. So if they were there way back then, then how can you lose your salvation? if you were in God eternally because we were there. I believe I was there. I don't remember it obviously, but I believe I was there and I was shouting. I was like, \"Yes, yeah. Look at this world. Look at these stars. Look at all of this. Praise the Lord. This is all this is awesome.\" I was there and I was shouting. I was just praising God just like the serarapums we heard this morning that they were they were there and they were covering their face and they were covering their feet and they were flying around and they were looking at each other and they were saying holy holy unto the Lord. They were looking at each other and praising God saying how great he was. And there I was, brother Matt, there I was at the foundation of the world and I was shouting for joy. And what does that have to do with this? So let's go to Revelation chapter 13 verse 5. So we've established here that the sons of God were there for way back. Revelation 13 says this. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints. We're talking about the enemy here. And it was given unto him to to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And the power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written whose names are not written in the book of life. So all these that are worshiping the beast, their names are not written in that book. of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. That's longer than 2,000 years ago. So that goes way back also before God even created the heavens and the earth. So here Jesus is way back before the earth was created. He was slain. And it was in God's plan to to slay his son Jesus so that we all may be saved. And here we are and we're shouting for for joy and we're we're we're rejoicing in all of this. So this salvation plan is not just for the 75 and a half years average that we are here on earth. It goes way back to the the beginning that God chose us. He tells us in the book of Ephesians that we are predestinated. He knew. &gt;&gt; Now here's the issue. So I am saying yes I actually I agree with everyone most people here that yes we are saved eternally. If the lamb was slain before the foundation of the of the world that's when I was saved. It came to pass 2,000 years ago when Jesus was here. My life was predestined to be here. It came to pass. And now I'm here and I have given my heart to the Lord Jesus. And I believe on him. And when someone truly gives their heart to the Lord, they truly become a Christian. They get saved. and they backslide. I really believe that that person always has a desire in their heart to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it ever leaves. If they truly are saved, if they truly give their heart to the Lord, no matter how bad they may be, I really believe that there is always something in there that wants to get right. And as I said at the beginning, we don't put God in a box and neither do we put each other in a box and judge them and say here is how you have to be. There is one there is one exclusive club and it's not anything other than Jesus Christ and him crucified. That is exclusive to salvation. You must believe that. So if you truly believe that and if you truly have given your heart to the Lord and then you fall away, then you're just making life hard on yourself. You are. And life is not going to be good. I have never met I've never seen someone that gave their heart to the Lord and then backslid. And I know a lot of them that have and their life got better. Never. or they had more joy in their life. Never. The enemy is so tempting. He is so the I read this morning in Isaiah and Ezekiel about how attractive he is, how beautiful he is, how much he is desired and in how he does things. And he is so tempting and it may be it could be anything. It could be, it could be wealth, it could be sex, it could be popularity, it could be just fitting in with the other kids. He is so good at what he does. And then he will always bring you down and ruin your life and make your life harder. Always. But we make that decision. We make that decision. I am going to choose to sin. And it never works out good ever. And then we have to we go all the way down this road. Say we start right here. We're doing good. And then you know what? I'm going to go all the way down this road of sin all the way to here and I got to go all the way back down that road to get back. You don't go down the road of sin and then all of a sudden your life just gets better. You have to go down the road of repentance. You have to make it right. And that is a child of God. A child of God. He's saved. I believe he is eternally saved. I believe the Lord has his hand. Jesus said that no man can I chose them. He says you didn't choose me. I chose you. &gt;&gt; And he and he says that no one can pluck you out of my hand. Never. But we make the decision to ruin our lives. Our children, loved ones make that decision to completely ruin their life. And they look like they're lost. They look like everything is bad in their lives. And they suffer. They suffer. They suffer until they come back to the Lord. And then they still suffer for what they did. They make make decisions in marriage. They might make decisions of of drugs or alcohol or whatever. and it might hurt their body and they might have to live with that for the rest of their life. But their soul is okay. We sin in the flesh and we suffer in the flesh. But when you come back to the Lord, then that soul is in good shape. That soul is fine. But we still have to suffer for what we've done because we're here in the flesh. But eternally, no. eternally. I believe that once we are saved that we are always saved, but I don't believe it just happened here on earth. I believe God chose me before the foundation of the world and I was in him before the foundation of the world. I was one of those ones that was shouting for joy. I was one of those ones that witnessed all of these things that were created in the world and the sun and the moon. And I shouted for joy. And I think that I was really shouting for joy. I mean, I I'm I love the creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I think I was really shouting for joy because I was redeemed &gt;&gt; because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and I was put in that lamb's book of life. Feel good? &gt;&gt; All right. Any anybody? So, we uh the question I believe I answered the question as far as I I know. Any other any other questions on this subject before we close? Brother Michael, where's brother Michael? You can you and the the worship team can come. Any other questions on this? Can you imagine? Think about that. Before the foundation of the world, the sons of God shouted for joy. I love the way God was saying it, saying like, \"Oh, Job, you know, oh, you oh, do you know how I did this? You're so smart.\" But then he puts in there that when all this happened, they were shouting for joy. Can you imagine just that thought that I was there? And if you're a son or a daughter of God, I believe you are there, too. And there's nothing that could pluck me out of his hand. &gt;&gt; Nothing at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron said the prodigal son when he left the house, ah, beautiful. When the when the prodical son left the house, he said, \"I want my inheritance now.\" His dad says, \"Okay.\" Gives him his money. You know what he does with his inheritance? He goes gets prostitutes, drinks it away, spends it all, live, backslides, lives terrible all the way till he's spent all of his money. Now, Satan really got a hold of him. It's like, \"Oh, you're having fun. good job. Drink and smoke and and and do all these things. Enjoy yourself. This is living. This is good. And here he is. He's enjoying it. And he think he thinks he's loving life. And then he finds himself. Wow. I don't have any money left. I don't have a job. And I'm just trying. I'm so hungry. I'm feeding these pigs. I'm so hungry that I would love to just eat this slop that I'm giving to the pigs. And then he thought, I wonder if dad would take me back. I'll live I'll live in the quarters with the servants. Oh, can you imagine? I'll live if he would just take me back, Lord. If you would just forgive me of my sins, Lord, if you would just I've gone so far, Lord. I if you would just just forgive me. And he comes, makes his decision, and he starts walking back. And you know, he's thinking about this the whole time. What's dad going to say? I have completely I'm sure mom was worried about me all this time. And I've been out and he knows what I've been doing with with the prostitutes. And he knows I've been doing the drugs and he knows I've been drinking and he knows he knows I've been doing all these things. He's He's going to throw me out. He's not going to accept me in. And then here he comes and his dad sees him coming down the road. And his dad rejoices and he says, \"Go kill the fatted calf.\" He says, \"We are going to celebrate because my prodical son has returned.\" That's us. No matter what we do, no matter how far we go, no matter how much we sin, here is our father. And his hands are out and he says this. He says, \"Come unto me all you that are burdened and heavy laden.\" And he says, \"I will give you rest.\" Beautiful story. No matter how far you go, he was still a son. He could not, no one could deny that he was still that man's son. And no one can deny that I and you are am a son or a daughter of Jesus Christ. You can't deny it. I'm there. He chose me before the foundation of the world. I love him. He's everything to me. And no matter how far I go, no matter how much I sin, he's my Lord. He's my Savior. And he'll accept me in because he said no one can pluck him pluck me from his hand. I may, as someone said, I may have made the decision to go. I think it was Jamie, maybe. I may have made the decision to go, but he was waiting there the whole time. And now I make the decision to come back. And here we are at home with Father, Brother Michael. Amazing [Music] grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace that taught my heart to fear. [Music] I do not know just why he came to love me so. He looked beyond my foe and saw my need. And I shall forever lift my eyes to Calary. To view the cross where Jesus died for me. Oh, how marvelous [Music] his grace that called my falling soul. He looked beyond my fault and saw my need. He's wonderful. And I I truly believe no Satan tells us you're lost. I have seen people take their own lives for the very reason people that I know for the very reason that they said that I am beyond forgiveness. I am beyond redemption. I've seen people actually kill themselves. Didn't see it with my own eyes, but I knew them very well. I talked to one person or he left a message on my phone the very day that he took his life. And his words were, \"I I can't come back from this.\" He just lost hope. I'll tell you, wherever Christ is, there is hope. He loves us no matter how much we do. Brother Michael, I don't think that any of us. I don't think we could ever forsake our child. But the love of God far outweighs the love of a parent. Far. He will never leave us or forsake us is what he said. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. There's nothing, friends. Brother Tony, if you would come and close, brother Michael [Music] I shall forever [Music] lift my eyes to Calary [Music] to view the cross where Jesus died for me. [Music] How marvelous his grace on my falling soul. He looked beyond my fault and saw my &gt;&gt; Let's all stand for prayer, please. Dear heavenly father, blessed are we that were able to sit at this service today and hear these words. I'm just so thankful for this congregation and and for the pastor and the the message that was preached tonight. Father, as we go and enjoy the rest of the evening, Lord, we just we just pray that your will be done in our lives and in this congregation, that we would be filled with the Holy Spirit. Amen. [Music] We just give you thanks, Lord. You are so [Music] merciful. And thank you. Thank you, Father. Amen. I think there's a time if I was saved when the lamb was slain. But there's still a time when I realized I'm saved. And I'll tell you what, that is a happy happy time when we realize our names are on that book and no one can take it away. God bless you, friends.\n"}, {"id": "2025-09-21 - The Beatitudes and the Christian Progression Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2025-09-21 - The Beatitudes and the Christian Progression: Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans - Clean.txt\n################################################################################\n\nSERMON DETAILS\n========================================\nDate:    2025-09-21\nTitle:   The Beatitudes and the Christian Progression: Daniel Evans\nSpeaker: Daniel Evans\nChurch:  Tucson Tabernacle\nType:    Full Sermon\nLanguage:English\nURL:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rf8lhGGCLs\n========================================\n\nThere is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life.

There'll be a reason for that. How many know it's already done? &gt;&gt; He said, \"It is finished.\" Yes. &gt;&gt; And it was finished. &gt;&gt; Now, it's just us to accept it and believe it. So, I'm just going to ask you something. If you know God has healed you and you've had an experience with God, that all I can say that was God, I want you to stand up and you know it was God in your life. That's pretty well all of you. If there's some of you that maybe I know some of you can't sin but have never look around and see God is more than able and it's already done. You might say, \"But I still feel this.\" Not only did he save you, he made you well. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wonder if you're saved. If I was saved, I wouldn't act like that. I wouldn't do that. No, it's already done. &gt;&gt; All he asks you is to believe it and to confess it. &gt;&gt; I am healed. I am saved. I am well. I'm one of his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all my We have a few requests here. Our brother Paul Murray has sent in a request saying, \"Brother Rome, he had gone to Ohio to for his sister's funeral. He's supposed to fly home Tuesday but is now fighting some sickness. So let's remember brother Roma and then sister Amelia says please pray for heaven myself. I've been going through um oppression and Eva has been having some anxiety attacks. The results of my bone density test show that I'm let's see I'm at risk for fractures. But Sister Amelia, it's already done. &gt;&gt; He's your healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we testify. Sister Becca Benzes. I had um surgery a couple of weeks ago. I'm still dealing with a lot of inflammation, tender tenderness. Uh having uh tooth pain is is getting me down. So please pray for the se serious infection in my foot. Amen. He suffered in every manner and way. His body was unrecognizable after he took every every sickness, every pain, every hurt. He didn't say, \"Oops, I forgot that one.\" No, he met it all. From Sister Briquest, she says, \"And she would like to be remembered in prayer. She has been having tests done and uh and had a biopsy done. She is trusting of the Lord that all is well. And that's our confession. We also had in a request turn in from brother Jordan. He says um a a prayer request for brother Peter Cam. He has serious need for healing in the body. and he says he uh received a call from Sister Barbara Surmers from Troy, Ohio, and she is a church on behalf of Brother Mike Twist, the pastor. Some of you may remember their church visiting here about 20 years ago with their choir. This brother is from their church. He now lives in Tucson for the climate for health reasons, but is going through some pretty bad something pretty bad. He said, \"Brother Mike was asking if one of us or some of us could go and pray for him, but we'll we'll start right here for him &gt;&gt; and for every heart.\" So pray with the understanding that it's already done. &gt;&gt; Not begging him to do it, not pleading him to do it, but Lord, I'm taking you at your word. That's what pleases him. Let's bow our heads. Lord, we we begin to look at ourselves sometimes and we find ourselves, I'm so unworthy. I'm so But there's nothing in the in the scriptures that says you have to be worthy of healing, of salvation. No, it's already done. But you ask us just to thank you and praise you and give testimony of what you've done, Lord. And you've already saved. You've already made well. You've already cleaned. You've already forgiven. It's already done. When you cried, \"It is finished.\" And today we accept it. We believe it. And we praise you for it, Lord. Lord. And as they take up the offering, Lord, let us be cheerful givers, Lord. And may it be to use for your honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can all have your seats. He came to me in key of B flat. This is a special song to me. Was one of my former pastor's favorite songs. Let's sing it this morning. Sing it like it was. Sing it about that event in your life that he came to me when I couldn't come to him. I couldn't I couldn't make it to God, but he came to me. Oh. Oh, he came in B flat. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me [Music] and that's why he died. on Calary. [Music] Oh, and I could not come to where he was. He came to me. Oh yes, he came to me. Are you thankful for that? He came to me. Oh, and I could not come to where he was. He came to me. Oh, and that's why he died. [Music] on Calary.

Oh, and that's why he died. [Music] on Calary [Music] when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] Amen. And anytime he comes, something good happens. And I believe he's here this morning. His brother Daniel comes and sing in the key of D. Let's sing down from his glory. We sang this song at the at the end of Wednesday night's service. The atmosphere was so good. The atmosphere is good here this morning as brother Daniel comes. Sing this song together. Verse one. down from his glory. [Music] Ever liveing story.

My breath, my sunshine, [Music] my all in all the great creator. He became my savior [Music] and all God's fullness dwell in him. Let's bow our heads. Those words of that verse are about none other than our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and all God's fullness dwelleth in him. Almighty God, we thank you. Thank you, Lord, for the blood of Christ that has wiped away our sins, oh God, that has given us life, Father, and it's given us peace on earth. And we know that we have a redeemer and we have a savior. And oh, Father, our lives just are dedicated to knowing you better. Father, we pray that your blessings would pour upon pour out upon this service this morning. Lord, I pray that each person came that is here, I pray that there is something upon their heart that they have need of and and Lord, a question that needs to be answered, healing that needs to take take place, whatever it might be. Lord, we are all a needy people and I pray, Father, that that you would meet every need this morning. Lord, we ask that humbly ask that you would join us in Jesus name. Amen. Sister Lily, if you could keep playing, let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 5. While I still have you standing and we'll read the biatitudes. Matthew 5 1-12. It's beautiful that this song is playing in the background as we read the scriptures. Matthew 5 verse one speaking of our Lord Jesus. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain. And when he was set, his disciples came unto him, and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness the sna's sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for mine for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Amen. Beautiful words. You can be seated. Thank you. Brother Josiah when he sang that song and I assume that you were talking about brother Biscll and uh as I sent out on the messages that brother Ed Biscll passed away a wonderful man and a great warrior of the faith. And all that I have known from Ed Bisll has been that that he was a gentleman. He loved the Lord and um he uh it was it was expected. Brother Eisll was well stricken in in years and it's nice that that he is now with the one that he served his whole life and there are many missing today. There's quite a few missing and um quite a few told me that they're going up to Charlie Kirk's memorial service up in Phoenix. So pray that hand of God would be upon each one upon those services up there. Uh for review, uh I I ministered last week to try to lay a foundation on this great sermon called the sermon on the mount. Jesus had there was a time of silence in his life from 12 years old to about 30 years old. And Jesus the the story picks up in the gospels and Jesus was baptized by John and he went into the wilderness to be tempted of Satan. He was led into the wilderness to be tempted of Satan. Now, now Jesus had already been through the teenage years. He'd already been through adolescence. He's already been through really what is most of the time the hardest time in a human being's walk with the Lord is that time from about 13 up until you're probably into your late teens and time that until you get married or that time is when it's it's a time of temptation. Now temptation never stops. It's it's for our whole lives. But that is when it seems like the enemy steps into someone's life and really wants to destroy them. And they can make mistakes when you're young that will be with you for the rest of your life. And this Jesus Christ, he wasn't called the Christ back then. He was he was just Jesus, the the son of um this carpenter. And he went through this adolescent years. He went through his teen years. He went through his 20s. And he never sinned. He was tempted in every manner of sin as we are, but yet he never fell to sin. And he went into the wilderness. So that was he needed to be tempted a little bit higher. So he went into the wilderness. He fasted for 40 days. He was weak. And then he met Satan himself. And in what form, we don't know. But Satan tempted him even beyond what he was tempted before. And yet Jesus overcame. Then Jesus came out of the wilderness and he started preaching. And he started preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And then his really his ministry started. And his ministry has affected all of us here. Whether you're a Christian or not, the ministry of Jesus Christ has affected you. I was talking with Sister Shirley before service and we were talking I was telling Sister Shirley that our lives our personal lives they really don't mean anything. just serving ourselves and how how successful we are in life. Whatever we heap for ourselves as far as as money or as far as a legacy or any of that, it really doesn't matter. Our lives really are meaningless. But yet what we do in our lives are so meaningful. Meaningful without measure. What we do with the lives that God has given us. I look back at Justin there. baptized him last week and and the testimony that you gave about how the Lord has been dealing with you and how you how you've just really fell in love it seems like with the word of God and Justin told me we went out to lunch after service told me he says he says brother he says I want to go back and I want to lead my family to the Lord and I thought that's a Christian that's what happens in a Christian's life is You feel you get this repentance. You get this this change in life and now you don't want to hold it to yourself. Now you want to go and give it to someone else. You want to see your loved ones. You want to see other people have the same joy that you have. And that is it's perfect of what happens to a Christian. And here is Jesus. He come out of the wilderness and he he starts preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. He starts preaching Christianity. He starts preaching how you need to give your life over to God and you need to stop serving yourself. And then he goes and he preaches this masterpiece called the sermon on the mount. The first recorded sermon we have. But so often you might hear from the pulpit, you just need to you need to give your heart to the Lord. Or you might hear from your parents or you might hear from your friends. You might say, you might hear people say, well, you need to become a Christian. You need to give your heart to the Lord. But the question that that is so often, it's like, how do I do it? Well, what do I do? And it's kind of a hard question to answer. Well, you just surrender your life to him. Well, how do I surrender my life to him? It's a good question to ask. And can you answer that? If you were witnessing to someone and trying to lead someone to the Lord and they said, \"Well, how do I do it?\" Would you know the answer to give? Jesus starts his ministry. The very first things we have recorded from Jesus Christ. He tells us how to do it. We we call them the biatitudes. The biatitudes means the blessings. Jesus starts the whole ministry, the whole thing. He starts telling us how to become a believer. Beautiful. Wonderful. He lays a foundation and it becomes it goes into as I said before the greatest sermon that has ever come out of the mouth of a human being from that time to from from the beginning of time to that time and to this time. There has never been such beautiful words come out of the mouth of a human being in my opinion as this sermon on the mount. I mean, tremendous, tremendous things, saying things that people had never heard before. And we are getting into this series and we are going to go through, we're going to read every word that he said in this masterpiece called the sermon on the mountain. And it starts with the biatitudes. He goes up. I'm sure brother Lyall has been there many times. I've been there where Jesus preached this sermon. We we think sermon on the mountain. We're live in Arizona and we have big mountains. It was more of a hill. Am I right, brother brother Lyall? It wasn't really a mountain. It was just it was a place that people could sit down and Jesus was up in a higher place. And he starts with these words and I love the way it says and he opened his mouth. Of course you open your mouth. We all open our mouth when we talk. It just it's kind of what you do. But with Jesus, I really believe he was so surrendered to God, he just opened his mouth and it just came out. Just the words of the father just flowed right through him. So let's go through what he said in this masterpiece called the sermon on the mount. It starts with the biatitudes. And as I said before, the the biatitudes really just means it means the blessings. The first several biatitudes deal with the condition of the heart. And then the second part pertains to a relationship with God. And then the final grouping is how we apply these blessings to others. Matthew chapter 5, we'll go back to what I just read. Matthew chapter 5 verse one. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain. And he was when he was set when he sat down his disciples came to him and he opened his mouth and he taught them saying remember this is the first Christian sermon that we have recorded and this is going to tell us how a Christian becomes a Christian. We're going to go through line by line and you're going to be blessed. It's beautiful. Remember in your Bibles it's in red. the words in red. Jesus is special. He gets his own color and it just happens to be blood red. And it's so when you open your Bible for for you young people and you need new people, when you open up when you open up the book, if it's in red, it's none other than Jesus Christ speaking. and he opened his mouth and he taught them saying, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" Now, here's the foundation of becoming a Christian. Here's the foundation of becoming a believer. This word poor in the original Greek, it doesn't mean that you just don't have a lot of money, that maybe you can't make your bills, you can't maybe that uh that you don't have as much as you want. This word poor in the Greek, it doesn't mean that. It means that you are destitute. It means that you are without anything. It means that you are in a tough position. And it also means it means that you are destitute in your own spirit. Blessed are the destitute in spirit. We hear so often, remember this is the progression of a Christian. We hear people say, \"Well, I'm a good person.\" No, you're not. I hate to break it to you. But you're not. People say, \"Well, you know, I have a relationship with God and and I'm I'm I'm I'm good, you know, but I have some faults.\" The the fact is that there is none of us that are good. And to to become a Christian, to become a believer, you have to realize that you're not all that. In fact, you're nothing. That's the very first part that you have to have to understand that you can't do anything in yourself. You need to realize that you need saving. I said last week I said that, you know, we hear so much about the unpardonable sin. The Bible doesn't talk about an unpardonable sin, but we hear about an unpardonable sin. And I said last week, and I really I want to double down on that, that really the unpardonable sin is someone that will not repent of their sins. and will not ask for forgiveness. How can I forgive you if you don't ask me for forgiveness? So you you some people say it's suicide, some people say it's this, some people say it's that. But if you don't want forgiveness, if you are not truly willing to humble yourself be for to God, then how can you be forgiven? As I said, you hear I'm a good person. We're not. That's the foundation. There's a whole lot. There's a bunch more that we're going to get to, but that's the foundation is you have to realize you are not. You have to realize that you are a flawed human being that needs help. 1 Corinthians chapter 6. You can't do anything in yourself. 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9. It's it's just beautiful. I'm going to read the New King James when I we'll read the Old King James with the biatitudes and the New King James when I go to the when I go to the the side scriptures. 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 says this. The Apostle Paul speaking, he says, \"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?\" \"Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkers, nor revelers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of of God. Now listen to this. Listen to this next sentence. As such were some of you, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God. You needed help. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 12. Listen to this. This even goes a little further. This is beautiful. Ephesians 2:12 says this, \"That at any that that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.\" Friends, this is the foundation. We have to realize that that is where we are at before we can become a believer. But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. So what is the condition that you must come to before you can even become a Christian? It can't be I'm a good person. You are not. And that's where legalism fails. You can't say I'm better than anyone else. It's it's you. It's not through your works. We have to understand how bad we are first. That's the first beatitude. That's the first step that Jesus is laying out here. And if there is no understanding of the need of remission of sins, then there cannot be a Christian. And Jesus is saying here, blessed are the destitute in spirit. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Verse number four, back to Matthew chapter 5. Verse number four, blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. I always thought this was like mourn for a loss. Mourn for a a lost loved one. I I always thought it was that and I would pick it out, you know, and sometimes I would read it during a funeral and and it is for that. But if you look at the context of this, that's not what the Lord Jesus is talking about. The Amplified Bible says, \"Blessed are they that mourn over their sins and repent, for they will be comforted when the burden of sin is lifted.\" So this mourning is mourning over our past. It's mourning over our mistakes. It's mourning over the things that we've done to maybe ruin our careers or ruin us financially or ruin a relationship or cause embarrassment or cause problems that that grieved God. the the mistakes that we made. We mourn over those and we we say, \"Lord, I'm sorry. Lord, I messed up. Lord, I sinned. Blessed are they that mourn on your knees. I was I was just on the on my knees in the back before I came out here mourning. Lord, I'm sorry because I did this and this and this wrong just very this this very morning. Lord, I'm sorry. I'm mourning my sins. Lord, forgive me. And that is part of this Christian progression. If you think that you're a good person to begin with, this is going to be a hard-fought battle with God for God to get to you. Verse number five, blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. What is meekness? It's humility. The New Living Translation said, \"Blessed are those who are humble.\" The Amplified version. So, we're moving now. We realize how bad we are. And it produces humility in us. It produces a change. The amplified says, \"Blessed are the gentle, the kind-hearted, the sweet spirited, the self-controlled.\" So once you realize that you have nothing in yourself and only God can fill that void, then blessed are the poor in spirit. Then you truly regret what you used to be. And friends, that's part of it. You feel bad for the sins that you've done. You feel bad for the things that you've done. That's part of being a Christian. You must go through that. Don't let it stay forever. Don't don't constantly dwell on your past sins. But there is a time to mourn. And then after you've done that, then you are humbled by these things and you realize that you're no better than anyone else. Romans chapter 12 says this, \"For I say through the through the grace given to me to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly as God has dealt to each measure and measure of faith.\" The Apostle Paul is warning us, and I'm sure Paul read this sermon. You look at all the disciples, you look at all the apostles, you look at all of the New Testament, they are regurgitating what Jesus said. So you can you can stop and you can you you you're humbled and and you're you're you're saying, \"Lord, I need a closer walk with you.\" And then you realize that the world actually isn't here to serve you. It's the other way around. You come into church and I hear people so often they say, you know, I want a church that that the people dress this way or I want a church that the the music is contemporary or I want a church that the music is traditional or I want a church that uh baptizes in this way or I want a church that the the people act in a certain way or some people say I want a big church. Other people say, \"I want a little church. I want an intimate church.\" But what what we shouldn't be say we shouldn't be saying that. What we should be doing is we should be saying, \"I want a church where I can serve. Not where everybody can serve me.\" &gt;&gt; You don't come to this church, friends. You will be served. But you don't come to church to get served. &gt;&gt; I I've said it before. People say, \"I want I want a church that I can go to be fed.\" Go to a church where you can feed others and I promise you, you'll get fed. Go to a church where you can contribute. Go to a church where you can help. Then you realize you become more meek when you're willing to serve other people because now you're constantly thinking about yourself. What you were doing, you were con constantly thinking about yourself, but now you start to think about other people. And the same thing in a relationship. When you're in a relationship and you're constantly thinking about yourself in the relationship and how your spouse or your boyfriend or your girlfriend or brother or sister, whatever it is, how your how they have done you wrong. What you need to be thinking is how I can serve this other person better. That's the best way. And it be and it does it it produces a humility. And we see these, we always see these self-help books and and many ministers, many many churches will teach, well, you need to love yourself before you can love others. That's a lie. That's false. Love others first. Hate yourself. Don't worry about yourself. Love others. Well, I need to I need to serve myself first. I need to make myself happy before I can make someone else happy. No. You know what that does? It produces depression. It produces anxiety. It produces relationship problems. It produces problems in your life. And you will be depressed for your whole life when you're serving yourself. All of us know. All of us know people who are all about themselves. And we know that they are the most depressed problem people that you'll ever meet. &gt;&gt; And it's because they're thinking about themselves. But those dear people that are always thinking about the other person, you notice how happy they are. You notice how that that they just have a spirit that you want to be around, it's because that is a Christian spirit. That is that is what it is. And and when you say everyone else here, when you truly come in and say everyone else here in this building right now, Tucson Tabernacle, Sunday morning, everyone else here is more important than I am. If you really have that way of thinking, that's meekness. It's not saying, \"Brother, I'm nothing. You know, I'm not important.\" No, no. That a lot of time, that's actually bragging. What you're trying to do is you're trying to pre you're trying to project a humility. That's that's not that's not right either. I'll tell so one of Daniel's friends got married a couple years ago and his brother was the best man and his brother was giving a speech and man the kid gave a really neat speech and and he was talking about how uh he was the one that was always taking risks and his brother that got married, you know, he was always the more mature one and and the speech was a little bit glorifying himself over his brother who was the groom and and and the uh The wedding was more about him, but the best man was basically kind of talking about himself and how oh his his brother has always been the immature one. And then he just at the end he just says, you know what, he says, I'm proud of my humbleness. We don't we're not proud of our humbleness. True humbleness, true humility is really lowering yourself to someone else and lowering yourself to below someone else. Brother Lyle and I had um had coffee the other day and he was telling me about a men's group that he used to be part of and they used to fellowship and they started coming together and they they just formed like a Bible study and it it what it did is is they got closer and as they got closer with each other it produced an accountability between these men. And as they were talking to each other and as they were fellowshipping and as they started to get each other's trust, then it led to starting to say, \"You know what? I I have a problem with this.\" And then the other brothers would help that brother. And then this one would say, \"You know what? I'm I'm struggling with this or I'm struggling with that.\" And it this humility that that fellowship produced brought these brothers down to the fact that they could confess their faults one to another as the Bible says. And then that allowed to pray one for another as the Bible says. And it produced really a close-knit group of brothers. And really, that's one of the main reasons that we are here as a church this morning. We come here, as I said, to serve other people. But there's also a meekness in our hearts that we know that there are things in our lives that need to change. So, we come to church and we want correction. Don't look at Don't We're not looking at everyone else. We want correction ourselves. And that is part of the Christian progression. Do you see this this morning? Do you see yourself when you came? It's like, Lord, I I want to I want correction. I want to repent. I want to be better. And that is this meekness. That is this humility that's it's speaking of here in the biatitudes. Verse number six, blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. So we go through this these first steps. It's admitting you're wrong. It's it's humility. It's it's mourning over your past sins. And then it produces in your life, it produces this this hunger and thirst after God. There's many places like in the Psalms, it says as the deer as the deer thirsts for the waterbrook. And then there's other places it says that that they're hungering. Well, here Jesus says it's both. It's hunger and thirst. It's double the desire to be right. And they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. You hunger and thirst after what God wants you to be rather than what you are. Jesus makes this statement a little bit later in the in the sermon on the mount, which we'll get to in the in the coming weeks. He says, \"Be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect.\" How can you be perfect? Right here, hunger and thirst after righteousness. How can we be righteous? It's saying, Jesus is saying that you hunger and thirst after a right relationship with God. You can't be perfect, but you can be perfect in resting in Christ because he was perfect. So, you're hungering and thirsting after this relationship with God. And that is that is what it's all about right there. Now, we're really getting into the meat in this. This is all producing all of the humility and all of the repentance and all this. It's really producing a relationship that is the ultimate that you want this relationship with God. So this this righteousness that's in Matthew 5 and in other play places in the Bible, it is a right relationship with God. That's everything. That's the whole purpose of it. When God created the heavens and the earth, he made it for his children. He gave it to them. He said, \"Here, this is yours.\" He wanted a relationship with his child. And then when we start to feel that pull, when we start to want to get closer to God, then we start desiring that relationship with him. David said in the psalm, it's a deep calling to the deep. It's God calling out to his children and then his children starting to call out to God, desiring that right relationship with their Lord and with their savior. Many times the devil tries to trick us. So when we come to that point, he tries to trick us into thinking that we need something more than Christ. something different. Friends, we talk about the meat in the sandwich. Paul said, \"I've fed you with milk because you weren't able to take the meat.\" When we take the meat in the sandwich, that is that relationship with Christ. That's the deepest most wonderful thing in the entire Bible. The the whole Bible is written as a as a book of relationship between God and the and the individual. And that is everything. If we just have this relationship with him. 2 Corinthians chapter 5. Listen to this. Verse 20. 2 Corinthians 5:20. Now then, we are ambass ambassadors for Christ. As though God were pleading through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf. Be reconciled to God. For he made him who knew no sin to be sin for us. that we might become the righteousness of God in him. It's not our righteousness. We hunger and thirst after righteousness, but not for our own. We hunger and thirst for that relationship with God, with Christ. That is everything. And that is this progression. So, we have this repentance. We have this feeling bad all the way now to where's this deep hunger. I want to get closer to him. Now, I know how bad of a person I am. And now I'm starting to get a little taste of how great he is. I want to just be closer to him. You've you've realized now you've given your heart to the Lord. Now you're a Christian. Now you've been baptized. Now you realize what's happened. You realize that someone else paid your debt of sin. And now you are hungering and thirsting after a right relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And then we become the righteousness of God in him. in Christ. The Bible says there are none righteous, not one. But do you understand? It's because he is righteous &gt;&gt; and we want to be part of him. Now listen to this verse number seven. Now we are moving past we've given our hearts to the Lord. We've made this commitment. Now we have this burning desire by the way that never leaves this hungering and thirst thirsting after righteousness. People are always saying, \"Oh, well, it's when I receive the Holy Spirit and and they look for the Holy Spirit.\" When you receive the Holy Spirit, it becomes stronger. When you finally receive that that spirit of Christ living in you, then it's just even I mean that pull that thirst and that hunger is far more because you got a little taste of it. And man, it's like eating your favorite food. You don't want just a sliver. You've tasted it. Say, \"Man, that was good. I want some more. I want more.\" And I want more. And with with Jesus, you don't get filled up. Just more and more. Blessed are the merciful. Verse number seven, Matthew 5. For they shall obtain mercy. So, we understand we're sinners. We understand that we have received mercy. Now, God's mercy, we we want that for ourselves. We've understood we're sinners and now we give that mercy to other people. When we truly understand that mercy is deserving a penalty but not receiving that penalty, it's reserving punishment but not receiving that punishment. And we truly understand that we have received mercy. Now we treat others as the Lord has treat treated us. Blessed are the merciful, for you shall receive mercy. Let me give you an example. This happened to me a couple days ago. I was coming home and I saw on uh on Apple Maps that I 10 was really crowded and uh so instead of going over the freeway and shooting north, I um decided to I I went down to Oracle. So, I took a left on Miracle Mile and I was going to take um the road that turns into uh Lockinata. I was going to take that all the way up by my house. So, I'm driving along and I got to take a right and I see and there's a stop light and I was like, \"Okay, I'll turn right right here.\" I flip on my blinker and I'm I'm uh I I start to slow down and there was this vehicle behind me and it was like a like a 75 Omobile. really cool looking car. So, I was kind of keeping an eye on it and I was like, \"Yeah.\" You know, and I was looking in the mirror and it was just really a cherry car. And so, I'm I'm going along and and I flip on my blinker and I'm going to turn right and I look and I was like, \"Oh, this isn't where I need to turn.\" So, I flip off my blinker and I just keep going. Well, it made the guy in the Omobile mad. So, he's behind me and he's he's gonna turn right and we're cruising along. It probably cost him maybe a second and a half maybe. But the fact is I was I would made a mistake. I was I had my blinker on and then I changed my mind. So he's behind me, gets up behind me and he turns right and as he's turning he honks. I was like whatever, man. You know, I want to give you that last little insult because you made a mistake and you made me mad because you were so low as to make this mistake, have your blinker on and slow down in front of me. If I would have turned, everything would have been fine. But I changed my mind. I turned the blinker off and I headed forward. I made a simple mistake. And as he was turning, Honk, I'm gonna get in this last little word. Come on, man. Cut me some slack. Give me some mercy. I made a mistake. It's okay. And that's how we should be with others. It's a mistake. It's all right. If it costs you a little bit, if it puts you out a little bit, be merciful. This is everyday stuff. We should be merciful in everyday stuff because if we are not merciful, the Bible says that we will not obtain mercy and it's in everything. We can't just be a Christian in church. It's it's everywhere we are. And that guy with his horn, I'm going to get this this little this little bit in. Don't we don't do that. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Now we see in our progression now we are Christians. There's no malice. There's no hatred. There's no impatience. They know this Christian knows how bad he is. He knows what Jesus has done for him. They make plenty of mistakes and there and there's plenty of mistakes in all of us. But we repent for our mistakes and you're pure in heart. So you can go before the Lord after you sin and you will. And you can go before the Lord and you say, \"Lord, I'm sorry, Lord. You know my heart. I sinned. I knew better. I did it. But you know, Lord, ultimately I want to serve you and I'm going to put you first.\" Then being pure in heart leads to this next verse. Blessed are the peacemakers. For they shall be called the children of God. This is where our faith is displayed. The guy honking at me. It's not a big deal, you know. It's it's it's just criticism. It's like, okay, if somebody honks at you, don't honk back. Just keep going. If somebody makes a mistake, just let it go and bring peace. Wherever you go, let peace follow you. When someone starts saying something negative, don't go into it. Don't correct them and lift yourself up, but just do your best to sway the conversation to something positive and be that peacemaker. When someone puts you down, don't fight with them. Don't get defensive. Pay a compliment to that person maybe who's putting you down and share your testimony. You know, the world needs us. Really, we were put in this world, as I said, to serve other people. Tell the world what Jesus has done for you and use these biatitudes. We'll we'll read them entirely here in a minute, but use these biatitudes in your witnessing. And then what's going to happen? It'll be a great blessing to you, but to those that you are witnessing to, imagine it could mean eternal life to that person if you are representing God in a in the right way. Blessed are they. And then once you've come to that point, the opposition arises when you stand for Christ. Now listen to this. You become a Christian. You've given your heart to the Lord. You realize how bad you are. You you've repented. You've started doing right. The the Lord is using you. And you're standing up for Jesus Christ. And this is all about Jesus. Everything's about Jesus. The whole Bible is about one man. It's about Jesus. And you start witnessing about him. You start standing for him in everything that you do. And many times you have to stand against the society that you are in. It might be a church society, may be a Catholic society, it may be a political society, it may be an ungodly society, it may be a work society. Whatever it is, you start standing for Christ and you start being that peacemaker and you start loving the Lord and you start you start witnessing to others and you start telling others about your testimony. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. If you truly stand, if you truly stand for Christ, you will be persecuted. Not if you bring it on yourself, not if you are unwise in your words, but if you truly stand, you will be hated. Look at Charlie Kirk. People are protesting vigils in his honor. Do you see the man? They're going out there that this man goes through and he kicks over the candles and tears down the stuff that that they had that they had that they were worshiping with the people and paying paying respects to this man, Charlie Kirk. And this hatred came out in the people. They start cussing and yelling and and kicking over the stuff and desecrating this man's not because they hate the people that are doing it, but they And not even because they hate Charlie Kirk. They hate what he stood for. &gt;&gt; They hate Jesus. They hate right things. &gt;&gt; And G and he says right here that you will suffer. If you truly stand for me, you will suffer. Abortion protesters, people protesting abortion are hated. cussed out on the streets. And these crazies that are that do that to them, they don't hate the person, they hate that person's ideals. They don't even know why they're doing it. It's just this anger that comes up. You know, you hear people call the president of the United States a fascist, calling him a racist, calling him these things, calling Charlie Kirk a fascist, calling Charlie Kirk a racist, calling Charlie Charlie Kirk a homophobe. They don't know Char, they don't know them. They hate what they stand for. &gt;&gt; You know, ultimately, they hate God. And Jesus is saying here, they hate me. And you will suffer for that because those are your ideals. That's what you stand for. It's not you. It's me that they hate. And why the hatred? They really hate this Christian living. They hate it. John chapter 15. There's never been a man more hated in all the history of the world. Never than Jesus Christ. He is the most hated person that has ever lived. And he is the only person that's ever lived that really mattered. And because he mattered, I mattered to him. &gt;&gt; He put me above everything. He took the lowest to help me. First uh John chapter 15 verse 18, listen to what Jesus says. He says, \"If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet, because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, a servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.\" But all these things they will do to you for my name's sake because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin. But now they have no excuse for their the for their sin. He who hates me hates my father also. You have to go through Jesus Christ. Friends, you cannot get around Jesus and go to God. If you do not accept Jesus, then you cannot accept God. If you hate what Jesus is Jesus stands for, guess what? You hate the creator. If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no they would have no sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my father. But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law. They hated me without a cause. I've heard many stories from many of you that were with people. They got the notice that Charlie Kirk was murdered and they rejoiced. Yes, Charlie Kirk just got killed. They didn't know him, but they hate the God he stands for. They hate the humility. They hate the the the the purity of God and they will rejoice. They rejoice at Jesus's death. Also, John chapter 16 verse two, they will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God a service. Wow. Rejoicing. I saw this video somebody sent me of of um I think it was a nurse and she was talking to her daughters and my one of my favorite people in the whole world Taylor Swift was got engaged and and she was telling her daughter she says she says the best thing happened one of mommy's favorite things that has that could happen happened and the girl said Donald Trump got killed little girl. And that's what they're teaching their children. Someone would be murdered. Rejoice right here that whoever kills you will think that he offers God a service. I I feel the the danger that these people face. they faced that co-workers and as I said many of you have told me the same thing same testimony that people rejoiced at the murder of this man and just because maybe a man's against or a woman's against murdering unborn babies they hate them or just because they're they don't agree with using pronouns that don't match the gender, that hate. We've seen that. I've seen it. That hate comes out or that they're they're using they rather than he or she. And if you don't conform to it, that hatred comes out. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's they want to kill you. They want you to die. And I'm sure all of you have seen them on YouTube and their ridiculousness. They celebrate the murder of someone says it's unnatural and the Bible speaks against a man to have a relationship with another man or woman with a woman. So they re rejoice over his murder. Verse number 21. But but all these things they will do to you for my name's sake because they do not know him that sent me. these biatitudes, friends, it starts with just this foundation. Here's where you start. Read it again. Read it in your own time. Here's where you start. You start with with you realize that you're not all that. And then it progresses all the way to people will hate you because you live a life that is consecrated and dedicated to this one man, Jesus Christ. And that is the progression. And I don't know where any of us are. All of us are at different stages of this, but it is Jesus lays it out here perfectly. Here's the way that you become a believer. Now, in closing, the um the musicians can come. Let me read I want to read the ten commandments uh really quickly, and I want you to see what most of these commandments have in common. Thou shalt have thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make for yourself a carved image. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Honor your father and your mother. Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbor. Thou shalt not covet. Thou shalt not Thou shalt not. Thou shalt not. Okay. Now, watch the difference in spirit when Jesus Christ comes into your life. Watch the difference in spirit from the Old Testament to the New Testament. No, no, no, no, no. Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules. Thou shalt not. Thou shalt not. Thou shalt not. Now watch these biatitudes again. And he opened his mouth and he taught them. Verse number two, chapter 5, verse two, Matthew. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. When you're convicted of your sins and you realize that you're hopeless, in a hopeless condition without God, then you realize you have a promise in the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; You have a place in the kingdom of heaven in joy. And the joy replaces that original poor in spirit. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted. Look at the hope that is in Jesus Christ. Before there wasn't hope. There was no hope in the world. But when Jesus came, it's not thou shalt not anymore. Look at how it becomes positive. Thou shalt. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall look at be filled. Look at all the promises. Look at all the promises that are with Jesus Christ. There the promises weren't there before. But when this man stepped stepped on the scene, it's like, \"Whatever you've done, what whatever sin you committed, I'll take it on myself, and you shall have peace. You shall have love.\" Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. And my computer locked up, so we'll just keep going the oldfashioned way. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my my name's sake, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven. for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Oh, it's so positive. It's so good. And it's like stand for me. You know, I don't know if back to Charlie Kirk, what a what a man. And look at what has resulted from him. It was love. It was praise. his his widow stood there and she was just doing nothing but talking about Jesus and and thanking the Lord for his his life and saying we are going to carry on. I think about brother Biscll and and all that in in all of his years and his long life blessed are you brother Ed blessed are all the things that you've done and now enter into the kingdom. Friends, I want to be among those. I want to be among those who follow these words of Jesus. I want to be the peacemaker. I want to be the merciful. I want to be I want to be Lord. I want to have this right relationship with you. It's everything to me, Lord. I just want to have that relationship with you. Please, Lord, that's everything. If I fail in everything that I do, if if I just mess everything up, but Lord, just let me have that relationship, that right relationship. Lord, I am blessed just to hunger and thirst after that righteousness. I am blessed to want it. I'm just Lord, it's everything to me. And then there's no more thou thou shalt not. Now it's and thou shalt be filled. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. We're blessed just to hunger and thirst after it. But we also have a promise that we shall be filled. Amen. Blessed are the merciful. Don't give the honk. Just be merciful. Just be loving. Be loving one to another. Was telling Josiah was reading to me a scripture. He didn't tell me where it was from. And I said there's only one person that could write such words and that was that was John. John was all about love. He was all about being merciful. He was all about getting along with each other. The beloved disciple, the most important thing to him was love one another. Don't fight. And then Jesus said, \"And by your love for one another, the whole world will know that I am the Messiah because of the example that you set.\" friends, the example that we need to set in this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. God, [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to interject for a minute. Do you know what the opposite of fear is? It's not it's not courage. The opposite of fear is love. The Bible very plainly says that love casts out fear. So as you're singing this song, as our brother is singing the song, think about that. Think about the love of Jesus Christ and how we do not have to fear anymore because he went to the cross. You know who he went to the cross for? He went to the cross for the person sitting in your chair right now. It's an individual thing. I think Lord, you went you did that for me. If I was the only one that ever accepted Jesus Christ as my savior, he would have gone to the cross for me. I believe that that was this man's testimony that wrote that song. He said, \"If it would have just been me, he would have done it.\" You unravel me with a meloy and you surround me with a song of deliverance from my eneies till all my Fears are gone and I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child of God. From my mother's womb, from my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Your love has called my name. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I've been born again into your family. Oh, your blood flows through my veins and I'm no longer a slave to peace. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. [Music] I'm no longer a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child. Sing that again. I'm no longer &gt;&gt; and I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; I think we canled on the one baptism. Is there anyone that wants to be baptized this morning? I always want to make it open friends on these biatitudes and on this sermon on the mount in this progression as a believer when I was talking about how they hate I mean the Bible says it's it's above my pay grade this is what the Bible says that they will hate you for what you believe they will hate you for the ideals. They will hate you for standing up against them. It's in the word. Now, we don't do it half-hazardly. And we don't disrespect the person that hates us. A real Christian would go to the cross for that person that hated them. That's a Christian. You don't get into an argument just to get into an argument. You don't put somebody down because they have different ideals. Then you're falling into the same trap as they are. What you do is you say, \"Lord, have mercy on that person.\" Let me quote someone. Father, forgive them for what they do. Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do. Jesus hanging on the cross for the people that hated him so much so that they murdered him. And I thank God that we still have martyrs in the world today that God has given gifts and they can take those gifts and they can make us stand and say, \"No, I don't care which direction the world's going. I don't care what politics says. The Bible says differently.\" And I will stand on what the Bible says, no matter if it cost me my life. It might cost me my career. It might cost me my position. It might cost me my position as a pastor, but I stand upon this word. &gt;&gt; I stand upon what it says. And no, I don't want to water it down and say it's okay just because of the time that we live in. No, no, no. If it's written in here, it's true. &gt;&gt; And my opinions and your opinions don't matter. &gt;&gt; What matters is in this book. Let's all stand one more time on that song. You know that song is beautiful. Love casts out fear. And it was the love for me that God gave his life. God sent his son to go to the cross. And he willingly gave his life. And even more of a miracle that he willingly gave his life. He lived a sinless life. He lived a life with all the temptations of the world and never fell to one of them. Ah, it just makes me want to lift him up and say, &gt;&gt; \"He's my champion. The one that died on that cross is my champion. He's the one that I point to and people will hate you. They killed this man. They're celebrating his funeral today. They killed him not because they knew him or they hated him. They hated what he stood for. Jesus said it's a prophecy fulfilled. Jesus said it'll happen. There's many martyrs through the ages. And he was a martyr Messiah. Yeah. One more time. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. [Music] Oh, I am a child of God. Let's sing. You split the sea. &gt;&gt; You split the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears are drowned in perfect love. You rescued me so I could stand and say I am a child. Let's sing that again. You split the sea. &gt;&gt; You split the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears are drowned in perfect love. You rescued me so I can stand and say I am a child of God. I'm no longer and I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child of God and I'm no longer a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many here want that right relationship with God? &gt;&gt; I raise my hand. Lord, if I could have anything in the world, anything in the world, Lord, I want that relationship. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Lord, I believe it pleased you. feel, Father, that you were pleased when you saw those hands go up, Lord. We appreciate your healing. We appreciate, Lord, you providing for us. We appreciate you putting food on the table. We appreciate, Father, you you giving us an income. We we appreciate, Lord, our our families. And we appreciate all of these things. But Lord, if you would just give us one thing, it would be to have that relationship with you, oh God. dear God, that we could we could speak with you, our our savior, oh God, and that you would give us the correction that we so desire. And and Father, that your hand would just be upon us. Lord, I pray to you in the name of Jesus Christ that you give us that right relationship, that you give us that righteousness as Jesus spoke of. For we hunger, Lord, after it, Father, go with us today. May we draw closer. I pray that as we leave this building, we would leave better people closer to you. I love you, Lord. Thank you, Father. I pray that your blessings would rest upon Cloverdale Church. [Music] Lord, I I know he hasn't been ministering for a long time, but he's still a loss. Pray that your hand would be upon each one of them and each one of those that mourn the death of this martyr, Charlie Kirk. We pray for each one of those. And Father, as they that the safety, this hand of God would be upon all those that are up there now in Phoenix and celebrating his life. And Lord, that your hand of safety and protection would be upon each one of them, Lord, from the the harm of the enemy that would want to hurt them, Lord, on the roads, wherever they may be. May your hand be upon each one and be upon us, Lord, and this congregation. Bless us father. Bless us with a closer walk with you. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Tonight friends we have and have our testimony service. So come ready to give the Lord glory with um something that's happened in your life over the past month or so since last time we had these testimony. And I was telling brother Josiah, I said, if nobody has a testimony, I I I could take the whole service with what he's done in my life just in the past month and what I've seen. So please, please come and let's let's give him a little bit of glory in thanksgiving &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we'll get we'll get closer to him and giving him glory.

rich like [Music] me and I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see let's bow our heads our heavenly father once again we thank you that we can open up this Bible and learn more about your word and therefore learn more about you Lord pray that wisdom would be here with us tonight as we open up This Book of Joel and father that if there' be a need in the church this evening or any of those that are streaming in father that you would meet that me most of all Lord we want your will not our will or the will of the world but your will Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated God bless you all it's good to see everyone out in the house of the Lord tonight Book of Joel is a um it's it's a really it's a great book it's an amazing book it's there's a lot of unknowns about Joel We don't know really we don't know When It Was Written because he doesn't name a king and we don't necessarily know if he was prophesying to the northern um tribe of uh of Israel the 10 tribes of Israel in the North or if he was uh prophesying to the southern tribes of Judah we don't we don't know the the um historic context of this but the Book of Joel is written to it doesn't really matter it does matter in in other books but the Book of Joel is a standalone book and it's um it's a book that's has a pretty amazing way that that we go through it and it's a book that has real life events that are happening and Joel and the Lord are taking these real life events that are happening and then they are used in a prophetic way saying that these times are coming into the future and so he's taking a a plague of locusts that comes through and just decimates the entire the entire land and he's saying that this is going to happen again in the future and he he uses it maybe as a as metaphorically speaking it happened actually and metaphorically speaking and prophetically speaking so as we dig into it in this book you'll see that the things that are happening right now in this book are a foreshadowing of things that are going to happen and then things that we are yet looking to see now the theme of The Book of Joel is the day of the Lord and you'll see that Joel mentions this multiple times through through the book and it's mentioned more actually by the prophet Joel than it is mentioned by any other prophet in the Bible so that's that's really the theme of The Book of Joel and what's what's going on is there's this as I said a plague of locust you know what a locust is it's like a grasshopper and in Northern Africa some they get big their uh their wingspan is is fairly big and they will um they could go for this this swarm of locust can go for tens of miles long and hund over a 100 feet tall so when this plague of locust comes over it will it'll block out the Sun and get dark and I'm I assume it's really a creepy thing when when they fly over and it's just absolutely devastating so we're going to be talking about this plague of locust that comes through and then Joel is going to be explaining the significance of this in the future so let's dig right into it let's dig into the The Book of Joel Joel chapter one and what we'll do is we'll read word by word at least for the first chapter maybe for the second chapter also and we'll see how time is going and then um we'll get through there's it's only three chapters we'll get through the third chapter and then I'd like to read um some things that brother brand said um about this Book of Joel at the end the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pul so now we know who wrote the Book of Joel and uh Joel is considered one of the minor prophets in the bible a minor prophet in the Bible just means that his book is shorter doesn't mean that he's any less than Isaiah or Jeremiah or Moses it just means that less is written from that Prophet so that's when we say a minor Prophet it's not in any way saying that this Prophet is less it's just saying that there's less that the prophet wrote In the book but this these prophecies that come from Joel are powerful amazing prophecies so in these three chapters is squeezed all kinds of great things hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children tell another generation this right here is a tremendous verse and I love the way Joel just puts this right up in the front to tell your children and then your children will tell their children it's it's kind of like Joshua how Joshua told the stories that that happened with all the plagues that came on Israel and coming across the Jordan and he said now you tell your children and then you bring them back to some of these these things that we have set up and when they ask like this pile of stones where did this pile of stones come from what is this pile of stones then you can tell them how the children of Israel walked over walked through the the walked over the Jordan River on dry land and this what the what this Prophet Joel is saying here he's he's saying tell your children of what's going on right now and basically tell them what I'm saying and you know if you come especially on Wednesday nights and Sunday nights I'll give a lot of testimonies from my family about brother Brandon and about all the amazing things that happened in his ministry and really this is what I am doing is telling the people that these things actually happened I wasn't there but my parents told me and my parents were there and my parents saw these things but they did exactly what this Prophet Joel is saying tell your children about these things that happened they really did happen and then I tell my children and I tell you all and encourage you you tell your children that these things that many of my parents my grandparents and many of all of our parents and grandparents witnessed they happened and they were real and you can go back to those and you can draw strength from those knowing that God manifested himself in a mighty way back then and we can apply that to our own lives and Joel's here he's saying listen tell your children about these things that are happening that you're witnessing these great calamities and then have them tell their children then he says this that which the Palmer worm hath left the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left the caterpillar eaten so we have this plague of Lo locust come through and he's describing it and he uses these words let me read another translation keep that one up there and it says this listen to this this is the English Standard Version what the cutting Locust left the swarming Locust has eaten what the swarming Locust left the hopping Locust has eaten and what the hopping Locust left the destroying Locust has eaten all of these the cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the Locust they are all the same bug they're the same grasshopper they are just at different levels of their maturity so when he's saying this he's saying that all of these things have come through they have have have grown up and each one of them does its own type of damage but it's the same little animal that's doing it a wakey drunkards now he's going to he's going to say now you've seen this this plague of locust come through you need to repent because God is in this and we know that from the prophets and we're starting into brother Lyall went into Hosea last week and you'll see a theme actually we've seen it through the whole Bible the prophet the people will sin the prophet will bring correction and then God's mercy will be manifested it's almost in every book and this one's no different awake ye drunkard and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of the lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion so the locusts come in but now it looks like a foreign Nation so we we see the plague of the Locust and now it looks like these locusts now represent a foreign Nation invading Israel now this could be as I said we don't know we can't really Place This Book of Joel in historic context we don't know exactly when it was this could be this Assyrian evasion Invasion that uh they took the C the captives in the northern part of Israel possibly it could be the Babylonian Invasion that we've gone through with the Book of Daniel and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and it could be another Invasion we don't know but it's showing here that this is an invasion coming from another country also and we'll see that it's proven a little bit later he hath laid my Vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean clean bear and cast it away the branches thereof are made white so we know first of all we know that this fig tree usually when a fig tree is mentioned in a symbolic way it represents the country of Israel so we we know that this this plague of locust that's coming on and as I said it could be hundreds of feet high and it could be tens of miles long and they come in so thick that they can black out the Sun and they just they eat everything and the the plagues that that he's describing happened it's happening against Israel now for their sins but do you remember it happened happened against Egypt years and years ago with one of the plagues I believe it's the E eth plague that came from God to on the Egyptians when Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he wouldn't allow the Hebrews to go and worship so God brought down these 10 plagues and brought pharaoh to his knees one of those plagues was locusts and now these this same plague is coming coming upon Israel for their Disobedience and he says this lament Like a Virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord the priests the Lord's ministers mourn so we look and he's telling the ministers he your pastors and your ministers you repent and you pray the field is wasted and the land mourneth for the corn is wasted and the new wine is dried up the oil Land languishes languisheth so this is what happened when this plague of locust come through they they eat up everything so now there's no food let's say they eat up the wheat and and the the wheat's ready to harvest they they come through they they eat up all the the food they eat even the bark off the trees it says they eat the fruit off the trees they eat the grain everything is destroyed when this plague of locust come through so then what follows this a famine because there's no food to eat and if the rain and if there isn't rain late in the season then they're also going to probably be suffering the next year because their trees are destroyed so they want this rain to come and they don't have any food now so they're not going to have any food until they can regrow some crops and it's probably going to be a year so things are going to be really really hard starvation and these plagues of locust it doesn't just take the food right now it makes it to where you don't have any food for until the next Harvest so very very devastating thing this plague of locust I was um when I was in Jeffersonville we were working with u a group in Loi there was a typhoon that came through and just destroyed the country flooded the country flooded their crops so we had all of this runoff and all the corn and stuff that was planted it all got washed down so now they had nothing and they didn't have the hope of having anything because it wasn't time to plant the crops and they wouldn't grow until they planted them the next spring so that's when we were able to bring in food that they could eat to get them through until they could plant the crops and and get something the next year but a plague like this the plague of locust is like this this typhoon that came through it just destroys and that's kind of the key word it's a destroying thing be ashamed oh ye husband and how oh ye Vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the Harvest of the field is perished so everything's gone all their food is gone the vine is dried up the Fig Tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because the joy is withered away from the sons of men I'm going to read some quotes at the end of service if we have time that will be um very applicable to that scripture good G yourself and lament ye priests howl ye Ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth you Ministers of my God for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholdeth withholden from then from the house of your God sanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord so the prophet is crying out to the ministry and to the population of people to repent repent and to make a holy fast to gather the people together and cry unto the Lord because this is your only hope you don't have any food you need a miracle you need the Lord to come down and protect you like what we're praying for for this um for this state of of Florida right now and this hurricane that's bearing down only God can protect it and only God can allow it to be to to just destroy it's up to him man man does not have that power and here he is he's saying that the only thing that you have is you cry out to God and repent because he can alas for the day for the day of the Lord is at hand and as destruction from the almighty shall it come as I said the day of the Lord that's the theme of This Book of Joel It's mentioned multiple times and the the day of the Lord is something that it can be something that's great or it can be something that's terrifying and horrible and really it depends on which side you're on the day of the Lord came from no for Noah he had built this Ark it started to rain the water came up out of the ground that was a day that was the day of the Lord that came for Noah no Noah was saved and it was a wonderful day for Noah because he was safe and he saw the power of God and all the evil that surrounded him was destroyed but it was a horrible day for those Sinners that weren't on God's side it's the same thing with Moses the day of the Lord came from Moses came from Egypt and it comes and and here is here comes all the plagues and it was terrible for Pharaoh but it was wonderful for the Hebrews and they saw the power of God they saw hail come down like fire they saw the the Locust they saw Darkness they saw all of these great things and God protected them but he destroyed those that didn't serve God so we see the day of the Lord It's a wonderful thing and it is a terrible thing and it really depends on which side that you're on Jesus or Paul said in first Thessalonians he prophesied that the day of the Lord would come as a thief of in the night we look forward to that day we're praying Lord come Lord come quickly we want to see you we want to we want you to come and redeem this world and then there's others that if the Lord comes they would be cast out into Everlasting Darkness into the Lake of Fire it's a horrible thing there and it's a wonderful thing here is not the meat cut off before our eyes the food yay joy and gladness from the house of our God the seed is rotten under their clouds and the Garner lay desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered how do the beasts Gran the herds of cattle are per perplexed because they have no pasture ye the flocks of sheep are made desolate so not only are the people suffering and we think about us it's like oh the the Locust came in and ate my fig tree or they ate my crops but don't forget if you're a Rancher you don't have food you don't have grass to feed your cattle or to feed your sheep so you're so these sheep and these cattle they're going to die too because these locusts came in this famine is coming down because all the food is gone and it has a residual effect all the way through oh Lord to thee will I cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the Wilderness and the flame ha burned all the trees of the field the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of water are dried up and the fire ha devoured the pastures of the Wilderness chapter 2 blow ye the trumpet in Zion and S sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is nigh at hand and you can see it was a it was a dire need the day of the Lord was there for them remember it's twofold he's saying that this is what's happening right now and he's going to say that it's also going to happen in the future and it's going to be way worse than staring to death because of a famine a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and a thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and strong there ha there hath not been ever ever the like neither shall anym after it even to the years of many generations so he's he's foreshadowing yeah you're seeing this but there is something big that's coming let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 and here the Lord Jesus actually refers back to Joel Same Spirit as the Lord Jesus is prophesying Matthew 24 let's start with verse three now we know that this is the Tribulation time this is a hard time that the Lord Jesus is prophesying that's coming it's the six seals that are in this Matthew 24 it's the tribulation it's the plagues there's all kinds of Calamity that's happening here and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives speaking of the Lord Jesus the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto him take heed that no man deceive you a Commandment that is constantly told be careful don't be deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ many shall come in my name what is that I come in the name of Jesus Christ is what they would say it's easy to say that but are you really sent from God he's saying that these false prophets will come take heed that no man de deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows this is just the beginning of it then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you should be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another one of the signs of the end is this great Discord especially among the religious churches especially among the religious people there's this bickering and this fighting and it's a sign right here Jesus says it's coming and many false prophets shall arise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved trust in the Lord endure keep your testimony keep trusting in God and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come skip to verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and all the powers and the powers of of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory it's like in the Book of Joel there was a time of tribulation but there's always hope God always gives you a way out he always gives you hope and he will always make a way for those that truly love him and those that put him first and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn a parable of the Fig Tree we know what the Fig Tree is as I said before when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh then the last verse 44 says this therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh now with that Prophecy from the Lord Jesus that Spirit let's go back to Joel chapter 2 verse three a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth and the land is as a Garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape them the appearance of them is the as the appearance of horses now he's talking about these locusts the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and of Horsemen and they shall run let's turn to Revelation chapter n again this is one of those things where this is an application to the Future Revelation verse chapter 9 ver verse one and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven under the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of a pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the Earth and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power and it was commanded to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the Seal of God in their foreheads that seal of God is nothing short of the Holy Spirit and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them and the shapes of the Locust were like under horses prepared under battle remember I just read in Joel and the shapes of the Locust were like un horses prepared under battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men and their hair as the hair of women and their teeth as the teeth of lions and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as a sound of Chariots of many horses running to battle and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the Greek tongue hath his name apalon one woe is passed and behold there come two woes more Hereafter very similar to what we're reading right now in the Book of Joel back to Joel chapter 2 verse 5 like the noise of Chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pained all their faces Shall Gather Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb a wall like the men of war and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one thrust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro in the city and they shall run upon the wall and they shall climb up upon the houses and they shall enter in at the Windows like a thief the Earth shall Quake before them and the heavens shall tremble and the sun and the moon shall be dark and the Stars shall withdraw their shining remember back to what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 24 Matthew 24 and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his Camp is very great for he is strong that executed the word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it so now God's sending in his power to counter this other power that's coming another translation in verse 11 says this the Lord utters his voice before his army for his Camp is exceedingly great he who executes his word is powerful for the day of the Lord is great and very awesome and who can endure it therefore now therefore also now sayeth the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning a common theme as I've said before turn to the Lord repent and Rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful and slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil so he's saying don't take the traditional thing of tearing open your garment he's telling them to tear open your heart instead don't just go through the motions don't just make it look like here I'm repenting really repent get down on your knees and cry out to God and then a promise right here as always God will forgive you God will take care of it who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the other Elders gather the children and those that suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet so Joel is saying bring everybody bring the babies you just got married skip the honeymoon come down everybody come everybody come in let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the Altar and let them say spare thy people oh Lord and give not thine Heritage to rep to reproach that the Heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God then will the Lord be jealous for his land and pity his people yay the Lord will answer and say unto his people and remember here we go we're going to start getting into the prophetic yay the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make you or reproach among the Heathen so he saying humble yourself whether there's famine that was on Israel at this time or in a future time humble yourself before the Lord and I'll take care of it with me all things are possible but I will remove far off from you the northern Army and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face towards the E East and his hinder part towards the utmost sea and his stink shall come up come up and his ill saver shall come up because he hath done great things fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid believe Stephanie I were talking the other night I believe that's the most common commandment in the Bible don't fear not don't be afraid be Not Afraid ye Beasts of the field for the pasture of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine yield their strength be glad you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord for for you for your God rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately for he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain prophet of Joel is referring to that when you sew the seed so when you have a field and a husbandman by the way is the King James version of the a farmer the one that that owns that takes care of the field so when this farmer goes and he SWS the seeds you need rain you need some sort of moisture to fall on that that's the former rain that's the first rain that you need and then that that seed is germinated in the ground it takes root and then your crop starts to grow and then it grows through the summer and then towards the fall at the end of the of the Harvest when the Harvest is coming you need another rain to really ripen that fruit and to make sure you get the best fruit before you you pick it you need some rain in there that's the latter rain so you have the rain that falls first and then you have the latter rain that really ripens that fruit James 5:7 says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman the husbandman remember that's the farmer the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receives the early and the latter rain so be also be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh so we plant the seed the Lord sends the rain to germinate that seed and then he sends the rain to ripen the Harvest the former and the latter rain and the floors back to Book of Joel verse number 24 and the the floors shall be full of Wheat and the Vats shall overflow with wine and oil so this is a time of prosperity and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you so again back to that same Locust at different stages and God is saying that he's going to restore what was lost during that time and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed my people shall never be put to shame and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed now a prophecy that we are all very familiar with and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit one of the greatest days in history is what this is prophesying and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth and blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that who whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant of whom and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call now let's fast forward about who knows it could be 400 years it could be 800 years but let's fast forward from that time to Acts chapter 2 we saw in the book of Acts that the Lord Jesus had promised that if I go away then the comforter will return so here they are they're in this Upper Room 120 people in this upper room and they knew this promise Jesus said just to wait there until you are endued with power from up on high and here they are and then here comes the Holy Spirit into the building like sounds like a rushing Mighty Wind there was tongues of fire on each of them they go out they're filled with the Holy Ghost they go out they start prophesying they start speaking in other tongues they start doing Miracles this great thing happened and then other people see it they're like we want that and that's how we should be as Christians friends let me tell you wherever we go whatever we do if the people that that you work with if the people that you see if the people are not uh taking you in in high regard and saying I want what that person has then we are doing something wrong and let me tell you the most important thing is that love 1 Corinthians chapter 13 when we lose that love then we lose the admiration of the world here in the book of Acts chapter 2 they wanted their hearts were cut and they said what do we need to do but Peter lifting up but Peter standing up and they and some were making fun of them they're saying oh they're drunk you know it's the the third hour of the day or whatever it was and they're they're already drinking and they're drunk and they're stumbling around they're doing all this strange strange stuff and Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you mean of Jud you Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day what is that brother L is that 9:00 in the morning thing this seeing this is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel Peter knew the scriptures he had read this book that we're reading tonight and he says that's it this is the Fulfillment of that scripture and it and then now Peter goes back and he quotes this Prophet it shall come to pass in the last days saith God that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dream dreams and on my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy it had just happened that is so awesome to me that this prophecy was sitting in the book for hundreds of years just there how many priests how many rabbis read that and had no idea what it means and that's brothers and sisters we have we have to be careful in doing that we can hear a prophecy but really we don't know what any prophecy is until it happens the interpretation of a prophecy is the Fulfillment of the prophecy and that is what happened right here with Peter he remembered these words of Joel and he says this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel where was I Verse 18 and on my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy so it is a just that Holy Spirit had just come they go out and they're stumbling around and they're speaking in these strange tongues and it's it's it's um recognizable to the different ones that are there and they're like wow they're speaking my language and there there there's these great things going on and Peter's like yeah this is that and he comes and he's preaching this sermon and I will show wonders in heaven and signs on in the Earth beneath in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord CA come I wonder I wonder if he had his Bible if he had his scroll or if it just came to him if he just remembered and he just quoted well we'll never know we'll ask him one day but it's said Peter did you have your Scroll of Joel with you or did you just remember it what it took the interpretation came down to Peter and he said this is the Fulfillment of that where was I 20 and the sun shall be turned to Darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourself know him being delivered by the determinant counsel and the the for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up not only is this prophecy about the Holy Spirit coming down but Peter takes it and he uses it like we should do every time you take something that the prophets say and it should always point to Jesus Christ and this is what's happening right here where was I sorry whom God hath raised up having Loos the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaketh of him concerning I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope so many say that acts and many of the the the readings that you'll read about this this prophetic Ministry of Joel many say that that is just to the Jews but it's not because Peter said for This Promise is unto you and your children and many that as many that are far off me and you even as many as our Lord God shall call that's me let's go to chapter three for behold in those days and in that time when I shall bring again the Captivity of Judah and in Jerusalem in Jerusalem I will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my Heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the Nations and parted my land and they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink yay and what have ye to do with me oy and ziden and all the coasts of Palestine will you render me a recompense and if you recompense me Swift recompense me swiftly and speedily will I return to recompense upon your own head because you have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly Pleasant things the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have you sold to the grecians that might be that might remove them far from their border behold I will raise them out of the place whether ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah and they shall sell them to the sabians to a people far off for the Lord has spoken it procla Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let all the men of War draw near let them come up beat your plow shears into swords and your pruning hooks into Spears let the weak say I am strong notice he calls the Gentiles to this is contrary to a scripture in Isaiah that says the very opposite it says here beat your plow shares into swords and your pruning hooks into Spears those are those are um tools that you use to to till the ground and he says take those and make weapons out of those but in Isaiah he says take your swords and make them into tools that you can tell tell the ground this prophecy here from Joel Isa that prophecy is coming that peace is coming the Prince of Peace the Mighty God but now late 1940s this was fulfilled with Israel and here comes from the Holocaust and all these horrible things that happened here come the Jews back to their Homeland as God had commanded I'm going to bring you back brings them back and you see pictures of when they when they started in the 30s and in the 40s here they are they have a rifle in one hand and they're picking oranges with the other and taking care of things and and and ready to fight and look what's happening right now they've got F35 stealth Fighters they've got the they've got the greatest of all the militaries and and they're they're they're protecting themselves and here they are they have beaten those those stuff to Tool the ground and they have made weapons with it to protect themselves you go back we went through the book of Nehemiah there they are they standing they're they're building this wall they got a brick in one hand they got a sword in the other hand and here they are and still these Jews are ready to go man don't shoot at them because they shoot back and that's how that's what's going on right now they they are ready to fight Joel's prophesying that here and it's coming Peace by the grace of God the Prince of Peace is coming where everything's going to be wiped out but there's going to be some hard times coming Joel says assemble yourselves and Come All Ye Heathen and gather yourselves together roundabout tother cause thy Mighty ones to come down oh Lord let the Heathen be wakened and come up into the valley of Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the Heathen roundabout put ye put ye in the sickle and harvest The Ripe come come get you down for the Press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the Stars shall withdraw their shining and the Lord also shall Roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the Earth shall Shake but the Lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel so shall ye show that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion my Holy Mountain then shall Jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her anymore and shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and the rivers of Judah shall flow with Waters and the fountain shall come forth out of the house of the Lord and shall water in the valley of sham Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate Wilderness for the violence against the children of Judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land wow what a current scripture but Judah shall dwell forever in Jerusalem from generation to generation for I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed for the Lord dwelleth in Zion and the close of the Book of Joel what a powerful powerful book of of things that are going on then with Joel and they represented things to come now I want to I want to say on uh on Sunday night I um I shared as we were sharing some testimonies and oh I heard some just wonderful things brother Stephen um what what just tremendous um testimony that you gave and and really that that everybody did and um it was just it was just a really good night I especially um appreciated sister Martha's testimony where sometimes we just need Lord I just need a touch and we get into that place well then I came up and I I shared some things at the end and just wanted to warn congregation just be careful about the spirit of the sectarian denominational Spirit where we draw a circle around ourselves and say we are special it's not right and let me tell you it is not if you claim and most of us do I don't see anyone here that is new if you claim to believe brother branam brother brandham did not teach those things This Book of Joel in my opinion and I've I grew up listening to brother brandom most days of my life really I listened to every tape from 1947 to 1965 and I um I love them everyone I know it I know it and one thing that is a common theme in brother Brown's message very very common I would say the most common theme is from This Book of Joel now he doesn't quote it I mean quotes it all the time but brother brandom Likens this this Locust this evil little creature that destroys the plant he Likens it to the denominational system and the denominational spirit I can categorically say he preached more about that than anything else in his whole Ministry he came to tear that thing down and let me tell you William brandom hated the denominational sectarian spirit and if you don't believe me I'd say turn on a tape pick one anyone and he'll be saying that I want to read a few quotes to you that he talks about these this evil little creature Palmer worm Locust cankerworm caterpillar 1959 now what do they do what has their translators or the men done that uh that quote was correct or the or the church men done what's the organization done wrapped up an old denominational rag around in order to be popular with the rest if I have to eat soda crackers and drink branchwater and be martyred I'll stand for God's truth and die on the stump that's right that's not no man the pope of Rome or bishop or Cardinal can't withstand that yes sir what's the matter what the Palmer worm left what the Methodist left the Baptist eaten what the Baptist left the Pentecostal eaten what a place the lifelines are all gone this destroying Spirit next quote is from uh the same same sermon so help me God uh one there you go so help me God let me have gumption enough let me have principle enough let me be man enough let me be Christ enough to stand alone if I stand have to stand that way and tell the truth and stand yes sir I'd rather preach the gospel to five people than have the millions that does here tell tell the truth I'll never compromise I wanted this because God had told me these Great Signs and things that's being produced like the manifestation of his resurrection and so forth it's for the church those poor people out there and bound in them Creeds and things they've been so undocumented like embalmed God bless your heart I won't leave you in that condition I'll tell you what God Said but I will restore to you all that the caterpillar has eaten and the canker worm has eaten and all that the Palmer worm has eaten I will restore sayeth the Lord so help me I make this Prophecy Before the coming of the Lord the true Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic teaching the true Bible Spirit the true it's on its road now trying to eat its way up and grow out again the Pentecostal had it to start with what did they do they draw a little rind around it and begin to to nominate and he cut it off and he cut it right off that's exactly right here come along where the Lord sent these gifts these humble little gifts that he gave me they kept coming and they wanted me to be a lad rain outp made an organization out of it wanted me to come to join the assemblies I've stood right in the midst of every bunch that's hanging out there right there at the stump of the tree and said this is the foundation cut off these Old Rag lines here so the life can get into you that you'll have prophecies and you'll have discernment you'll have the spirit you'll have power you'll have the restoration of the true church when you get back to the True Vine and the true life it can't come through a rag that drops right down and says it was another day it's another day it's forever the same he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end absolutely you'll have to come back to the foundation for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it what is that rock you tape listeners that rock is the that's this is Peter and Jesus that rock is the revelation of who Christ is next quote it gets better brother Aaron I mean it's good now watch back in Joel in the second chapter where I preached on here not long ago the four insects what the Palmer worm left and the caterpillar eat with the caterpillar eat the Locust eaten you remember the preaching on that I think it was here in California at the breakfast I believe it was in Phoenix what the Methodist left the Baptist eaten what the Baptist left the Pentecostal eaten and tore the whole Vine down but i r restore sayeth the Lord and watch that same insect is the same thing only in different stages the Palmer worm becomes a caterpillar and so forth and on down and it's an insect and that's an insect starting eating off brotherly love I read it again started eating off brotherly love taking the Bible and substituting something else I'll read that one again taking the Bible and substituting something else and I give the four major things and proved it by the scripture the things that eat out the teaching of the true word of God brotherly love as Paul said already started in 1 Corinthians 13 all those things how they eat it up and just eat the church plumbed down to a stub but he said I will restore sayeth the Lord that's right all the years that they had eaten and all the things that they had done notice Israel notice Israel when you has always been the Fig Tree when you see this tree putting forth its buds what the generation that sees Israel become a nation that generation will not pass until it be fulfilled watch don't you see it here look at them now God God has always had to drive the Jews and they never had the Holy Spirit many of them wouldn't even believe their prophets they Messengers and he had to drive them and that's what he's going to have to do to the Gentile Church he's going to have to break down these denominational barriers we're letting communism start eating eating around us and then we'll all have to come together God will make his word fulfilled because the Covenant is unconditional not if you will will we don't make a deal with God not if you will I will but I have already done it that's right oh I love that that just makes me feel religious does me too next next quote then this little fellow died out he become a locust that was the next stage that was the next stage was a locust now what does that Locust do a locust eats the leaves that's right a locust takes onto the leaves what the Palmer worm left he left the leaves he eat the fruit off the tree then what took then what took in the locust come to eat eat what the Palmer worm left now what did he do what did this Palmer worm do destroyed the leaves what's the leaves for destroying Divine Fellowship that's right now he's a presbyterian we don't have nothing to do with them are you serious now now he's a presbyterian I won't have nothing to do with him and how many times have we heard something like that from our churches oh they're Baptist they're Presbyterian they're nominal do you think brother Brandon was for that kind of a spirit yet it's rampant he was not for that he's a presbyterian we won't have nothing to do with him he's Nazarene he's Pentecostal he's this or that or the other we won't have nothing to do with him because he don't belong to our group have a meeting up here for healing of the sick huh our church don't even believe in it see there you do what did the old old Locust what did the little old Locust do he cut off the he cut the fellowship off and that's right he took all the fellowship what is fellowship what does the leaves do it makes it cool where the birds fly under the leaves cool off there's your tree again and he shall be like a tree that's planted see all right where the people can come and sit down under the The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and cool off a bit I'm going to brag for a minute this is the and I told somebody this is the best church I have ever seen as far as welcoming people come sit down in the shade enjoy service we're going to love you and I want us to continue I want us to get even better next quote and I said to a little woman the other day poor little woman she belonged to a great dignified Church down she said she's dying with cancer went down to pray for her brother Roy Roberson here one of the trustees sent me down there and the poor little thing sitting there dying with cancer and she said I said I said are you a Christian she said sir I don't know what to say said I went to a certain church and said she started crying I said' what's the matter she said I just couldn't dress right said they looked down upon me H oh there you are see you're there you're uncomfortable see but the Bible said that we are to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places oh my what all alike why I I tell you what what this will do it'll make a pair of overalls in a tuxedo suit put their arms around each other and call each other brother sure will it'll make an old Calico dress I have no idea what that is do you sisters know Sister Sister Heather you know what that is calico dress I don't okay old Calico dress put her arms around silk and satin and say sister how are you this morning praise God I love that that is just brother John that's that's our church man and it's it feels good and we need to continue on on that's right it will it's joy peace love Faith in the word longsuffering gentleness patience set down in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus cool off a little while that's what the leaves did but what did the old locust did he come around eat them leaves off and said you belong to ours or you don't belong to anybody so he took all the cool coolness out of the spirit took all the coolness of the spirit out he fixed himself a Creed all right now we got to go on I could stay on I could stay a long time on that old Locust I'm sure he could we can close as I said my understanding of brother bram's message this was his core was against this sectarian denominational way and he likened it to this Critter that swarms in and kills the plant it kills the fellowship it kills the ability for you to invite someone to church and for them to feel comfortable here it destroys that it destroys as he said in these in and I read I don't know how many quotes he kept going back to love and how it destroys that love because of certain doctrines and we brothers and sisters we are I'm not saying us I'm saying the message ranks is guilty of that it has always been my greatest desire to have a church that we can invite people to and that they could come here and they could feel comfortable I believe we have it and I want to continue on but that is not the case in other places and as you said as as I read this from brother brandom that woman said I can't I don't look like they look and brother brandom said ah there it is right there so we need to always be careful I believe we're headed in the right direction I do not sacrificing Holiness by no means continue on serving the lord we need to pray more we need to be more of a Christ we need to always do more and more and more but we also have to understand if we say we believe this man we have to know what he preached and we have to see his number one focus and that was this denominational spirit that is the same as this Locust that comes in and destroys Daniel you can come to close I could read quote after quote I tell you what pick pick a tape just pick one go into the table pick one and tell me if he doesn't preach about it it was his message and it's a wonderful message and I think that we should get back to it we should get back to what he taught because he had he had something that we need that's why I love way the way Joel starts this he said tell your children about it teach your children about these things tell them for those that knew him what kind of a man he was tell them about the Miracles that you saw show them that God's Alive today because this time's coming these prophecies that come out of This Book of Joel they are are powerful and they're the closing of time Jesus quoted them Peter quoted him the Book of Revelation says the same thing it's a hard time coming but our hearts need to be right and we need to be right [Music] Daniel Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see [Music] you I want to see you and Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of my heart I want to see you and I want to see you to see high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory and pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see I'm looking for a [Music] scripture the Apostle John I remember brother brandom telling a story about him when he got in his old age he's the only one of all the disciples that died of old age and here is here is in his old age and he would just cry out Children love each other just love one another even in his old age he saw that that is the most important thing and he himself wrote these three words he said God is love it is so important brothers and sisters it is this denominational system started with the Catholic church and boy did it do damage and what it does is it brings it doesn't breathe love it brings jealousy and it brings it breeds hatred it bre breeds division it breeds a um fear it it breeds a spirit that that you think that that you're better than someone else and it just plays on the weaknesses of human beings and it is today it's a strong as it's ever been and that destroying Locust comes in and takes the leaves it takes the all the way takes the bark off of it and kills the plant and then and then when he when he kills all of the fruits when he kills the ability of the plant to be able to bring forth food for the people then it brings a famine and that famine is prophesied to come and not just a famine for food but a famine for hearing the word of God and we're living close to those days brother Mark would you come and and close let's all [Music] stand Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of My Heart and I want to see you and I want to see you open the eyes and Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see [Music] you amen that was a wonderful wonderful message there going through the Book of Joel there and and just seeing how that uh I was just listening uh to a tape on the on the way uh we drove from Jeffersonville we're from the Jeffersonville area for the last nine years and and um like I said we Fellowship Brother Brad Burgess and brother Daniel Andes and them and and they said to send their greetings and we told them we're coming out here and they really love you all and but we were listening to that message just simply Called Love in 1956 and and uh really speaking on the things brother said just like uh preaching in Joel there we we listen to it it's the truth and um he said love can conquer all diseases love can conquer um any situation you're in love is is the main them that's what he spoke in that message and it's a truth I I'm so thankful that the brother was admonishing you and that cuz it's it's it's wonderful that's that's the right way to go so let let's just pray dear heavenly father we're just so thankful Lord that you've chosen us Lord Jesus there's nothing good in ourselves Lord but but lord it's because you put it in US Lord to believe your word word Lord and to see the day that we're living in Lord Jesus we don't want to take it for granted Lord we we just appreciate you so much Lord Jesus we can't do anything without you but through you Lord we believe we can do all things Lord and Lord we just pray Lord that you let these words that we heard Lord sink into our hearts Lord Jesus Lord we desire to be more like you as the prophet said we never want to put a a period at the end of our faith but a comma and that we just want to believe more of you Lord we just want to see more of you Lord as our brother said sometimes um even though we might hear the word we might read it we pass over it many times but when you reveal it to our hearts Lord it's a different story Lord becomes part of our lives and and that's we desire Lord just more of you in our lives to show it to those around us and that can be effect Lord to our those that we work with and go to school with and our neighbors Lord and and those that we sit next to in the Pew Lord we want to be effect Lord upon others Lord there will be a time as we heard that it'll be perfect rest Lord but we realize that time isn't now we've got a fight on our hands Lord that that we know that Devil's coming at us every day but but Lord Jesus you said you raise up an a stand and you certainly have Lord and we're so thankful for your word for your spirit Lord that leads and guide us please be with us now Lord as we go to our homes Lord let us Lord as we depart Lord from this building may your presence go with each of us Lord in our cars and our homes Lord and we'll be quick to give you the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory and pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy [Music] I am uh I'm biased but I'm very proud of this congregation I um I I really appreciate the welcoming Spirit brother Lyall sister Heather God bless your hearts for always being sister hope God bless your heart I just appreciate the the and all of us really but I appreciate whenever we see somebody new that comes in they are welcomed let's always keep that Spirit brothers and sisters I believe that is one of the things that I used to do is I used to ride my bike around town in Jeffersonville and I talk to Old Folks sitting on their porches and try to get stories about brother Brandon one of the things and this was universally that all of them who never went to church and never they they didn't they didn't follow his teachings or anything but one thing that he that they always said is he was my one of my best friends he made everyone feel like they were very special I remember one time I was I rid my bike up to this this lady she was sitting outside these low-income apartments on um on 10th Street and um no it was on uh 8th Street and I went up to her and she had a circle around her mouth where she had been smoking cigarettes for so long and and her mouth was she just looked at and and her lips were stained from the nicotine and I walked up to her and and I said uh I said ma'am I said you ever heard of a man named William brandham she said oh yes she said he was a prophet of God she said he was so kind to me and my family and told me a couple stories about him and and how honored that that lady was to have met him and the impression that he made on her why wasn't the Miracles it was the love that that man had and that's the love that I desire to have I believe that's a love that Jesus Christ himself had but I am unbias brother Mark we've got a great church here and I'm very very proud of him and and we're brother Brandon was greeting all these different churches I think they were on the the radio hookup and he would greet them and he'd say um looking for the coming of the Lord and this person and looking for the coming of the Lord and that person brother we're looking for the coming of the same Lord that you're looking for God bless you brother and sisters you're

[Music] Jesus. [Music] If we truly put him first and put him in the center of our lives, then we never have a worry in the world. If we can just do that. Let's pray. Our father, Lord, as you're in heaven looking down upon us, we ask Lord that our worship would come up before you as the incense of old would come up before you from the altar. May our prayers come up before you in the name of Jesus Christ. And Father, may they be heard in your ears. Lord, would you answer? We pray. visit us, Father, this morning.

I always said he looks like Shan Connory and he just glad to glad to have you back. Um, so, uh, Brother Ed mentioned that we have a lot of construction going on. That's what these lines are. These lines are actually what happened is they pulled the carpet back. They shaved down. There's a big ridge in the middle of the church here. They shaved it down so we can um, lay the carpet. Brother Ed was quick to point out that now we have seating in the front is first class. The middle is economy plus and the back is just economy. So So you all are in in first class here this morning. Brother Ed sent me a picture of the tape and um so yeah, it's uh it's good to have it. So, we're going to continue on with the construction. And the next step is uh in a couple weeks, if the Lord's willing, we will rip out all of the this carpet. We're going to replace it with a new carpet. And uh so there's going to be a lot of um just a lot of things going on. Brother Ed mentioned that we're going to put replace a glass back there. There's going to be some railings put up. We need to finish the railings up in the balcony. So, quite a bit of construction. And with that, we also have quite a few people missing. We have all kinds of people missing either on vacation, traveling. Um so what we're going to do for August and September is we are only going to have Sunday evening service every other service. So tonight we will not have Sunday evening service. Next week we will have Sunday evening service and that's because of all the people missing all the construction and everything that's going on. So, um, we will do that August and September and then we will get back to our normal schedule in October. Um, I think that's it for the announcements. We're looking forward to we got the the wheelchair ramp poured back there. We're looking forward to getting this done and then if the Lord's willing in um October, November time frame, we will probably once we finish all the sanctuary, we will have meetings and we will rededicate the church. really looking forward to that recap on last week. We started a series on prayer. And I think it's really I think it's the most important thing that's in our lives is praying. It's fellowship between us and the Lord. And I hope that you remembered from last Sunday that God wants to talk to us more than we want to talk to him. He created the Garden of Eden for his children and then he's preparing a place now for his children to go back to that is going to be an eternal place of joy and peace. Talked about last week that the Bible it is uh neither a science book nor is it a history book and it's not meant to be read like that. The Bible is a book of relationship from the start to the finish. It's a relationship between God and his children and us. So when we are reading this Bible, we can place ourselves into the word and we can learn more about God and how it pleases God for us to commune with him. And it really it all comes back to prayer. We went through Genesis 1 and showed how God created everything for his children. And at the end again, he wants us to be with him in eternity. Told the story and I hope you remember this. I told the story of the of the purchase price. And if you buy something, if you spend whatever money on whatever item it is, that purchase price, it was worth it to you to pay that money for that item. So that item that you bought was worth to you more probably than what you paid for it. And that is our souls. God gave his only begotten son. And we were worth this life of his son Jesus Christ. The purchase price. That's how much we are worth to God is that he would give his son. And it is very very important that our way of communing with God and our way of speaking with God, our way of fellowshipping with God is through prayer. It should be the number one thing in all of our lives. And so often it's the thing that suffers the most. But prayer is the most important thing that we can do. More important than reading our Bible, more important than going to work, more importing important than eating or drinking is prayer. It should be number one. I looked up a couple we'll continue on with prayer this morning. I want to talk about Jonah. U but before we get into that, I looked up a couple a few facts about prayer in the Bible. I got this from gospelcoalition.org. Um these are very interesting. We have record of Jesus praying about 25 times in the four gospels. Can you imagine the son of God, God himself in flesh praying and praying not just once but 25 times we have that he's either referring to prayer or praying. If the son of god had to pray that much how much more do we have to pray Moses we have him praying about 20 times. David. Many, many prayers that King David prayed. If you count the Psalms with the Apostle Paul, up to 41 times, Paul is either praying or he mentions prayer. The greatest men in the entire Bible are really the ones that prayed the most. There are about five different positions listed in prayer. So often we ask, Lord, how do you want me to pray? Am I supposed to kneel? Am I supposed to stand? It's there. There's different times. There's one time that Jesus or that God instructs to that was sitting when they're praying. Nathan came to the prophet. Nathan the prophet came to David and tell to tell him that he couldn't build the temple but his son would. And um it says this, then when King David went in, he sat before the Lord and said, \"Who am I, oh Lord, and what is my house that thou has brought me hither to?\" So David sat and prayed. Standing and praying. Jesus said in Mark Mark 11, he says, \"When you stand praying, forgive if you ought to if you have ought against any other that your father also which is in heaven may also forgive forgive you of your trespasses.\" And kneeling in prayer, Daniel 6, Luke 22, Acts 7, Acts 9, Acts 20, Acts 21, Ephesians 3, Daniel and then back to Daniel. Daniel knelt in prayer with his windows open and he kneelled before the Lord and faced Jerusalem, faced the temple at Jerusalem when he prayed. 1 Timothy chapter 2, Paul says that you lift up holy hands. He says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and without doubting. And it's so the Bible teaches us that many many there's not a specific way or or a specific posture that we have in praying. There's other places where Jesus he he laid down with his with his face to the ground and prayed. So there's not a specific way that we have to pray and not a more reverent way. We need to pray as the Lord leads us to pray. When we pray, we always say the word amen. Amen. As we know it means so be it. It means let it be. Something on the order of let these things that I have just prayed let them be so. When we say amen at the end of our prayer. There are about 650 prayers in the Bible. And there about 450 answered prayers in the Bible. So prayer is a very very important thing. just me and I I'll give a short testimony of just me last week. Stephanie and I were kind of worried about some things that are coming up and I just had a lot of anxiety about just some personal um situations that we may have to overcome and just worrying about it and worrying about it. And before I went to come out on a Wednesday night last week, I believe it was, I was just worrying about it in my office. And then I said, \"Wait a minute. How many times have I encouraged other people to pray and to lay these things in the hands of the Lord and the Lord?\" And as soon as my knees hit the floor, the Lord took all of the burden away. He talk all of the anxiety away and I just placed it into his hands because I know that he's he's gonna take care of me that it's going to be whatever happens whether it be in church or whether it happens with with our families whatever it would be if we would just lay it into his hands he has our best interest in mind and he wants to take care of us and it's a bit sad and I can say this in my own personal life and you can probably too that the times that I have been closest to God are the times that have been the hardest in my life. It's the times that I've had to overcome or the times that bad things happened or the times that maybe I made mistakes and I fell and I had to come back to God. And those are the times that I had there's nothing that I could do. I couldn't take the situation into my own hands and I would put it into the hands of the Lord and then he would take care of it and that faith would rise up in me. But it to me it's sad that we have to make a mistake or we have to go through bad things before we put things into the hands of God. We should be praying like we have a terrible thing coming. We should be praying like that all of the time. Just put it in into his hands. Put our lives into his hands every day. was um I have a friend that right now in the past and over the past couple weeks he has spent time praying. He went to a place that he felt that the Lord would heal would hear him. And he has been praying for his family and his family, none of them would he consider uh believers. They don't want to follow the Lord like he's following it. And he has just been praying and and there was there was one day that he spent 24 hours in prayer. didn't eat, didn't drink, just stayed in prayer the whole time. And I know him and I see that his motives are not correct. And I don't know if the Lord's going to hear those prayers because he has in his mind what he wants his children and what he wants his wife to be. And he's praying that they would come to the Lord and see things the way that he sees things. And he should be really praying, Lord, I want what you want. I want my children, I want my wife to have a personal relationship with me. They don't have to come and see things the way I see things. I want them to just know you, dear God. That is what he should be. And I I see that he is trying to pull them in a certain way and they just don't want to go in that way. And instead really of getting together and asking God what Lord, what do you want? He is instead asking the Lord. He's really putting the Lord in a box and saying, Lord, here is what I want. I want them to be coming to come to church with me. I want them to act like this. I want them to believe like this. And really, he should just be surrendering. And that is the kind of prayer that God hears. He hears a complete surrender. I had another friend a while ago that he was really struggling. He wanted to homeschool his kids and his wife didn't want to. And there was just a battle going on in the family and it was really taking a toll on their on their marriage. And he told me the next day he came and came to my office and he says he says yeah he says I was praying last night he says my wife was praying and he said I laid my hands on my hand on her and I said dear Lord will you show her that she's wrong in this. I said dude you're lucky you got that hand back. That's not the way that you approach prayer. When you approach prayer that you're together in this and you say, \"Lord, what is your will in these things?\" We want to find what your perfect will is for our family because it might be right for this family and it might not be right for that family. The one thing that we know is always right is that we approach Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He is the king. He is it. And if we would approach him and ask him, Lord, what is right in our family? Then the Lord will speak to us instead of having our preconceived notions about these things. Lord, we want what you want and we surrender. Remember also who we are praying to. St. John, let's let's read St. John 14:1. Jesus says this. Jesus says, \"Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive unto receive you unto myself, that where I am, you may be also.\" Remember last Sunday's lesson? Jesus's desire, God's desire is to have fellowship with his children. And Jesus's greatest desire is for us to be with him in heaven. He is preparing a place for us to spend eternity or at least the next thousand years. He is working on this place and it's going to be like the Garden of Eden. It's going to be perfect and he wants us to be there. That's his desire. We get all we get all kinds of things in our heads, but we have to remember what God wants. Verse number four. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. NIV says, you know the way to the place where I am going. Thomas, one of his disciples, was listening to this and and he was like, what? I don't get it. I don't get what the Lord what Jesus is saying. And Jesus and Thomas said unto him,\"Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way?\" NIV is a little bit easier to understand. It says, \"Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?\" Jesus said unto him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father but by me.\" What does that mean? No one comes to the father except through me. We always think it's salvation. We always think that well you to be saved to have eternal life that you have to come through the lord Jesus which is true but that's not all that he said. He said no one can come to the father except by me. And the same goes for our prayers. When we approach God, it is through Jesus Christ and him alone. How can anyone expect God to hear a prayer if it is not through Jesus Christ? Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one no one can come to the father except by me.\" So when we pray, it must be according to Christ and him only. We can't have it through our way of thinking or we can't even really have it through our desires. We don't put a God in a bo God in a box. I say that a lot. We always want him to fit our mold of what God should be. We approach him, we should approach him as the almighty God. And Lord, I am just trying to find your will in all of this and say, \"Yeah, I don't care, Lord. I don't care what you how you do it. I don't care what it what ends up, but just please get me Lord out of this mess that I've got myself into or pray that that Lord help my family or whatever it is. Or better yet, we pray to him all the time and we give him our prayers and our thanks and we give him our love all the time and not just when we have a a problem. Paul said that we pray always. That's the best way. It's not just when we need something. How would I like to have a friend that just calls me when he needs something? How would I like to have kids that just talk to me when they need something? That's that's not that's not a good relationship. So whether we pray on our knees, whether we pray standing, whether we pray sitting, whether whatever we whatever we are doing, we just say, \"Lord, just hear my prayer. I need you.\" And we suffer as I said just now that suffering is part of it because it drives us to God. We ask what are we praying for? And I asked like like my friend that's praying for his family. What are you asking for with your children? Are you asking that they start coming to church with you to your church? Are you asking that they start dressing like you want them to dress? Are you asking that that they start seeing things the way that you want them to see it? Or are you asking that they have a relationship with the Almighty where they are talking to him directly? Is that what you're praying? Is that what we should be praying? Lord, I want my son, I want my daughter, I want them to have a relationship with you. I want my wife to have this relationship with you. I want your spirit to be in our family all the time to where we are just fellowshipping around you and we can open up the Bible and we can say Lord we want to know what this means and we are together in this rather than having a preconceived notion on how we should be but pray and ask Lord let my son let my daughter my wife my husband let that person have a relationship with you. And if they're talking to you and you're talking back, that is communion. And that's what we're all seeking or we should be seeking. Then you might ask, and I have in my notes here, how do I hear the voice of God? And that's that's the thing that so many people ask, how do I know it's God speaking? How do how do I know that it's him talking? And he speaks to us in different ways. You're going to see how he spoke to a prophet in a little bit, but he spoke to Elijah in a still small voice. He spoke to David in a wind going through the malberry trees. He spoke to Peter in a vision while he was on the housetop. He spoke to Paul in a light, a blinding light. He speaks to us in different ways, but it's always purposeful. And if you really get word from the Lord, and many of you have had experiences, if he really speaks to you, no matter how it is, it may be an audible voice, it may just be, I just know he spoke to me. Or it may be, Lord, I need something out of your word. And you may turn to a scripture and oh that answers my question. But you know when God speaks to you and when he speaks a volume of books couldn't have as much knowledge as you just got. And it may just be one sentence that God speaks to you. And I know I've been there where he just spoke a little bit and it opened up an entire it just it it fulfilled a an enormous number of questions. It told it gave me the answers for those. Now, watch the Lord. We're going to get into this man Jonah. Now, watch how God speaks with Jonah and watch Jonah's response. And watch Jonah's weaknesses. Jonah was not perfect. He's like everybody in the Bible except one. He was not perfect and he made plenty of mistakes. And we're going to read about how this prophet was running, actually running from God. Jonah, we'll summarize the book of Jonah. He was he was um as I said, he was a prophet. He was called to preach to a city of pagan people, not Jewish people. Remember the Old Testament is all about one lineage from Adam to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob to the sons of Jacob. We call them the sons of Israel, the children of Israel. They go out and then we have Moses and we have Elijah and we have all of these different prophets. And it's all pretty much in this lineage of people that we call the Jews. And this man Jonah was one of these prophets. And he was called not to preach to Jews, not to correct his own people, but to these worldly bunch of pagan people in this city called Nineveh. Jonah didn't want to do it. How could God call Jonah? Jonah might say, \"How could you call me to this bunch of evil people? I know they're not even your people, God. So, how could you? I must be wrong in what I'm thinking.\" So instead of going to this city of Nineveh, Jonah has it in his mind, well, I'll go to this city, Tarses. That's probably more along what God would want. And we have to be careful in making God's decisions for him. We have to be careful in saying, well, here's what the Lord would want because it makes sense in my mind. This did not make sense, but God, it was God. He's sovereign. He knows what's best. He sent Jonah to this place. But no, Jonah decides he's going to go to this other city of Tarsus. He jumps on a boat, jumps on a ship. They start sailing to Tarsus. God sends this great storm. They end up Jonah ends up confessing to the people, \"It was me. This is the reason the storm.\" They take Jonah. They throw him overboard. The The storm stops. This big whale comes up and swallows Jonah. He's in the whale for the for three days. The whale probably goes down and hangs out at the bottom of the ocean. He's there for three days. And Jonah prays while he's in this belly of the whale. After three days, the whale swims up to the shore, spits him out. Jonah now has a new commission and same commission as he did before, but now it's more real to him. He gets up, makes a trip to Nineveh, and preaches to the people of Nineveh, and they repent. &gt;&gt; And not only do they repent, but even the people on the boat, the ship repent. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Jonah. We'll get through the first two chapters of Jonah, which is I believe what um that'll close this message on this section of our series on prayer. Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amiti saying and go to Nineveh that great city and cry out against it for their wickedness has come up before me. Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah. How did it come? We don't know. And that's the thing. We think that it was just God speaking to Jonah lip to ear. But it doesn't say how. It may have been a vision like Peter had. It may have been like Daniel who got the word of the Lord by reading from the prophet Jeremiah. It may have been that. It may have been a number of things. We don't know. But we know that God sent his word to Jonah and says, \"Go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it, for their wickedness has come up before me. So God tells Jonah to go to this pagan place and but Jonah rose up to flee to Tarsus from the presence of the Lord and went down to Japa and he found a ship going to Tarsus. So he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them into unto Tarsus for the from the presence of the Lord. When we choose our path, no matter what path that is, if we choose our path rather than the path that God sets before us, no matter how religious we are, no matter how much we pray, no matter how much we try to get God to see things our way, we leave the presence of God. As I said, no matter how religious we are, no matter how good we are living, when we go our way, aside from God's way, we leave his presence. But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea. And there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his God. Remember that. and cried every man unto his God, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, and to to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship, and he lay and was fast asleep. Every man cried unto his God. It's not capitalized there, and neither does that represent Jehovah. These mariners were pagans. These mariners had their own gods. They were not believers. This is important in a few verses. So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him, \"What meanest thou, oh sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not.\" And they said, \"Everyone to his fellow, come and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.\" So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. If you come to our Wednesday night Bible studies, we've talked a little bit about this casting lots. This is the way that God had actually placed into the hands of people that they could. It's like flipping a coin and it would fall upon a certain one. And it's throughout the Bible and it was the way that God ordained back then that they could do this. And this lot fell upon this man Jonah. He is the one that's causing the problems. Then they said unto him, \"Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us? What is thine occupation? And whence comest thou, and what is thy country, and of what people art thou?\" And he said unto them, I'm a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. Now he's saying he fears God, but just a little bit ago he was disobeying God and he was going to this Tarsus. But now he's fearing God. Why? Because the ship is sinking. Because his life is on the line. And now Jonah is saying now he gets his mind right. He says, \"Now, okay, now I fear God.\" And he said unto them, \"I'm a Hebrew and I fear God.\" And we see, friends, we see this happen a lot of times when something bad happens to us. As I said, when we go into trials and and tribulations, even though it's because of us, it's it's a blessing. A lot of people that go to prison, you see that they go to prison and they're they're living a sinful life outside of prison. Then they find the Lord Jesus in prison. I know a a a friend of mine that I was very close with, his name's Don. He could not really live outside of prison. He would get into all kinds of trouble, all kinds of crime, violent crime, but he would go into prison and then he would start reading books and he would start reading his Bible. He'd start praying more. He'd start a Bible study and he would do really well while inside. But when he would go out, he would immediately fall into sin. So I believe friends that we have a choice in our destination. We have I believe that the Bible teaches us that we have a choice but I also believe in predestination where God knows which choices that we are going to make and how we will make those choices and he will set a path in front of us like he did to Don or many others. He will set a path in front of us that forces us into him. And that's how this man Jonah was. Jonah was a son of God. great man who was running from God. We don't see him praying about going to Tarsus. We see him making that decision because it made sense in his mind. And that's the case for most people. They want to serve God as long as it makes sense to them. And even worse, most people want to serve God as long as God's serving them. As long as they can call themselves a Christian, &gt;&gt; they will serve God. As long as you you don't have to give too much of your life, &gt;&gt; as long as you don't have to make too many sacrifices, then you'll serve you'll serve God. But when God starts to require more as he did with Jonah, it's so easy for people to say, \"Yeah, you know, I'll just serve God in my own way.\" We don't serve God in our own way. If we truly want to serve God, we serve God in his way. &gt;&gt; We serve God in the way that he has set before us. And Jonah right before he was saying, \"I'm going to serve God in my own way. I'm going to go to Tarsus. I don't want to go over here. Maybe I got something wrong. This isn't working. This doesn't make sense. I'm going to serve God in my own way, God.\" No. And if you are a predestinate predestinated son or daughter of God, he is going to force you into that. Whether you have to go to prison, whether you have to make big mistakes, whether you have to cause all kinds of problems, God is going to force us in. We can make it a lot easier on ourselves if we just follow his leadings. Are you Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Jonah, he's serving God on his own terms. The people of Nineveh, as I said, they're Gentiles. They're sinners. They were not God's people, as he thought. And he may have prayed, but as I said with my friend, we don't want to pray in a way that says, \"God, here is what should be.\" We say, \"God, what do you want? Lord, what is your will in this sin? this man Jonah. So, he's on this ship and this this big storm comes and these people are like, \"What is going on? This is not normal.\" And Jonah basically confesses to him and says, \"Yeah, I'm the one that did this.\" And do you see how the sins of all of us, they don't just affect us. &gt;&gt; Remember, I say it all the time. It's not just about you. You know, you you say, \"Well, it's my life and I'm going to live how I want and I can make these decisions because it's me.\" No. Your decisions not only affect you, but they affect everyone around you. Jonah's bad decision here affected the people on this ship, and they were going to die because Jonah sinned. So, when we are are going before the Lord, and we might say, \"Well, it's my body, it's myself, it's me, I can do what I want.\" No, you can't. Your life is not your own &gt;&gt; because you affect not only yourself and God wants you to be saved and God wants you to prosper, but you affect everyone around you. &gt;&gt; That's that's the even even last night when I sent out the prayer request. I got the sister Angela and brother Jeremy sent me the update on sister Ronnie. Serious situation. First thing I did, I sat back in my chair. I was I had my Bible open. I was I was studying. The first thing I did is I said, \"Lord, am I in a place that I can approach you? Am I in a place that I can pray?\" And as I sent out the request to to all of you all, the thought also came to my mind, are they in a place where they can get this prayer request and go before the Lord for this sister? And friends, if if you're sinning, if you're not in a place where God can use you or God will hear your prayer, who suffers? It's not just you. It would be the sister that needs our prayers right now. We owe it to each other. I talk a lot about Jesus and how he wanted unity because there is strength in unity. If we are together, if we are if we are worshiping together, if we love one another, it not only helps us, but it helps the people that need it. Paul said in I believe it was 1 Corinthians chapter 12. He said, Paul said, I don't I don't know exactly where it was. Paul said that those of us that are strong should bear the infirmities of those that are weak. 1 Corinthians 12 26 he says that when one member of the body suffers the entire body suffers and I'll tell you when one member of the body sins when one member of the body isn't living right it's not just that person it's all of us that suffer and here is Jonah and he is sinning and he's outside of the will of God And look who's suffering. It wasn't just him. It was all these people that had never heard of him before. And they were probably looking at him like, \"What's the matter with you, man? Why did you do this? Now we're we got families to go home to. Why did you do this?\" And Jonah then finally Jonah repents. And watch what happens. Verse number 10. Then were the men exceeding afraid and said unto him,\"Wh hast thou done this?\" For the men knew that he had fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. Then they said unto him, \"What shall we do unto thee that the sea might be calm unto us? For the sea rot and was tempestuous.\" And he said unto them, \"Take me up and cast me forth into the sea.\" So shall the sea be calm unto you. For I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. So he acknowledges that his sins has caused problems to everyone around him. He confesses, he repents, and now Jonah is ready to surrender to God. So much so that he is giving his life for the pagans that were on that boat. He's like, \"Throw me over.\" He didn't know what was going to happen. Jonah didn't know that a big whale was going to open his mouth and and swallow him. Jonah, now these pagans that he hated, Jonah's now like, \"Hey, throw me over and you'll be saved.\" Look at the difference in Jonah. We're about to see Jonah go to prayer. Nevertheless, the men rode hard. They didn't want to throw him overboard. They didn't want this guy to die. Nevertheless, the men rode hard to bring to the land, but they could not, for the sea rot and was tempestuous against them. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord and said, \"We beseech thee, oh Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish, for this man's life, and lay not upon us the innocent blood, for thou hast for, oh Lord, hast hast done as it pleased thee.\" All of a sudden, now look at what has happened to these men. Instead of every man going to his own God and setting up their idol, this is a good idol. Setting up their idol and praying to this. Now they are going to the one true God. Look what happens when Jonah repents. Jonah says it's my fault. A repentance doesn't just affect us. A repentance is also a blessing to all those around us. And here Jonah is like, \"I repent. I'm wrong. Throw me overboard. I give my life for you. Even though you're a pagan, even though you're not like me, even though you don't go to my church, I give my life for you.\" And look at the effect that it has on these men. Now, they're praying to the one true God. Remember the famous scripture, Romans 8:28. We know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and them that are called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Look at Jonah completely out of the will of God, running from God, thinking laying leaning on his own understanding. And now he goes and now God is punishing and God brings the the tempest. God brings the the storm and the place is going to sink and they're all going to die. And now God uses that for the good. Now, it's even better probably than if Jonah would not have just gone to Nineveh in the first place. So, when we sin, friends, when you do something wrong, don't just crawl up in your hole and die. Say, \"No, now I'm going to make it right. And Lord, no matter how bad that I have done, you can take whatever I've done and you can turn it around and you can make it a blessing, not only to me, but to others.\" I'm running out of time. So, they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea. And the sea ceased from her raging. Then the mere the men feared the Lord exceedingly. They feared God, not their go, not their idols. They fear the they feared the real God. Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows. Look at the effect that it had on these men. So if we make mistakes, if we are a child of God, God turns around and makes those mistakes a blessing. Don't use it as an excuse to sin. You'll suffer for your sins as Jonah did. But when we make a mistake, watch God turn things around. Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. Remember that for when I close. It's an important blessing that comes from this story and it's amazing. Watch what happens. Chapter 2 verse one. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly. His prayers may not have been sincere before, but now he's at the bottom of the ocean in a whale's belly with no hope of redemption. No hope anywhere. And he's thinking about these things. So, no matter how far we've gone, God is able to turn things around. I don't think there's anyone in this room that have been so bad that they've been in a whale's stomach with seaweed around their neck at the thousand feet below the the the top and sitting there. I don't think anybody's done that bad. I don't think any situation has been that dire as it was with Jonah. But God can take that situation and turn it around. Now, when we have no hope and you think that the enemy and he tells us there's no hope in this situation, there's always hope in prayer. And watch what Jonah does. This is amazing. Now, we're going to hear from Jonah what he says. Jonah said this. I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me. Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou hast heard, thou hearest heardest my voice. For thou hast cast me into the deep, into the midst of the seas, and the floods compassed me about. All thy billows, and all thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. The waters comp compassed about me. Even to the soul the depth closed round about me. The weeds were wrapped around my head. wrapped about my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with her bars was about me for forever. Yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption. Oh Lord my God. How many here can say the same? How many here can say the Lord has brought my life out of corruption? When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple. They that observed they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. So he's saying here that no matter how bad things appear, don't give up. when you lose all hope all hope when when you forsake the mercies of God that's when all hope is gone and a lot of times many times someone that commits a su suicide that's the number one thing is they just have no hope they think there's no one that can bring me out there's no way I can get past this you lose all hope and when you lose hope friends then things are really really bad, but you've never been in a situation like Jonah was right here. And yet, he still had hope in his prayer. &gt;&gt; Read it again. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. He's repenting here. He's saying, \"Lord, I'll do whatever it takes to make it right. I'll sacrifice to thee with a voice of thanksgiving. I'm not going to complain about anything, Lord. I'm going to I'm going to lift up my offering. I will pay that which I have vowed sal but salvation Lord is from you. And the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. So out of nowhere the worst you have this weward prophet and he goes and everyone suffers because of what he did. And then yet God turns this around. He turns his life around. And then he makes it a blessing. So much so that the people even on the ship, the pagans, the unbelievers, even they saw the power of God. And even they made sacrifices to the Lord. And Jonah goes preaches in Nineveh and they repent. And it's tremendous story of disobedience, tremendous story of prayer and how God we should never lose hope that God is always there to hear our prayer. Now remember I said that God can take a mistake a dire mistake that we make an embarrassing mistake maybe something that we just Lord I can't believe I did it. I I I did I did this so wrong. And God can take that mistake if we repent. And he can turn it around to make it more of a blessing than if we would have never done it. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened with Jonah. Now watch this. Jesus in Matthew chapter 12, the Pharisees and the Sadducees asked Jesus to show them a sign. Jesus was always chiding back and forth with him. You know, same thing with just like Jonah, they wanted Jesus to fall in line to preached, but Jesus wouldn't do it. So, they say, \"Okay, well, show us a sign, you know, then then we'll believe you.\" Matthew 12:38, listen to this. Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answering, saying, \"Master, we would see a sign from thee.\" But he answered and said unto them, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall shall rise in judgment with this generation. These are the people that Jonah preached to. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment to this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas. And behold, a greater than Jonas is here. &gt;&gt; Speaking of himself, how beautiful. Jesus wasn't remembering. Josiah and the worship team can come in closing. Jesus was not remembering the mistakes of Jonah. Really, it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness. And he doesn't remember our mistakes either. But he can take that mistake and make it a prophecy from the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, our savior, through Jonah's mistake. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous story this is. Jonah does all of these things wrong and yet God turns it around and says, \"It's just like my son's going to be in the grave for three days and he's going to raise up again just as Jonah came out of the whale. again, Matthew. And then he goes and he repeats it. Matthew 16 verse1, I'm sorry, Matthew 16:4. A wicked and adulter adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And there shall be no sign given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them and departed. Jonah would have done better for himself to set aside his way of thinking and follow the leading of the Lord. But he did what all of us do. He put himself there. He put his understanding there. This makes sense. Why would God want this? This is how it should be. Proverbs 3:5 says, \"Trust not trust the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding. In all your ways, submit to him and he will make your path straight.\" It's the hardest thing, friends. This is the hardest thing in the world is for us to lay aside our own way of thinking. Lay aside really our own religion, which is what required Jo Jonah had to do. Lay aside those things and seek God. Pray to God. Lord, how do you want to handle this situation? Husband and a wife. My friend was praying about homeschooling. They should have got together and prayed, \"Lord, we want to do what's right. Let us just surrender ourselves to you as Jonah did on the ship when it was a dire need. Lord, let us just have your will. Let us do your will.\" And then we can rest assured that no matter how how many mistakes we make, no matter how bad things get, no matter how hopeless things seem, that God will hear our prayers and he will take these things and make it a blessing to others. And it may be that we're all in this ship and there may be some Jonases among us, but friends, if we could just surrender, then it'll be a blessing to the whole ship. Amen. Little Josiah. Let's sing in his time. In his time. In his time he makes all things beautiful in his time. [Music] Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your time. [Music] Yes. In his time. In his time. He makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your time. In your time. In your time. In your time you make all things beautiful in your time. [Music] Lord, my life to you I bring. Each song I have to sing be to you a lovely thing in your Let's sing that again. Let's stand together. In your time. In your time. You make all things beautiful in your time. [Music] Lord, my life to you I bring. May each song to you I sing. be to you a lovely thing in your time. [Music] Remember brothers and sisters, this life is not of all about you. And every decision that you make, it doesn't just affect you. It affects everyone around you. And it you can either have a positive influence and do great good or you can have a negative influence and do great harm. And it's dependent on what you say. It's dependent on what you do. It's depend dependent on the decisions that you make. If you can get yourself out of the way and truly come into the presence of God like Jonah did in the belly of the whale, coming into the presence of God and truly repenting and truly saying, \"Lord, you are you are great. You are everything.\" Let me read again what Jonah said. I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me. Can you imagine? Can you really imagine if God hears? We take prayer for granted. It's just a few words in Jesus name. Amen. That's not prayer really. Enter. Enter into the presence of God. Enter into the presence of the creator. Enter into this presence of this one, this all knowing one that can do all things. Enter into his presence and then to say the same thing that Jonah said and he heard me. Can you imagine if he really hears a sincere prayer? Nothing could stand before our prayers. If we are truly in the presence of God, out of the belly of hell, cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou has cast me into the deep, into the midst of the seas, and the flood compass about me about. All thy billows, and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. The waters compassed me about even to the soul. The depth closed me round about. The weeds were wrapped about my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with her bars was about me forever. Yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption. Oh Lord my God. When my soul faintth within me, I remember the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy, but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving. That can be our sacrifice. Lord, I give to you my voice. I give to you my prayers. I give to you my thanks. I give to you, Lord. This is my sacrifice that I say thank you, oh God. I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. And then the Lord spake to the fish and Jonah was delivered. Can you imagine friends actually speaking to that one? When we come into his presence, come reverently. He's not your buddy. He is someone that deserves our reverence and deserves everything that we can give him. Lord, I come to you in the name of your son Jesus Christ. I am a sinner. You are my savior. You are my creator. I come to you, Lord, and here is what I have need of. Lord, I pray that you would put me in your perfect will as you did Jonah. Let's bow our heads. Friends, think on these things. Think how all of us have been in Jonah's position that we've taken our own way. We've taken our own ideas and we've done nothing but suffer for them. But if we could just lay our lives before the Almighty in prayer as Jonah did, then we can trust in him that he will provide. He'll provide our families. He'll forgive our sins. He'll provide fellowship. He'll provide a husband. He'll provide a wife. He'll provide children if we could just get ourselves out of the way and truly approach him. Lord God, [Music] Lord, the thought is overwhelming that we can come into the presence of the almighty God. Lord, it is written in your word, wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in the midst of them. Lord, the best that we can, we gather here this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, lay our lives down before you might, Father, serve you from this day forward that we might have a change in our lives and and serve, Father, you serve your people. And may the influence that's given to each of us that each of us have, Father, may that influence be to point others to a living God as Jonah appointed those people on that ship and also those people of Nineveh and they repented. Father, may we have the same. We pray. Lord, forgive us of our shortcomings. We ask, Lord, we look our our hearts and our minds and everything that's in us. as we look to you and we thank you Lord for your love. And Lord, just to think that we could say what Jonah said that we cried to the Lord and he heard. Dear God, may it be so. We love you in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Josiah. [Music] Psalms 34. Brother T. Think of these words, friends, are written by King David as a prayer to the Lord. Listen to this. I sought the Lord and he answered me and deliver me from every fear. Those who work on here are radant. They'll never be ashamed. They'll never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; This poor man cried. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This poor man cry. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord heard me and save me from my enemies. The son of God surrounds his saints. He will deliver them. He will deliver them. Oh, magnify the Lord with me. God exalts his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Oh, taste and see. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That the Lord is good. Oh, blessed he who hides in. Oh, fear the Lord. Oh, all you saints. He'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He wants to give us everything. Magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. [Music] And let us bless the Lord, every day and night, neverending praise. May our incense rise. Let us bless the Lord [Music] every day and night. Neverending praise. May our incense rise. Let us bless the Lord every day and night. ever ending praise. May our incense ride. Let us bless the Lord every day night. Neverending praise. May our incense rise. Magnify the Lord with me. Oh, come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come it's all to stay forever. Oh magnify magnify the Lord with me. Oh come exalt his name together. [Applause] Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Just our voices now. Oh, magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name. Together glorify the Lord with me. &gt;&gt; Come exalt his name forever. Oh, taste and see &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; He'll give you everything. &gt;&gt; He'll give you everything. &gt;&gt; He'll give you everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. and he wants to give us. He wants us to be in the same page as him. And let me tell you, he cares. He loves us and he cares. He cares more than anybody else does. And he's real and he's watching us. God bless you, friends. Remember, no service tonight. Brother Josiah, do you have another Huh? I I wanted I never like I know that the anointing is on our song leaders and I never want to step in front of them and I believe Josiah had a song in his heart and I wanted him to sing it. Go ahead. The blood that Jesus shed for me way back on Calary. The blood that gives you strength from day to day. It won't never lose its power. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again. The blood. &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood that Jesus shed for me. Oh, hallelujah. Way back on Calary. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose its power. For it reaches to the highest mountain. Oh, and it flows to the lowest valley. Even to the bottom of the ocean it flows. Oh, the blood that gives me strength. From day to day, it will never lose its power. It suits. It soothes my doubts and calms my fears. Oh, and it dries all my tears. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It'll never lose its power for it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest [Music] valley. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. It'll never lose its powerful. It reaches war. It reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest valley. The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It'll never lose its power. It'll never lose. Oh, it will never lose its power. Sing that again. Oh, it will never lose. Just one more time. It's power. One last time. &gt;&gt; Oh, it will never lose. It's time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. [Music] Remember, no service this evening. Lord willing, we'll see you all on Wednesday. God bless you, friends. Remember, seek the Lord and he'll take care of you and he can change. He can make all wrongs right. He can give light to a dark world. He can do all things. and we can do all things through him that strengthens us. God bless you.

You know, it's I like that first. You know, life here is grand and it is. It's wonderful to be a Christian, but when everything goes, we can go to him. Oh, living below in this old sinful world, hardly a comfort can afford. Striving alone to face temptation. Go. Where could I go but to the Lord? Oh, where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? And neighbors are kind. I love them. Everyone we get along in sweet a cold. But when my soul needs mana from above, where could I go but to the Lord? Oh, where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to alone? And life here is grand with friends I love so dear. Comfort I get from God's own word. And yet when I face the chilling hand of death, where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Needing a refuge for my soul. Brother Ed, if you would come on up in the end, where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? Brother Ed is is going to share a request that they have and also open in prayer. [Music] Good evening. God bless you. the request um most of you already know it's for our sister-in-law Susan Lupicar um brother France's wife she's due to have surgery next week u from what we been told it's going to be a very long and very delicate operation so would I know we would appreciate your prayers and I know France and the family would truly cherish your prayers so if you'll keep that in your heart pray for him. Um, it's a battle. Uh, she was diagnosed with a a had a tumor. It's cancerous and they don't know the full extent, but I know who I believe in. So, let's um place let's keep her in the the hands of the great physician. Do you have something that you'd like the Lord to meet with an uplifted hand? Let's go to the Lord.

There where I'm going is I'm going to get to see him. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face. and sister hope when we finish this if you'll make ready to come up. I'm sorry I had the wrong song in mind. As I journey through the land, singing as I go, pointing souls to Calvary, to the crimson flow. Many arrows pierce my soul from without. But my Lord leads me on. Through him I must wind. And oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face there to sing forever of his saving grace. On the streets of glory, let me lift my voice. Cares all past home at last ever to rejoice when in service for my Lord. Dark may be the night, but I'll cling more close to him. He will give me light. Satan snares may vex my soul.

But God gives a song in the night season and all the day long. Sometimes on the mountain where the sun shines so bright, God leads his dear children alone. Sometimes in the valley and darkest of night my dear children belong. Some through the waters, some through the flame, some through the fire, but all through the night, some through great sorrow. But God gives a song in the night season and all the day long. No sorrows before us and Satan leads his dear children along. By grace we can coner, defeat our foes. life his dear children alone.

Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood. Some great sorrow, but God gives a song in the night cease and all the day. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Amen. just reminds me of something I was watching the other probably I think it was National Geographic the mother bear leading her little cubs across the street crossing the road and she stops and she looks back and they're not paying a lot of attention. They're running around but she stayed there until they came over. Sometimes we go this way he goes that way but he's still watching over us. Do appreciate that. You know, I know who holds tomorrow and I know he holds my hand. I don't know. I just live from day to day. I don't borrow from it sunshine. for its skies may turn to gray. I don't worry. Your birth of future for I know what Jesus said. And today I'll walk beside him. for he knows what is ahead. Many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand. But I know who holds tomorrow. And I know he holds my hand. Every step is getting bright. As the golden stairs I climb, every birden's getting lighter. Every cloud is silver light. There the sun is always shining. There no tear will dim in the eyes at the ending of the rainbow where the mouth can touch the sky. many things about tomorrow. I don't seem to understand, but I know who holds tomorrow. And I know who holds my hand. I don't know about tomorrow. It may bring me poverty, but the one who feeds a sparrow is the one who stands by me. And the path that is my portion may be through the flame or flood. But his present go before me and I'm covered with his blood. many things about tomorrow. I don't seem to understand, but I know who holds tomorrow. And I know who holds my hand, Lord. Oh many things about tomorrow I don't see to understand but I know who holds my holds my hand. He's holding my hand every day. He's holding my hand and he's walking me on through it. A lot of times I don't notice that he's holding my hand, but then many times I'll look back and see where I've come from and I say, \"Yeah, Lord, you are holding my hand the whole way.\" God bless you, Brother Daniel. Good to see you on a Wednesday night. And then, Sister Stephanie there in the back, God bless you. It's good to see you. It's um we're we're a bit sparse tonight on this Wednesday night. There's a lot of people missing. Um, do pray for I forgot to mention uh Lionel and Lonnie Salazar. They're up in the fire and they're providing support, but that's a monstrous fire up on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. So, please remember them when you're praying. And I did mention uh Eric Davis, also this young man that uh Sister Mercy Samurano's grandson. He's incarcerated in Yuma and the family would really like to get him here to Tucson so they can visit him and he's he's been there's just some fearful things in prison. There's there's gangs there and he's not doesn't really feel like he's quite fitting in. So, he uh he would appreciate the prayers. He's lost about 20 pounds. It's just it's been hard on him. But like I said in my my broadcast this morning, Jonah made some bad decisions. One particular bad decision that caused all kinds of problems, but then God turned it around and he made it a great blessing. So I pray that uh this Eric Davis um I met him. I I um would visit him when he was here in the in the jail and um he he's just he needs to change his life around. And I believe that this was the mercy of God has done it. And uh I believe he's a son of God with all my heart. And I just can't wait to see him out and serving the Lord. And uh I'm looking forward to seeing miracles in his life. So don't don't forget to pray for uh Brother Eric Davis. And um I uh happy to have my little girl here. She's [Applause] she's holding my grandbaby until the end of December and then she's going to let us hold it. Good to see you, sweetheart. Nice. Nice to have you here. Um Maline came in for my grandma's funeral that's going to be this um she got here early. Uh we had to put the funeral off till next Friday, but she wanted to be with the family. And Sister Wheeler, 98 years old. Brother Wheeler, my grandpa was a deacon in Brother Brandham's church. They um just I'll tell you what I've ever if I've ever seen an example of how a Christian should live. I see that in my grandpa and my grandpa Wheeler. They were just I mean perfect is is pretty a high level, but they were as perfect as a human can be. I think just wonderful, wonderful people. A lot of love and love the Lord Jesus with all their hearts. and the Lord has seen fit after 98 years to take grandma home. So that will and and everybody's welcome. We're going to have just a short graveside funeral next Friday. Not this Friday, but next Friday at um East Lawn Palms funeral. It's not even in the funeral home. It's going to be right at the graveside. So um if uh if you'd like to go, you're welcome to. I'll be officiating and I'll just minister just a short message and uh we will put grandma to rest with the promise that she is going to rise again um for tonight for our brother Josiah. He's I'm looking forward to hearing him speak. I usually choose the topics that we we minister on on Wednesday night and I'll choose a series um whether it be the Bible or you know from book by book or whether it be the book of Acts. Um we lately been on David and Saul but I wanted Josiah just to feel at liberty and I told him just minister what's on your heart. I was I've been thinking about getting into the book of Timothy and I Josiah kind of reminds me of Timothy in the Bible and and I said, you know, you could you could go through his life, you go through Timothy or just whatever whatever is on your heart. And brother Josiah, he had it on his heart um to minister on uh a Christian is and a Christian does. And I'm looking forward to him. Brother Josiah, if you could uh make ready. I think that we're going to be blessed. I want to give our young men a chance to come up and and minister. And and Josiah is he's very knowledgeable in the word and he he he's always quoting Bible verses to me and I can see a deep understanding in the young man and I'm very much looking forward to hearing him tonight. So, let's all stand. Welcome our brother Josiah. He usually stands before us and leads us in worship. And now he's going to lead us in expounding on the word. Brother Aaron told me that he was looking through the website and he saw Josiah Ao ministering and Daniel Evans leading worship. You laugh. You think that's funny, Sister Elizabeth. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; I told him I was looking forward to this service. &gt;&gt; But Aaron said he was looking forward to this service. So, no, that was a typo. I forgot Junior on the back on the back of Daniel. But God bless you, brothers and sisters. It's my honor to introduce our young brother Josiah to come up here and expound upon the word of the Lord. Yes, brother Aaron, if you could lead us. All to Jesus I surrender. Oh, to him I free. I will ever look and trust in his presence day. I surrender all. I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all. Last the very last verse. [Music] All to Jesus I surrender now I feel the sacred flame. Oh the joy of full salvation. Glory gloryy to him. Surrender all. I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior. I surrender. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Make it your prayer this evening. Oh, I lift my hands, bow my knees in worship at your throne. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Let's sing that again. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. right now. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Oh, I lift my hands. I bow my knees in worship at your throne. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for this Wednesday night service. Thank you for everyone that's here, Lord Jesus, and everyone that's streaming. Thank you for this building full of wonderful air conditioning that we have, Lord, these pews, this piano, this church, Lord. Let us never be ungrateful for what we have, Lord Jesus. Lord, I've heard it said, if we never got anything else given to us this life, we'd still have so much to be thankful for. We couldn't we couldn't thank you enough for how much you've blessed us. Thank you, Lord, for all you do, Lord. Truly, tonight, we need you. Each one of us needs you. I need you tonight, Lord Jesus. If your presence would be here with us tonight, that's all that matters, Lord. We thank you for all these things in Jesus name. Amen. You can all have your seats. Thank you very much. We need him, don't we? Every day, every day of our lives. You know what we don't need is these. We think a lot of times that we need them and I understand for work and many things, but I I want to tell a story. We were just camping and um I asked my dad one time about their camping trips as a kid. He said they would go to Lake Diablo in Washington and Baker Lake. There's two beautiful crystal blue lakes in Washington. And my grandpa would go first the night before. I don't know why they always did this, but this is what their system would be. He would he would go first and they would always get the campsites that you had to take a boat to. My grandpa loved doing stuff hard. He was an archery hunter. And when they camped, he liked to have to park on the side of the road and then take a boat across the lake to the campsite. And they have those spots. You can only get to them by boat. So, my grandpa would go the day before and the next day my grandma would come with the kids and sometimes my dad would go with my grandpa to help set up. And my grandpa would get there and I thought to myself, \"So, did did grandma know exactly on the road where to go? Did she see the truck?\" No. Because the truck was actually parked a little ways up, so it's not clear where you cross. Well, you didn't have phones, so how did she find you? And my dad said, my grandpa literally stood on the other side of the lake, a mile away, with a mirror, and when he saw her car coming, he flashed the mirror and she stopped. Let me just say, we don't need these. They figured it out. They It worked. They were able to do it. And I said, \"My grandpa's incredible. how on and my grandma for seeing a a flash from the road, a tiny little mirror a half a mile away has nothing to do with what I'm talking about tonight. It just it relaxes me to tell a story before we get started. So, um I told brother Daniel that that was my title. Uh what a Christian is and what a Christian does. So, we're going to read when you're reading about what a Christian is and what a Christian is supposed to do. Um, what a where where better to start than Psalms. So, let's start in Psalms 19. Last time I spoke for a few minutes on a Sunday night and I did Psalms 1 and I've just been going through the Psalms and Psalms 19 was one that I spent a great deal of time on. And so we're going to go through a couple verses here and let's go to the very last verse. Psalms 19:14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Let's read that again. Let's read it together. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. This is a prayer as are a lot of the psalms. And I want to start first by saying um saying what this does not say. This does not say accept me as I am or Lord receive me like this or I'm going to do my thing and the Lord will just understand me. That's not what it says. It can be misinterpreted to mean that. But on the other on the other extreme, those are obviously wrong. Obviously, we know that's not what it's saying. But on the other extreme, it's not saying if my words are righteous enough, he'll receive me. And it's not saying, \"Lord, look at my good faith or hear how I word my prayers so perfectly.\" It's saying, \"Change me to line up with you. Change me, oh God.\" And it's it's almost desperate. Lord, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart just be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. David is saying, \"Change me. Change my way of thinking. Change my way of speaking to be pleasing to you, to line up with you. And not only the words I speak, change what I think in my heart, change what I feel in my heart, the things I that come from within. Change those. Because we can all change the way we talk. But he's saying, Lord, change me from within. Change what change what I can't change. Lord, may may the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight. That's the change. Change me, oh God. So, you can look back at the previous verse. Let's go back to verse 13. When I was reading through this, this chapter kind of made sense to me when I went to the end and went backwards. This is a trick I I have. My brain might just be off. But brother Biscll told us one time, he's my pastor growing up. He told us, \"If you don't understand a verse, sometimes skip to the end and then go backwards. Read that verse, get it in your head, and then go back to the one and go back.\" And sometimes, you know, if you don't understand it the one way, you can get it going back. So, we just read about the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart. So the verse before, keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. Again, this is a this is a request. This is a prayer. This is Lord, help me. Things that are obviously sins, I need help, Lord, that they won't have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright and shall be innocent from the great transgression. Let them not have dominion over me. This is one that has recognized something. They recognize that they can't do these things on their own strength and rather than relying on their own strength, I'll rely on his. That's always the better route. So now let's go back to verse seven. This isn't a usual pattern of ways. We'll read it the right way after, but uh the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. We hear a lot about the law and how there's the letter of the law and we don't have to live by the law. We have grace and we don't have to think about the law. It says the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul. So the law of the Lord is perfect not because we're robots and it gets programmed in us and we have no choice but because it's actually the intent is to change from within. converting the soul and the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. So, if I could say it like this, um, this has a track record of working. If you read it in the Amplified, it says something like, um, you can count on this. It it has a specific word that it's reliable. says it has a track record of working for people who maybe nothing else works in your life. This works. This works. The law of the Lord, it converts the soul. It goes beyond just memorizing, just knowing and it goes to the goes to the heart and it goes to the soul and it makes it makes dummies like me even a little more wise. Verse eight. Am I putting you to sleep yet? Okay. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. And though we say, and maybe we really do believe that we would trust the Lord blindly, this verse says his commandments bring understanding. says they enlighten the eyes. You will actually understand he this this is to help you understanding. We can have times when we don't understand and the Lord wants us to trust him. I believe in that. But this says it enlightens the eyes. This will bring you understanding. This will help you and it helps us to understand his heart. So why should I trust him is a question someone could ask. Verse nine, the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. Can you say that about any politician or judge or officer as just as they may be? Their judgments are true and righteous altogether. Verse 10. More to be desired are they than gold. Judgments, statutes, commandments, they're more to be desired than gold. Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. I could say this isn't like any earthly principle or law I've ever heard of. Perfect judgments, never failing, better than money, better than pleasure. And this isn't even in the context of eternal life. This is to help you on earth. This is to help you in your earthly journey. This is something and the verse says it's better than money. It will be more helpful in your life's journey to fear the Lord and keep his commandments. Money isn't as good as this. As I said, pleasure won't help you like this well like this will. And verse 11 says, \"Also, or moreover, by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.\" Having this in your mind, heart, and soul will help you do the right things. You if you just read through the Psalms many times, it's about meditation. It's about praying. It's about thinking about these things. God did not intend for us to just rely on going to church on Sunday or whatever outlet you have to plug into. If you don't have that outlet to plug into, it's written on your heart. If you meditate on these things, when something comes up in the spur of the moment and you have it so near and dear to your heart, that's why David was a man after God's own heart. He said the law of the Lord, it converts the soul. It changes you from within. This is deeper, like I said, than just coming to church. This should be written on every believer's heart. And we should be thinking about it. And I said earlier, why should we why should we trust him? In keeping of them, there is great reward. This is something. There's commandments with promise that your days may be long on the earth, but beyond that into eternal life, keeping this, there is great reward. I I really hope you didn't come to hear something deep tonight. This is just reading what I believe God's prophet wrote here in the in the book of Psalms, thinking about each word. Is that okay? Is that all right? having this in your mind, heart, soul. Amen. Verse 12. Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults? So that first question, who can understand his errors? Confuse me at first. Because it's not talking about the Lord. It's not saying who can understand his errors. It's saying what person can understand their own mistakes without something to without a lighthouse, without something to point them to what's right. Um, one that happens to me almost weekly at least if I'm working is um if I am finishing a job and I want to take the short route almost always the scripture do everything as as unto the Lord. And I want to just take the shortcut. I don't need to sprinkle sand on this part. I did the entire area. I can leave out this corner because I'm tired. It's hot. I want to go home. And then it always hits me. No, do this job as if you're doing this job for Jesus. As if whatever whatever your work is, as if the person or whatever you're serving is literally for the Lord. That's an example of who can understand his errors. If if you don't have something to point you to what's right, many people would say, \"Hey, there's nothing wrong with taking the shortcut.\" And and maybe there isn't. Maybe there isn't. But it always comes to my mind. I need to be doing this as unto the Lord. And then cleanse thou me from secret faults. And then we're about to get back to where we started, but cleanse thou me from secret faults. The more I thought about it, the more it made me just want to fall on my knees and say, \"Lord, I'm so sorry.\" Think about the things you might not even know that were displeasing to the Lord in your life, in my life. Lord Jesus, I'm so sorry. I don't even know something maybe I didn't do that I was supposed to do. And then the next verse says to the other extreme, \"Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, from obvious wrongs, from things that are clearly wrong, clearly I messed up, both extremes, the things that I didn't even know I did wrong. And Lord, the things obviously wrong. Let them not have dominion over me.\" That's a good prayer. Let these things, Lord, you know I struggle with this. Let it not have dominion over me. And then I shall be innocent. I shall be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. I just want to say for a minute um James 5:16, cleanse thou me from secret faults. Um, it says uh in James 5 verse 16, I think it's a habit I have because I lead songs that I wait for them to put the scripture up on the screen before I go. I can't read it. It's right here. I can read it, but I just wait for the next verse. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another that ye may be healed. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And the verse in Psalms that we just read says, \"Cleanse me from secret faults.\" It's interesting that James 5:16 says, \"Confess your faults. Tell others you messed up.\" And uh this doesn't necessarily mean you always have to go around telling everybody what a horrible person you are, but to your brothers and sisters here at church that you can rely on, you can count on each other. what you're struggling with. You can be honest when you make a mistake. And it's actually when you read this, it doesn't seem it doesn't feel like a con like a like a suggestion. It it feels kind of like a confess your faults one to another and pray for one another. Be there to listen to when somebody needs to talk and then pray for one another. It doesn't say go talk about it to the other ones in the church. Pray for your brother. Pray for your sister that you may be healed. Um, I've heard it said before, uh, that the line of people to criticize is really long, and the line of people to gossip is really long, and the line of people to sympathize is a lot shorter, and the line of people to help is almost empty. What a shame. We should be hitting our knees immediately when we know that somebody is struggling. That should be and it's saying this is like vinegar for me because I'm so guilty of this. Just, oh man, did you hear about this? And it's like I haven't even prayed for that person yet and I'm already spreading this. That's not how we should be. It says confess your faults to one another and pray one for another that you may be healed. And we do the exact opposite. Uh I think somebody maybe said this here, maybe brother Daniel a while back and it stuck with me. As humans, we do the opposite of confessing our faults. We tell each other all the good things that we've done and all the things that make us look so great and the things that elevate us. And we hide our flaws and we hide our mistakes and we hide our failures. We hide the wrongs we do because we want to make ourselves look good. How many of you have ever lied to make yourself look good? And if you don't have your hand up, you're lying to make yourself look good. Jesus said not to do that. Jesus said, \"Don't let your right hand know what your left hand do.\" He said, \"Don't let your arms be seen in front of other people. Uh, don't do good to make yourself look good or look more righteous. That's exactly what the Pharisees did. Show everyone all the good things you do. James literally says the opposite. Tell them how you messed up. Be brutally honest and how much you need their prayer. And you have now you have a deeper connection. And now it it really I believe it brings so much unity in a church when you can just be vulnerable with each other. Um there's a lot of power in the tongue when we gossip or when we say good or when we pray for someone. There's a lot of power in the tongue and I believe you can you can stay bound or you can be free a lot of times depending on if what you say or what you don't say. I really believe that. You know, let me just say Satan holds us captive by fear by keeping things in. We become afraid of what will happen if our sin is exposed. But exposing it is the best way to get rid of it, I believe. Can I tell the story? Um, he might he was maybe going to tell it, so I'll I'll tell the story. Um, I heard it growing up. His brother Biscoll would tell it. Maybe you've heard it. It's concerning a meeting he was in in uh northern British Columbia. Is it okay? Okay. Um, and he was sitting on the platform and brother Brandham was preaching and they were coming to the end of the service and they didn't have a prayer line that night. Uh but the anointing came and brother Brandham was calling people out in the service and people were being healed and brother Bisll sitting was sitting back here and he said a lot of the people were people from his church and he knew the problems and he'd hear one thing said he'd say that's correct and he'd hear time after time people he knew things they were dealing with and then in the middle of a song They're singing I love him. I I would have actually prepared better and played the section, but in the middle of the song, he says, \"What's the matter, soldier boy?\" Maybe a lot of you have heard this story. And he says, \"You're not going to commit suicide.\" In the middle of a song, and you can hear on the tape, everybody stops singing. It's quiet. All of a sudden, they're You can even hear they're like looking for the soldier boy. You can hear like rustling around. He says, \"You're not going to commit suicide. The devil's a lying to you.\" He says, \"You have a a phobia, and if you let if you let him, he'll drive you insane.\" I'm not quoting exactly, but he says, \"If he'll drive you insane if you believe him.\" He says, \"Deny him, renounce the devil, accept Jesus Christ as your healer, and you'll go home, and you'll be a gentleman, and you'll be a real man.\" And then they just carry on with the service and nothing else happens. So it was brother Biscll's job that weekend to take brother Brandham on a rest up into the mountains to go hunting. And they go up there and they're driving down the Alaskan Highway and they're already in Dawson Creek, which if you've been in northern British Columbia, that's pretty much in the middle of nowhere as it gets. And then beyond that's just even more. and they come to a town, I think it was called Fort Nelson, and they decided to get something to eat. They're hundreds of miles up the Alaskan Highway in the middle of nowhere. This is the last town before they're going to get to the ground where they're going to hunt. So, this is out there, but there's a little town cuz when the Alaskan Highway was built, they just pushed it right through the wilderness and then little businesses opened up on the side of the highway. So, they stop at this restaurant and they sit down to have lunch and it's uh three of them and they order something to eat and then in walks this man and uh this man wearing a US Army tunic and brother Bisll recognized him as this soldier boy from the service and he said, \"Fancy seeing you here.\" And then the man that was with him ran over to the table and thrust his hand down in front of front of brother Brandham and said, \"Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham.\" And he said, \"Uh, do you remember calling out the soldier boy? Do you remember saying what you said to the soldier boy?\" And he's frantically speaking. Frantically speaking, \"Uh, do you remember what you said?\" And brother Brennham said, \"I don't I don't remember. Do you remember, Brother Biscll?\" And he said, \"Yeah, I remember. You said that he's not going to commit suicide.\" And that was the devil talking to you. And he said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what you said. That's what you said. And he said, \"This is him.\" He said, \"He came all the way from Fairbanks and we wanted to get him in the prayer line, but we couldn't get him a prayer card.\" And he said, \"I believed that we would find you today.\" And then the soldier boy spoke up and said, \"Yeah, this man actually believed.\" And he said it, Brother Biscll said he said it in such unbelief. He said, \"Yeah, this guy actually believed that we would find you today.\" And I've heard brother Bisl tell the story many times. He said you could drop a pin in that spot. He said you could go 500 miles down the Rocky Mountain trench and maybe find a trapper and you could go however many hundred miles in the other direction and find a logger maybe or a or a trapper or or something. He said this was a true needle in a hay stack. And he said in the middle the fact that they ended up in the same place absolute miracle. So back to the this man is frantically speaking and he says, \"Will you pray for him?\" And brother Brandham said, \"Oh, sure. Of course, I'll pray for him.\" And he said, \"Let's just eat our lunch first.\" So they eat their lunch and they leave and as they're walking out, they meet out front and the soldier boy says, \"Just two minutes, brother Ben.\" And so they walk to the end of the sidewalk and brother Biscll, Brother Chris, and this other man walk and give them space and this man is frantically speaking to Brother Biscll. He says he's he's tried to commit suicide three times. He's got a wife and two beautiful children. Nobody knows what's wrong with him. Nobody knows what's going on. He came down here so we could get him in the meetings. And brother Daniel has a side to the story that maybe he'll share. And nobody knows what's wrong with him. He's tried to commit suicide. And brother Biscll's hearing this and he's watching Brother Brandham. And brother Brandham takes off that hat that is you see in a lot of the photos and puts it over his heart. He knew he was praying then. And then he turns around, brother Brandham and the soldier boy and start walking back. And the soldier boy goes like this with his fist in the air three times and says, \"I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.\" Walking back to the car and he gets back and they're in a little group. And he says, \"This man told me something that I and my wife in this world know and no one else. And as soon as he told me, I was free.\" before they even prayed. He said, \"As soon as he told me, I was delivered.\" And so they had a little conversation there and then they had to get in their car and head their way. And brother Biscll and they had to get in the car and go hunt. So they get in the car and leave. Brother Brenham says, \"Brother Eddie, do you know this man?\" He says, \"No, no, I don't know this man.\" He said, ' Have you ever seen him? Is he any kind of a friend? No, I've never seen him. He's He's no kind of a friend. He said, ' Do you think you'll ever see him again? He said, \"No, no, he lives in Fairbanks and I live in Vancouver. That's 1600 miles. I don't I don't think I'll ever see him again.\" And he said, \"If he was your friend, I would never tell you.\" He said, \"But when we were at the end of the sidewalk,\" This is Brother Brandham speaking. He said, \"When we were at the end of the sidewalk, he came to us there and he told us that he had a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children.\" That's the exact same words that the man had just spoke to Brother Biscll. He said, \"He has a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children, but he's been committing homosexual acts with young men.\" And as soon as that was told to him, Satan lost his power. And the boy went away free. He never prayed for they did pray together, but he said the exposing of the sin is what freed that man. And all those years with that covered up and coming to the point three times where he was going to commit suicide. And when that sin was exposed, he was free. Do you see why God gave us a church? A people we could talk to each other. People we could hold each other accountable. We could rely on each other. We hold things we hold things in and it does us harm. And it sears our conscience and it it causes a friction that if we would just talk to someone, obviously talk to the Lord. I'm not saying we don't confess these things to the Lord. If we would just open up and rely on the church that we have around us, we'd be free so many times. That's why we need a church. That's why it's not I'll just stop right there. That's why you can't stay home on Wednesday night. people. When we come to that point of humility, God is faithful to help us. He wants us to be he wants us to be free. He wants us to be holy like him. He gives us understanding of right and wrong. Helps us to do good instead of e evil. And then he writes it on our hearts so that we carry it wherever we go. and we carry it out of this life. Even let's read the last verse again. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. So I the title tonight was a Christian is and a Christian does. What is a Christian is the question. I said all that to get to this. What is a Christian? Someone who prays to Jesus. Someone who reads their Bible. Someone who forgives. Someone who repents from their sin? Someone who tries to live holy? Is it someone who's honest? Is it someone who shares the gospel with others? Is it someone who stands up for truth? Is it someone who would give their life even for the gospel? Maybe. Is it someone that goes to church like we just said, participates in church, pays tithes, gives to God? Is it someone humble? Is it someone like Job? It says Job assued evil. He was a man that assued evil. Someone that obeys the golden rule. Is it someone who exalts others, lifts others up, encourages others? Somebody giving, somebody with faith, somebody with love and joy, somebody who memorizes scriptures, which I encouraged all of that tonight when we were reading through the Psalms. Is it this poster boy for Christianity? Yes. Yes. Yes. But also, no, no, no. These are all things that a Christian does. This is not what a Christian is. A Christian is, just to back up, a Christian is a human. It can't be an angel. They have to be alive or shall I say born. Unless one is born, you can put John 3 verse three up. Unless one is born of water and spirit. So you're born naturally. And we have this scene where this teacher of the law, he probably knew that psalm we just read. He probably knew it. He probably had it memorized because they didn't have phones and stuff. He probably had it memorized. And Jesus says to him, you know, just in casually, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Simple, right? Well, no, it's not simple because Nicodemus said, \"What on earth are you talking about? Born again? Can I enter a second time into my mother's womb and be born again?\" So then Jesus steps back. He says, \"Okay, yes, yes, yes. Unless someone's born of water, born naturally, and born of the spirit. So he's saying these are two different things. They cannot see the kingdom of heaven. And Nicodemus says in verse 9, \"How can these things be?\" And Jesus says, \"Art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things? Have you not read the Psalms about how your heart's going to be changed? The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. There's this whole thing called the Old Testament that talked about this for generations and you're a teacher of Israel and you don't even understand this. Said, if I'm talking of earthly things, which I feel like Jesus said it, so I can't argue, but I feel like this isn't an earthly thing, that this is a heavenly thing. But he said, \"If I tell you of earthly things and you don't understand that, how are we going to get to the deep stuff? How are we going to get beyond this?\" Unless one is born of water and of spirit, they cannot see the kingdom of heaven. So that's what a Christian is. It's someone who's born again. And like I said, Jesus clarifies, you're born first of water, then you're born of the spirit. And he says, you're a teacher of Israel. This is taught in the scripture. A Christian is someone who's born again. So if I could say this just as we close, no matter how good you look or how religious you may be, how many quotes you know, how well you know this book maybe, it doesn't make a difference if you're not born again. And on the flip side, how wretched you may be and how filthy you may look and how sinful you may feel, if you're born again, it doesn't make a difference. Oh, glory to God. That he could take a sinner like me, wretched and vile, and all he has to do is put his spirit in my heart. I don't have to. Nothing came from me. It's from him. And now I'm a Christian. Because of that, Jesus stood before a woman that was married five times and he said, \"Someone that drinks of this water will be like a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" He wasn't talking to a churchgoer. He wasn't talking to somebody clean. Think of who he was talking to. He said, \"If you drink of this water, it'll be to you like a like a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" Whosoever, he says, drinks of this water. The musicians could come now. We're going to sing a song. I wonder sometimes when I was thinking about this, how much I forgot about the foundation of all this. That's really what this is. What a Christian is and what a Christian does. A Christian is born again. Would you stand with me? I would say if you haven't been born again, don't wait. Don't leave this building tonight without being born again, without being filled with his spirit. and that you could fulfill this scripture that you'd be like a well of water springing up into everlasting life. KFC, I will praise him. [Music] I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people [Music] for his blood has washed away each stain. Could you worship him for just a minute? Oh, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. [Music] Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each stain. Verse one. When I saw the cleansing fountain, oh wide for all my sin. I oy the spirit's ru. Oh, when he said, \"Wilt thou be clean?\" Will you praise him tonight? Just a little longer. Oh, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners. Give him glory, all ye people, for his blood has washed away each. And one more time, I will praise him. Oh, I will praise him. for sinners like they give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each stain. Amen. Amen. When brother Brandham was when he was up there in that restaurant and that man accepted his healing and he gave his heart to the Lord and was delivered. As brother Josiah said, it came from brother Brandham knowing something about him that no one else could know. And when brother Brandham received his commission, the angel told him that if you can get the people to believe you, then nothing would stand before your prayer, not even cancer. Now, that's misinterpreted and and and totally torn out of context and made into strange doctrines. But if you listen to it, if you can get the people to believe you, then nothing will stand before your prayer. That discernment that brother Brandham had, that gift that God sent through him was to help the people believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can imagine if someone told you the deepest secrets of your heart, you can imagine that that would give you faith to be to believe that must be God. No one could know the secrets of my heart. And it helped so many people that that gift came out. And it was a gift, friends. It was a gift for us. It was a gift for those people that were there in those meetings to help them believe, to help them receive their healing. But it all has different parts. Each part has its part to play. As brother Josiah said, he was talking about confessing our faults one to another. You know, don't tell the Jesus said things the exact opposite of the way that we think. You know, we tell everybody how great we are. Jesus said, \"No, tell everybody.\" Or James said, \"No, tell everybody how bad you are.\" And then Jesus said, \"If there's something good to be said about you, let someone else say it.\" &gt;&gt; It said that. It says that in the Psalms. I believe it's in the Proverbs. Jesus said it throughout the Bible. Let someone else say it. But we get it all mixed up. But do you see how God has a great economy working? He places one with this gift of discernment here to increase the people's faith. But let me tell you the backstory of that. My dad was in those meetings and he saw brother Brandham call out that boy, that young man. Before the meetings, dad was driving and he saw this guy hitchhiking on the road. He picked him up and he invited him to go to the meetings and it was that man. It was that soldier. [Music] So my dad got to my dad and my grandfather, my family got to play a part over here. Brother Bisl got to play a part over here. Brother Brandham got to play a part over here, but God got the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the man was delivered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful story. And if we friends, if we could just operate in the calling that God has given us. If we could just all just like a watch, you know, like the old watches, they had all these moving parts. If you take one part out, the watch stops working. If one part breaks, if this watch of the Tucson Tabernacle could just click and just everything could fire perfectly, then God, he could do great things. But we all need to get in get into the spirit of God. And as brother Josiah said, the whole thing he he talked about I love that way he closed. There's acting like a Christian. This is what a Christian does and this is what a Christian is. And a Christian is born again. Born of the spirit. We were born of blood and water at the beginning and then as the Lord was telling Nicodemus, you must be born again after that. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Father, what beautiful words from the psalmist. We thank you for our brother Josiah. Lord, thank you. young man studying the word and putting these things together, Lord, and just going verse by verse with this this psalm. How beautiful it was. What deep meaning that psalm has. Father, we thank you. Thank you for brother Josiah, Sister Katie, their dedication to young people. Lord, how rare is that in today's world? to young people serving us here at this church. We thank you for them. Lord, we thank you for your word. And most of all, Father, we thank you for your son, Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and ascended up to heaven and is at the right hand of the majesty on high. Lord, we thank you that the almighty God became flesh and dwelt and a man that lived a perfect life and then father gave his life for our sins. We thank you Lord. Thank you for your goodness.

want to if it's good to know the Lord isn't it First Timothy um chapter you know I believe it's chapter one I didn't put the chapter down let's maybe open our Bibles and look that up First Timothy [Music] I I was telling brother Dan I was just looking at it where Paul is saying here [Music] and I didn't write the verse down so the brothers are verses 12 to 17 so let's find that real quick here [Music] it's where Paul says Ah he says now unto the king eternal [Music] if you could find that here I didn't write the what chapter First Timothy one okay yeah and I just began to read that and I didn't realize that what Paul was speaking about is what brother Dan would be speaking of tonight this is Paul saying I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor an injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly and in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful sane and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners who I am chief I wonder how many times Paul went that through his mind how could I have persecuted God he had to live with that but he realized that God's forgiveness how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them that should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen I was sharing it with brother Dan and he goes well that's ax Paul I said yeah you're right just hadn't thought of it just share a little testimony and work yesterday there's a young man I've mentioned in Indian young man well he's older than I thought he was he just told me he's in his 40s he looks like in his he's in his 20s and I hadn't seen him for a while and we got into the same house we're both working so we got to talking with him a little bit and we began to talk about forgiveness and and accepting forgiveness and that was my thought to him is you know you have to accept it and there's I told him there's only one sin in the scripture that the Bible says there's no forgiveness to and that is if you blaspheme God I said you say he's not God I said but everything else is forgivable so we got to talking to a little bit about then I could see it was hurting because he was making comments but I'd fail the Lord I said we all fail him no it's not as a righteous one and it came to mind where the man that had run from the battle and he his best friend had gone to President Lincoln and asked for pardon for him and Lincoln just wrote it on a piece of paper and said this pardon this man and when his friend took it to him he said you're you're fooling me it always says this would be an official stationary would be it would be said by some dignitary it would be so he the man lost his life and then it was taken to court and the Court ruled a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a part and each one of us have got to believe that Lord you have forgiven me I can come into your presence and I just it made my heart glad and when he when he we got ready to leave I had to leave the job site he came over and he gave me a big hug and he said I just so needed that today and I said Lord you know we hadn't seen each other so I go from there to the next house down the road a little ways and I walk in and there's somebody in the that I don't recognize and he's taking some of the doors from our cabinets so I question him and he said well they're broken they're no good I said I know but why are you taking them I got to order them again I said well who are you because I have no idea who this guy is and he uh he says I I work for this company and I said well this is not your house your houses are across the street where two different companies working he said no you guys work for us I'm looking I said I've never seen you in my life you're a about a 20 year old kid that was my thought who are you so we got to talking and he walks out with the parts but he told me of another house so I go down to the other house and he's now taking Parts out of that house too and my first thought this guy's trying to steal stuff but I see his van his van is for the company that does cabinets but he picked up so sorry so I reached over and I said these are not yours don't take them and he got right into my face and said don't you ever touch anything or try to pull anything out of my hand got into my face right here and I walked out after then I said a little bit a few minutes ago I was testifying about the grace of God and over here I wanted to hit that guy and I had to say Lord help me he watches over us all the time you know and I appreciate God just teaching us lessons every day you know and sister Shirley I'm glad you can smile brother Jonathan said the sister that smiles all the time I said sister Shirley always smiling appreciate that but life is just beautiful you no issues no problems right so you can smile no you're like the rest of us but you love the Lord how many loves the Lord Jesus today he's good to all of us isn't he amen it's so good to know that I told Brother Dan for what happened on you know the robbers were there in the middle of his sermon when he stopped and as I said brother Dan my stomach turned as hard as yours when I was watching I said how could that happen but God is good he took control of the service and he does that for his children so as brother Dan prepares to come out here and sing a couple more songs you love him amen I'm amazed that he loves me [Music] for the Lord sometimes I don't know why you would love me but you do and I accept it foreign [Music] oh the only ones that don't get washed are the ones that don't confess so if there's some just say Lord I'm sorry [Music] impressions [Music] and my sins they're all washed away all my sins all that stand as we sing it one more time [Music] on my sins oh washed away my sins our washed away amen thank the Lord for that the flower heads Lord God we thank you for another opportunity to come and to read your word together father over the past 2000 years how many congregations have read these same words that I'll be reading tonight [Music] and how many people have been just blessed by what you have recorded here for us in this book of Acts father we're grateful that we have an opportunity once again together as they have through two thousand years and Lord we pray that the same Holy Spirit that penned this book of Acts through your servant we'll be here tonight we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all you can take your seeds I appreciate it brother Aaron he wasn't planning on well he didn't have a plan that he was going to read that scripture in first Timothy and we were back there and the scripture he read was actually a uh Paul testifying of Acts chapter 9. where he was struck down on the road to Damascus and and everything everything changed I am appreciate I appreciate I just as I was praying I just appreciate the honor to be able to read this read this book um again Sunday I've said it before Sunday is Mother's Day we're just gonna have one service on Sunday and uh Stephanie and I are working on something try to do a little something for the mothers so make sure when you come bring Mama and as as cousin Jonathan would say and uh and we'll have a good time and then on Friday we have a youth Gathering um we're going to concentrate on the younger ones some of the older ones have asked me is it okay if we come and I said sure what we'll do is we will for the upper room we'll leave the one side where the instruments are we'll leave those for the that for the older ones and we'll let the kids the younger ones go upstairs and use the games up there but we'll congregate here in the fellowship hall first and we'll have a Bible study and uh thanks to my friends there I think we have a special surprise for them um Jeremy and Angela God bless you um so yeah we'll be we'll be doing that on Friday night and that starts I believe we put on there at six o'clock so everybody's welcome um Paul on the road to Damascus he was he was struck down on this road he was going to destroy the new converts to keep this new ministry this new way to keep it isolated in this city of Jerusalem and it was starting to to spread out and a light Shone on Paul the light that Paul said was brighter than the sun blinded him he fell on his back blind and then the Lord Jesus spoke to him and he after the Lord had spoke to him and gave him his commission he stayed in Damascus he stayed blind there for three days brother Cedric God bless you I just saw you back there it's good to have you my brother um didn't he eat or drink for three days then a brother named ananias comes to him ananias sees the vision about going to this Saul of Tarsus and praying for him so ananias comes he prays for him Saul is healed of his blindness and then ananias baptizes him then he has a meal with the disciples and then we will start here in Acts chapter 9 verse 19 and let's read it says this and when he had received meat he was strengthened then Saul was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the son of God very important right away look at Paul's Ministry back then Saul he hadn't changed his name yet Saul's Ministry back then look at what he's preaching he preaches Christ and it may seem simple just just to preach this Jesus but it wasn't simple we uh we had a prophet teach us that Christ is the mystery of God revealed he is everything and I can imagine this Saul preaching Jesus Christ from Genesis all the way to the end of Malachi that's all he had to choose from right there and I could see that he was just probably going through each scripture and and each book and bringing him out there but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound into the chief priests but Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is the very Christ now this next verse I kind of rushed through the last one and we have time today tonight verse number 23 and after that many days were fulfilled after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him now after studying this over the over the past few days and as much as I've studied the book of Acts there is a time when Paul he he refers back in the book of Galatians he refers back he said that I went to Arabia for three years now I believe and I I think I'm right this is that time that Paul actually left and he left for three years here let's uh turn to Galatians chapter one and I want to tell you what I'm referring to here verse 11. now you know who the author of Galatians is can you guess Paul but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now this was important to Paul that he gets this across he's saying hey I didn't learn this in the synagogues I didn't even learn this from the disciples I learned this from Jesus Christ himself very important to Paul that he's he's saying that hey I got this not from somebody else but I got it straight from the source which is Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it again brother Aaron just like in first Timothy chapter 1 where he was referring to Acts chapter 9 here in Galatians he's referring to Acts chapter 9. and it profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen you know who the Heathen is we've established that right anybody right amen anybody that's not you immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood I didn't go ask my pastor I didn't go ask my Rabbi I didn't go ask the high priest I didn't confer was FL with flesh and blood neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me I didn't go to James and John and all of them that walked with Jesus but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days but other of the Apostles saw I nun save James the Lord's brother so there's a time about three years here when Saul of Tarsus studied the scriptures and prayed researched until he was sure about this testimony now remember he got knocked down the Lord Jesus spoke to him said Saul Saul why persecute us thou me he said who are you Lord and he says I'm Jesus whom you persecute he was testing that brother Paul he had this testimony he had this experience but he had to go back and test it with the word it shows really to me it shows why Jesus trusted that Apostle so much to write most of this new testament here because he took such great care he wanted to be right let me read this quote to you something brother Branham said and you know I'm thinking about how much faith and um confidence the Lord hadn't had in Paul to write these letters see Paul may not have known it but the Lord was going to make Paul's letters New Testament Canon I mean this was absolutely the word of God that Paul was writing now here's what brother Branham says about this he says see where he was what a thing it must have been for Paul see all that he had been trained to do was vice versa so now with all the education he had it was just become not to him now he knew that he had experienced he knew that he had an experience so here's another good lesson for us that experience alone isn't enough important experience alone isn't enough it's got to be an experience according to the word of the Lord so him seeing this and know that it is a great something than that someone else somebody else had received it before him he took three years and six months down in the desert in Arabia taking the Bible as it was then the Old Testament and going down there to compare this experience that he had and to see if it was scriptural wow put yourself in Saul of tarsus's in his shoes you are knocked down the Lord speaks to you changes your whole life you're you're smitten blind you're blind for three days then you go and this this man of this new cult that you've been persecuting he comes he prays for you you're healed immediately and then you feel inspired and you you go and you even start preaching and then you say wait wait I got to make sure that I'm right how many would would really take that time not just I'm gonna go pray about it this weekend three years more than three years he he went down and got away from everybody and went down to this other place and prayed there and and searched the scriptures so he would know beyond any doubt that this experience that I have lines up perfectly with this Bible the Mormons are a group that one of the things they'll do some of my best friends growing up are Mormon still close with them fine fine people one of the things that they tell you is take this Mormon Book of Mormon take these things that we teach this teaching of Joseph Smith and and this Revelation take this and you pray about it and then you pray about it and then God will give you an experience to justify what this new faith is sounds good doesn't it makes sense it's false it's false because it doesn't line up with this word right here and it's another thing it's false because they're not saying go try to line it up with the scriptures they're saying you go and seek you go seek an experience and guess what millions of them not thousands hundreds Millions have had that same that experience to where they now say well I prayed about it and now I believe this Book of Mormon and I'm Mormon because they had an experience but it doesn't line up with this Bible but look Paul look at what Paul did Paul had this incredible experience that I mean it was it was on par with Moses Paul has this experience and yet Paul the the man of Great Character that he was he says no I'm gonna go check this out three over three years can you imagine what a man I mean so so often with us it's like I don't have time I got to get out I got to start preaching I got to do this I have my commission wait a minute stop check it with the word don't seek validation don't seek Vindication go back and check it and see if it lines up perfectly then after these three years and Arabia Paul comes back and spends two weeks with Peter Galatians 1 18 then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days so there he is with Peter now he's he's saying okay I've got this all lined out from Genesis all the way here through Malachi which was the last book they had and everything in between and he says it's lined out now I want to go talk to this man that have walked with him that had that had gone around and preached and saw him preach the gospel and all the Miracles that he he had done I'm going to spend two weeks 15 days with this man would you have not loved been a fly on the wall in that conversation Peter and Paul talking I can imagine Paul saying well what did he do when this happened and then Peter said oh we were on the boat and and he stood up on the on the bow of the boat and he said peace be still you know Paul was like yes it's him it's this Messiah that we have always wanted and just really just digging in and just listening to Peter you know and and for like for a pastor for someone that leads the church who would I want to have would I want to have someone that had come up say in in a certain way of thinking or have been educated According to some denomination and and had all of these credentials and just and then just brought it and then started preaching what he had learned or what I want someone that said you know what I'm going to test it and they say oh well you're a doubter no no this word is more important to me than just to take something that I've been taught my whole life I want to take it and I want to really understand it and compare it to this Bible and to make sure it is right those are the kind of leaders we need in church not someone that just thinks about A good sermon and and and then lines it up and and brings it out but someone that has really spent the time and has got themselves out of the way like this Saul of Tarsus and really put it before the Lord and said Lord I'm gonna forget everything I've ever knew just just like he did here and I just want what what you want me to know so let's go back to Acts chapter 9. this was a silent time those three years in Paul's life but at the end of this chapter we're going to see that plenty of stuff is going on Acts chapter 9 where are we at verse 24. so in verse 23 he probably returned from his three-year sabbatical I guess we could call it and after two weeks with Peter now he's back Saul of Tarsus is back on the field but they're laying in weight was known of Saul so so what happened is is they were going to Ambush him but they're laying in weight was known of Saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then his disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket obviously they're in a walled City and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he is saved to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believe not that he was a disciple foreign this word of Saved means to try so when when Saul was come to Jerusalem he tried to join himself to the disciples that's sad you think about that he tried to fellowship with the church he wanted to he said hey friends you know I believe the same as you do it okay you stay away I feel this man overcame more than just about anybody in the book over on this side he had the Pharisees and the Sadducees they wanted to kill him and then over on this side he had these Disciples of Jesus these these these men and women of the way as it was called loving the Lord Jesus and out doing Miracles and and spreading the gospel and thousands were being converted all over and they're like you stay away we don't want anything to do with you either we don't really believe that you've converted and there's Paul in the middle yet he's stuck with it what a man stuck with it he knew his he knew his Revelation was sure he had spent the time he had spent the time in prayer he knew and yet both sides were against him right here you know I've seen people had a genuine desire to serve the Lord especially a lot of times it's it's young people and the Lord starts dealing with them they may be in there about 20 years old which is a lot of times when it starts 20 21 18 somewhere around there and the Lord starts dealing with these people with these young people and then they start trying and I'll tell you what church people can be so discouraging and they'll start condemning them they'll start they'll start talking about them and here you have a young man or a young woman who's who's they're not where they should be of course but neither am I where I should be either and I'm up here preaching I'm trying I'm getting better every day and and so are you are you and you should be but then there's these young people they'll come and they're doing their best they're trying and then they get condemned and it just drives them away how many times have I seen it how many times have I seen it at Youth Camp whether whether they'll have an experience and then instead of being greeted by love especially by the elders in the church they're greeted by well now you have to do this and this and this and they're agreed to buy a bunch of rules those rules friends come from the inside out that Holiness it comes from the inside out that love is what can bring those people in and I've seen it I've just seen it too many times but I thank God for a man of real courage like Paul Saul of Tarsus is this sign who stood up against that attitude and he put his own reputation on the line let me let me go back there's this man I want to go back to uh um no let's start at 27. there was a man that put his own reputation on the line which is verse 27 in Barnabas and he brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus now remember Barnabas as I said last time Barnabas is this guy that that he was greatly respected in the congregation he had sold a piece of land that was probably worth a fairly large sum of money and he gave it all to the work of the Lord and he this man had had a good reputation so he took Barnabas took his reputation and he laid it on the line for this man named Saul of Tarsus and that's really to me in reading the Scriptures it looks like that's really how Saul started to be accepted I want to do the same how important is it to all of us a friend that would stand for us a friend that would go to battle for us doesn't matter if if we've messed up we've sinned we've done something dumb or or made a fool of ourselves it really feels good to have somebody that loves you have some somebody to put their arm around you and say hey I'm your friend no matter what thick or thin and I'm going to stick up for you when you're not here I'm going to go to battle for you just like this man Barnabas did for Saul and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem now so so now if Saul is accepted and he's going in and out now let's go to acts 22 for a minute and start with verse 6. now this is later on Paul is giving a testimony of what happened on the road to Damascus and this one they're pretty close they're not exactly the same as we just read in in Acts chapter 9 but Saul many many years later is recounting this verse 6 and it came to pass that this is Paul speaking that as I made my journey and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon suddenly they're shown from Heaven a great light round about me and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecute us thou me and I answered who art thou Lord and he said unto me I am Jesus from Nazareth whom thou persecute us and they that with me they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid that they heard not the voice of him that spake to me I mentioned that in the last service and I said what shall I do lord and there is the Christian you give your heart to the Lord and it's not Lord what will you do for me it's Lord what can I do for you and the Lord said unto me arise and go into Damascus and there it shall be told the of all things which are appointed for thee to do and when I could not see for the glory of the of that light being led by the hand them that were with me I came to Damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood up and stood and said unto me brother Saul received thy sight in the same hour I looked upon him now that testimony is pretty much the same as what we read in Acts chapter 9. now listen to this and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and should just hear the voice of his mouth for thou shall be his witness unto all men of what thou has seen and heard and now why tarryest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord again close pretty close to Acts chapter 9 slightly different but about but about the same and you know it's it's a perfect example let me stop right there for a minute it's a perfect example of I see the brothers except especially people criticize brother Branham because he'll tell tell a story different differently over time and and they say well because he told it differently then it must not be true now right here we see a story that has been told fairly differently over time I believe it's told three times in the book of Acts twice by Paul and once by the original author Luke but just because it's told differently doesn't mean that it's different I was I was uh hunting one time and we I was hunting with my cousins and we we found this um skeleton of this deer and it had a mountain lion claw stuck in the the leg it was the neatest thing so this this mountain lion when it killed the deer it must have yanked out its claw so then I was hunting with my cousins and we we were going we noticed that there was a lot of fox scat in the area and they they go on the top of rocks to mark their territory and then another time uh well and then I was honey with my cousins and my cousin shot this deer the first time he'd ever been out with a bow and he'd shot like one time in the backyard and he pulls back and he kills this this whitetail deer which I've hunted for how many years and I've never been able to kill a whitetail deer with my bow so I tell those three stories but they're all the same story because on on that trip we had found this carcass of this deer it had a lion claw in it I was telling them about these foxes and how they marked their territory and then at the end my cousin uh Kyle kills this deer so just because I may tell this story differently it's still the same story I just leave out certain details and add certain details at different times and that's what is in this book of Acts when Paul is telling these stories sometimes he's leaving out details and sometimes he's putting in details they all happened but he's saying them because of his audience and he wants to focus on certain things like if you're a biologist I would tell the story about the fox you know and and just the different things like that so this wasn't this this part of acts right here wasn't recorded in the original testimony of Acts chapter 9. verse 17. a verse of chapter 22. thank you and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance now this is referring back to Acts chapter 9 that what we're studying right now but this is like 30 years later he's telling the story and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance and I saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me strange that they would receive Peter's testimony those same people but they wouldn't receive Paul's testimony so again look at the resiliency of Paul these people we don't want you but here's Peter and he's out and he's preaching the gospel and Paul may have been saying hey I have a PhD I studied this I went three years I understand all this there's no way that Peter can quote the scriptures like I can quote and yet they're like but we want Peter and we don't want you Paul and I said Lord they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on me and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed I also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the arraignment of them that slew him now we're back to Acts chapter 8. and he said unto me depart for I will send the far hence unto the Gentiles so now let's go back to Acts chapter 9. this is really neat I read that for a reason I don't mean to bore you I read that for a reason there we go Acts chapter 9 verse 29. and he spoke and he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and dispute disputed against the grecians but they were they went about to slay him now these grecians brother Lyle pointed out that these grecians and other translations are called hellenists they're just Greek speaking Jews which when the Brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus now this caesarea I'm gonna I'm gonna skip that caesarea's uh um I was gonna gonna tell where this place is and then verse 31. then had they the church had the churches rest all throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord now let me go back I skipped something I'm sorry I got confused here there's a place that Saul there's a place that in the previous that I just read that Saul it was made known to Saul that this plot that was against him so then what I just read is what Saul is saying later he said that I saw a vision and and I understood what it was that they were going to do to me there verse verse 28. and he was coming in and going out of Jerusalem verse 29 I'm sorry and he spake boldly in the name of Jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him which when the Brethren knew they brought him out down they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus now all the just all of a sudden the disciples and remember what I said about the difference between a disciple and apostle a disciple is anyone that believes Jesus you're with me an apostle is someone that believes Jesus but they're sent out on a mission they have a purpose to go out to do the work of the Lord and that's how Peter and John they could be disciples and they can be Apostles now Saul is also considered one of these Hellenist Jews and how do we know that because he came from a place called Tarsus which is outside of Israel so they sent him back to his hometown of Tarsus and now sawing Saul is going to be out of the picture for a while until chapter 13 in in Antioch now let me let me just sum up everything that I said and I just threw a whole bunch of information to you so so Saul goes and he goes and he separates himself for a while he goes to Arabia then he comes back and he spends 15 days with Peter and then he goes out and he's he's preaching and he's he's winning souls to Christ but then there's a time of quietness and that is right here that we don't see Saul anymore we don't see him in fact according to my Bible remember if you have a Scofield bible in the middle of the pages there you have the dates according to my Bible it's seven years until we see Paul again it says here then the then had the churches rest all throughout Judea and Galilee and Samara so Paul's gone and now we go back to Peter and walking in the fear of the Lord in the comfort of the Holy Ghost they were multiplied now remember I said that this is a pivotal time in in the book of Acts where you have you have Paul he gets his commission he he gets everything square and now he leaves and he goes across the Mediterranean to these Greek speaking Jews and he starts preaching there and now the book of Acts is going to go back to the Judea here back to Jerusalem and back to all of this area of Israel remember Paul's left now and now for the next span of time we're going to stay right here in Israel and we have Peter preaching again and it came to pass as Peter passed through all quarters he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lita now Lita is on the coast so Jerusalem is not on the coast but if you go north and west all the way to the coast then you'll get to this place called Lita again it's in Israel and there he found a certain man named Enos which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy so this man had been in his bed for eight years he was crippled he was maybe like a Parkinson's type disease or something like that and Peter said unto him Enos Jesus Christ maketh the whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately and all that dwelted Lita and seren saw him and turned to the Lord now what I wanted to get to here was look at the difference between the two ministries of Peter and Paul Paul is this educated man who can take the scriptures and make them in such a way to make the people believe and here's Peter over here Peter doesn't have the education he may not have the Charisma that Paul had but Peter goes over here and he's healing people and they're seeing all of these Miracles and they're like wow I'm going to turn to the Lord because of this man Peter now Peter was sent here to these people that needed that type of thing the ultimate goal the ultimate goal for both of them is to get the people to Christ that is the most important thing it doesn't you know as I said last time you can you can get sick and then you can get healed but you're gonna get sick again the whole thing with healing and and all these Miracles is to help us but it's the main thing is to point us to Christ to show us that Christ is alive and that's what Paul was doing over here Paul is studying the scriptures and he's laying them out and people are coming to the Lord wow just like the eunuch did in in the desert poll ex or um Philip explained it and he gave his heart to the Lord now you see over here Peter's doing Miracles and they're giving their hearts to the Lord that's the ultimate goal for all of it now there was a japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which is by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works in alms deej Deeds which she did Tabitha is the Hebrew name and Dorcas is the Greek name again remember who the author is the author of this book Luke he's not the conservative um old-fashioned Jew Luke's not afraid to mention the sisters in neither either his gospel or his book of Acts that's why you see many of the sisters more in the book of Acts and in the Book of Luke and she must have been a this Tabitha must have been a very special lady in because so many people loved her and so many people were crying at her funeral and she was had all these acts of Charity which is alms Deeds it's the same thing as as giving to the poor and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they later in an upper chamber now when it says that they had washed her that is the Jewish ritual of preparing a body to be buried so she died and of course mourned and then they take the body they wash it and then they Anointed with uh with the spices and the ointments that they Anointed with then they put it in the grave before the uh it sounds gross but before the body like starts stinking and and it corruption sets in so they were at that point here and listen to this verse number 38. and for as much as little was nigh unto japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that they would not delay to come to them this is very interesting this sister's dead but they knew that Peter was kind of nearby and they must have remembered now I can't prove this in the scripture but they must have remembered they had maybe heard the story or Maybe someone was there that remembered this story of this man Jairus this man Jairus was a priest with Jesus so Jairus is jairus's daughter was sick he came to Jesus and he said Lord would you come and pray for my daughter she's very sick so Jesus starts on the way and there's Miracles that happen on the way over to jairus's house is when that he was walking along and the the young lady with the blood issue that she came and she touched the very Hem of His Garment and she was healed and he turned and he said who touched me you know the story so he's walking and then it comes back she's dead so Jesus is he continues on and he says no she's not dead she sleeps so he continues on and he goes to this house and there's everybody crying and mourning and all of this and he goes in and he puts everybody out except for Peter and James and John and the mom and the dad so he goes in there and he goes in and he says uh talitha forgot exactly what he said but young lady arise and she rose up a miracle now listen to the way that this scripture in the book of Acts when Peter comes listen to this then Peter arose and went with them and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats in the garments which dork has made while she was with them again this Tabitha called Dorcas she must have been a very very special lady now what I'm quoting here is Luke chapter eight what I just told that story about Jesus going to Jairus daughter but Peter put them all forth he put them all out and he kneeled down and he prayed so Peter was like hey I've been in this situation before I was there Jesus came in and he put out all of those other people he came in and I got to stand there and I got to watch this and Jesus rose this young lady up now this book of Acts it's like a mirror of the Gospel the the very same things happen in the book of Acts that happened in when Jesus was here now listen to this but Peter put them all forth put them all out and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive mirror of Luke chapter 8. exactly the same it was the same It Was the Same Spirit that was in Jesus that went to jairus's daughter that Rose her up look at that Spirit was now in this man Peter and Peter went in and did the exact same thing and what's amazing to me is those disciples call them after she was dead they called him and it was known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord and it came to pass that Isaiah carried many days in Joppa that he he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a Tanner now in Acts chapter 9. as I said this is a pivotal time this is when that we have Jerusalem and the Jews and the message going around there and then it starts to kind of Squirt out to the areas around there and then it it gets to Damascus and then we have Paul step on the scene now we have a transition period from chapter 9 to chapter 12 or chapter 13 when things really start to shift and it's amazing shift that happens right here and we look back we see that now we have really these two great Servants of the Lord and I'm wrapping up if the musicians want to come we have these two great Servants of the Lord going out and preaching the gospel we have this period of quietness we don't really know what's going on for about seven years that Saul of Tarsus he goes out away from from Judea to the to the Greeks to the greek-speaking Jews and also to the Gentiles and now we have Peter just primed to see a major shift in the whole Ministry and this major shift is what we call the Gentile dispensation and it's all starting right here and things something is going to happen in this next chapter in Acts chapter 10 that is really going to just solidify that and change everyone especially as Peter's way of thinking because the Lord is going to instruct him now all right now we're going to move in a different direction you're with me and that is Acts chapter 10. so Acts chapter 9 we see this we see the Apostle Paul we see we see him change we see him go out and study and the most important thing that I want everyone to get tonight is what I said about him going and studying for these for these three years and how that he had this great experience but yet he had to check it with this word and even as great of a theologian as he was and how well he knew it he still it was such an important decision that he had to make sure that it lined up with this Bible amen well we got through Acts chapter 9. it's uh it's a great book I enjoy it so much I uh sorry I got I got uh a little bit confused there before but I was I was wanting to bring out that it was so neat to me that that in the beginning of Acts it says that that it was made known to Paul and then later he said that I saw a vision and the Lord warned me to go out sometimes you wonder why it's like Lord why did you warn him why don't you just wipe it away why don't you just kill him but it's just God's way he has his way of doing things and one thing that in the book of Acts that I'm seeing more and more that's a theme is God uses different people it's not all just one Prophet or or one person that's doing everything this holy spirit is spread out and they really they work together like the disciples let Paul out on the basket over the wall and he got to safety he he's just he's having everybody really work together and and this gospel starting to spread and now in this next chapter we're going to see wow big big [Music] Miracle happen and we even see a gentile seeing a vision in the next chapter God bless you all let's stand thank you [Music] for there and if you would lead a ladies and song Open my mind to reach out I had to say that we love him open are you is [Music] we want to see Jesus [Music] open our eyes we we want to see Jesus to

make a better decision in your life that's the most important decision that you will ever make and it's the greatest decision that you will ever make is to vote your life to the Lord Jesus after you

sent s out my WhatsApp this morning and was almost ready to cry just thanking the lord for the friends that we have and the church that we have and the love that we have for each other and and how that that people will hold each other up and somebody said one time I remember a while back maybe I heard it maybe 15 years ago that it's it's God's sheep just leaning on each other and holding each other up and I believe that's that's what we are we are doing um for for prayer I want to have uh I want to have special prayer brother Jeremy you mentioned that one of the kids has a has an earache

bring them to you in the name of the Son of God the name of Jesus Christ and ask Lord that every hand that is raised that each person would be healed or would receive the request that they have

anointing would be upon brother Li and and father as he brings out the life of this man Joseph and he reads the scriptures father May the same anointing that wrote those scriptures by men of God May

we're awake now thank you tonight we'll continue our investigation into the life of Joseph some of the lessons it holds for us and reminder that in the back of the sanctuary by the AV booth there are copies of lists of the Bible verses we're reading and some relevant images some people didn't pick some up previous time so we've got them for all six parts and I looked at the length of the bench there's only enough room for seven so I don't know if we'll finish it next time or we won't but but uh anyway they're back there for you and by the way if if I were subtitling these lessons tonight's might be subtitled road rage road rage well before we resume our study and hopefully no one here is suffering from road rage let's join together in prayer One More Time Lord Jesus Lord we're just in awe of you Lord we feel the presence of your spirit Lord and Lord we're just so grateful that you would come down to visit us Lord that you would come down to be present with us Lord that Lord that each person that's come here with you within them Lord to join together Lord our hearts our minds Lord help us set aside all the burdens and cares Lord that are upon us as just part of daily life Lord realizing how good we really have it even when we have it bad Lord we just pray now that you'd be that you'd continue to be present in this service this evening Lord May the words that are spoken be words that would help and strengthen and encourage us and draw us closer to you and to one another Lord to Bear to bear fruit Lord like that fig tree that the fellow in the orchard said give it give it one more year Lord we just want to bear fruit for you the fruit that you desire Lord we commit this service now and you Lord completely and wholeheartedly in Jesus precious name amen I I'd like to start by reading a short passage from a book to which I very rarely refer now we're in the middle of the story of Joseph a model of Christ in the first book of the Bible Genesis so let's turn to the middle of the last book The revelation of Jesus Christ chapter 12 and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death tonight we'll see a parallel and perfect though it may be the Christ type Joseph bringing his power to Bear to bring Salvation and Reconciliation brought about through the word of the testimony of one who overcame prepared to sacrifice his own life by that very testimony another verse from the New Testament comes to mind in a letter Paul wrote to the fledgling Church in galatia Galatians chapter 6 and verse 7 he says be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap please be seated thank you last time we saw the brothers leave heon go to Egypt to buy food because of the famine they had to see a Stern forbidding and powerful man named Zapf panea he was their brother Joseph but they didn't recognize him he sent them back to Canaan with grain their money and a warning that they would never see him again and th must never buy more food unless they brought their brother Benjamin he kept Simeon in prison as a hostage until they returned during this time Joseph overheard a conversation between Reuben and his brothers That Shook him to his very core when the brothers returned and reported to Jacob he refused to let Benjamin go to Egypt but they ran out of food the famine continued finally Judah persuaded his dad to send Benjamin and that Judah would take full responsibility for Benjamin's safe return we then explored the path that Judah took to confront his own failures as he became what he hated about his dad in a dramatic turn of events on on the brink of committing an horrific murder of his own daughter-in-law and unborn Sons Judah recognized what he had become he publicly confessed repented his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar thus became the matriarch of the royal line of Judah we entered with the brothers including Benjamin preparing to journey to Egypt face the Fearsome Zapf panea and seek to buy more grain from this strange Egyptian let's pick up our story as Jacob sends his sons to Egypt all substitute Joseph's Egyptian names afnaf Pano and Joseph is in that role or that perspective hopefully clarified some things a little bit Jacob is speaking to his sons as they prepare to depart from heon God Almighty give you Mercy before the man that that he may send away your other brother Simeon and Benjamin if I be bered of my children I am bereaved and the men took that present honey and nuts bomb spices myrr and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin and and Rose up and went down to Egypt a week or more traversing a hot unusually dry desert talking among themselves as they journeyed what will he say when we return the money how will we explain it how's Simeon doing is he okay is he he been abused starved beaten will the man believe this is our brother what will we do if he doesn't or says we stole the money what will happen if he refuses to release Simeon or detains Benjamin what is God doing to us and they stood before Joseph they were awaiting an audience with Zapf pan uh I recognize this map isn't great but it it shows the direct route from from Hebron where they live this will be the direct route down to arrival in the Goan area of Egypt and on down to where Joseph most likely is there's also a sea route this is the the route that they took him into slavery maybe they came down this way and over we don't really know they had to have water for the animals and it's been a time of famine there has to been a lot of rain the oases maybe not such good shape and carrying water is heavy and it reduces the amount of grain that you can carry back if you've got to carry water so we don't really know the exact route they took but it would probably take a minimum of 10 days or so to travel each way if if there's no delays and and you want the animals to stay healthy and and while we're looking at pictures have you ever wondered how long it was between the journeys how long did the grain last anybody think it lasted six months or or a year or more or or less I used to think well they probably made the trip once a year it's a second year of famine coming up so it's probably the second trip they've made and that all seems to make sense but then I thought or was it so let let's think this through for for just a moment a good siiz donkey weighs about 700 PBS now we have really huge donkeys these days but but a good siiz animals about 700 lb and a donkey can safely carry about a 20% of its weight 140 pounds or so of grain now we're told that we need about 1,800 calories a day a cup of grain is about 600 calories so three cups per day per person but let's assume that they're small people and they can supplement their uh their grain with other things so maybe they only need 1,200 calories a day from grain now a cup weighs about 5 ounces so each person needs about 10 ounces or 58 of a pound now we're later told that Jacob's Clan is approximately 70 people so you need 700 ounces a day or about 44 pounds so a donkey can carry enough food to feed every witer Hein for about three days now if the 10 so that's what one donkey can do if the 10 Brothers each had three donkeys they'd be able to feed the clan for about 90 days 12 weeks three months well they had other food sources sheep cattle crop yields were low but probably not zero on the other hand they had to feed the livestock so the bottom line is it's probably only been about three or four months since the first trip to Egypt when they're again on the road when Joseph saw Benjamin with them as they're arriving uh to see him he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay an animal make ready prepare a suitable banquet for these men shall dine with me at noon the man did as Zapf pan bade and the man brought the man into zafaf Pan's house not just a typical Egyptian house a little mud brick uh Thing by the side of the Nile somewhere this is a mansion it's near the Palace of pharaoh and Joseph is not a a minor Royal functionary he's the vizer the second most powerful person and the mightiest nation of the era and area now this is an artist's uh conception of what a huge Palace might have looked like in Egypt about this time there's no remains of anything that's been dug up out of the desert to know for sure and it's doubtful that Joseph's house was quite this spectacular but Egyptians were Master stone masons and artists Joseph's house was impressive designed to inspire awe at the magnificence of Egypt and intimidation at the power of its occupant and the men were afraid because they were brought into Zapf Pan's palatial and intimidating house and they said among themselves why does he want to see us because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time we were brought in he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us take us for for Bond men and our asses it's clear these guys are afraid they're intimidated hearts are pounding in their chest breaths short brains foggy zafra pan would not need to seek occasion against them his Wills the law he can arbitrarily seize them make them slaves kill them whatever and in the midst of Their Fear I think Moses wrote a line that would have had his audience laughing or at least chuckling not at their plight which produced great anxiety and fear but showing their panic in a humorous way look at the last part of the verse he wants to steal our donkeys that's what he's after he's after our donkeys they came near to the steward of zaa Pena's house and and they spoke with him at the door of the house at the entrance to this Palace and they said oh sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food and and it came to pass when we came to the end that that we opened our sacks they're very nervous in fact only one sack was opened at the end the the rest were opened in Canaan and behold Every Man's money was in the mouth of his sack or money in full weight full weight to understand these weren't coins you weighed silver and a weight of shekels like grams or ounces or something so it's measured by weight our money in full weight and we brought it again in our hand and the other money the other silver we brought down in our hands to buy food we don't know who put the money in our sacks but it wasn't us and and the steward said Peace be to you fear not relax calm down people you are God and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks have you ever thought about that what was the treasure the grain or the silver it was both the grain representing salvation from starvation and the silver representing Christ who paid our debt of sin and here is Joseph paying the debt for their salvation making it a free gift wow I had your money and he brought Simeon out to them and the man brought the men into zafaf Pan's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender he didn't take our donkeys yet they must have had a lot of questions for Simeon trying to understand what's happening and they made ready the present provided by Jacob nuts and honey spices bomb and myrr against Joseph came that is before Zapf Pan's expected arrival at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there and when Zapf pan came came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and he's probably thinking oh honey pistachios almond a reminder of the best of the land of Canaan that he'd enjoyed as a boy and a young man and uhoh spices bomb and myrr GH a reminder of his forced march to Egypt so many years ago these items were precisely the three items the ishmaelites were carrying a reminder of the past what his brothers who were now before him had done to him associated with that particular combination of odors and they bowed themselves to him to the Earth and he asked some of their welfare and said through an interpreter to them he still the strange Egyptian ZF MAF pan is your father well the old man of whom you spake is is he yet alive and they they raised their heads and answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obes they they bowed low they prostrated themselves in homage the rabbis say this was an acknowledgment of his asking about their father so they're bowing on his behalf since Jacob is being called thy servant and since Jacob represents the family as a patriarch this represents the Sun and Moon of Joseph's second dream bowing to him and Joseph lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me and he said God be gracious unto thee my son what the brothers think why did he say that to Benjamin and Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there and the brothers are wondering why did he suddenly leave what's going on and what is this does this remind you of remember the last time Joseph was weeping by himself while his brothers were preparing to eat that time his chamber was the sistern and Doan so many reminders of his past mistreatment by his brothers and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and as Zapf pan said set on bread and they set on for him by himself he's an important person and for them the 11 Hebrew Men by themselves and for the Egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the Egyptians might not eat bread with at the same table as Hebrews for that is an Abomination unto the Egyptians Hebrews are not their favorite people and these Hebrews had just traveled for days through the desert were hairy and bearded and dirty Hebrew Hillbillies and and the 11 Brothers sat were given seats before him the the first born according to his Birthright and the youngest according to his Youth and and the men marveled one or another other translations make it clear that Joseph dictated the order of the seating you sit there you sit there you you're next you sit there anybody have an idea how many different ways 11 people can be arranged if 11 of you were here and to put them in a certain order how many combinations are there of 11 people 39,9 2016, 800 now of course he knew Benjamin was the youngest so the other 10 leave only 3,628 1800 that's an easy problem to S and it's not like they were very different in age it's not like one of them looked like me and one of them looked like Josiah that that would make it easy no not including Benjamin they were all born within seven years of Jacob marrying Leia and Rachel and the four oldest were born before the next seven which means seven of them were born over a period of less than three and a half years to three different mothers and they're all in their early to mid 40s no wonder they marveled you couldn't just look at them and figure it out and this is part of the set up for the next chapter the concept that zafaf panea is capable of divining and zfn panea took and sent servings unto them from before him but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him the Hebrew word Shahar translated as Mary means Tipsy drunk in other words they were all intoxicated they started at noon they had a long party it's a big party the Egyptians the proper people they won't eat with the Hebrews do you see a parallel here with the gospels what did the proper people say of Jesus the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous a wine Biber a friend of publicans and sinners in chapter 47 not tonight we'll see Joseph is a seriously successful Publican stay tuned now chapter 44 and zaap AF pan commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry more than they paid for and put every man's money in his sacks mouth and put my cup up the silver cup in the sax mouth of the youngest and his grain money and he did according to the word that zafaf pan had spoken the image here is of silver dishes in a cup from the reign of Amon haet 2 the Pharaoh at the time of Joseph's March into slavery and the father of senu and as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses this was an all day and all night party it doesn't say they left and summoned him from the in it says they were sent away they came for lunch at Zapf panas and stayed the night oh they got to keep their donkeys and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off zafaf pan said to his Steward up quickly follow after the men when thou dust overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good is not this it in which my Lord drinketh and whereby indeed he dineth ye have done evil in so doing and the steward overtook them and and spake unto them these same words and they said unto him wherefore saith my Lord these words God forbid that thy servant should do according to this thing behold the money which we found in our sack's mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan how then should we steal out of thy Lord's House silver or gold notice they don't dispute that zap Naf P has amazing powers of divination they just saw him pull off a thing with a one in 40 million chance of success with whomsoever of thy servants should be found both let him die and we also will be my Lord's bondmen they know they're innocent they know they haven't taken this they know it and the steward said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant we won't kill him and you shall be blameless not enslaved then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack oops they're quick to prove their innocence they want to be on their way home to feed their families and the steward searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest it doesn't mean that he did it in birth order but he knew who the oldest was and he knew who the youngest was and he left that youngest one Benjamin for last because he knew that's where the silver cup would be he put it there and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack nobody seems surprised that the money is in the sack but that cup that's a big deal then they the brothers all rent their clothes and laided reloaded the sacks of grain onto every man his ass and returned to the city and Judah notice not not Ruben or Benjamin but but Judah and his Brethren came to ZF Pano's house for he was yet there he's waiting for them and they fell before him on the ground and Zapf panus said unto them what deed is it that you have done didn't you know that such a man as I can certainly Divine speaking through an interpreter of course but look who the spokesman is for the group Judah still wearing his torn clothing said what shall we say unto my Lord what shall we speak how shall shall we clear ourselves God ha found out the iniquity of thy servants Judah is not referring to the iniquity of stealing the cup they didn't do it but past nicity regarding Joseph this whole strange set of circumstances going on he says that God is punishing them for their past sin for behold we are now become my Lord's servants we become your slaves both we and he also with whom the cup is found he he's not guilty of the iniquity that we're guilty of he wasn't part of the sin that God is punishing them for and zath panus said God forbid that I should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my slave as for you get you up in peace under your father I don't want to see you anymore get out of here then Judah remember he's the one whose idea was to sell Joseph to the Israelites in the first place Judah knows it Joseph knows it Judah the one who was transformed as we read last time in chapter 38 that Judah came near unto the man he knew is Zapf pan and said oh my Lord let thy servant I pray thee speak a word in my Lord's ear and let not thine anger burn against thy servant thine anger burn an interesting choice of words from Judah who in Anger was going to burn tomorrow for thou art even as Pharaoh my Lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother and we said unto my Lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one might be better thinking as a small one implying that Benjamin is the youngest of us he's not a kid he's 30 years old and his brother is dead Judah doesn't know if Joseph is dead or not only that he was sent into slavery 23 years earlier but Judah is simply reminding zap pan of the contents of the general conversation from their first visit and he alone meaning Benjamin is left of his mother and his father loves him and thou s unto thy servants you said to us bring him down unto me that I may set mine eyes upon him and we said unto my Lord the lad cannot leave his father if he should leave his father his father would die and thou sayest unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you you shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father we told him the words of my Lord and our father said go again and and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the man's face we may not buy Grain except our youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us you know that my wife bear me two sons one went out from me and I said surely he's torn in pieces and I saw him not since at this Joseph knows his surmise was correct Jacob thought Joseph had been killed just as Ruben said on their first visit if you take this meaning Benjamin also from me and Mischief befall him you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life it shall come to pass when he seeth the lad is not with us that that he will die and thy servant shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the Grave for thy servant I Judah became shity for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee that and I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee let thy servant let me abide instead of the lad AB bondman to my Lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest per Adventure I see the evil that shall come on my father this is a very different Judah he's been transformed by the conclusion of judah's Supplication Joseph realizes several things first his father truly was led to believe Joseph was killed when he didn't return from Dothan with his brothers his conclusion based on Ruben's statement at the end of their first visit as we discussed last time was in fact correct thus Jacob not coming to rescue Joseph is not born BN of a lack of compassion or love but is instead the fruit of Deceit second that Judah the one who arranged his sail to the ishmaelite spice Traders had truly changed he who was willing to condemn Joseph to slaver in Egypt was now asking that he be made a slave in Egypt to spare Jacob further grief third the he Joseph cannot knowingly be the cause of further grief to his dad he cannot retain Benjamin and send the others back to Canaan all of which means he can no longer be Zapf Pena to his family he must once again be Joseph chapter 45 then Joseph could not refrain himself from before all them that stood by him and he cried in egyp Egyptian cause every man to go out from me there stood no man with him none as afnaf Pan's Egyptian staff guards interpreters while Joseph made himself known unto his brothers here we see one of the most often quoted parallels of the life of Joseph and the life of Jesus the first time the brothers were together with Joseph after the famine began Joseph saved him from starvation we spoke of this last time about Jesus being the bread of life and Joseph providing grain bread to sustain Jacob's family the fact that the money was put back in their sacks showing that his gift of life was without cost it was freely given that they could try to pay for it even be convinced that they had earned it but they couldn't they had to accept it as a free gift and this time which is often used to illustrate Jesus Second Coming his brothers the the Jewish Nation will recognize him paralleling teachings about the second coming of Christ were told that azath Joseph's Egyptian wife was in the palace and not present when his brothers recognize Joseph brother brandham mentions this many times in his various sermons we could end the story here end the series on Joseph but Moses didn't and neither will we and Joseph wept aloud and the Egyptians in the house of pharaoh heard Joseph was overcome with emotion and cried out and Joseph not zafaf pan through an interpreter Joseph said unto his brothers I am Joseph does my father yet live is it really true that Dad is alive you're not just making this up this is the first time that Joseph refers to Jacob as his father and his Brethren could not answer him they were troubled at his presence no surprise there Reuben would be the most shocked if this was true this Egyptian fellow had just told them that he could Divine how could zap Naf panea know the name of the brother who was not they haven't said the name Joseph and how can Joseph convince them that this isn't some witchcraft or divination or other means that it's not some sort of an act Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you I pray you the the Hebrew word is n it often means please in the case of a command or an imperative it softens it so he's not commanding them come here or else but he is insisting and they came near they're still troubled at his presence and he Saidi am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt at this Reuben must have looked at his brothers and seen their guilt-filled countenances filled with fear if this guy really is Joseph and has the power he clearly has this might not be good news Joseph goes goes on to reassure them of his good intentions toward them now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life Joseph has understood his role for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you he repeats this do you get this guys he repeats it it's God's doing to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance they're still silent so now it was not you that sent me here but God this is the third time he's repeated this are you getting it guys and Heath made me a father to Pharaoh we talked about this in part four that senusret 2 who had the dreams died about the time the years of plenty ended and his son senusret three who had been tutored by Joseph for several years was now Pharaoh made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt Hast she hurry up go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son Joseph God hath made me Lord of all Egypt come down unto me T not and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goan Joseph has carefully inspected the entire land during his tenure he knows the best areas in chapter 47 we'll see how he knew the land land would be available for his extended family to settle and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou Hast and there will I nourish thee again a model of Christ come down from heaven can't be bought the bread from Heaven can't be bought but will be a gift for there are yet yet five years of famine to come he repeats this prediction to emphasize it lest thou and thy household and all that thou Hast come to Poverty yeah I'm your brother but in this land I'm also your lord and I will save you in spite of your rejection of me and what I suffered at your hands a perfect parallel to Jesus and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that it's my mouth that speaketh unto you and I can see in your eyes you're starting to believe me and now he becomes assertive and ye shall tell my father of all my glory the honor the fame the Splendor in Egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither he's very very old get him down here quickly and he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept and Benjamin wept on his neck moreover he kissed all his Brethren and wept upon them and after that his Brethren who had been dumb struck until now talked with him reminds me a little of Thomas after Jesus resurrection he needed serious convincing and the fame thereof not just Joseph is overcome and his weeping was heard in Pharaoh's house saying Joseph's Brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well and his servants and Pharaoh said unto Joseph after summoning him to the Palace say unto thy Brethren this do ye laid your beasts load your donkeys and go get you into the land of Canaan and take your father and your households from Canaan and come unto me and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt and you shall eat the fat of the land again parallels go ye into all the world preach the good news come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laid and I'll give you rest now Thou Art commanded this do ye take you King James says wagon a much better word is carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives not for your heavy stuff and bring your father and come and also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours Pharaoh seems awfully generous we'll get a strong hint about why at the end of chapter 47 not tonight and the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them carts according to the Commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way many use these verses and specifically the use of the word wagons to dispute the time of Joseph being during the 12th dynasty of the Middle Kingdom they point out that evidence of four-wheeled wagons didn't exist in Egypt until the late second intermediate period or early New Kingdom 1600s or 1500s BC two or 3 hundred years after the 12th Dynasty where we have placed Joseph this is the first record of Egypt having four- wheeled wagons in approximately the 1600s of BC during the 13th Dynasty more than 200 years after these carts are sent to Joseph's family in Hein the image is taken from a stone relief the wheels are tiny discs could even be small logs useless over rough desert Trails but as early as the fifth Dynasty around 400 years years prior to the setting of the story two wheeled scaling ladders were in use and a Siege Tower is Illustrated in a tomb of the 11th Dynasty about 150 years before the time of the 12th Dynasty both these images are from Stone reliefs noticed especially the fifth Dynasty scaling ladder has decent sides solid disc wheels and an axle the Hebrew word translated in the King James Bible as wagon and more accurately cared is agala in modern usage small hand trucks like one we might use to move an appliance are called aala agala is derive from a word that means revolving circular round the carts sent by phero and Joseph were most likely two wielded carts and were not for their goods but for their small children their wives for Jacob light loads hard to put on the back of a donkey and people incapable of walking the distances involved verse 17 showed us that heavy loads were carried directly by donkeys not loaded on carts or wagons we'll see the same in verse 23 now we have no illustrations carved in stone or examples from tombs of what such a cart might have been like remember nearly all the tombs of the Pharaohs and of the wealthy were robbed in Antiquity it's only in the later New Kingdom that there were extensive paintings inside tomb walls illustrating daily life the the wooden models I showed you pictures of uh last time surviving from Joseph times were Agriculture and food making and so it was so that the deceased could eat food in the afterlife they wouldn't starve and the models were apparently of little value to tomb Raiders finally remember that lack of direct evidence of the carts is not the same as evidence of a lack of carts moving on to all of them Joseph gave each man changes of rment why because they torn theirs when the cup was found in Benjamin's sack of grain but to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five changes of rment and to his father he sent after this manner 10 asses Laden with the good things of Egypt and 10 she asses Laden with grain and bread and food for his father by the way again note the heavy those are born directly by the pack animals not loaded into carts or wagons further evidence that the wagons were two wheeled carts and not four or more wheeled Vehicles such carts could slowly Traverse unpaved paths in the Rocky desert Wilderness befitting events in Egyptian technology in the time of the 12th dynasty of the Middle Kingdom so Joseph sent his Brethren away and that he parted and he said unto them see that you fall not out by the way what does that mean don't fall off a cliff on a mountain trail don't stop at Disneyland of the sin go directly home don't dottle it's not what he's saying other translations read don't quarrel among yourselves while you're traveling the Hebrew word regaz translated Fallout means tremble Quake rage shake or quiver with violent emotion especially anger or fear today we might say road rage can you imagine Reuben's anger at having been told a lie all these years about Joseph's demise Reuben having unwittingly been pulled into the deception of Dipping Joseph's special coat in goat's blood to convince Jacob their father that Joseph had been killed what did Judah and the other brothers told Ruben when he came back and found the sister and empty and asked the child is not an eye whether shall I go I don't know bro hungry lion or a bear must have smelled him and heard him balling his eyes out and carried him off to devour that's why we're here protecting the flocks right but there's no blood in the sistern the animal didn't want to get trapped in there probably dragged him away to eat him in its den or feed its Cubs in one of the caves around here Joey might have found a way to try and climb out when he was taken who knows but he's obviously dead and good ridd right but now Ruben knows the truth straight from the mouth of Joseph oops or what about Benjamin all these years you've told me my brother Joseph was killed but you sold him into slavery what kind of brothers are you how could you do that that what kind of family is this and both Ruben and Benjamin first and last born accusing how could you do this to our father and all of them what are we going to do how are we going to tell Dad they know Joseph will tell Jacob all the details of his life since he left Hein for sheam those 23 years earlier the brothers have no choice but to finally tell Jacob the truth Judah so far at least is the only one we know that is demonstrated confession and repentance Simeon and Levi admitted killing the men of shakam but Justified their actions no sense of guilt or remorse or repentance and demonstrated want and cruelty hamst stringing the animals and Jacob's response to it how could you do this was you're putting us all in danger you're putting me in danger Jacob was a very self-focused individual and how will Jacob their dad react to having been deceived and not about a missing piece of pie or other triviality but about his favorite son and for 23 years I'll repeat one of our opening verses be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap I wonder if Paul was thinking about job when he wrote that even as I have seen they that plow iniquity and so wickedness reap the same Jacob's whole life has been one of practicing deception his sons have been good students a wakeup call for Jacob is coming on the road from Egypt to heon in the form of 11 shocked brothers and as they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father I can imagine and it's just my imagination that Jacob saw them saw them arrive pale now shaking as they lock eyes and notice him looking their way and he happy that he plainly sees Simeon and Benjamin or part of the returning group could have said hey boys welcome home what happened down there in Egypt you all look like You' seen a ghost seriously now tell me all about it and they told him saying Joseph is yet alive and he is Governor over all the land of Egypt whatever the greetings this was the last thing Jacob would have ever expected them or anyone to say and Jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not of course he didn't how could he if Joseph were alive why hadn't he reached out to his family if he was as powerful as they asserted he could have easily done so why would he run away and hide for 13 years cut off all contact how had his special coat been left behind and covered in blood Jacob had mourned the loss of Joseph for years this can't be true but it was and they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them in the course of these Revelations would have come the confession of the brothers selling Joseph and the cover up and when Jacob would have undoubtedly challenged them how could you do this they undoubtedly pointed out Jacob's duplicity all of his life Esau and the birthright deceiving Isaac for the blessing of the firstborn Rachel and Leia the spotted sheep at Uncle laan's dad your life has been one of continual deception and self-focus and you're upset with us for following your example you ignored us dad always put Joseph first we hated him and that hate came from your preferential treatment at our expense we just wanted some of that love and attention Dad we thought with Joseph out of the picture you'd finally see us but no you were more concerned about mourning what you'd lost than caring about what you still had maybe some of the air finally got cleared the brothers were reaping what they had sown and so was their dad Jacob and when Jacob saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revived he could see that the carts were Egyptian not Canaanite the people attending them were clearly Egyptian as well and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I'll go and see him before I die chapter 46 and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beva and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob and he said here am I why biva why not Hein is it just because it's on the way if so why stop and offer sacrifices there let's unravel that mystery we're running out of time this evening why b sha it's next time and this part of the story of Joseph's life we find Joseph as a model of Christ revealing himself when he sees genuine repentance the musicians could kindly return and we see that those who were his enemies his brothers who hated him received Grace at his hand they didn't know who he was but he knew who they were and in this part I also see a life reflecting teachings that Jesus will speak some 2,000 years later he might have been thinking of the life of Joseph as he prepared to deliver his most notable sermon Matthew 5:44 I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you or Matthew 6 if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses or in Matthew 7 therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do so even to them even if they're your enemy for this is the law and the prophets Joseph is not only showing grace and mercy but loving kindness to his brothers let's worship together and celebrate our Lord's loving kindness to us all there's a song that's based on Psalm 63 let's all sing it together and you can sing it in the correct key I'll be struggling to find it here somewhere th thy loving kindness is better than life thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise the thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name thy loving kindness is better than life thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee the will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands unto thy name my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless Thee I will lift up I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands unto thy name my lips shall praise thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name did you enjoy it as much as I did did you learn something I'm so [Music] blessed my brother Lyall is just a wonderful teacher and he's he's a wonderfully learned person someone that studies and takes these things in using the very native Lang or learning the very native language of Hebrew so that he can learn these things better and that he can present these things to us so that we might understand the word better one thing that I just have to share with the church and I don't want to try to add to brother Lyle's sermon and he said this believe he read this [Music] scripture Genesis 45:7 and God and this is Joseph speaking God sent me before you to preserve your posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land and brother ly said he your exact words where let me read your exact words he said [Music] it took so many notes brother I'm sorry but the L's words were Joseph understood his role I've heard brother brandom say that if the bride could just realize who she is can you imagine if we really understood who our father is and if we really understood Jesus Christ and we really understood what a son or a daughter of God is can you imagine the different lives that we would live can you imagine the blessings that we don't have because we really don't truly understand who we are Joseph understood who he was and not only did he save all of Egypt but he also saved Israel the sons of Israel later on 400 and something years later 440 years 430 years later a prophecy came forth about these same descendants of this same man Jacob and said oh Israel whatever blesses you will be blessed and whatever curses you will be cursed and we see that same today if we would just realize what God has promised us Jesus Christ himself said ask anything in my name and I will do it imagine if we really understood our role like this man Joseph understood his role well done brother L well done let's all stand and then we will sing there's coming a day when we realize when we do really realize who we are and for eternity we'll sing of the goodness of God there I'm going to do one song great all is well all is well we have heard the message the and all is there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner so rest little Bri rest for all is yes all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom and all is well there is a place perfect rest behind the in so rest little

It's already done. Oh, the battle is over. Victory is one. Oh, it's already done. You can have your seats. [Music] I wanted to sing this tonight in honor of Good Friday and the coming resurrection morning. [Music] They were watching from a distance and they could not take their eyes from you. You were bleeding. They were weeping. Faithful sisters, they had followed you. They did not understand. They could not see. They were mourning their loss. And as the sky turned black and the earth turned red at the foot of the [Music] cross. He was standing near your mother. They were so close. They could hear you sighing all around them. Angry voices pierced the darkness as you were dying. But they would not leave. They lingered there no matter the cost. They were staying and they were praying at the foot of the [Music] cross. Keep me near the cross. Near the cross. May I never stray so far that I cannot see what flow down for me at the foot of the cross. Now I'm standing in your presence and I cannot take my eyes from you. You have risen. I'm forgiven. Precious Savior. Oh, I worship you. I'm not looking back. I've heard your voice. I'm staying here. I've made my choice. Now it's real. Now I kneel at the foot of the cross. Keep me near the cross. near the cross. May I never stray so far that I cannot see what flow down for me at the foot of the cross. Keep me near the cross. Jesus near the cross. May I never stray so far that I cannot see what flowed down for me at the foot of the cross. Oh, what a [Music] savior. Isn't he wonderful? Sing hallelujah. Christ is risen. Bow down before him for he is Lord of all. Sing hallelu. Christ is risen. Oh, what a [Music] savior. Isn't he wonderful? Sing hallelujah. Christ is risen. Bow down before him. For he is Lord of all. Oh, sing hallelujah. Christ is risen. Oh, sing hallelu. Christ is risen. [Music] [Applause] Wonderful. Thank you. Let's sing Old Rugged Cross on a hill far away. [Music] And then once we're done as a sister now, I'll have you come up and get ready. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame. [Music] And I love that old cross with the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners. [Music] So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies. [Music] lay down. I will cling to the old rug cross and exchange it someday for a crown. In the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine a [Music] wonder for the dear lamb of God. He left his glory above to bear it to dark calary. Oh, I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down. And I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a cr to the old rugged cross and to the old rugged cross I will ever be true. its shame and reproach gladly there bear. Then he'll call me someday to my home far away where is glory forever I'll share. So I'll cherish the old rug it comes. Oh, till my trophies at last I lay down. And I will cling to the old rocked cross and exchange it someday for a crown. Thank you sister. your only son. No sin to hide. But you have sent him from your side to walk upon this guilty sod and to become the lamb of God. Your gift of love they crucified. They laughed and scorned him as he died. The humble king they named a fraud. They sacrificed the lamb of God. Oh lamb of God. Sweet lamb of God. I love the holy lamb of God. Oh me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. I was so lost. I should have died. But you have brought me to your side to be led by your staff and rod and to be called the lamb of God. Oh lamb of God, sweet lamb of God. I love the holy lamb of God. Oh, wash me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. Oh, me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. Thank you very much. I've been enjoying the specials lately. They've been so good. We've been getting more. So, the rest of you who haven't sung yet, start getting some ideas. Would you all stand with me? We're going to sing on the wings of a snow white dove as brother Daniel comes. On the wings of a snow white dove, God sends his pure sweet love, a sign from above on the wings of a dove. Verse one. Jesus our savior came to earth one day. He was born in a stable home in a manger of [Music] hell. [Music] Rejected but not from above. God gave us his sign on the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow white dove, God sends his pure sweet love, a sign from above on the wings of a [Music] dove. Beautiful singing tonight. Let's pray. Father, if we only truly knew. Lord, you give us a little taste. Father, we want to know you and the power of your resurrection, in the glory, Lord, of of your being. Thank you, Father, for preserving your word to us that we might get a glimpse of the greatness of God. Thank you for your son Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins as as these songs that were sung tell us. Father, we thank you Lord. Now as I open up your word, I pray that your anointing would be on it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Thank you. really nice job, Sister Sarah and Sister Naomi. Perfect, perfect songs just for this week. And uh, Brother Josiah, he um, he sang that. Brother Michael, I want to tell you something, Brother Josiah, when he sang that song um, on the wings of a snow white dove. First time I never grew up in church. First time I ever I'm sorry, not on the wings of a snow white dove, the old rugged cross. First time I ever heard that song. As I said, I never grew up in church, but it was your sister Sherry that sang that song in church. And it was that song that she used to sing. And u also uh when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. So um and when you don't grow up in church, these you just seems like you appreciate the things that you didn't have growing up even more. And the music I uh Brother Manny I appreciate it so much. I know you do too. Really speaks to me these songs. Sister Sarah was singing that Easter song at the foot of the cross. And there weren't very many people that were at the foot of the cross. There was believe it was three women named Mary. Mary the mother of Jesus, another Mary and and Mary Mary Magdalene that were there. And I believe John the Apostle was there. I we have the opportunity now to kneel at that cross all the time. And I look back in that day and I probably would not have been one of those ones, one of those special ones that knelt down at the cross. But I'm I'm thankful for the ones that did. And and I'm also thankful for the ones that that learned and that have brought this gospel to us. Even though they they may not not have been there. They may have been afraid, but now we have their words forever preserved in this this glorious book. Know what it is about Easter, but it just it really gets to me. I think about everything that's happened during this week and I I I try to relive it every day. I'll uh our lesson tonight, we're on our Bible study and I'll uh I'll go through the the days that led up to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And as I'm going through each day, I'll go through the first three days. I'll read scriptures and then I will I'll go through quickly through the rest. But as I'm as I'm speaking, think about the event that was most pivotal in this time in this week and think about what you think. There's not going to be a right answer obviously for this, but think about what event that led up to the crucifixion of Jesus. Think about what was the most pivotal and what had the most gravity. what had the most far-reaching effects? Of course, not the the death and the resurrection, but what led up to that day? And then I'd like to hear, we're in a Bible study, so it's more more informal. So, I'd like to hear what you all think is would be that most pivotal time. Hopefully, we will get to that point. I think we will. Day one was uh it was we call it Holy Week. this day that Jesus came in to the city of Jerusalem riding on this donkey. It's called Palm Sunday. What a what a day that was. And I'm sure the disciples as Jesus was coming in, the disciples were probably saying, \"Finally, finally, he is going to be crowned king of Israel. He has been prophesied to come. We know this is the Messiah. finally this is going to be the day. And as he as he came in and everyone was waving the palm leaves and and he was riding in and they were singing hosana to the king. I can only imagine how those disciples just felt vindicated. They just felt good. Let's turn to Matthew chapter 21. We'll start with verse verse one and we'll read about that. It's uh Matthew chapter 21, Mark 11, Luke chapter 19, and John 12 all tell the story of Palm Sunday. Matthew chapter 21 verse one. And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Beth Paji unto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied and a colt with her. loose them and bring them unto me. And if any man say unto you, if any man say ought unto you, you shall say, the Lord hath need of them, and straightway he will send, he will send them. All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, behold, the king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass, the cult a and a colt, the full of an ass. It's quoting two different scriptures. Isaiah chapter 62:1, it's saying that this is fulfilling as Jesus rides in to to the uh to the city of Jerusalem. It's fulfilling these two two scriptures. Isaiah 62:11, Zechariah 9:9. I read I'll read Isaiah 62:11. Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh. Behold, his reward is with him and his work before him. The first part of him writing in behold the daughter the say to the daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation cometh. Now Zechariah chapter 9 verse9 says this rejoice greatly oh daughter of Zion. Zechariah 9:9, \"Behold, the king cometh unto thee. He is just, and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon the colt, a cult, the f of an ass.\" So these two scriptures together are fulfilled as Jesus is is riding into the city. One thing that I always I always kind of wondered but I never dove into it is why does it say a donkey and the cult of a donkey? You notice it says that. Has anybody ever wondered about that or or just you just kind of read over it? Well, remember he was supposed to ride into the city on a donkey that had never been ridden on before. So here we have a donkey and then we have the donkey's baby and it was two donkeys. So the the brothers that went in, they went and they got they brought both of them back and Jesus rides on the younger one, the one that had never been ridden on before as he comes into the city. It's Bible study. We can learn things like that. Verse number six, Matthew. Back to Matthew. And the disciples, Matthew uh 21:6, and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass and the colt, and put them put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way. Others cut down branches from the trees, and straw them in the way. And the multitude that went before and that followed cried, saying, \"Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the highest. We sing a couple different songs with that title. Hosana. Hosana is I'll read it. Says hosana is a lurggical word used in both Judaism and Christianity. In Judaism, it's an appeal for divine help. While in Christianity, it serves as a cry of praise. The term is derived from the Greek word I I can't pronounce it which is believed to be a transliteration of two Hebrew words. All right, brother Lyall. Two Hebrew words. Yasha meaning to save or to deliver and anna ana meaning to please meaning please. I beseech. So it defines hosana as a powerful and ancient expression of praise and adoration in Christian worship originating from the Hebrew um Hebrew. Its meaning has evolved from a plea evolved from a plea for salvation. Save us we pray to a joyful declaration of salvation and deliverance. And really I believe right there is when we see the fulfillment of that word hosana. And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, \"Who is this?\" And the multitude said, \"This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.\" And they also said, the priest said, \"Hey, they're all saying all of this about you, Jesus. Tell them to be quiet. You know, you're causing a big uproar in the city.\" and they're calling you these these great things, tell them to be quiet. And Jesus says, \"If they be quiet, the stones will cry out.\" That's what happened on day one, Palm Sunday. On day two and Monday, Jesus enters the temple, drives out the merchants and the money changers, declaring, \"My house will be called the house of prayer, and you have made it a den of thieves.\" Markap 11 verse1 15 Mark 11:15 says this and they ca and they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast them out that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. And he taught, saying unto them, \"Is it is it not written, my house shall be called a called of all nations, the house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves?\" Jesus goes in and can you can you imagine if you are a priest and Jesus walks in violently flipping over the tables binding up cords and start whipping them away you know tearing up all the cages with all the animals. These are animals for holy sacrifice. They're doves. They're lambs. their the animals that they that they are supposed to sacrifice for their own sins. And Jesus comes in and he sees all the money on the on the tables and he sees wow this is church has become now a business and it's all about money tearing everything up and and flipping it over. Imagine what the priests thought. Imagine what the disciples thought like whoa. They stood back. There's a if you've ever read the book Prince of the House of David, it's a beautiful um kind of drama of of what happens when Jesus comes in and and the girl Adena, she's over a long way away and she hears all this ruckus and people screaming and all this things these things being thrown around and they go and it's the young prophet Jesus of Nazareth tearing everything up. He had just come. As he was on his way, he was hungry. Hungry. Walks by a fig tree. It's a springtime. Figs don't bear fruit in the spring. Jesus comes up to the the fig tree and he looks and there's no figs on it to eat and he curses it. The next day, fig tree's withered, dying. After he curses it, he goes in, turns the money the money changers tables over and and that. On day three, Jesus teaches in the temple. This is Tuesday, yesterday. Jesus teaches in the temple. He spends the whole day and he's teaching in parables and he's answering questions and he's warning about the hypocrisies of the religious leaders. And he's tell and he's he also he speaks about the end time and he speaks about his second coming. He tells the parable some of the parables that we've gone through over the past few months. He ter tell tells the parable of the wheat and the tears how they should let them grow together. Famous story happens on this day when the Pharisees they try to trap him in paying taxes. He tells them he says pull out pull out a coin. We have a soul in our in in ourselves. He says yeah pay your taxes. Abide by the laws, but more importantly, give your soul to God. Money is earthly, so pay your taxes, but your soul belongs to God. The widow comes to the temple and she Jesus is watching her and others are watching her. They see people coming in and there's the box there and they're they're putting their their offerings in the box and the rich people are coming in and they're flipping out the $100 bills and they're dropping them in. And here comes the little widow lady and she digs in her what we would call her purse and she pulls out two coins and she puts them in the box. And Jesus says points it out and says, \"Who gave more? Did the widow or did all of these people that were putting in those hundreds and putting in all those money, all that money? He said the widow gave more because she gave a higher percentage of what she owned. She gave a a bigger portion of what she had. He said she's the one that gave more. All of these rich people, it's nothing for them to throw hundreds in there. But for this little widow to give what she had, she is the one that is more blessed. Even though the the trustees might say, \"Oh, we didn't get much in the offering today.\" Those two coins that that widow gave were far more as I said than those hundreds. He prophesies about nation rising in against nation. And and he he he warns as he has warned so many times about false prophets arising and deceiving many. And there should be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and on the earth and distress of nations with perplexity in the sea and the waves roaring and men's men's hearts failing them from fear and expectation of those things which are coming to the earth. For the power of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with glory and with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to happen, look up. Lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing nigh. Your redemption is near. Said that on this this day, this Tuesday, he tells the people the parable of the fig tree. When you see the flowers starting to form on the on the branches, then you know that summer is coming. He tells the parable of the 10 virgins where five were ready for the coming of the Lord and the other five were lazy and didn't prepare. They weren't ready for the bridegroom to come. He tells the parable of the talents of the bags of gold where he had three servants. Five, he gave five bags of gold to one. He gave two to another and he gave one bag to the last one. The man with five bags of gold or silver, what whatever the valuable was it, he doubled his. The one that was given two, he doubled his. But the one that was only given one, the man was afraid and he dug a hole and he buried it. He's lazy. When the master comes back, he was pleased with the with the one that had that was given five bags because he had doubled it. He was pleased with the one that was given two bags because he had doubled it. But the one that only had one bag that buried it and didn't get didn't receive even interest. He was upset and he says you could have le at least earned something with my money. And the man was cast into outer darkness. A parable. He makes many famous statements that day. Hey, he even says, \"Heaven and earth will pass away. My word will never pass away.\" One of the things he said on that Tuesday, all the sermons that are preached all these 2,000 years from all of these parables and all those things that I had just just talked about, he said it all. The Lord said all of these things in one day. This is when the Pharisees began their plan of attack against Jesus. yesterday, Monday, he turned everything upside down, throwing the money everywhere and disrespecting their way of selling, disrespecting their way of worship. So they they was that was the last straw. He comes in, this triumphant king, who does he think he is? And then he comes in and he turns over all of our stuff and messes everything up. Who does this guy think he is? We have got to put this guy away. And they started on their plans. And on Wednesday, the priests were devising against him. There's not much written about Wednesday. This is the day that the woman comes in. This woman from Bethany and she has compassion on the Lord. She comes down in and she falls down on his feet at at his feet. She begins weeping. She anoints him with this sweet smelling oil. And as her tears wash his feet, she washes them with her hair. That's that's Wednesday. Thursday, Peter and John were sent to prepare the Passover meal. After sunset, he eats the meal with his 12 disciples, washes the disciples feet. Judas departs, goes to betray betray, meets with the priests. The Lord's supper is instituted. What we did a couple weeks ago, he said, \"Do this in remembrance of me.\" Judas betrays him, goes to the Sanhedrin, the to the he goes to the the house of the high priest. And then on Friday, then on Thursday night, Jesus walks his disciples down the the mountain and he gets to the Garden of Gethsemane on Thursday night. He goes into the garden and he prays, tears coming out and and and the water coming coming out and mixing with blood or or the blood and the water, it's separated. and he's praying and he's he's saying,\"Lord, if there would be some way, let this cup pass from me.\" He knew what was coming. He didn't want to do it. There in that dark night in that garden, he wanted somebody to help him out. He wanted somebody to pray with him. And he sets the disciples here. He says, \"Just pray.\" And the disciples are there and they're tired. It's been a long week, man. all the stuff going on with the with Palm Sunday and then everything that with him turning over the the the tables and and all of this going on. It's like, boy, I I I just need some rest. And they are there sleeping. And here is Jesus and he says, couldn't you just stay awake for a little while? Then he wakes him up. He says, \"They're coming Thursday night. They show up. Judas leading them. He walks up to Jesus and tells the tells the soldiers. He says, \"The one that I kiss is the one that you should take.\" He walks up to Jesus and kisses him on the cheek and he says, \"Friend, you betray me with a kiss.\" They come in. There's a a bit of a skirmish. The disciples get afraid. The disciples all run away. They take Jesus that night. They bring him to the house of this of the high priest. And there the first court trial happens. Peter betrays Jesus that Thursday night. And on Friday, early in the morning, the first trial happens before Annis, the high priest. And it's still it's still it's just past midnight. He's looking, Annis is looking for an accusation and he's biting time to all the Sanhadrin gets together and they're they're trying to get people to witness against this man, Jesus Christ, these false witnesses. Then there's a second trial before the Sanhedrin and Jesus is condemned. He's slapped, beaten. Third trial. Immediately at dawn, Peter denies Jesus the third time as the rooster crows. Condemnation is just repeated of of Jesus. And then he's taken to the Romans. And the fourth trial begins before Pilate. And then the fifth trial, Pilate takes him to Herod. Another another trial takes place. Herod says, \"Oh, don't you have any miracles? I want to see a miracle. Jesus just stays quiet. In the sixth trial again before Pilate and this is the end, last one. Jesus is scorged. He's beaten the city. Pilate brings him out in front of all of the mob. And Pilate even says, \"What has he done? And he says the he says I will it's your custom I'll release to you a prisoner. He puts up the very worst that he could put knowing that they would choose this Jesus because he had never done anything wrong. They just hated him and Pilate could see that. So he puts the two there and they cry out, \"Give us Barabbus the murderer. Let him go and crucify Jesus. Pilate goes back and he's he knows they're innocent. The night before, Pilate's wife, his own wife, said, \"Have nothing to do with this man because I was warned in a dream.\" Pilate goes back and he says, \"I'm clean of this. This is your choice.\" They said, \"Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.\" Pilate goes back and he washes his hands and he says, \"I'm clean of this. still early on Friday morning. They take him to the cross about 9:00 in the morning. They crucify him. Jesus carries his cross through the city of Jerusalem. Simon the Sirene is told to help him. They carry the cross up. They put him up on Golgtha at about 9:00 in the morning. Time goes down. Jesus dies about 3:00 in the afternoon. That night, Joseph of Arythea, Nicodemus, they ask for Jesus's body. Pilate gives him the body. They take it, put him, put Jesus in a grave that had never been used before. It was Joseph's rich the rich man in his own grave. Jesus is put in the grave on Saturday on uh on Friday evening and then he lays there all day Saturday. Pilate on on Saturday, Pilate puts a guard in front of the tomb. And you can only imagine what the disciples were going through at that time. everything that they had thought that this man was. They started questioning. He couldn't have died such a shameful death if he was the Messiah. He had the power to heal all of these people. Yet, he didn't have the power to save himself. Maybe we were wrong. He was a prophet, but maybe we were wrong about this man. Saturday, you can imagine that was probably the longest day in history. Sunday morning, Mary Magdalene, God bless her loyal heart. Brother Law was telling me earlier um last week about how Mary was up before daylight and walking through the city by the light of the moon going to the grave and just as the sun was coming up Mary was a witness Jesus had risen from the grave. So those are the events of this week. What do you think? What's the most pivotal thing to you? There's no right answer to you. What means the most that happened this week? What do you think had the most um had the had had the most effect in all of these things that had happened from Sunday all the way to Sunday? Of course, not the death and resurrection. Anybody? Josiah, what do you think? I don't know. I thought about that too. I assume that he was talking about what was about to happen. And the the Jews were about to go through a very very hard time. And I mean, they had just said, \"Let his blood be upon us and upon our children.\" And Jesus tells him, \"Don't wait for me. Wait for your children.\" What else? What is a What was another one, Brother Joe? What do you think? What really struck you about the past week? Yeah. Like like Peter just running and and and losing his testimony so quickly and Jesus even he was only on the cross for very long. It even surprised I mean physically we're fragile. We um by the grace of God uh Klehano is doing well. Um, I just sent out a report. He had his but he had his uh his leg amputated and it was just it was it was from an ATV accident year a few years ago and he didn't know when he woke up that morning how fragile he really was. And all of us we we have to be so careful because we are we don't know we don't know what tomorrow holds. Someone else. So, brother Aaron said that that's a good one. That's a very good one. But Aaron said when he was praying at the Garden of Gethsemane and he was a man and he was crying out and he sword said, \"Lord, if this cup could pass from me, Lord, let it be done.\" But then he said, \"But nevertheless, thy will be done.\" And imagine if he wouldn't have said that. There would be no hope of salvation for us. But he put us above even himself. Sister Sharon. Yeah, it was in the temple. Sure. It was it was torn from top to bottom. That veil was huge. It was thick and it was torn from top to bottom because that's what hid the secret mercy seat that only the priest could go and see once of ye once a year. And God took the the veil and he ripped it from top to bottom. And it and it was a symbol saying now anyone can come to me by the blood of my son Jesus Christ. That veil was torn into Sister Sharon. I could I could start a sermon on that right now. Someone else. Brother Ed. Brother Ed said that the most impactful for him was when Jesus was dying on the cross and he said it is finished. And he wasn't just talking about his life. He was talking about this whole plan of salvation. How beautiful. There he is and he is about to die. He said, \"I can lay down my life and I can take it back up again.\" And he is up there and he says, \"Okay, now it is finished.\" And then he gave up the ghost. Brother Ed, that is beautiful. Never thought about it like that. It wasn't just finished his life. All of our sins were finished right there. Praise God. I'm loving this. Somebody else, Brother Jordan. when he did not answer. Brother Jordan said that when he didn't answer when these false accusers came came and accused him and he did not answer a word, he didn't even give witness of himself. Even when they said, \"Are you the king of Israel?\" He says, \"You say I am.\" And he was. He was the Messiah. But he says, \"You say it.\" Didn't even give witness of himself. That humble man. Pilate wanted him to. Pilate wanted to release him. Herod wanted to see a miracle. He had the power to to let him go. And he's he said, 'Oh, do a trick for me. Show me all these miracles I couldn't I just been wanting to see. I couldn't wait. I want to see some of these miracles. Show me one. I'll let you go. Didn't give him the time of day. Someone else. Sister Martha. Sister Sister Martha said, \"When the earthquake came, not only did the veil get torn, like Sister Sharon said, but the dead raised and came out of the graves.\" I was thinking about that yesterday. And the people recognized them. They were walking around. I wish I I wish I knew. What does that mean? That the people recognize him. It's like, \"Oh, Moses, was it really like that?\" But they came out and they walked. That power of Jesus Christ, the power of the blood of Christ, those men that had been dead for some of them probably a thousand years or more came out of the grave on that day. Tremendous. Someone else, Sister Sarah Jesus says he set his face to Jerusalem. So he knew he was going. But we see the battle of his mind in heity where that moment of surrender was there. And then when they came, he was like, \"Okay, now I'm going.\" And from then on, it was he didn't open his mouth. He didn't argue. It was that moment in the garden of surrender. And that's the part that speaks to me today because we have to do the same thing. And he was our ultimate role model. He's the one that we pattern after. And he showed us there sometimes the are not the thing that you're doing the sacrifice but it's actually the will that's laid down for me is so important so that sister Sarah said that when he laid down his life we talked about on the cross she said he really laid down his life the first time at Gethsemane where he said not not my will, but thy will. And that was Jesus's surrender. And then everything else followed after that. That was the battle that was in the mind of the man, Jesus Christ. Remember, he was God made flesh. Don't forget the flesh part. The flesh part is the part that has thoughts that come into your mind. the doubts come in, the desires come in. He knew how it was. He was a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. So, he had a battle that night, a a battle that maybe had never been fought before. It was so powerful. And he overcame that night. And that's when we finally make that decision. Lord, I want to serve you. I I'm all in. That's when things change and then later on we see the power of God manifested. Amen. Someone else sister Millia but I was also thinking about Judas mother to Jesus. Only a mother. Sister Ameilia is a mother. A mother thinks on those things. This man did this to my son. This man betrayed my son. this man went and lied about my son. And he did. Judas left that night and went and sold Jesus Christ, the Messiah, to his death. And Mary praying for her son, loving her son, walking down the street, watching her son who was beaten and bloodied and and dripping with blood carry trying to carry this cross. He couldn't even hold it up himself. How does mom feel? That was her little boy. She nursed him as a baby. She raised him. How do you think mom would feel? One more. Yeah. Is he? Yeah. showing them house. Yeah. I mean, as he was saying that the the situation that really struck her was when Jesus was turning over the money change money changers table and he came in and and he greeted him with anger, but it showed her how we should respect the house of the Lord and and reverence what we're doing. And I would like to add to what you say that Jesus is our savior. Jesus is our friend. Jesus is the one that has taken our sins upon him. But if we don't give our lives to him, one day he will be our judge. Remember the parable about the the talents and being cast into outer darkness. Jesus will judge and there will be justice for those that do not accept that blood. Is he? It's the most important thing. my you want to hear mine even if you don't I'm gonna say it. Um the uh to me I think the most pivotal day was Wednesday today. Not much is said about that. But let me read what happened. Matthew chapter 26 verse 6. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he sat at me, as he sat at at dinner. Um, I'll be I'll be right back. I need to take a break for a second. I'm just kidding. I'll be right back. this uh brother Paul Murray, brother Paul's here. He gave me this. It's uh it's anointing oil, but I'd like everybody to just take a smell of it and pass it around. But it's a it's it's a very strong smell. And uh let me let me explain here. I have a few minutes. Let me explain. A lot of people think that this is Mary Magdalene that an anointed Jesus. And and and there's actually it's it's not a definitive answer. There's scholars that say it was Mary Magdalene. Other scholars say it wasn't. But brother Jordan, if or uh whoever's in charge of the video, could you put up the big map of Israel and see um where is the laser? So it says, and I'll read it. It says that that this woman that came in, she was from Bethany. And you see Bethany, Jerusalem is right here. You can see Beth Bethany is right here by Bethlehem. It's it's very close to Jerusalem. Mary Magdalene, she shows up in Galilee. Galilee is way up here. And you see this Sea of Galilee here by the uh the city of Capernium where Jesus's ministry started. Way up way up there where Peter was from, there is a town called Magdala. So when you say Mary Magdalene, you're they are saying that this is Mary from Magdala, right? And she was probably from this area right here because that's where you see Mary Magdalene show up. Mary of Bethany is down here by Jerusalem. So when it when we we talk about this Mary of Bethany, she was the sister of Martha and the sister of Jesus's good buddy Lazarus. So I I believe that this Mary that is going to anoint Jesus here is not Mary Magdalene but is actually Mary the sister of Martha. Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat. So you can smell that that anointing oil that's going around. It was a really strong smell. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation saying, \"To what purpose is this waste?\" when his disciples, it was Judas that said that to what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor. John chapter 12, you can stay here. John chapter 12 says this. Then saith one of his telling the same story. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas is carrot is carrot. Simon's son which should betray him. Why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor? This he said not that he cared for the poor. This is John writing. John knew him. This he this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had to bag and bear what was put there in back to Matthew. And when Jesus understood it, he said unto them, why trouble ye the woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me. To me, that's a key. She's done something good for me. For ye have for ye have the poor always with you, but me you have not always. As they were going down in the book of John, as they were walking down from Jerusalem to um to the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is telling them, he's saying, \"I am going to leave.\" He's saying, \"I am leaving, but it's good that I leave because I'm going to re because the the comforter will come after me.\" But he was warning them that I am leaving. And here he says it right here. He says that that she's done something good for me because the poor you'll always have with you. It's good to do good for the poor. It's good to buy them clothes. It's good to give them a handout or whatever. But they're going to get hungry again. It really doesn't do a whole lot to help the poor. It's good and we should do it, but Jesus is like, \"You're always going to have the poor, but me, I'm leaving. For ye have for for have for ye have the poor always with you, but me, you have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.\" Not knowing what she was doing, she felt compelled to do something for this man, Jesus. For she for for in that I'll read it again. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body. She did it for my burial. She didn't know what she was doing. Jesus was about to die. the next two days later, less than two days later, he was going to be dead on the cross. And he's saying that she's doing this and he wasn't going he didn't even get to be anointed. It was right at the Passover. They had to get him in the grave. And two men went down and and did it. That's why Mary Magdalene and they were coming later on to anoint him with the o with the oil. He says, \"But she's doing it for me. I'm going to get anointed. Verily I say unto you, whosoever this gospel, whosoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also of this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial to her. Think about all the great people in the Bible. How Shamgar saved the Hebrews from the invading Philistines. great stories. How Samson killed a thousand Philistines with a jawbone of a of a donkey. How Gideon led like 300 soldiers in a battle against overwhelming odds and won. How the woman named Jail in the book of Judges. How she drove the tent stake through the head of the of the runaway king. These great stories. How Hannah cried at the altar for the Lord to give her a baby and then God heard her and gave her this great prophet Samuel. in the New Testament, how Peter and John healed the lame man at the gate called beautiful. All of these wonderful memorials that read, how Peter discerned the thoughts of Ananas and Safh. How Peter preached the day of Pentecost and thousands came to the Lord. How Paul cast out a demon of the witch, the woman that was possessed by the by the demon that was following him. How Paul was bitten by a poisonous snake and he threw it into the fire like nothing happened. How many times do we remember all of these great things that happened as a memorial? We preach on them all the time. But this woman that anointed Jesus with the oil, all those other ones that I mentioned and everybody else, who actually did something for Jesus himself, who actually had the honor of doing something for the son of God, giving him a little gift, giving him a little help. This ointment, it says how much it was, is probably pushing a year's salary, maybe. She spent all of this money. And you and I might be like, well, why is she spending this money like Judas was? But the one chance that someone got to do something for Jesus in the flesh and she did it. I don't know anyone that can compare to her. And he says that she'll this will be told for memorial to her for generations to come. And we're doing it right now. Fulfilling scripture. Whoever Peter, Paul, James, all of them, whoever actually did something for Jesus, he did he he did it for all of us. He he died on the cross for us. He heals our sickness. He does he does things all the time for us. But this woman actually got to do something for him. No wonder she spent so much money. That was her chance. Now she's immortalized as one of the few people that has ever actually done something for the son of God. We can today Jesus said, \"If you want to do something for me, do it for my disciples. Do it for my children.\" But he was in the flesh then and she got to do it. then one of the 12. So she does this. Judas sees it. Here's the pivotal thing to me. Judas is watching. He sees her come in with this alabaster box that was probably $10,000 maybe in our money or more. She comes in with this. She breaks it. Nobody had washed his feet. Nobody had welcomed him. She breaks it and she puts this priceless ointment on his head and anoints him. And Jesus made him feel good. Helped him. Maybe the sun was was maybe he was sunburned. Maybe maybe he was tired. But it helped him and she got to do it. Judas was watching and it got to him. Things changed right there. He couldn't handle it anymore. What a waste. We could take all of that money and we could use it for something else. And John's like, \"No, no, no. This guy's a crook anyways.\" But he said it. He thought it in his in his heart. Then one of the 12 called Judas his carrot went to the chief priests that put him over the top and said unto them, \"What will you give me and I will deliver him unto you?\" And they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver. And from that time he sought to he sought the opportunity to betray Jesus. All because this lady Mary, boy, she was she was great. She did it. And G and Judas resented it. And that's what turned his mind. And then he went after Jesus. And it ends up I told the story earlier. God bless you. If uh musicians would come and we'll close. So during this week we have I went through everything tomorrow, Thursday, Garden of Gethsemane and then Friday, Good Friday, Saturday and then the resurrection on Sunday. Think about it this week. Study it. Study the word this week. Put yourself in the position of the disciples. I would love I'll tell you what in this whole story there's one person I would want to be and that was Mary of Bethany. No matter Bible says before she was a sinner she had all kinds of problems in her life but we're still preaching about her and that's not going to change until until we come and go to heaven. Then we'll be able to meet her in person and thank her for her testimony. Thank her for what she did for Jesus. Down from his [Music] glory, everliving story. [Music] My God and Savior came and Jesus was his name. Born in a [Music] manger to his own a strangeanger. [Music] A man of sorrows, tears, and agony. Verse two, what [Music] condensation bringing us redemption. that in the dead of night, not one faint hope inside. God gracious tender laid aside his [Music] splender. Stooping to ru to win to save my soul. And oh how I love him. How I adore [Music] him. My breath, my sunshine, my all in all. [Music] The great creator became my [Music] savior and all God's [Music] fullness dwell in him without [Music] Reluctance. Flesh and blood is [Music] substance. He took the form of man revealed aheaden plan. Think of it now. Oh glorious [Music] mystery, the sacrifice of [Music] Calary. And now I know thou art the great I am. Do you love him? Oh, how I love him. How I adore him. My breath, my [Music] sunshine, my all in all. [Music] The great [Music] creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him. [Music] I think Mary was singing that song before Jesus went to the cross. Can you imagine that woman? You know how I love him, how I adore him, spending all of that money on that that oil and bringing it to the son of God. She got to do something. I have more respect for that little lady as much as anyone else in this whole story of the resurrection. And it was such a great act, such a such a great thing that Satan hated it so much. That was when Satan said enough is enough and sent his servant Judas's carrot out to destroy Jesus Christ. It was a pivotal time. Thank you friends for all of the the good input tonight. Boy, I enjoyed that. That was really, really good. Let's all stand. keep praying for Hano. He uh I was at the hospital today with him and I just love that family so much. He's he looks a little different. He's wheeling in on his wheelchair. He gave me a big smile. I looked at him. All of that hair is gone. is just the sweetest kid. He uh came in and we were talking and I really believe the Lord has a work for him to do. I believe the Lord has a work for all of us to do. I really do. And I look at each one each person here and I just it's like, \"Oh yeah, the work has a the Lord has a work for him. The Lord has a work for her. The Lord has a He has a work for all of us. None of us are any greater than any of the other other ones. He loves us all and he will use us as much as we will surrender to him. Look at this little lady Mary. She had seen her brother raised from the dead. Jesus even told her that he appreciated her just listening to him when he talked. tells he tells Martha and Mary he says you know Mary Mary's Martha you work hard and you take care of me but she's more right and just listening to my words I think I just the story of this little lady I'll probably preach about it again on Easter morning but um just tremendous that she got to do something for Jesus and look what all that Jesus does for us now he's he's Great brother Josiah. You are worthy of it [Music] all. You are worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the gloryy. You are worthy of it all. You are worthy of it [Music] all.

Are you staying in Tucson &gt;&gt; for two days? &gt;&gt; For two days. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you. It's an honor to have you with us tonight. Welcome. We're going to tonight we are going to listen to our original church dedication. And this happened 60 years ago almost to the day. Brother Brandham and brother Green dedicated this this church not in this building, another building, but we claim it. It's the same Tucson Tabernacle that was dedicated way back then. for um for some of the I don't see any new people James maybe uh maybe maybe you some of the history here is uh the founder of our church brother Perry Green uh he was very close with a wonderful man named William Brandham prophet of God and tremendous ministry way back in the 50s and 60s and this church was founded in a very very special way. Tonight we're going to hear the dedication of the church and then we are going to have our 60-y year anniversary and and rededication of the church Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We'll have those meetings looking really I'm really really looking forward to those. I want to give a little bit of a background to what's going on for this sermon that we're going to listen to tonight. Brother Brandham, uh, I'll start with my grandfather. I was very, very close to Brother Brandon, my dad and my family, and he lived down in Georgia. And he always wanted to move up to Jeffersonville. and he would ask, \"Brother Brandham, I'd like to come up and and be there with you in Jeffersonville.\" And brother Brandham would always say, \"No, Brother Evans, I want you to stay in Georgia right now. I feel that that's that's the best thing for you to do.\" And Brother Brandon would come down and stay with my family really since like around 1950 or early 50s. They're very, very close. And he would every once in a while he'd say, \"Brother Brandham, you know, I'd like to be close to you. I'd like to drive all of this way every weekend from Georgia all the way to southern Indiana.\" And brother Brandham would just kind of say, \"Well, you know, I do whatever you want, but I would wait.\" And then in 1962, Brother Brandham called up my grandpa and he said, \"Brother Evans,\" he said, \"you still want to move to Jeffersonville.\" and he says, \"Yeah, I'd like to.\" And he says, \"Well, if it was me,\" he said, \"I'd move to Tucson.\" He said, \"Because I'm moving to Tucson.\" So, my grandpa and the family, they uh sold the business in Georgia. And Brother Brandham found a station, a service station on Park Avenue, not too far from here. And he said, he told my grandpa, he said, \"This would be a nice place for the brothers to come together and be able to fellowship with each other during the day and whatever time they want to come together.\" He said, \"I wish I had a place that was just kind of a meeting place for all the brethren to come together and just enjoy themselves.\" And he found that station over on Park Avenue. And so my grandfather bought the station and he ran that station for a while. And you're going to hear brother Brandham in this sermon. I've listened to the sermon, I don't know, four or five times in the past few weeks. You're going to hear brother Brandham talk about this church giving the people a place to go to church, a place to fellowship. And it's people from really from all over the country. It's brother Green is from Bumont, Texas. Then um my uh my grandpa was from Georgia. My my mom's family did the same thing. They they moved out here. My my other grandfather was a deacon for brother Brandham. And uh they started uh grandpa told me that they started a lot of the leaders in the church started having dreams that they should also move to Tucson. So that there was many of them that made the decision also to move here. and uh this church provided them a place to go. And you'll hear at the end towards the end of the sermon, brother Brandham says that or um during the sermon a couple times he says that, you know, it gives the people a place to go so they're not the kids aren't out riding their bikes on Sunday and they they don't basically disrespect Sunday. He wanted them to be in church. And this place provided that provided that for my family, from my ancestors, and for many of yours. And and um maybe even I don't I doubt anyone was there when brother Random dedicated this church many years ago, but it provided a place for the people to go and fellowship just like my grandpa's station gave the brothers a chance. have have a nice place of fellowship. Friends, fellowship's important. It's important that that we are together. It's important that we come together as many times as we can to come to church. And it's important that we are also together when we're not in church. It's important to just see each other and encourage each other. Go to lunch with each other. Have have dinner. Do do the things. Go hiking. Enjoy Tucson. En enjoy each other's fellowship. It gives us strength. The Bible tells us, it says, don't neglect that the assembling together. Um especially as you see the day approaching. And that's not just going to church. Going to church is is the the the biggest part of it, but it's also being together. And how many times did the brethren get together at that service station and just laugh and talk about give each other's testimonies and how important that was. And then the most important place really was this place that brother Green had it on his heart to move here and to start this church. And it was tremendous. Really was. You're gonna hear Brother Brandham talk about a man named Jack Moore. Jack Moore was a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was a longtime friend of brother Brandon. Very long time. Do you remember the story in I believe it was around the mid40s, maybe around 1947 around there where Brother Brandham was in Oregon and there was a man that came in that wanted to disrupt the service and was going to take a swing at Brother Brandham in the pull pit. And the man came running down the aisle to take him out and brother Brandham called upon the name of the Lord and the man fell down right at his feet. You remember that story? Jack Moore saw that he was there and another man that you might know his name TL Osborne. Both of them, these are James, these are great evangelists back in the 1950s. Both of them saw this happen. Jack Moore got on the phone to this other man that you might know his name named Gordon Lindsay and he said, \"Hey, you gotta get up here because this is something special. This is a big deal. This man is praying for the sick and all these people are getting healed. This just happened.\" So Gordon Lindsay came into the picture and he eventually became Brother Bram's campaign manager and Jack Moore a close friend. And this was uh Brother Green knew all of those people. He was friends with them because of the Christian businessman. I wish I could have I wish I could have talked with brother Green about about these men and about all that he knew in dealing with these these brothers they um so after this sermon that we're going to hear tonight when brother Green brother Brandham dedicated this church then brother Brandham and I think he mentions it in the sermon he drives to Shrivefeport Louisiana to um have a series of meetings there and while he was there he pre I mean he preached some of the really that series in shreport is just wonderful one of the sermons that he preached I believe was preached by prophecy and uh sister hope that song in the wings of a snow white dove I've told this story before you all know it but I'm going to tell it again um because I like it brother Brandham and my dad and my grandfather were together in Georgia, I believe it was, and brother Brandham said, \"Have you heard that new song on the radio by Ferland Husky called On the Wings of a Snow White Dove?\" It was a popular um the country music uh radio radio would play it and uh it's just a well you heard the song that Sister Hope sang and my grandpa and my dad said yeah you know we've heard it and brother Brandham said I have a message I'm going to preach and he said I'm going to title it on the wings of a snow white dove and he says when you hear me preach that sermon he said you know it's my time to go and that was in I think it was in 1961 one is when that song came out as a brand new song. Then fast forward to the dedication of our church in 1965. November 21st, 1965. Brother Brandham says that I'm about to go to Shreveport. And he goes to Shreveport and he preaches a sermon called On the Wings of a Snow White Dove. My dad was there. My grandpa was there. and they didn't remember when they were there that he had told them this years before that it was his time to to go when when the sermon was preached. Then brother Brandham preaches those sermons and he even says in that sermon he says this is a memorial service [snorts] and he had a prayer line and Jack Moore came up the one that he's going to mention all of his old many of brother Bram's old friends came up and they had a prayer line and they prayed for the people that was that was again that was just a few days after the sermon we're going to hear tonight brother Brandham came back to Tucson uh he went to uh he went to California and went to Yuma's always gone. Came back to Tucson and within a month of when he preached this sermon uh the on the wings of a snow white dove sermon and then within a month and a few days of this sermon he was in a tragic car wreck and died. And I believe this church was very very important to brother you're going to hear it tonight how important it was to brother Brad. He preached the series in Shreport preached a a sermon in um Yuma a wonderful sermon called the rapture. came back, preached um ministered with brother Green communion on December 12th, 1965 and then was few days later was driving back home back to Jeffersonville and was in a car wreck and then died on Christmas Eve in 1965. sermon we're going to listen to tonight was leading up to to that um Jack Moore, Brother Brandham, he mentions this twice in this sermon about brother Green and it to me is just striking what brother Brandham says. He says this, I mean, right when he gets going, second the second paragraph, he says this. I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother Green several times speak and I will and I certainly was influenced and as he brought the word of the Lord to us and so humble about it. Listen to this. Yesterday, brother Brand speaking about brother Green yesterday. He said, \"I don't get the word from the Lord as maybe it would come in Revelation as it's been sent, but said, I like to stress on what has been said.\" He said, \"Like when Paul wrote something in the Bible, I come here to stress on what he said.\" Said, \"I have no message only to stress on what's been what's already been said from the Lord.\" Brother Brandham says, \"Now, that was really remarkable. a young fellow like that and say and make a remark like that. Then later on, brother Brandham comes back to it. It made such an impression on brother Random and as his word brother Randman later on he says this and as his word said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of of the inspiration as it does maybe to some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given. What a statement, Brother Brandham said. And I was listening, I've been listening to this, like I said, over over and over for the past month. And I mentioned that I had that experience with it was almost like brother Green was in front of me and I knew that he was suffering. I knew that he was hurt because some of the things that he was saying and it was a time that of just horrible turmoil that there there was these fights with the copyright and and all of these problems and he was brother Green was just being hit. He was being attacked. And as I was I had that experience with brother Green and I just wanted to tell him that I really just appreciated it. I really appreciated what he was trying to do. And from what I've heard brother Green speak and it's something that really hits me um hard and and sometimes I I get I almost resent some people doing this and I've never heard brother Green do it in in the sermons that I've listened to. I don't feel like brother Green ever took, at least I've never heard him take what brother Brandham said and then tried to tell you what brother Brandham meant when he said it. I just feel like he had too much respect to do that. He always pointed to him. He always pointed to what he said and he used his own experiences to point people to the prophet. And I think that's a good legacy to have. And brother Brandham said it on this tape. He said that he he said that what brother Green was doing. And then for the next 50 years after that, Brother Green would go all over the world and point back to Brother Brown. And he did it better than anyone else did in my opinion. He lifted he lifted brother Bram's ministry up. He pointed back to him. He gave his the testimonies that he had. He used them to promote this man's ministry. And I think he did an absolutely outstanding job. And in fact, in fact, I think he did not just an outstanding job. I don't think anyone could compare to what he did. in and what brother Green again using what he had learned using his own experiences and doing exactly what brother Brandham said in the tape that we're going to hear tonight for 50 years he did it. man has my respect very much so and I will give I'll give as I was praying about this and as I was studying on these things really over the past month um one one experience that I have kept coming to mind and really it has to do with this church and I used to come to this church every once in a while when I dating Stephanie and um then of course we moved to Jeffersonville when we got married. But uh this one hits me and it's something that this church and especially Brother Green is responsible for. And that is in 2000 I believe it was 2012 that a Jewish man I was working in the ministry in Jeffersonville and a Jewish man called And his conversation with me really shook me up because basically he was telling me that I was wrong in everything that I thought I was right in. But he was right. What happened was this man, he was introduced miraculously to the Lord Jesus. He was a practicing Jew and as a young man he was introduced to the Lord Jesus. Somebody came by and gave him a Gideon Bible. And he says, \"I don't want it. I'm not uh I'm not Catholic. That's Catholic. It's about Mary and all that.\" And the man said, \"No, just read it.\" And he they argued back and forth. Well, finally he he took the little New Testament Bible and he said, \"I couldn't take it and not read it.\" So then he read it and he saw that this wasn't about Mary and the Pope and all of that. This New Testament was as Jewish as the Old Testament was. Everybody in the New Testament was Jewish. Peter and James and John and Paul and all of them, these were Jews. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Jesus was within, of course, we know he was God's son, but the lineage is from the the the um lineage of David. And so he saw this and it just really struck him. And then he he was praying about it. He gave his heart to the Lord Jesus. And his family kind of disowned him for doing it. And he ended up um he ended up uh having a vision and in that vision the Lord came to him and among other things he said that someone within a week someone is going to bring you a further a um I forgot his exact words but someone's going to bring you something that's very important. So with about three or four days later, he gets a knock on his door and it's this man, a tall thin man, and he says, \"Can I talk to you about the Lord?\" And my this Jewish man, he says, he says, \"Oh, I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus.\" He says, \"I was Jew.\" He says, \"Now now and now I know the Bible and and now I understand that they're all Jewish and this is a Jewish book and it's really not for the Gentiles. I mean, you guys get it, but but it's really for us, you know, and he starts telling about how the the New Testament is actually for the Jews and the Gentiles. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys are good, but but kind of stay out of our way. So, he and then this man says, \"I want to tell you that God sent a prophet.\" And he says, \"Oh.\" He says, \"I had a vision, you know, a few days ago.\" And uh this man introduces them to the same ministry that brother Green fell in love with many many years ago and he um gives him contact information for the Tucson Tabernacle. Now he's living in San Diego. He drives to Tucson, comes to this church, and he he he bought the full volume of those red books that Brother Green published. You know which ones I'm talking about. Those red books are just basically the transcribed sermons. And he because he bought those, he didn't have enough money to get back home to San Diego. So he gets to Yuma and he runs out of money and he goes and works in the fields picking onions to get enough gas to drive back all the way to San Diego. So when he gets back and he starts reading these books and starts studying this and his longtime girlfriend who he was engaged to marry his her parents said that he wasn't a high enough class Jew to marry their daughter. So they forced her to marry another Jewish boy. It broke Ram's heart. Ram left. He went back home back to Jerusalem where he lived for a long time. And for like 20 years, all that man knew of William Brandham was those volumes of books. He never heard another message preacher. He never heard anyone else give witness. He never heard anything. All that he ever knew was those volumes of books. He was at the I knew another man. remember um Frier Tuck [laughter] um what was his name? Steve Goldberg. Steve Goldberg was a Jew and he was uh he would fellowship with us. The tape's short, so [laughter] that's the highlight. I'm just trying to build up to it. So Steve Goldberg, who I knew in Jeffersonville at the Brandon Tabernacle, he would sit and the guy he would sit in the front and brother Joe, he was like twice your size, but built like you, but the guy was just a a fire plug, you know, and and he was he would sit in the front and he would fall asleep and snore every service and it's like, \"Brother Steve, sit in the back.\" But anyways, he uh he he was he was just a really neat guy. And he told me, I knew he was Jewish. And I said, \"Hey, give me your testimony.\" And Steve says, he says, \"Well,\" he says, \"It's it's an angel came to me.\" He says, \"I was at the Whailing Wall in Jerusalem.\" And he said, \"I was praying at the Wailing Wall.\" He says, \"I was from the United States.\" And and but I was going there. It was kind of a pilgrimage. And I was praying at the Wailing Wall. And he said, \"This little man came up to me.\" And he starts witnessing to me about the Lord Jesus. And he said, \"He was so compelling in what he said that I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus right there at the wailing wall.\" And he said he was just one of the he said he said, \"Brother, this man was an absolute angel.\" And he said he told me when I get back to go to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and there I would find more information. And he said, I went and he he said, I went back and I prayed and I looked back and he was gone. He said, \"Brother, there was an angel.\" And I was like, \"Wow.\" You know, that's that was one of the coolest testimonies I've ever heard in my life. Here's this Jew at the Wailing Wall and an angel comes down and introduced into the Lord Jesus and now he's in Jeffersonville and I know him and I'm friends with him and and after I met Ram, my friend from San Diego who had who had gone and and just been studying those books, he asked me, he said, \"Oh, yeah.\" He goes, \"Brother Daniel,\" he says, \"I forgot to ask you.\" He says, \"I met a man at the Whailing Wall one time named Steve Goldberg.\" He said, \"Did you ever hear of him?\" I was like, \"You're the angel?\" He goes, \"What?\" I said, \"Brother Ram, he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus at that moment that you witnessed to him and he did exactly what you said.\" and he is still here this day. And he he was happy about that. It put him in a in touch with each other. And then the thing that meant the most to me about this man was he was a complete virgin to brother Brandham's message. He didn't have all of these different doctrines that we have today. And you can see maybe why I minister the way that I do. And he told me that his first words to me, one of his first words to to me that very first conver conversation, he said, \"You ruined William Brandham's message.\" The Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, \"Listen to him.\" And all of this was because Brother Green had it on his heart to publish these books and to get them into the hands of the people. got them into the hands of a Jewish man and ram rashover. That man brought these books all the way to Israel and studied them for 20 years before he got Crohn's disease and had to come back to Phoenix to have a a surgery done and then he lived out his days in Hawaii, no less. But I was friends with him for a year and he was a tremendous impact on me. really because it comes back to this place and the burden that Perry Green had on his heart to do exactly what brother Brandham said in this sermon, quoting Brother Green and and saying that Brother Green, he wanted to just build on on what other men had done, what their revelation, which he dedicated his life to doing that and I think many of us are here today because of that. So I was just blessed beyond measure to listen to this sermon because it comes right down to me. Not not just because my family on both sides was really close to William Brandon. Not because of that and not because of um that I'm now trying to fill very very big shoes. And brother Green, a great man of God and and and one of the um somebody everyone knows around the world. I could never fill those shoes. But because of those red books that he felt on his heart, they they have a huge impact on me and and my ministry and my direction that the Lord has placed me. So, we're going to hear some we'll hear that. We will um I said he talks about Jack Moore and explain I've been to Jack Moore's church. I I didn't go to a service, but it's still there in Shreveport. I don't know if it's the exact same place, but still they they followed his um his lead. And brother Brandham, you'll hear brother Brandham say, and as I said, brother Moore was a close friend of him. Brother Brandham was like, \"Yeah, but he just never really believed me, you know, and and I think it was on a couple of the doctrines that Brother Brandham had.\" And you could see that he really appreciated brother Green because he stood right there and said, \"I believe it.\" [laughter] So, let's um let's all stand and let's sing the battle hymn that Brother Brandham would always have sung when he would take the pulpit. This great old tune called Only Believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things [singing] are possible. Only be seated. &gt;&gt; November the 21st. What house will you you build me? Really appreciate it. I appreciate the whole thing. Brother Brandon prayed that this place would be a place that we can invite people to place that we could invite our our neighbors and our friends and I hope that this place grows again. It was really big and then it didn't it's the the Tucson Tabernacle was really really big and then it got small. But you know what? It didn't get small. What happened was all these other churches around formed and they flourished. So it's been a blessing. I remember brother Brandham said when um when uh Junior Jackson and Don Ruddle when they left the Brandom Tabernacle and then Brother Bram said great. He says he says this is good. He says we'll just fill it back up again and then we'll just dump it out again. That's the attitude that we should have. So let's fill this place up. Let's let's make this place that same thing that brother Brandon prayed that it would be. Let this place be a strength and a lighthouse to this city called Tucson. We together. Let's all stand. Daniel, my boat alive sails on a troubled sea wherever there's a wind in my sail. that I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into a girl. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm, make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky. Among the peaks my [music] soul can be found. An unexpected storm may [music] drive me from the heights, may bring me low, but can never bring me down. I know the master of the wind and I know the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm. [music] Make the sun shine again. I know the master of the real. Sorry. I know the master of the wind. [music] I know [singing] the maker of the rain. And he can calm the storm, make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. Please this week pray. Pray for our church. We went through a at least I did went through a really hard time the past few weeks. And those hard times make us better. They make us stronger. They shake the foundations a little bit. that that old tree that's planted by the water, that wind comes and and that and it shakes that tree and it just loosens up those roots a little bit so they can grow. The the the the ground gets really hard and the roots have a tough time penetrating that ground, but when that tree is shaken, then that ground loosens up and and then out goes those new roots to allow that tree to continue to grow. Brother Aaron Garrett, would you come and close as brother Aaron's coming? I want to read this again. Says here, and I believe by that that almighty God will bless you if you will just stand by this church now, this group of people. Not only that, but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in. See, let's speak to others everywhere. Speak to them about our church. What it means we're here. We want you to come bring strangers. And I'm sure it will be good for all of us. We have a building which we're thankful for. We're thankful for this place to gather together. I really believe that's the spirit that's in our church now. And there are many people, you see them on Sunday morning. There are many people that have found a place. They found a home. I know I'm looking at one of them right now. Raise your hand, James. Bless you, my friend. We're glad to have you. That's what we stand for. We love the Lord and we serve the Lord and the only way that we have to serve the Lord. He's God. We can't do anything for him. We can sure do things for his people. Amen. This December will be 50 years since we first came visited for the December meetings. 50 years have passed. A lot has happened, but he has never failed and he he will not fail. So, let's just just believe that. Lord, as we listen to your servant, Brother Brand speak and and pray over the brother Green that would be the pastor of this place for a long time. But greater than that is your promise to never leave us. &gt;&gt; Amen. to watch over us, Lord. And though we might fail, and though we might do something wrong, and you still love us, we're your children, Lord. So, we want to go forward first of all in you. Let Christ be made known through us to others. The scripture says that we are the light of the world, Lord, and that's Christ in us. May this church always be a place where we weary pilgrims can come and find rest. &gt;&gt; The rest is not necessarily so much physical but a resting of the heart and the spirit Lord. And then to continue on the journey Lord. May we pray for one another. May we support one another Lord. May we encourage one another always. Sometimes it seems like somebody has a greater part. But if you begin to take out the foundation, all of it will come down, Lord. Strengthen us more today. We pray, Lord, as we commit this weekend, Lord, to you. May we give our all for it, Lord, as you gave your all, Lord. Bless each one as they go home, Lord, and as the next few days that come forward. Lord, we just anticipating that you, Lord, would meet with us in Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. I know the master [singing] of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. And he can [music and singing] calm the storm and make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. I'm excited. I feel good. There's good spirit here tonight. We're not too many people, but it doesn't matter. God can he can take one man and he can part the Red Sea. And I know that he promised us that if we would be here, the same one that parted the Red Sea, the same one that um multiplied the fishes and the loaves is the same one maybe with us here tonight. I just I feel I feel that he's pleased. God bless you, friends. Remember These meetings this weekend are very very important. So please invite invite whoever you think would benefit from uh from these meetings. Friday night really looking forward. We're going to have um some testimonies from some of the maybe the newer people that came have come over the past couple years. And then if we have time, brother Steve Personne will say a few words. He's a wonderful ministry for families. And then on Saturday night, brother Steve uh will minister for us. And then on Sunday morning, we will talk about the direction of the church, the missionary program that I want to um talk with the church about. And uh just that we're going to continue on. We're going to continue on this journey. And I think that we got our commission tonight to bring them in. So let's continue to do that. God bless you, friends. You're dismissed. I pray the Lord will be with you. See you Friday night. Hosana. Blessed be [music and singing] the rock. Blessed be the rock of my salvation. Hosana. Oh, blessed be the rock.

the asphalt they're going to repave it and I was just warning the people to go slow when you when you come in the in the parking lot brother Joe sent me a note saying that he said it's just another sign It's Just Another Blessing and that they're going to pave our street out front and give us a nice nice asphalt to drive on no more bumps on the road and I just thought hey man you know brother Joe I was thinking the same thing and I'm just grateful it's a little bit of a hardship now but the the good times coming the good pavement's coming and we might be going through a little hard time right now we might be struggling a little bit right now but there's a good time coming there's a nice smooth road ahead of us and that's a promise for us and a welcome a couple special boys to me Joel

that song sister Jessica sang that song at camp and wow it just it was amazing it was just we had an amazing camp if you I think most people were there um I'll share some testimonies in the coming services but I really believe the Lord was with us I believe he paved the way for a nice time and I think he was working on quite a few Souls at camp and I saw that in the last day that couple people I never thought whatever give the hearts to the Lord to be touched made a commitment in their life um it was a blessing um we were sitting around the fire we had some really nice conversations and worship around the campfire and had some of the young people around and I asked him I said what would encourage you so a lot of times we don't have a full house on Wednesday night and Sunday night I said what would encourage you to serve the Lord to to to be excited about the Lord and one of the numer girls said that you know we really appreciate testimonies we really appreciate hearing what the Lord's doing in other people's lives what you didn't know is that I had already scheduled a service um the uh next weekend that we're just going to have a testimony service and that's that's next Sunday I think I told you at the fire that it was this Sunday but I already had it on the schedule and it was already on my heart to do it so when you said that it was it was just confirmation that no this is right let's continue on this way and so next Sunday next Sunday evening be prepared for testimonies and I wanted to go orderly so if you have a testimony to give let's let's keep it short and if you could um contact one of the brothers and we'll put you on a list and I'll just go down the list with testimonies and that also includes song specials too I want to get in some song specials and some testimonies just a nice time of worship I think the Lord would be pleased with it I think he was leading me and you saying that it really it gave me confirmation this is this is the right thing to do I have a testimony I want to share Stephanie and I were we're working late out here wanted to get the the kids room done for the kids I forgot it was a Friday night or a Saturday night sister Debbie when you stopped by it was a Thursday night so Stephanie and I were there and we were working and uh we're here knock at the door and sister Debbie comes in with this little girl sweet little girl her name's Riza she's 11 years old it's her niece she brings her in and and we show around the new area that we had back there and she seemed to like it with all the games and the and everything in there and and I I told her I said you need to come to church you need to come so she came to church and she went um she went to Sunday school and she went to I think she was up in Stephanie's class and she came home she had her book bag and her Bible and all of that and she told sister Debbie she said you know I I didn't I always was afraid of church it was always scary to me she'd never been she thought church was like you see in the movies with these weird old Catholic priests and all these weird spirits and the horror movies she didn't know that church is actually a loving place and a good place so she came to church and she enjoyed it so she couldn't she wanted to come back and she she couldn't have come back for a couple weeks she was busy with her family and sister Debbie said that uh was it uh yesterday or did you say Saturday what day was it they were in the in the wreck it was on Sunday night they were caught they were driving on I-10 and a semi was in front of them and the semi in front of them slammed on the brakes and the dad who is the driver he couldn't stop in time so he slams into the back of the semi somebody somebody behind them slams into them the car starts spinning around on the highway and comes to a stop and and of course the EMS come and the Wreckers are there and they give them a ride to the uh to a nearby service station and sister Debbie drove up to pick him up and of course everyone was telling them how dangerous of a situation that was and no one got hurt and the only real damage to the car was was the right front wheel got bent and they couldn't drive it so sister Debbie comes in and she tells Risa her niece who knew nothing about the Lord friends nothing she'd never been to church she she had never there was no background there at all and she tells Risa she says the Lord God protected you and Riza says I know she says when we got after the wreck when we got here she says I went into the bathroom and I prayed I thought oh Lord how sweet that's why we're here we're here not to get to somebody to believe like us or get somebody converted or fill up a church we're here to get people to Christ and sister Debbie it didn't you got the little girl to where she loves the Lord she's going to start coming to church she she enjoyed it she saw all the people that were so sweet and nice and they loved her and she just she wants to come back I thought praise God thank thank the Lord for kindness and love because that will win over every time that little girl she'll know the Lord Jesus and I believe with all my heart because of how the Lord is using you sister Debbie and using this church she's going to be with us at an eternal camp where we will be all together and everything will be good and we'll be praising the Lord and and sister Jessica will be singing and and Daniel will be playing and and we'll just we'll just have a great time forever and there'll be people there that you may not have ever known just like this Native American man that brother Aaron was talking about there'll be people like him there and they have come because of our witness and our testimony is what the word tells us so let's all stand wow brother Lyle makes ready think about this book of Acts and I think about this next chapter in Paul's again on trial and just getting beat down and and everything everything is just constantly against this man and as I was praying today I was thinking about Paul and I was thinking about how much he relied on God for everything he relied on the Lord and and as he went as he came before these rulers replace Pontius Pilate these people they had the power to crucify him they had the power to cut his head off and he would not he was obedient to that heavenly vision we're going to hear today about how Paul stood and he stood on trial again and he wouldn't back down he loved the Lord and he had had an experience sister Debbie I want a little risen to have that same experience I want us all to have that same experience to where it is just perfectly real and there is no way we could ever forsake it it is Jesus Christ we can testify Jesus Christ how do you know him because he lives right here and and he speaks through me and he uses me he provides for me and I am like that Apostle Paul I am like that Apostle Peter I'm like Mary Magdalene I'm like Mary of Bethany I am like these people because I know the same Jesus Christ that they knew amen and that's what happened to these people in the book of Acts brother and you have a song for we'll just continue whole thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me oh as he made you home thank you Lord for giving to me so great our Salvation so rich I am so free amen thank you thank you good evening let me try that again good evening tonight we're going to study chapter 25 in the book of Acts I I will keep you less than two hours tonight in fact I'll probably keep you less than 45 minutes but that's okay in it Paul prepares for a third trial this one this time is before a new governor once again the person judging seems focused on political expediency rather than application of Justice based on law but before we open our Bibles to read this account let's approach the author once more in prayer Lord Jesus it is such a privilege that we can gather together with people of like Precious faith your spirit here Lord these songs of worship thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole thank you Lord for giving to me so great of Salvation so rich yet so free Lord please be with us continue to be with us this evening Lord help the words that are spoken over this desk tonight Lord to be accurate and true and to be of help Lord that your spirit could speak and meet the expectations of each one that's here each one that might be streaming Lord It's Your word Lord and we just want to enter and we want your spirit to just enter in and Lord we just want to be lost in you tonight we thank you forgive us where we fall short we commit this service once again into your hands in Jesus precious name amen we recall from chapter 21 that Paul arrived in Jerusalem and agreed at the repressor of James and Elders heir to participate in an end of vow ceremony at the temple with four Jewish Christians before that could be completed he was recognized by some Pilgrims from Ephesus and Jerusalem for the Feast of Weeks what we call Pentecost and they stirred up the crowd and there was a riot that followed and Paul was arrested chapter 22 as he was being led into the Fortress he addressed the crowd they listened to him until he said that he was sent to the Gentiles and then they erupted this man should not live Paul was then bound and being prepared to be beaten beat the truth out of him tortured for a confession what they called being examined and he told his interrogators he was a Roman he was exempt from such practices he'd had quite enough physical abuse in chapter 23 the next morning he was brought to the Sanhedrin Council and broke him to a fist fight over differences that they had in interpretations of scripture a plan to Ambush Paul was foiled when the Roman Commander Claudius Licia snuck Paul out of Jerusalem that night with a little tiny guard of only 470 soldiers to take him to caesarea to stand trial chapter 24 Paul confronted his accusers in caesarea before the governor Felix only about 12 days it elapsed from when he'd arrived in Jerusalem until he was standing in front of Felix let's read this closing verses of chapter 24 to set the stage for chapter 25. this works better Lyle if you turn it on technology okay acts 24 verse 22 and when Felix he was the governor of the district and also the judge at Paul's trial heard these things Paul's defense against the charges brought by the Jerusalem Council Felix we're told having a more perfect knowledge of Christianity of that way he deferred them he adjourned the proceeding and said oh when Lycia is the chief Captain shall come down I'll know the utter most of your matter I'll decide your case later of course there's no record that lycius ever came and Felix commanded a centurion that's a relatively low ranking military officer in charge of 60 to 100 soldiers to keep Paul in custody but to let him have some limited Liberty and that that Roman officer should forbid menopause acquaintance of his friends to come and minister or come unto him we'll talk more about one of these friends when we get to acts 27 but we're in 25 tonight and after some days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla which was a Jewish in fact she was a daughter of Herod Agrippa he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ and as Paul reasoned of righteousness Temperance that's self-control and judgment to come Felix trembled and answered or go thy way for this time when I have a convenience season I'll call for you Felix was afraid afraid of the consequences of his life under Paul's Ministries he understood that so Felix also hope that money should be given him of Paul that he might lose him wherefore he sent from the oftener and communed with him Felix was corrupt that's all there is to it it's all too common throughout human history he wanted a bribe to release Paul but after two years Perseus Festus came into Felix room in other words Festus became the governor and Felix was no longer the governor and Felix willing to show the Jews a pleasure to gain favor left Paul bound there's a lot going on in this verse 27 we'll investigate some of that this evening as it applies to chapter 25 but you're tired now so please be seated we see Paul's been kept in custody for two years Felix refuses to release him or to condemn him Paul's life is on hold there's no formal charges or Lodge so no one can prove him guilty and he can't prove his innocence now as you'll probably expect from me by now I want to read from a totally different place in the Bible let's pick up the story of Paul from Genesis chapter 40. it's a good place to start Genesis and verse 23 . here a fellow named Joseph is in prison he had interpreted the dreams of a baker and a butler and those dreams came to pass exactly as he told them it would he asked the butler to remember him not the baker because the baker was going to die and bring his situation to the attention of pharaoh not unlike Paul appealing his case to Caesar let's read Genesis 40 starting at verse 23. yet did not the chief Butler remember Joseph but forgot him and the very next verse is Genesis 41 verse 1. it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river I once heard an amazing sermon from this portion of the Book of Genesis this part right here between 40 23 and 41 1. as you can see there's only a blank space but in that blank space two important years elapsed while Joseph was unjustly held in prison some of his experiences in that blank space would help shape his ability to be the number two person in Egypt maybe someday we'll have a chance to show what happened in that blank space well here in Acts some 1945 years after Joseph was released from prison we again read of 2 silence a blank space also during an unjust imprisonment I'd like to make an observation here lack of evidence of activity is not evidence of a lack of activity let me repeat that lack of evidence of activity is not evidence of a lack of activity Luke's account of Acts contains only highlights in the early Ministry of Peter and then some highlights and the ministry of Paul the end of Acts 24 that we just read is in 60 A.D that's about 30 years after the day of Pentecost recorded in Acts 2. you can be sure there were a large number of evangelists spreading the gospel Peter Silas Timothy Apollos Barnabas many others whose names we don't know were active Peter didn't retire after he brought the gospel to Cornelius Paul was busy in Corinth during his first 18-month stay as well as his later three months day little details recorded at that time or of his activity in Ephesus which spans some three years Philip and cesarea wasn't known as the Evangelist because he stayed home once he arrived there after baptizing the Ethiopian treasurer what about James the Jerusalem Church didn't number in the many thousands because the apostles stopped their Witness remember at the first wave of persecution many if not most fled Jerusalem we read when we studied acts 8 verse 1. Saul that's Paul was consenting unto Stephen's death and at that time there was a minor insignificant no a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and a few fled the city no act says they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles Peter and James and others of the original disciples of Jesus this verse tells us a large portion of the thousands of converts recorded on the day of Pentecost and shortly thereafter fled Jerusalem what remained was the core of the Apostles the church body had to be rebuilt new converts added certainly some would have returned after the persecution settled down but it's safe to say that James and Peter and the others continued their witness and their Ministry looking Beyond Jerusalem what about Priscilla and Akila what about the church in Antioch what about the churches throughout Asia and Europe and what we call the Middle East that Paul and Barnabas and Silas and others founded Philippi thessalonica Berea Corinth Ephesus the church didn't die congregations didn't collapse Luke's narrative the book of Acts is narrowly focused it's not a broad record of all activity it's called The Acts of the Apostles but it could be called some of the acts of a few of the Apostles over many decades not all the acts of every apostle back to Genesis I I'm sure Joseph wondered why he would in the prison beneath Potiphar's house at the end of Genesis 40. but he didn't spend his time bemoaning his fate he continued his life he continued serving in that prison and was being prepared for the transformation that would occur in Genesis 41. and here in Acts this Saint Paul had been released from prison by an earthquake in Philippi right the earthquake came he witnessed to the Jailer it was in prison for a day this time it's been two years there's no earthquake Peter had twice been set free by angels from confinement in Jerusalem for Paul there'd be no angel to Spring him from caesarea in the past he'd born physical suffering and deprivation for his witness to the gospel he hadn't been confined for any length of time prior to this incarceration frankly I I wish personally that the ax account told us why the other Christians didn't just pay the bribe and set Paul free maybe they tried maybe Felix was too greedy maybe Paul said no we don't know and therefore we can't judge what we do know as we saw in Acts 24 was that Paul used his opportunities to witness to Felix he didn't give up he didn't wallow himself pity though I'm sure he earnestly prayed to be set free and I'm sure many others were praying for him to be set free and I'm also sure that there were some detractors that said uh Paul you know he was told by many in the spirit he shouldn't go to Jerusalem did he listen no not stubborn Iron Will Paul now look at him Paul would later write that he learned to be content and whatsoever State he found himself when we encounter dry places blank spaces in our lives isolation prayers that seemingly are unanswered the spirit sometimes seems far away we must continue to be what he has called us to be it isn't about our circumstances it isn't about our comfort it isn't about what we feel it's about faith continuing to believe it's about him and his often mysterious will being worked out in our lives it's about being a Christian in the blank spaces Paul wrote to the Romans shortly before his imprisonment in caesarea in Romans 8 14 he said for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Solomon wrote something a little similar proverbs 3. heard this many times I'm sure trust in the Lord with all fine heart lean not unto thy knowing understanding that sometimes is pretty hard in all thy ways acknowledge Him and he shall Direct bypass whenever I read this Heather and I we can't help but here brother red certel's voice when he read this passage in Proverbs as he minister to us in his living room in gizborne New Zealand more than 50 years ago he he brought it to life for us in those dark in those dry places continue to seek the Lord and trust the Lord be like job never give up or back to acts let's see where were we 24 27 to me this is this is like chapter 25 verse 0 just before verse one it says but after two years forecast Festus came into Felix room Festus became Governor replacing Felix and Felix willing to show the Jews of pleasure left Paul found have you ever read acts 24 verse 27 and wondered what was going on behind the scenes why was Felix being replaced with Festus is that the normal order of events why was Felix so intent on showing the Jews a pleasure that he was no longer going to be governing why would he care as we read chapter 25 we'll see that Festus was yet another unjust judge along with a fellow we'll meet called King Agrippa but but let's take a brief a brief but closer look at Felix I'm going to give you a little historical information it's from the Jewish encyclopedia Felix was a governor of Galilee and he was promoted to be governor of Judea a much larger territory by the emperor Claudius and 52 A.D according to the Roman historian tacitus Felix exercised quote the Royal prerogative in a slavish sense with all manner of cruelties and excesses it was he who excited the bitter feelings of the Jewish Patriots to the highest pitch as they moved closer and closer to open rebellion in the first Jewish revolt Felix was right there putting on the pressure according to Josephus Felix sent the chief of the zealots Eliezer Bay deny and chains to Rome while taking Relentless measures against his followers the zealots whom he'd announced as robbers Joseph Josephus says crucifying them in countless numbers Felix also proceeded rigorously against the would-be prophets that were disturbing the peace with their fanaticism especially against an Egyptian Jew who with several thousand followers attempted to drive the Roman Garrison from Jerusalem but was defeated and that's probably the Egyptian that Claudius lysius mistook Paul for at his arrest Felix's term of office we're told was practically A Reign of Anarchy for even the high Priestly families war with the lower priests we saw that and Paul's trial before the Sanhedrin in Acts 23. during Felix's term the Jewish encyclopedia tells us the Apostle Paul was taken prisoner at caesarea a fierce contest arose at that time between the Jewish and Syrian citizens of caesarea and as Felix acted unjustly toward the Jews it was so bad that he was recalled by Nero about 60 A.D at the intercession of an influential man named palace with neuro Felix escaped punishment so we see Paul was taken prisoner in 58 A.D Felix was recalled in 60. Felix was ruthless plant the Flames of rebellion I I probably need a drink he was also responsible it turns out for the murder of the high priest Jonathan which led to ananias this fellow being the high priest during this period with Paul after eight years under Felix Festus took over the governance of Roman Judea Felix having lost his position due to his persecution of the local Jewish population tried to make amends or at least hoped to secure his own safeties who left caesarea by keeping Paul incarcerated as a favor he was still able to Grant I'm sure you all knew all of that about Felix but I needed to refresh my memory about it so I thought I'd share that with you let's move on now to 25 and verse 1. now when Festus was come into the Province to replace Felix after three days he ascended from caesarea to Jerusalem now as you as you know one always goes up to Jerusalem or comes down from Jerusalem and he most certainly went there to acquaint himself with the Jewish religious leadership pay his respects and introduce himself to them as their new Roman governor then the high priest is ananias and the chief of the Jews informed against Paul notes they laid out their case they made accusations to Festus against Paul and they besought They begged they urged they pleaded with Festus and they the priests desired favor of Festus against Paul that Festus would send for Paul to Jerusalem would transfer Paul to Jerusalem and meanwhile they would be laying in wait the Jewish leaders would be preparing an ambush in the way to kill him these guys don't really like Paul very much do they remember back in Acts 23 there have been a plot to lure Paul to the Jerusalem Council and lay an ambush to kill him on the way at that time it was a youth it was a young boy that saved Paul's life recall Paul's nephew his sister's son heard that an ambush was being planned Paul was going to be summoned to the Jerusalem Council and be killed on the way from the castle to the council by these 40 guys that would be there to Ambush and kill him now we don't know the age of the young man I I'm guessing that he was probably between the age of eight and perhaps as old as 15 that intervene that's why I asked Elijah Andre to portray Paul's nephew when we studied acts 23 some of you might have been here and remembered that Elijah if you're here or streaming or listening great job but how do I was such a young person brother Lyle well it says here acts 23 19 then the chief Captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is it you have to tell me well I see is took him by the hand the 10 year old sure come come here what what is this that you want to tell me a 20 year old he's not going to take him by the hand what do you want right so we can tell from the context that this was a young fellow what if this boy had thought well I'm just a kid no one's going to pay attention to me those guys are probably drunk or something they they probably weren't serious and castles a scary place think about this if that young person had not stepped up overcome his natural fear and Lycia said not believed him Paul would have been killed in the ambush and we would not have the following Epistles Ephesians Philippians Colossians first and second Timothy Titus Philemon Hebrews these wouldn't be in our Bibles today imagine your new testament missing those books those Epistles those letters but they are thanks in part to that boy when you read those sometimes you might think about that this is here because it was a a little boy that overcame his fear and helped his Uncle Paul well back to Acts 25. the priests desired favor of Festus against Paul that Festus would transfer Paul to Jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him verse 4 but Festus refused their request and answered that Paul should be kept Paul's being held in custody at caesarea and that he himself Festus would depart shortly thither too caesarea let them therefore said he which among you are able go down to caesarea with me and Abel here doesn't mean that you're able to travel you're not in firm or something but leaders competent men positions of authority able to make their case go down to assessor with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him press charges against him at trial there the the Roman capital of Judea is caesarea not Jerusalem old court and accessories and when Festus had tarried among them in Jerusalem for more than 10 days he went down to caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgments he wasted no time he convened the court and commanded Paul to be brought to stand trial again this is the third time we call the first trial in Acts 23 Paul perceived that one part this was the Jerusalem Council where Sadducees and the other Pharisees he cried out to the council men and brother and I'm a Pharisee my dad was a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead I'm called to question and we read we talked about it before this big fight that they started to have so in verse 10 we read that uh when there arose a great dissension the chief Captain that's Claudia sliceus fearing Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them so it wasn't just a verbal argument it was physically violent we got a couple of boxers here yeah so those guys know what we're talking about commanded the soldiers to get out and take them by force from among them and to bring them into the castle what today we might call protective custody the Roman soldiers had to rescue Paul from that trial a few days later was Paul's second trial before Felix who refused to pass judgment with our new knowledge of Felix what I just read to you and you all memorized from that Jewish encyclopedia rapidly taking detailed notes let's look again at this initial presentation of the prosecutor to Felix and don't worry it's just five verses we read that after five days ananias a high priest descended came down to caesarea from Jerusalem with the elders and with an order named Turtles who informed the governor against Paul so as our brother Daniel pointed out he's a prosecutor knowing what we know about Festus when you read this is just have to shake your head I mean about Felix we just called forth Turtles began to accuse Paul saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness yeah he's getting the Zeal it's all stirred up and crucifying them in countless numbers and that very worthy Deeds are done unto this nation by thy Providence like killing Jonathan the high priest we accept it always and in all places most noble Felix with all thankfulness that Felix may be cruel he's not stupid he can see right through this guy notwithstanding that I be not further tedious unto thee I pray that one is here so they come and see if a few words but now verse 5. knowing what we know about Felix for we have found this man Paul a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition in other words he's lumping Paul with the zealots the ones that they know that Felix chases down and kills Paul's one of these guys a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world not just here everywhere and not a non-ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes oh so he's an attempt to connect Paul and all the other Christians to the zealots these guys really don't like Paula they don't like Christians in Israel when we lived there how many years ago was that close to 50. yeah I guess I can believe it Christians there are known as note Stream So I was a notes error and notes Remus plural it means nazarenes so today the Hebrew word for Christian is Nazarene okay going on let's just see verse 22 which is how we opened this evening when Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way that is Christianity he deferred them he put this off delayed said when life see us the chief Captain shall come down all know the uttermost of your matter so here we go again it's two years later trial number three before the newly appointed Governor Festus acts 25 verse 7. and when he Paul was come into the courtroom the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about they surrounded Paul and laid many and Grievous complaints against Paul which they could not prove accusations no evidence while he Paul answered for himself I'm sure he was looking at Festus maybe at some of these other guys and said neither against the law of the Jews neither against the temple nor yet against Caesar Roman law have I offended anything at all Festus wanting to the Jews of pleasure answered actually interrupted Paul and said well will you go up to Jerusalem and there be tried and judged of these accusations before me yet another delay Festus has heard the arguments he's been presented with the lack of evidence but he seems to refuse to do his job as a judge Paul's had enough of this nonsense Felix wanted a bribe Festus is having a hard time making a decision now the back route to context is the growing recess of the people of Judea a simmering pot that's about to boil over in Rebellion Festus is a politician is unwilling to do what he already knows is the right thing and he apparently fears the consequences in the context of his new role and just getting acquainted with the other leaders in the complexities of this province called Judea so he's proceeding slowly and carefully then said Paul I stand at Caesar's judgment seat I'm I'm here in a Roman Court where I ought to be judged here in your court in caesarea not in Jerusalem where they only want to kill me to the Jews I've done no wrong that was pretty angry we see a another little bit of Paul's uh temper I think here he publicly scolds Festus to the Jews I have done no wrong as thou very well knowest oops for if I be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death refuse not to die remember from our previous study a Roman citizen condemned to death at least in theory has the right to demand banishment rather than death so Paul's again reminding everyone that he's a Roman citizen but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man May deliver me unto them my accusers frankly including you Governor Festus since you're apparently unwilling to equip me I appeal unto Caesar appeal unto Caesar what does that actually mean repealed to Caesar does that mean the emperor himself would try the case does it mean the case has to have already been decided much like an appellate court in America today what's going on but a Roman law I don't speak Latin I don't pronounce Latin but it's called The Lexington was passed about 20 BC along with many other reforms under Caesar Augustus around that time this is from a textbook of this period by a fellow named FF Bruce if you want to look it up it forbade any magistrate to kill Scourge chain torture or even sentence a Roman citizen who has announced his intention to appeal or prevent him from going to Rome to Lodge's appeal there within a fixed time this is the same law that stopped Claudius lysius from having Paul scourged it's why he feared himself when he'd had Paul bound with chains at his arrest once you realized Paul was a Roman citizen Nero this user at this time became emperor in 54 A.D about the time that Paul set out on his third missionary journey Nero said according to the Roman historian tacitus that he would not be judged in all cases and until 62 or 63 A.D he made no exceptions and just simply wouldn't judge anyone and only did a few after that time so appeals cases were apparently assigned to various officials so thus in Rome Paul would most likely be Tried by an imperial representative subject to Roman law but he had this right to appeal then Festus when he had conferred with the council clearly realizing Paula just given him a way to appease the Jewish religious leaders and wash his hands of the whole mess that Fest Felix had left him answered have you appealed to Caesar under Caesar you'll go oh well some days later after certain days King Agrippa and Bernice Burness is this King agrippa's sister and both are children of a fellow named Herod Agrippa they came into caesarea to salute Festus to greet him congratulate him on his appointment as a procurator of Judea we all know who this guy is right review when we studied acts 12 we went over all the various Kings of portions of Judea in the gospels and acts so this is the Dynasty and a dynasty simply means this guy was ran things and then his kid ran things and his kid ran things and then somebody killed that kid and so they it was so a different family took over so a dynasty is just a family line okay so this is the dynasty of Herod the Great so Herod the Great when the Bible says the in yellow is the the the name that's given in the New Testament when you're reading and that's why it gets confusing because we've got three different people that are all called Herod so Herod the Great was the Herod at the time of Jesus birth and he died about for BC Herod Antipas you see directly below Herod the Great was the Herod of John the Baptist and Jesus judgment he died about 39 A.D over here on the on the on your left no you're right yes yes it's like the fellow said at the train station well if I want to get to this place for the said well turn to the left and you'll be right and the person said don't be emptying it he said well then turn to the right and you'll be left but anyway heroda gripper was a nephew of Herod Antipas and a grandson of Herod the Great it was a herd who persecuted the early Church in Jerusalem and who died after his speech listed in Acts 12 around 44 A.D so when we see this name Agrippa this is actually Herod Agrippa II but in the in acts in 25 and 26 he's simply called Agrippa he's great grandson of Herod the Great and the last of the dynasty he was made King and 53 A.D it turns out that he and Josephus that famous historian were correspondents after the failed Jewish rebellion of 66-73-80 in fact Joseph publishes two or three of the letters that they exchanged in his massive work that's very difficult to read and this Herod Agrippa II was the one who tried to quell the Rebellion he fled your DNA in 66 A.D when it was clear it could not be prevented he eventually died in Rome various sources say it was 92 A.D or 100 A.D well here's his territory and we don't really need to to zoom in on this Z Paul's captivity in caesarea that's where that is this whole green area is the province of Judea under Felix and later under Festus these three little spots that are circled in red that's the domain of Herod Agrippa II so you can see that he really has no jurisdiction in Judea or Samaria so this is a state visit of Pomp and Circumstances it's Trudeau coming down to see Biden or vice versa they we have a common border but not a common government so this visit will read about now in Acts 25 is a formal visit with Pomp and ceremony but Agrippa has no jurisdiction so continuing on verse 14. and when they Agrippa and Bernice had been there in cesarea Festus many days so they're visiting and after a while you know they're probably sitting around having dinner and having a cup of whatever they had a cup of and they're talking about stuff and eventually they get a little bit bored and what are we going to talk about now and how long is this guy going to be hanging around and uh oh hey you know uh Festus uh talks to Griffin he says you know a strange thing there's there's a guy that was left here in bonds by Felix and when I went to Jerusalem when I first came to this place and went up there to check things out and get acquainted with everybody the chief priests and the Elders of the Jews accused this guy to me and that he desire to have judgment against them they they wanted me to condemn this guy to whom I answered it's not the manner of Romans to deliver any man to die before that which he is Accused have the accusers face to face and have license or opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him with which he's charged just because you don't like him doesn't mean I'm going to kill him so I had him come down and when they came hither without any delay on the morrow in fact the very next morning I convened a trial and sat on the Judgment seat and commanded this man Paul to be brought forth against whom when the accusers the priests and council members from Jerusalem stood up they brought no accusation of such things that violate Roman law as I suppose that they were going to do but I have certain questions or charges against them of their own Superstition their religion and some guy called Jesus which was dead but Paul said was alive because I doubted such manner of questions I'm not Jewish I I don't know how to proceed how do I investigate something like this this is all very confusing I asked Paul whether he would go to Jerusalem and never be judged of these matters in their own courts while I presided in Roman law this is known as extraordinum which literally means not on the list of offenses so if a person is broken a law and it's on the oh we can go to chapter so and so of our law book and it says oh yeah no you're not supposed to do this here's the punishment but this is something that wasn't in their list of laws so they had rules for how you deal with that a lot of latitude is given to the governor or the head of a tribunal that's hearing such matters so Festus is saying this isn't a normal offense it's not on the list wants a little help to understand if an offense has actually occurred and if so what a reasonable punishment might be but when Paul had appealed to be reserved under the hearing of Augustus now that's not actually Augustus who's long dead but in other words the emperor I commanded him until I might send him to Caesar you can make that arrangement then Agrippa who knows a lot about Jewish stuff he said oh interesting I I'd like to hear the man myself um tomorrow said Festus you'll hear him and on the morrow when Agrippa was come and purness with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at Festus commandment Paul was brought forth so this is just a big show trial sort of thing it's not even really a trial because he's already appealed to Caesar and Festus said King Agrippa all men which are here present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me both at Jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer but when I found he had committed nothing worthy of death but which fact I was unwilling to state that the trial and thus set him free but it's obvious that he's innocent and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus that is the emperor because he's been detained for two years is clearly innocent disgusted I wouldn't make the perfectly obvious decision to free him I have determined to send him to Rome of whom but regarding Paul I have no certain thing no specific accusation to write unto my Lord Caesar the emperor the wherefore I have brought him forth before you all and especially before they do okay that after hearing the evidence after examination had I might have something to write maybe you could help me figure out what he is or should be accused of within Roman law or a clear statement of offense of extraordinum I laugh when I read this next verse it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not be able to say what the crimes are against him oh look like a buffoon or at least incompetent if I send him and say I don't know what he did or why I'm sending him to you the next verse then Agrippa said to Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth a hand and answered for himself oh that's acts that's Acts 26. Oh Come Back brother Daniel we'll teach from Acts 26 and tell you about Paul's response to Agrippa what can we learn from Acts 25. to apply to our lives I I think one of the most important things is to not become discouraged like Paul like Joseph we need to persevere those blank spaces in our lives times have drawn times of difficulty in isolation we need to hold fast musicians would please come remind ourselves of the love and grace bestowed upon us by the God we know and love and serve be sensitive to those around us who might be encouraged or helped by contact like like Paul in prison but allowed visitation and assistance by his friends his fellow Believers in spite of continued isolation or opposition this past week Heather and I visited an old friend who was hospitalized had been for several days he commented to us that it was a time of reflection for him to look back on his life to this point and think about things look for opportunity in every situation times for reflection meditation prayer to grow as Christians we need to read our Bibles and spend time in prayer daily there's no substitute for that always remember when Jesus spoke about dividing Souls at the final judgment in Matthew 7 part of The Sermon on the Mount blessed are these and blessed are those his sole Criterion was whether he had known whether he had a relationship with the one being evaluated not what the person did or knew or could quote or recite Miracles wrought in the name of Jesus Christ meant nothing at that day depart from me that work iniquity is what Jesus said Criterion I never knew you I never knew you be sure you know him and be absolutely certain he knows you a personal relationship with Jesus of Nazareth is not optional it's essential we close this part of the service yes okay I guess you're going to do your version rather than mine and that's fine I'd like us to sing at Calvary years I spent in vanity and pride caring not my Lord was crucified knowing not it was for me he died Glory Mercy there was great and Grace was free hard and there was multiplied to me there my burdens all found Liberty [Music] by God's word at last my sin I learned that trembled at the law I'd spurned till my guilty Soul employ [Music] Mercy there was great and Grace was free hard and there was multiplied to me there my burdens all found Liberty oh my [Music] now I've given to Jesus everything now I gladly own him as my king now my raptured soul can only sing of cows [Music] of Mercy there was great and Grace once free hard and there was multiplied to me bear my burdens all found Liberty [Music] oh the love that Drew salvation's plan oh the grace that brought it down to man oh the Mighty God that God did span at Town over here [Music] great and Grace was free [Music] it's all Stan [Music] great and Grace [Music] is [Music] amen I gotta read it again what Paul said I I love Paul's personality the guy was tough and you know he he didn't back down and when he knew he was right he would stand up to anybody remember when when the high priest had the guy slap him in the face he was there Chained and he said the Lord's gonna Smite you you Whited wall I love that about Paul says this then said Paul I stand at Caesar's judgment seat where I ought to be judged to the Jews have I done no wrong as thou very well knowest brother Joseph you come close my friend for if I be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death I refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man May deliver me unto them I appeal unto Caesar he was Paul he stood up he knew that they didn't have anything they didn't have anything on him he didn't break any law and the Romans are like what's the deal with these so-called these Jews they hate each other and they want to kill somebody he didn't even break any law I love the way brother Lyle loved the way that you brought that out I love the way the apostle stand strong standing up for Christianity I'm so glad he did Brother Joseph let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before you once more we thank you Lord for the word that was brought by Brother Lyle tonight Lord we pray that we continue to be that that light shining throughout the world Lord and we pray that you be with all of us as we go on our ways home in Jesus Christ's name we pray thank you Lord amen [Music]

to preserve the apostle that would re that would write the biggest part of this new testament thank God that he did he uses every little piece of the puzzle and I just pray Lord just Place me in that puzzle somewhere let me do my part like that little boy did his brother Lyle said earlier like the Apostle Paul did like Peter did and like all of these Brethren I just want to be in his perfect will Walking in his perfect way with my eyes on the cross the words of Calvary coming out of my mouth praising the Lord Jesus praising him in song praising him in word praising him indeed praising him in everything that we have God bless you all stay in the book of Acts this week the next brother Lyle encroached a little on my territory when when he went on to the next chapter you know what you know what uh brother Paul did when he was brought before um Bernice this very strange woman and uh this man Agrippa you know what he did he gave his testimony so next time I Minister on Sunday night we are going to talk about Paul's testimony and what Paul stood for when he preached the gospel and what he said when he testified before this man that probably had the power to put him to death also God bless you all think on the things of the Lord this week you're dismissed in the name of the Lord oh yeah we have a we have a special Minister for uh for us on Sunday morning brother Ryan long I heard him preach at a Minister's meeting a couple months ago and he really impressed me he many of you maybe know him he's he's up um he's a minister up at the Flagstaff Tabernacle and I just felt on my

it didn't even come to mind and I was talking with brother Josiah in the back and thought this Psalm is perfect for the message I want to bring this morning Psalm chapter 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in in his law that he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the riv rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper what words let's bow our heads our Great and Mighty Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for these words and Lord our Delight is in your word father we pray that we could just find our place in this word and in your

welcome I love that smiling face and that Zeal to serve the Lord welcome God bless you I met uh uh sister Rebecca Oliver where are you sister Rebecca could you raise your hand there you are hiding back there it's good it's good to see you I I was thinking about so when sister Rebecca walked in um we uh I greeted her and she said she's knows my brother Jeremy at voice of God Recordings sister I'm trying to place your family do you know Josephine Jarvis you've never met her well God bless you it's it's good to have you in service welcome and all the other visitors if I didn't recognize you God's recognized you it's it's good to have you line old man where you been bro you've been awall for a while been to Japan and Hawaii and all over the place it's good to have you back my friend God bless you Stephanie and I were we're driving to church this morning and um it's really neat because she wanted to teach on the Beatitudes in her Sunday school class and um she asked me she said um there was one of them she didn't understand and she said it was blessed are the poor in spirit and she said what does that mean and I said you know what I don't know I said look at a couple of the other translations and and see if you can get it well so she gets on on her phone and she types it in and uh right away it comes up what it means and I'm driving I look over and that's not the Bible that was AI generated answer so she she types it in and these this it scrubs the internet and it it generates an answer from everything it's written and it's not even a human being that wrote this thing it's something that's not it's not real it's a machine and it makes it to where now it's like this artificial intelligence is better than even a preacher it's better than anything and it can give you an answer to whatever question you have and as I was thinking about that and going along and I was like honey turn that thing off just read read the Bible and she's like well it's it's it's a good answer I said yeah it sounds good but this this isn't even this is not even a living breathing organism it's it's fake it's it's a computer and you I was just thinking on that and that's the way that the enemy does the enemy wants to take the Holy Spirit out of the Church to take each one of us have a each one of us have a role in this divine plan of God and what the enemy does it's like no I'm going to take that out I'm just going to make it easy on you just so you can search the internet and I'll I'll make a machine that can give you the answer and it's almost always a better answer than a person could give you and I'll just give it to you right here really easy and it's pulling out the gifts out of the church and replacing them with something else and it makes for a lazy generation it makes to where we just we have all the knowledge we need we have everything that we have is right here in the little square Idol what I call it I mean it's more rectangular than it is square but you know it's it's it's a plan of the enemy and it's like I said it's to take that relationship that all of us have with God to take that out and replace it with something else wow I was driving home week or two ago from Flagstaff and uh I listening to um the Bible and Book of Matthew and I got to Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew Chapter 5 is the start of The Sermon on the Mount most famous sermon that brother that the Lord Jesus preached just a I mean a masterpiece and as I was listening going down the mountain I was just taking in this wisdom and I I was I was saying Lord How could a man speak with such words how could a man speak with such wisdom as the Lord Jesus taught and and one thing after the other when it went through the Beatitudes and it and then he he goes and he he Contin continues his sermon and out loud I was saying Lord who could say such words he's saying things like you are the salt of the earth but if a salt has lost its flavor then what good is it it's the same thing brother James taking out the Holy Spirit out of the church and just replacing it with a machine or phone he says you are the light of the world he said but don't hide your light under something he said let your light shine among men he said that and then he warns the people he says I've not come the Lord Jesus the Messiah God in flesh he says I haven't come to do away with the law and the prophets he said I came to fulfill what they taught and he's warning the crowd he's like you're going to hear something that might not be what you've grown up with he's warning the crowd that it might not be your way of thinking then he goes on and he starts talking about this law and he says you've heard it Tau that you shall not murder he said but and if you murder you're liable to judgment but he says this he says but if you're angry with your brother you're liable to judgment taking the Commandments The Ten Commandments and now he's making them real in people he says this he says you have heard that you shall love your brother and you shall hate your enemy he said but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you so your F so you that this is very important pray for those that persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send Reigns sends rain on the just and the unjust for if you love those who love you what reward do you have I ask us in this congregation if you love that those that love you what reward do you have and because and then he says but the Sinners and the tax collectors they do the same thing he says and if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than other people if you're just greeting those that believe like you if you're just greeting your your brethren that are part of your group then what good as Jesus said what good are you he says don't even the Gentiles the unbelievers don't they even do the same thing he said you must therefore be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect so how can we be perfect he and and as he's as he's ministering there and he has this big crowd out in the field in the grass it says that they were they were sitting there and and as he's ministering he starts to change direction from these Commandments in the law and it's such a sweet thing as I was going down the mountain I was like Lord you're so kind you're so sweet in the way that you are and he's looking out on the people and he must have started to feel their anxiety he must have started to feel that that these people are are struggling with themes every one of them is struggling with things at home they're struggling with their jobs they're struggling with their family they're struggling with their kids with their moms and their dads they're they're they're having problems and then the Lord in his kindness and his love he looks out and maybe and I can't speak for God but it seems like maybe he felt that from the people and then he he starts to move as I said he starts to change directions of the church I mean of of his sermon and the Lord Jesus the Bible says that he's a high priest that's able to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he understands how it is he understands how it is to suffer he understands all of the sins that are out there he understands the Temptation for all of them all of us have different Temptations and all of us have different weaknesses I may be able to relate with brother Aaron's weaknesses but I might not be able to relate with brother Josiah's weaknesses that's why God has placed in this church different people with different experiences and different gifts to bring because I can't if brother Josiah as I said if I don't understand I can't counsel I can't encourage brother Josiah like someone else that maybe has gone through what he's going through and vice versa but the Lord Jesus was different he understood all of The Temptations and the enemy knew who he was and the enemy hit him with every Temptation that's on the earth so he is that high priest he understands he understands how it feels for somebody to have a weakness with addiction he understands how it feels for somebody to have a weakness with sexual immorality he understands all of those things while some of us might not understand it but he understood it and that's why Brothers s it's so as I just said we can't take those gifts out of the church we need the people here not for yourself everybody thinks going to church I'm going to go to church because I want to get something I say it a lot go to church to give something go to church to give out your love wow I just saw the garas back there brother and sister Gara God bless you welcome to patriarch it's good to have you in [Applause] service come to give and then we receive as we give so he looked at Jesus he he looked out on this audience feeling their their anxiety there was a on Wednesday night there's a woman that came um sister Missy is she here that that lady that you witnessed to um um the lady that you witnessed to that was talking uh her name was an she came and just a hard life elderly sister struggling and has has I mean struggling with a place to to sleep at night going from shelter to shelter and just not having anything and she she comes and brother Jordan and I were talking with her and she was just destitute and and I said are you a Christian she said well I don't really know what it means and I said let me tell you a scripture and and I quoted to her the Lord Jesus saying um come unto me all ye that are burdened and heavy laden and I will give you rest and she looked at me and she said I like that she said say it again and and I simplified it a little bit and I said come unto me all you that are carrying a heavy burden and I will give you rest I said that's what Jesus does and she said tell me again and it was three or four times that I repeated it and she said oh I like that I said sister I said there's a whole book book of quotes like that I said and and every one of them is just as good as that one it's really really blessing her but there's something that we have to do also let's turn to Matthew chapter 6 now again Jesus is on the mountain and he's giving this sermon on the mountain and as I said precious words like no man had ever spoken is what Jesus is is preaching here Matthew 6: 25 and he felt as I said he must have felt the anxiety that was in the people and he says this he says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the light life more than meat and the body than rainment so he's saying he's saying you're wor worth a lot more than the clothes that you have on your life is worth a lot more than the food that you're you're Desiring to have and God knows it and he says and he continues on he says behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor they gather into the barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much better than that imagine the people listening to this and the struggles that they were having at home and he goes on and he says he says which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to a statue the ESV says which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his life he says you're worrying about anxiety and you that worry isn't going to change anything wow and why take ye thought for reignment for your clothes consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not they're not working and that they don't Spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raay like one of these so he's saying even the most prosperous King that had ever lived can't even compare to this one little beautiful flower in all of man's achievements he can never make something as beautiful as God's simplest achievements wow and these lilies they show up every year you can count on them being there you can count on sister uh sister Rebecca back back there you can count on the spring flowers coming up in Ohio and in Indiana you know that they're going to be there they they're going to show up and yet nobody's worrying about them the sun rises every morning no matter if we worry about it coming up or not it's going to be there whether I'm depressed whether I'm looking for a job whether I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills that light spreads across the Earth no matter how much my tiny problems are I've gave the testimony before as I was really struggling with things I was I was really sad and depressed and I didn't know what direction my life was going just a few years ago and I go up on an elk hunting trip in northern Arizona and I'm up there and and we come back after dark and we come back to the UTV and we turn out our lights and I looked up in the sky there was no moon no clouds just these beautiful stars you could see the Milky Way up there all the different colors and the Stars went all the way down to the ground most beautiful thing one of the most beautiful things I could ever even imagine and I'm looking up there and I'm thinking Lord every one of those those heavenly bodies up there is bigger than the rock that I'm standing on and you created everyone and I'm worried about my problems thinking that maybe you're not hearing me no he knows if he can create all of this then he can surely provide for us verse 30 wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not not not much more clothe you oh you have little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed he's saying that's up to God to do those things so don't worry about how you're going to pay the bills if a car breaks down you're G to get it fixed brothers and sisters many of us have been here for a long time has God not provided Ed every time that we've needed it every single time and we worry we struggle how am I going to do this but he he does it we look back it's like well wow I got through it and we don't even remember those struggles but when it's here it's like man this is rough for after all these things do the Gentiles seek the unbelievers for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things so he's saying that they hey the unbelievers worry about this stuff you know the people that don't believe in God the people that don't believe in the Lord Jesus they worry that they're not going to be able to pay the bills right they worry that their kids aren't going to be saved aren't going to have a a a happy life or they're going to marry the wrong person or they're not going to have the right career they worry about all these things and he's like hey so the unbelievers worry about this why are you worrying about it because you believe in God right then why are you worrying about it but there's a catch to all this remember Jesus preached earlier in this sermon on The Sermon on the Mount he preached about being honest about giving to others and when someone slaps you on the cheek turn the other cheek and let him slap that to even pray for those that would despitefully use you to love your enemies like you love your friends he just finished praying or he just finished pre preaching about that that was the first part of the sermon now here's the catch verse number 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you what a promise seek first the kingdom of God seek first the righteousness of God he had just said blessed are that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled earlier in his sermon and now he's saying now you seek that righteousness and all these other things they'll be they'll be given to you but here's the most important thing take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for uh for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof English Standard version says don't be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself sufficient for the day is its own trouble I promise you that once you solve this problem you're going to have more tomorrow right they don't go away you just get new ones it's a variety I appreciate it at least it's not the same one I'm but it is though it's you'll get past this one there'll be another one but seek first that Kingdom amen brothers and sisters when we work seek God's righteousness in your career your work will be a better place if you're a Christian at work just like you are in church practice Christianity at work if someone does you wrong at work be kind to them you're a Christian at work too so if somebody insults you or does you wrong or double crosses you let that Christianity come out and then you be kind to that person and help that person whoa It's what Jesus taught and it's not just for the folks in church if he B treat you bad then work harder for him say what you has no right to treat me that way yeah but did you have a right to sin against Jesus did you have a right to sin against Jesus no I didn't either and even if my boss doesn't treat me right I'm still going to serve him and do the best that I can we had a we had a guy that um was doing some international travel for work um not too long ago and we were was working with uh uh the travel guy um in DC and he just did a great job the guy I mean it was his job to get all of my travel and all of my every all of the Hoops that we have to jump through and all the all the stuff and this guy just do did a great job so when I got back I uh sent him a cash award and boy he he just he really appreciat appreci ated it but he did his job and he worked hard and he did what he was required to do but a little bit was added to him just for doing a good job and that's how we are if we do a good job of work if we if we are kind to people and respect people it will be added to us you will be more successful I promise if you respect your colleagues if you respect both those that are underneath you and those that are above you and those that are equal to you you will prosper be a Christian first the um we need to make sure that we're seeking the benefit of others more than ourselves Jesus as I said Jesus didn't say just those at church Jesus said prefer your brother prefer these other people over your and you'll see that if you do that you will gain more respect like this young man that helped me at work you will get more respect and you will prosper from it same thing is at school when you're at school you are representing the kingdom of God seek ye first the kingdom of God when somebody sees you at school are they seeing a Christian are they seeing someone that they want to be like are they seeing someone that respect are they seeing someone that that acts like a Christian that that talks like a Christian that looks like a Christian or in our in our social media Snapchat and Instagram and all that when someone looks at your stuff are they seeing a Christian are they seeing a Godly person when they look at your page or your post does it represent Jesus Christ come on now or is it something else that the Lord might be ashamed of wow same thing I'm going to go through a couple more like our personal finances are we seeking the righteousness of God first above everything else in our finances what do you mean I gotta have I got to pay my rent I got my car and pment I have my insurance I have my food I've got to eat I've got to do all these things but are you sinning with your finances it's my job as Pastor to get into your personal life sorry I'm not sorry I just kind of say it broadly and then you take it and apply it to your life all right are you being frivolous brothers and sisters with your spending buying things you don't need to do taking the money that God gives us and blowing it are we doing things like that it's robbing God and if we are robbing God if we are not living up to our role which is seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then we are robbing God of something we're taking the money that God gives us and robbing it you say well it's my money I'll spend it the way I want to what do you mean I Rob God Malachi chapter 3 says this verse eight will man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed you and tithes and offerings notice he said tithes and offerings you know me I'm not pandering for money I'm telling you what the word says you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat meat means food may they that there may be food in my house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall be not room enough to receive it seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and these things will be added to you how do you expect to be successful in life financially if you're not doing what God told you if you're not giving him his first you're not making a deal with God either you know this Prosperity Gospel nonsense you're not making a deal with God is like Lord I'm going to give you my next paycheck then you're going to let me win the lottery that's not what he's saying he's saying just stand fast be steadfast give and then you will receive but as I said it's not it's not a deal and watch how God protects those who are faithful and giving verse 11 and I will rebuke the devour for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field sayeth the Lord of host of host if you're a far farmer your crops will do better if you're a businessman your business will do better if you have a steady job then your finances will go farther farther that's God's words it's not my words and all the nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delight delightsome land sayeth the Lord of hosts it's the same thing seek first the kingdom of God in our relationships and our families with our husbands and our wives mothers and daughters cousins and brothers and sisters seek first that Kingdom and his righteousness and it'll be added to you we if you perceive someone Did You Wrong your husband your wife be a Christian about it turn the other cheek are you a Christian with your husband are you a Christian with your wife are you a Christian with your parents with your children Stephanie and I were we building this house and um if you haven't noticed things are more expensive now than they were a couple years ago so when we got our loan it was great we could pay for it but now it's like Whoa man how are we going to how are we going to finish this house and it was just it's really started to the pressure started to get to us and and so on uh yesterday day before yesterday so we started to bicker you know and I was like you don't need that and this and this and there too much money and and and and she got upset and and you know how husbands and wives do and you know brother brandham tells the story when sister brandham was upset and he walked up to her as a good husband would and he he said honey kindhearted and he said he he wanted to talk he started to talk about things that she would want to talk about and he started cons solar and just like a good husband you know I didn't do that I should have but I didn't do it and so we we continued on in our and our whatever we were doing and then finally we both honey I'm sorry and and I'm sorry and and you know we we made up but we'd already escalated it too far and got mad at each other and both of us just felt terrible about arguing and and but and I was like honey it's okay everything will be okay and she's like honey it's okay you know we're feeling good and and then out of the blue I get a phone call I get a text and we have this little piece of property in Jeffersonville and I've been trying to sell it for three years and finally we just gave up and and it the the um contract with the real estate agent expired and it was just sitting there and right after Stephany and I make up I get a phone call from some guy in Jeffersonville wanting to buy our lot and it was is pretty much exactly the money that we would need to finish [Applause] up but we sought first the kingdom amen we sought first righteousness we we admitted we were we were wrong and arguing and then the Lord's like if you just do this if you'll just be a Christian I'll add to it don't worry about it I know your heart when you went into this I know what you're doing and you may have regrets and and think that I made a mistake but the Lord knows and he's it's a promise right here he said I'm gonna provide for you there's a story that we all know but I I want to I want to tell this story again in the book of First Kings and what happens in chapter 17 is is this man this great Prophet Elijah he comes and he he just comes out of nowhere and he goes to the king and he says neither due nor rain is going to fall until I call for it later on we know that Elijah prayed under the anointing of God Elijah prayed that it wouldn't rain because of the evilness of this man Ahab and his wife Jezebel so he's Elijah prays this and brothers and sisters when we pray for something and it's the Lord's will we have to live in that prayer and it might not be the easiest thing when we're praying we want God's Will and we want to live in God's Will and here is Elijah and he prayed that it wouldn't rain and he had to live in that famine that was created from that prayer so Elijah the Lord tells Elijah he says go up to this Brook and stay there he says I've commanded Ravens to feed need you so Elijah goes up and he's sitting by this Brook and every morning and every evening the birds would bring him food what what a tremendous testimony Elijah sought first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then it was added to him he got what he needed he got his food and he got he got his Dr his water from the brook and everything was working out good and he's there and then the brook dries up because again it was a famine and it was a drought so God tells Elijah he says go down to this place first Kings 178 and the word of the Lord came to him saying arise and get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee stop there for a moment I have commanded a widow woman to sustain you that's amazing an amazing statement there's people in this situation now all many of us might be in this situation we might be this Elijah or we might be this widow woman God knew what his commandment was the widow woman or Elijah knew that God told him but you know who was left out of the knowledge the widow woman yet she was commanded to sustain this man of God so he arose and went to zerath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to f fetch it he called her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil and a Cru and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so she was starving to death and worse than her starving to death her son her little boy was starving to death and imagine she's going out there she grabs two sticks she's going to bring it in and start a little fire in her stove and she's GNA she's going to boil maybe this water and and she's going to put this this meal in there use the water maybe to to get the meal and then fry it up and that's going to be the last meal that she has there was no chance for anymore imagine her looking at her son his maybe sunken in cheeks little skinny arms she sees her boy dying and she looks and here comes this man maybe she knew him maybe she didn't I don't know and she says and he says go and get me a drink and she says okay I'll go get you some and he and he says and make me some food too and she says she didn't lie she says listen she says all I have is this handful of meal and just this little bit of oil it's all I've got in my house many of us someone might ask us for money and my first answer is I don't have any money and I might have a $20 bill in my wallet but she was honest and she said we don't have anything but just this little bit and then I Elijah said something so strange but Elijah knew that he was commissioned of God he knew that God had prepared this woman to feed him to take care of him he knew that God was with him but the woman didn't know that God had commanded her all of us look at look at through your lives how many times have you gone forward in faith not knowing and then you do something and you look back and you say that was God it's the same thing he commanded you to do it you just didn't know you were walking perfectly in God's Will and that's this woman here she has no idea and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me there thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son she must have thought and I know this man's a man of God but she's asking for the little he's asking for the little bit that I have God's asking just for this little morsel that I have how much more important was that than all the granaries that maybe Ahab had stored up this is what God had chosen this is the blessed as as we've heard the prophet say the hidden Mana maybe the Mana that was put into the ark this is something this meal is blessed for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sends reain upon the Earth so she was Pres presented with the word of God seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness she was presented with that and it these things shall be added to you it's the same thing Elijah is telling her that the Lord Jesus was saying when he looked out upon the audience on The Sermon on the Mount and he said seek first the kingdom of God and all this anxiety that you have it'll be added to you and she did according to the saying of Elijah and she and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not de neither did the Cru of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by his Prophet Elijah so every time she put her hand in that mirror that that Barrel she dumped it out she gave it to Elijah she goes back in there puts her hand in there there's another handful takes the Cru of oil wow she makes it up she fries it up they get hungry again she reaches in there it's another one a miracle how many of us can say lord always provided for me he always took care of me he was always there for me when I needed it he never forsook me I thought I was so poor and I thought I was so destitute I I thought everything was bad and I thought all my family was gone and then all of a sudden it's changed and there's a turn of events in each thing for us that the Lord has his hand on it just like he had his hand on this widow woman that was commanded to do one of the greatest things that we read in the book and she had no idea it's one of the best stories I mean we we look at all the people out there at that time with Ahab and Jezebel and and and all of a sudden this little widow woman shows up in her son and God had mercy on her and gave her a great work to do how many times can we say it and it's happened to us everybody can but we don't recognize God for what he does but seek first the kingdom of God live right be a Christian do your do exactly what Jesus says in all parts of your life honey I told them about our argument the other day it's all her fault that's what I told him no I [Laughter] didn't but when we sought the kingdom of God he provided and when we sought his his righteousness he provided it when Martha and and Mary when Jesus came to their house Jesus entered into the village a woman named Martha welcomed her into the house and she had called her her sister Mary who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching but Martha was distracted with much serving and she went up to him and said Lord do you not care that my sister I'm doing all the work and she's left me alone to do all this tell her to help me I'm cleaning the dishes and I'm I'm serving the food and I'm sweeping the floor and all look at look at the sink it's all full of dishes and nobody's there to help me and there's Mary just sitting at your feet listening to you talk and then Jesus rebukes her and he says Martha you're too you got too much anxiety about the things of the world Mary is more right because she sought the kingdom of God and his righteousness she wanted that word I always related more to to Martha I would have been that believe me I would have been the Martha I would have been been out there I'd have been the one working say no I'm not the only one the place does anything and then the other people would have been more right than me and here is Mary and she's just taking in these beautiful words from the Lord wouldn't you have loved to been Mary and listening to I would have loved to been Martha too and serving the lord Jesus such a such a wonderful wonderful thing and then he says Martha you're anxious and you're troubled but there's one thing that is necessary Mary has chosen the good portion which will not be taken away from her there's Cain and Abel they uh they come to the Lord and they build their Altar and they make their sacrifice and here is Cain and he's thinking here here is what's the best looking here is here is what that the Lord will be more pleased with look at how much better my altar looks than his pile of rocks with blood on it and a dead animal look at how much better mine is than his and then God looks down and he refuses Cain he says Cain just do it like this but Cain was full of him himself he would not change he wanted to do it his way he wasn't seeking the righteousness of God he was seeking the the he was he was seeking fame he was seeking recognition he was seeking validation when Abel he was just seeking the righteousness of God he just wanted he just wanted God to be glorified and then at the end of the story Jes the Lord says if thou doest if thou doest well Cain if you do well look at how God loved even Cain he wanted Cain to succeed he wanted Cain to be saved he didn't want Cain to make a mistake and he says he said if you if you do well then you then you'll be accepted but if you do not well he said then Cain sin lies at the door for you if you're not serving God if you're not seeking God first if you're seeking these other things of the world if you're not looking for th if you're not looking if you're looking at those and you're not seeking God then sin comes right in your life and causes problems and causes problems in our families it causes problems with us it causes problems with our businesses it causes problems in school it causes problems in church if we're not seeking God first if we're not just being a Christian like the Lord Jesus said that we should be it's that simple and then we worry and God promised he promised he said that I will restore he said that I'll take care of you but seek first that Kingdom the musicians can come and I'll close it's really been on my heart I've talked with brother Jordan about it I've talked with some of the other brothers about it I want to help our kids I want to help our young people I want to help even people that aren't so young that might need help in their careers I want to help them move forward I want to provide the tools that they need to succeed I believe that's that's the Lord I believe the a church isn't just the preacher up there preaching and explaining the word the church is there to help us all we give as I always preach give give give but then we also receive and if you want to do something for me as you've heard brother brandom say do it for my children and I want to do that for us I want to help I want to start helping these young people and and older people too that maybe want a career change I want to start helping them move forward in their lives so I've asked brother Jordan he's gonna he's going to help me out we're gonna start looking for avenues that we can find um financial aid or or or classes that are you that our people can take if they want if they want to move forward word and help them succeed brothers and sisters I want to see every one of you succeed if you're 80 years old or if you're 15 years old I want to see the Lord bless you and I'm not talking about financially I'm talking about in life I want to see you choose the right man or the right woman to marry I want to see this happiness but first we have to seek the kingdom of God we got to be Christians and everything that we do and if you start a new job or if you start a a new fellowship or whatever it is and you do these principles that Jesus set forward then the Lord will bless you he promised he'll provide what you need you might not make us a millionaire but maybe we're not supposed to be maybe we're supposed to struggle because it builds our character it's okay to struggle as as Jesus said he says you have a lot of anxiety today he said don't worry you're going to have it tomorrow it'll be there but seek first the kingdom of God and he'll take care of it brother Josiah when I think about the [Music] Lord when I think about the Lord how he save me how he rais me how he filled me with the whole Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up turned me around place my feet on Solid Ground when I think about the Lord oh when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raise me how he fill me with the Holy Ghost how he heal me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up turned me around place my feet On Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all of the glory all of the honor and all of the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord worthy of all the glory all of the honor all praise when I think about the Lord how he Sav me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost when I think about the Lord how he picked me up and turned me around how he set my feet on Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy all of the glory all of the honor all of the praise it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all of the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise amen amen brothers and sisters [Music] it's the best thing that we can do in life is to be a Christian I was wondering how do I know if if I was that widow woman how do I know that God has commanded me to do something because he didn't come down like he did to Elijah the prophet he didn't come down and talk to him talk to her like that she just was faced with a decision and she made the right decision and I think that there is a pull that's on us and as we pray and as we go through life there's something that's just pulling on us to do something and you know that if it's not God you know that it glorifies yourself but if it is God then it's glorifying him and it's usually the harder thing to do and it usually requires a sacrifice of your time a sacrifice of your prayer prayers he usually requires that like this widow woman then the rest of the story her son died and there was that man of God there and man of God raised up the child to live with his mom she was a blessed lady and I just think she was commanded by God to do something great I want to feel that commandment Lord I want to be in that channel you may not say it to me but you can still command me to do something we were talking the other night about how do I know when I have the Holy Spirit how do I know when it really is dwelling in me and there's a number of different ways that we know one of those ways is that there is just a continually refilling of the Holy Spirit we know the parable of the wise and the the foolish virgin the wise virgin kept that oil in the lamp all the time and it was constantly filling it up but then there is that place that we get to like this Widow woman where we bow down and we say Lord whatever you require that will I do then you know that Holy Spirit is operating right

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610oMSeVPvU\n========================================\n\nI um I was talking with my uh my grandmother this morning God bless her she's she's streaming in and she uh she's just you heard the prayer request her nerves were were um just out of out of sorts and just struggling sometimes we get like that and what we don't understand is those things are normal it's it's normal for us to go through these the these fa phases of ups and these phases of downs and there is just something as sister Jessica is saying there is something that's within us that is just crying out to something over on the other side it's something that the Apostle Paul I believe it was he said it's something behind the veil it's something on the other side of the Veil and as when I was thinking about that scripture the other day I was I was thinking what is that really mean Beyond the Veil or on the other side of the veil and it's something that that we go back to the original Temple and there was the holy of holies that was that inner Sanctuary that that Mercy Seat where the Ark of the Covenant was you had the ark was a a wooden box and then on the top of the Ark was what's called called The Mercy Seat with with two cherubims on the top with their with their wings touching on either side and there in that once a year the presence of the Lord would come down and it would just be for that one high priest once a year that would be able to go into there and experience the presence of God and now the Apostle is telling us that he's saying that there is something Beyond the Veil and it's like if you're up against a a curtain or a wall and you put your ear up to it there's something there that's speaking to you and with with this gospel that that the song says come Jesus come there's something in us that just longs to to have that what's behind that Veil have that that voice that's speaking it Lord I want to know you better I need to understand you Lord I it's I'm going to die if I don't have you that longing that we have to that being that Spirit that's over that's over on the other side Psalm 42 says that it's a deep calling to the Deep it's something that that all read it psalm believe it's Psalm 42 Psalm 42:7 says Psalm 426 it says oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore I will remember thee from the land of Jordan and the hermit from the hill of misar deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy wat spouts it's waterfalls all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life do we really know who that God of Our Lives is do we really we all come to church we all call ourselves Christians we all say we're Believers but do we really know that voice that's on the other side of the Veil do we really understand do we really have a relationship with that God that's speaking us to us from the other side brothers and sisters I I believe that he wants us to know him and just as sure as there is a voice over on the other side of the veil and the other side of another dimension calling out to us there is also another voice from Satan that hates us and we'll do anything in his power and he has great power to prevent us from going over there that he's doing everything that he can because he wants our souls and he'll do anything that he can and if he knows that he can't have our souls then he'll try to take our joy he'll try to take our happiness he'll try to ruin our lives just like sister mine was talking the prayer request about about your son and now he wants to do what's right and here comes Satan seeing that and if he can't have the soul he wants the joy he hates us and he's going to do everything that he can to keep us from that Joy of Jesus Christ that love of Jesus Christ in um Jesus's first public sermon the Sermon on the Mount Jesus says some things that really no one had ever heard very very deep teachings and let's turn to Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 and Jesus is still preaching he's he's gone through a a fairly lengthy sermon and now he says some things that are a bit frightening Matthew chapter 7 verse verse 21 it says this not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so not everyone that claims Jesus Christ not everyone that claims that they're a Son of God not everyone that claims those things is going to enter in to that place but only he that does the will of my father is what Jesus is saying many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in that in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in my name Jesus is saying in the name of Jesus Christ they're saying these things and then he's going to say depart from me I never knew you therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and does them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and and it fell not and it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto the foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings that the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes so here's Jesus saying he say and this is his first public sermon and he makes a statement like if you don't do what I say then you're going to be lost and many will come in my name and say have we not cast out devils and done these Mighty works and I'm going to say I never knew you depart from me and then he tells it what he had preached earlier he tells about what things what he was commanding us to do and the people listening to him and they were things that seemed very simple but they were things that I see very very few people on this day doing James chapter 1 verse n verse 19 now James was a follower of Jesus Christ he became the pastor of the church in Jerusalem after Christ had ascended James 1: 19 says this wherefor my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness that means overflowing wickedness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soul Souls be ye doers of the word and not hearers only for if any deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass for behold he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless the widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world so what James is saying he's saying that Jesus taught these things Jesus taught that we should prefer our brother and and and and a few of the things that I'll mention here in a moment and he's saying that don't just be hearers of the word don't just listen to it but you go and you do it and Jesus himself said if you're not going to do what I say you're going to be lost and I'm going to say depart from me you're the work of iniquity you're going to say come before the Lord you're going to say Lord have I not believed you have I not cast out devils in your name have I not done all these things and he's going to say no you didn't do what I told you and then what James is saying here when he says looks in front of a glass James is saying that you are looking in a mirror when you're in church probably and you're looking in this mirror and you're seeing yourself and you're saying Lord I need to improve what the brother was saying and and quoting the Lord Jesus and that I need to improve in my life and then you walk out of the church and as time starts to go by you forget what manner of person you were before and then you go right back into everyday life and the feeling that we might have in church that feeling of condemnation I need to do a better job it leaves and you forget what you looked like verse number 26 it says this I'm going to read the um I'm going to read The New International Version let's start with verse 26 with James 1 says this those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rain on their tongues deceive themselves and their religion is worthless religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after the orphans and the widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world it's pretty simple it's as I said we come to church we receive correction we see ourselves in the mirror that we need to do better we go right back to the life of criticism of everything outside of ourselves and then time goes by and all of a sudden you look at yourself and wow I'm the same person I was five years ago I'm the same person I was 10 years ago I'm the same person I was 20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago what in my life has changed why have I not turned a corner and it's because we become complacent in what we believe and we're ignoring ing many times we think that we're great we think that we have this great Revelation and we ignore what Jesus said he said Matthew 5 he said you have heard that it was said the people long ago you shall not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment but I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or a sister will be subject to judgment do we believe that Matthew another one says this in Matthew there for if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you leave your gift there at the altar and first go and be reconciled to them and then come and receive your gift if someone has something against you you are to go to that person if if you've done no no wrong you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and to for tooth but I tell you don't resist an evil person if anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn it other cheek Also if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt give them your coat as well if anyone forces you to go one mile forces you to go to mile not you're walking and you're greed and you're enjoying it but if anyone forces you to go a mile with them go two miles with them give the one who asks you and don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from from you you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I tell you to love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you this is Jesus Christ God made flesh speaking that you may be children of your father he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and S Reigns on the just on the just and the unjust if you love those who love you what reward will you get are not even the publicans doing that if you greet only your own people what are you doing more than the others don't even the pagans do that some says publicans some translations say publicans some translations say say Gentiles some translations say pagans the one I just read it's Sinners don't the Sinners do that too be perfect therefore even as your Father in Heaven is perfect these are the commandments of Jesus and he says if you are not doing these things my Commandments then when you come before me I'm going to say Department from me you that work iniquity I never knew you these these things right here that well teaching teachings of Jesus and you say well I'm higher than that I understand more I I have we have a much deeper understanding now but we don't the fact is we don't if we're not doing these things that Jesus commanded and he has many other things then we are not being what Jesus commanded us to be and we run the risk of coming him to him in that day and saying Lord I believed your message with all my heart I came to church every Sunday I did this and this and this and he's going to say what you didn't do what I told you to do you had every opportunity to open this book and read the words and read and all the other words and you didn't do them how many of us have we driving on the highway merging in and here comes this guy behind us and he's trying to get us I do it every morning merging on the AA Road under the freeway and inevitably the guy behind me two lanes coming together to get on the highway the guy behind me tries to get in front of me fires me up but bro we can't we got to let them have it what is it going to cost me maybe maybe one second maybe two seconds we're Christians when in our we're in our cars too those things count I use that because it's an easy example for us all to think about it's not just a sister or a brother in church that you might have something against that you're not even going to go to heaven if you don't get it right first by the way that's a promise but it's not just that it's the people that we meet every day and if somebody does us wrong be a Christian about it we want the Deep things let me tell you the Deep things these are the Deep things these are the most important things we look at we look at the Lord there's three there's a beautiful set of three words in the Bible and I believe it's in first John's one of John's Epistles he says this he says God is love that love of God that's there how that it just overflows in all of us who have sinned against him and forsaken him and done all that we've had and that we've done in our lives and he just loves us more and loves us more and takes care of us because he knows that one day this is my child and he's going to repent and we need to have the same Spirit as him and we need to build this foundation on a solid rock and that rock is this word and the revelation of this word and that's where we need to build our house on of this life and if we build it on something else that house is going to fail as I read Lord Jesus saying let me tell you about we're going through the Book of Daniel and we we just finished up brother L is going to give us a summary on Wednesday but let me tell you a story in This Book of Daniel that shows a perfect example of a man who had a weak foundation and then God brought him around gave him some character and gave him a strong Foundation was one of the greatest testimonies in the Bible and it's not even one in the lineage of God's people it's a king and not just a king one of the evilest kings that we have ever seen one of the most ruthless kings that had one of the worst tempers one of the most um narcissistic kings that you'll ever read and that's this man Nebuchadnezzar what an awful person he was Nebuchadnezzar didn't have a foundation in his life but there was some good in the man and what he did is he has this bad dream he hears about this Prophet named Daniel Daniel comes and interprets this dream to Nebuchadnezzar and not only interprets the dream but tells him his dream so then Nebuchadnezzar sees that this man is something this man is great so what he does is in the very next chapter he builds this giant statue of gold and he tells the people to Fall Down and Worship this statue maybe like he was like he was doing because of where the it lays in the scripture and because of the things that Nebuchadnezzar said it's very obvious that this statue that was built up in the plane was a statue of the Prophet Daniel brother brandom said the same thing that it was so he builds this statue and he says now when you hear this sound you fall down and everybody here you fall down and you worship this statue like I am and he lifts this statue up to a Godlike thing because Nebuchadnezzar didn't have an understanding he didn't have that um that that strong Foundation of God so he builds this up he's happy everything's going good so there's these three young men Daniel wasn't forced to worship the statue because it was a statue of himself of course he wouldn't have to but there were three young men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who had a strong Foundation so when they were forced to worship this statue they said I'm not go we are not going to do it we would rather die than to worship anything but our God they had a firm foundation so Nebuchadnezzar loses his temper gets all fired up we know the story fired up he fired up the the furnace seven times hotter and he takes Shadrach meach and abedo and he says now you all we're going to throw you in there if you won't recant if you won't worship the statue they say no God's able to deliver us but even if he doesn't Deliver us we're still going to worship God and if God changes your life even if times get hard you're gonna say even if my life is ruined I'm still going to worship God and that's that's the attitude that these young men had he gets them there they throw them in the furnace this big flame comes out of the furnace and it it kills the soldiers that are with them Shad um Nebuchadnezzar looks into this Burning fiery furnace that was used probably to melt metal and it was seven times hotter than normal and he sees four people walking in there and he says hey didn't you put three like yeah well there's a fourth one in there and then the Gentile says Ah he looks like the Son of God how he knew that I don't understand right but he had that Revelation there was something good about about that man so he goes and he pulls him out and he says this Daniel chapter 3 verse 27 and the princes and the governors and the captains and the Kings and the counselors began to gather together and they saw those men upon whose whose body fire had no power nor was a hair of their head singed neither was their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo who have sent his Angel and delivered his servants and trusted them and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God therefore I make it agree that every people nation and language would speak anything against the Miss against the god of Shadrach mhach and abedo he still isn't there yet he still doesn't have that Foundation it's this other God it's this God of these great men that did great things the God of this Daniel and he was giving reverence to this God and not knowing that he had not accepted that God himself his foundation was weak that's why he's saying it's their God because he didn't know him and how many times do what us all of us we say oh it's the God of this great man or this man did these great things or our pastor does this or priest does this or whoever it is does this these great miraculous things he knew God but Nebuchadnezzar and US often we don't know the same God but instead we put it on someone else and truly do not know him we know he did great things we know he's powerful beyond measure but do we know him do we know that voice that's on the other side of that Veil therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language would speak anything aiss against the god of Shadrach mesach and abedo shall be cut into pieces and their houses shall be made a dungill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sword then the king promot did Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon so he knew that there was something powerful and he believed he said a decree he was like this their God is true but he didn't know that God himself he did not understand that he his foundation needs to be built on that God and not just rely on the foundation of these other people so then he goes on in the next chapter and he has a dream and this dream is about very very it's it's a very hard dream same man Daniel comes and interprets the dream he tells him he says Nebuchadnezzar he says you're going to lose you're going to lose everything he says you're going to be like a beast in the field so then Nebuchadnezzar some time passed and then he's out and he's looking out across this great Babylon the king and he says look at this Babylon which I have built and his pride welled up in him and this then the prophecy that had come forth the interpretation of the Dream came forth and right at that moment because that Pride welled up in him because he didn't understand that he didn't have that Foundation that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had that Daniel had because he didn't have that he fell and it was the grace of God that he fell he lost his mind went out into the field for seven years he was there his Nails grew out long crawled around like a cow slept in the field woke up in the morning and the Dew was on his back his hair got really long men crazy can you imagine what the people said can you imagine how embarrassing it was to him this was Nebuchadnezzar our great king and he's out there eating grass and and and out of his mind for seven years and then what was going on I believe is God was building that foundation not on Sand but God tore him down so that that Foundation could be rebuilt and built upon a rock Nebuchadnezzar then his mind was restored to him and then he had the honor of being the only Gentile King and and really probably the only Gentile that has his own chapter dedicated to him in the Bible and it's his testimony it's testimony of how I failed and how I how I pride welled up in me and yet God had mercy on me let's go to Daniel 4 we'll start with verse 29 this is the king talking this is Nebuchadnezzar giving his whole his own testimony he speaks in third person because a lot of the Kings used to do that Daniel 4:29 says this at the end of 12 months he walked into the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon the king spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for my for the house of the Kingdom by the might and of my power and for the honor of my Majesty while the world was in the king while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy TW Dwelling Place will be the beasts of the field he's giving his testimony about this is what happened to me and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times seven years shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high rule in the Kingdom of men and giveth to whom he whosoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from all men and did eat grass and his body was wet with the de of Heaven till his hairs were grown out like e eagle feathers and his nails were like Bird's Claws and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven now brothers and sisters it's no longer the god of Shadrach mesach and abedo it's no longer the god of Daniel it's no longer the god of Paul it's no longer the God of this Prophet or that Prophet or the god of brother brandom or the god of anything it's no longer that I lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding returned unto me and I blessed the most high and I praised and honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to [Music] generation and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say to him what doest thou and at the same time my reason return to me and for the glory of my kingdom my honor and brightness return to me and my counselors and my lord lord sought unto me and I was established in my kingdom and an excellent Majesty was added to me now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of Heaven no more another one no more there's many there's multiple of them now I honor the one true God because in those Hard Times those past seven years none of us have gone through something like that he learned who God was he learned to trust God and his ways and his judgments and to those that walk he said now I Nebuchadnezzar praised and extolled and honor the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abas he was Nebuchadnezzar now is testifying now I have this Foundation now I know that there's one this one true God and now I have a relationship with him and everything was restored to this man but he couldn't see it before he couldn't see he gave honor to this God because he had seen his miracles and he had seen his servants he gave honor to him but he didn't know him himself his foundation was sand and it fell the house got destroyed and out into the field he goes and then rebuilding this Foundation he comes back and now he there's only one God and I know him now my brother he said tell me we talk about the Lord and and there's Nebuchadnezzar couldn't see the importance of knowing this one God he didn't understand and my brother used to say like a blind man you can put up two fingers and say how many fingers am I holding up four no how many fingers am I holding up two no how many fingers am I holding up 14 no he doesn't understand he can't see and no matter how mad you get at him no matter how upset you get the man can't see because he's blind those scales need to come off of our eyes and we have to admit like Nebuchadnezzar did humble ourselves Lord take this blindness away help me to serve you help me to understand Lord let me let me know you better like this man did like these men in the Bible these women in the Bible Lord let me know you better because I don't know you all I know is a church or all I know is a Creed or an idea I need to know you all of us everyone under this roof needs to have that attitude because we're not there we are not what we should be we should be better and then there's times that the Lord like this man Nebuchadnezzar there's times when the Lord will let us if we are his child he'll let us fall and let us come to complete ruin to show us that your foundation is wrong and then build it back up and I wondered I always wondered I've seen people fall into sin I always wondered why why do some humble themselves and come back and others just fly away there's two stories I'll tell there was a man that I knew that he's married and children and uh his nephew had a girlfriend and so he allowed this girl to come they allowed the girl to come stay in their house well he ends up having an affair with this young lady ruining his marriage ruining his life and he goes and he says instead of repenting to his wife instead of making it right this was his opportunity to leave and to live a life of sin so then now he's free so now he starts going to the bars starts drinking starts running around the guy's in his was in his mid-40s starts starts just doing terrible things ends up just being a a total nothing and loving sin and even and and then he became he turned against the faith that he was raised in he he didn't just turn against the message of brother Brandon he turned against it all he left the whole Faith to serve himself I look at that that man and I I I think why because that sin was in you you never had a foundation you grew up in all this but it was never built strong you sinned you made a mistake terrible mistake but you made a mistake now what are you going to do about it and that's so often with us we'll make a mistake we'll do something wrong and then what proves it doesn't prove that we're not a Christian what proves if we're a Christian or not is what we do about our mistakes is if we can get up and then we can serve God and say I failed I messed up I want to read a testimony of my grandpa PA's cousin and uh I think you'll enjoy it and let me this is another person that did the same thing that made the same mistake but he had a foundation in his life and he turned his life around he was allowed to sin if you could put up the the quote brother the bram's telling this story he says this brother Ram says I was sitting in a room and I had to hurry out there my wife said now get to this little girl this or this little woman she had two or three little children and I walked in where she was and the only thing I the only the only thing I'd seen her these couple times just know that she belonged to the Methodist Church Main Street Methodist Church in New Albany and she was sitting there holding her hands like this and she said and I said what's the matter sis brother brandom had prayed for her in a prayer line earlier um not that day but sometime earlier and it didn't work and she was terrible with her nerves she was she was losing her mind and she said oh I don't know brother brandom she said I guess I'm just crazy and I said I don't think so you don't talk like a crazy person to me so I had her to get up and and stretch different you see and till I could get her off of that thought I said let's take a little trip and let's go back before the world began let's watch the world come into existence before God had made his first star and so forth like that so he starts preaching Jesus he starts preaching God to her to calm her mind and to raise her faith in a few moments I felt the angel of the Lord pulling me into this Channel and when it did I seen a little black car running like that right across my room and said were you ever in an accident she said no sir see now on a platform I have prayed for her and let her go on see but I had I had her before me and I watched again just a minute the first thing you know here it come I seen a vision break then come right straight in it caught me no way of getting away from it then I said I see a little car you're sitting by a blond-headed man and there's an automobile coming you pass it and there's a big light it's a train and there went the vision she let out a scream and jumped out under the floor and fainted so the vision went on and here it was when she got married just before her husband went overseas just a few weeks she was a young woman he went to war and he went overseas her being a just girl she started running around being Lonesome and she started running around with another man and she went out in a little car with him one night and lived untrue to her marriage vows and on the road home was almost killed by a train told her all about that what she did and then when she raised her up in the floor she began screaming to the top of her voice wife came in there and said why what's the matter she said oh brother brandom don't you tell nobody I said I thought you told me you were a Christian she said I am she said I've confessed that to God years ago I said it wasn't God you sinned against it was your husband your marriage vow you was a married woman I I said you'll have to go and make that right with your husband if you ever if you ever get well she Saidi can't do it it'll break up our home she said' I've got three children and she said my husband would leave me I said now lady I've done all I can do she said you know there I said you know there isn't a psychiatrist in the world that could pull that out of you that's way back in the Gable end of your soul you're just subconsciously think of it so you got yourself in that condition I said' that's the whole thing now there is the truth and and you know it's the truth there's no person in the world but you that you that man and me that knows this now she said that's right but said I just couldn't make it right I said well now that's all I can do she said oh you're going to leave he said yes ma I said yes ma'am there's a man sitting in this room which this which is this man here I said he's very seriously ill fevered up here this morning I said I've got to go in there's some more people coming in and she said oh I just can't said what must I do I said go call your husband and make it right get right get the thing clean that's the only way to do it and she said well she said I just can't do it she said I'll just die I just started just started like that and I happened to look around and seen something forming by the side of her and looked and there stood a blackheaded man combed his hair over kind of sideways kind of wavy a little older than she was I said is your husband a black-headed man she said yes sir I said kind of tall yes sir I said isn't he a deacon in the church she said yes sir I said he works for a chevolet company doesn't he she said yes yes sir I said he has the same thing to confess to you no wonder brother Johnson can't have a Revival brother Johnson was their Pastor in the Methodist Church no wonder you can't have a Revival no wonder the spirit of the Lord won't won't move in the congregation there's sin I said look at here I said your husband when he landed in France he had taken a girl and told her what he did and said now there's a woman works in the office and she was wearing a pink dress and she was in a Green Chevrolet car no more than three days ago and he's guilty of the same thing she said no not my husband and I said well you all better get things right you better call them up so me got to talking to her and persuaded her to do it and she went and called her husband they got in the car and met on the road she got in his car and she said now I want to tell you and she confessed all to him and he was looking at her and said now didn't you want to go out with this woman at the office there two or three days before that and you were in a Green Chevrolet car and she was wearing p a pink he said how did you know that where have you been and so she told her so she told her so she told her where where it been he said honey that's the truth and I will admit it's the truth and if you'll forgive me I will forgive you and will raise our children and start a life right in a few minutes here they come back up the steps tears streaming down their cheeks aha Satan lost his hold then see now there's where it's at see now that settled but as long as that sin was under there no matter how loud you scream or how hard you stomp or how much oil you pour on or how loud you pray or how easy you pray or whatever you do the devil will stay right there because there he has a legal right as long as you have unconfessed sin that's right that was my grandfather's cousin who I used to talk to on the phone and he never wanted to talk about that he said no he he says I'll talk about my Ministry he said but I won't talk about that that's personal it's family Things Not only was he a deacon in the church but he also became pastor of the church and had a great ministry in the New Albany area he had when he was faced with sin and he had fallen he had that foundation and he made it right and the other one didn't two foundations one fell and one stood strong closing turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 remember Nebuchadnezzar looking at the other holy man looking at Daniel or Shadrach mhach and abedo and saying their God and I follow that their God but it needed to become Nebuchadnezzar's God 1 Corinthians chapter 3 says this and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ he says I fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you these are the people that sat in the book in the church with their notebooks listening to the Apostle Paul the man with the greatest revelation of Jesus Christ on Earth at that time the man that pinned most of the New Testament the man that solidified the deity of Jesus Christ he was the greatest of them all and and here they were they were the ones listening to Paul and Paul says I fed you with milk because you couldn't stand meat he's telling them that you still aren't able to for you are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and striving and divisions are you not yet carnal and walk as men for while one says I am of Paul and another I am of apollis are you not carnal for saying that I follow this man I follow that man remember this is the greatest man besides Jesus in the New Testament in my opinion speaking and he's saying you're you're carnal because you're saying you're following me who then is Paul and who then is apoll but ministers by whom you have believed even as the lord gave to every man English Standard Version says what then is apollis and what is Paul servants through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each the only thing we are is a vessel through which you believed the first church age messenger the messenger the Ephesian Agee the one who was present when the white horse rider started writing all of these deep things in Revelation he's saying that my only role is to be a servant through whom you have believed that doesn't lessen himself that lifts up Christ I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase there should be no division never division between any church any so-called Christian church or any denomination or anyone who claims Jesus Christ and I'm not talking about local churches I'm talking about any church that calls themselves Christians there should be no no division because our job is only to introduce someone to Christ as Paul said listen I'm nothing my job is to introduce you to Christ and so's Apollos over here so then neither is he that planteth any anything neither is he that WTH but God gave the God but God that giveth the increase he's saying I'm nothing other people elevated him to a god I believe it was on Mars Hill like they like Daniel elevated neb or Nebuchadnezzar elevated Daniel to a god a God is infallible and that's what makes him a god now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own according to his own labor for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry that's a field you are God's Building so you're God's field field and you are God's Building he's building this foundation in you according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the the foundation and another build it there on but let every man take heed how he builds there on so the Apostle Paul he's built the foundation just as a concrete mason will will pour the slab and you got to have your subgrade right you got to have all your compaction right you got have your Steel in your in your concrete and you build that and then the the framers come in and they build the house but imagine if they built the house and it didn't fit the slab imagine if you're putting the 2x4s over in the gravel beside the beside the concrete it won't work but you build upon that Foundation that was laid for other Foundation can no man lay than is laid which is Christ Jesus that is the foundation let's skip to verse 18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seems be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise how many arrogant and prideful people would say I know I'm right I know I'm right I know this is the truth and nobody can tell me any different that was Nebuchadnezzar the Gentile Paul's saying and it's probably offending n90 90% of the people he's writing to in that Corinthian Church he's saying don't deceive yourself you may think you got it but it's foolishness for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men as Nebuchadnezzar did for all things are yours what matters is Christ and he's about to say what matters whether Paul Paul or Apollos or sephus really three of the greatest men in the whole new testament sephus is Peter whether Paul or Apollos of sephus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours if you have that foundation and you're Christ and Christ is God's I say it a lot musicians can come a close there is nothing that matters in life other than introducing someone to that Foundation Building that Foundation which is Christ really the greatest of them all the Apostle here he says I'm nothing but I'm just a tool in God's hand to introduce you to Jesus Christ we see the two men the one his name is Wilber Shane um which is is my U my grandpa's cousin uh cousin-in-law and then this other man and we see one took the opportunity to run away and that house failed the other one as humbled as he was and as low as he got he humbled himself and then God restored him not only to be a deacon but God restored him so much that he eventually became a minister and led a church for many years became a wonderful man and that's us we fail we mess up but let that be the foundation that we're building and that Foundation Let It Be Christ and not some other man not somebody else not a pastor as I said not you got to have your own you got to have your own relationship there amen and the good way to start that Foundation is to be baptized according to this Bible according to acts 238 according to the Book of Romans where we go into that water and we are making a public confession that now I accept this man Jesus Christ I want to take on his name name I want to be part of him I want to be one of these Christians that this Bible talks about I want to be one of those people I'm going to go into this water I'm going to be baptized I'm going to be put underwater I'm going to come back up and that represents a sinner that is me being washed clean by the death of Jesus Christ that's what baptism means that's why it says Washed by the Water of the word that's why it says that we were we were dead in the Book of Romans we were we were dead and we went into the grave and we came back up a new creature that's what baptism is we take on the name we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ because we want to be associated with him Christian you're not being baptized into a church you're being baptized into a body into a body of Christians so when you are baptized and there is someone else who believes in Jesus Christ there is someone else who has also taken on this name you are Brethren it makes you a brother it makes it makes you a Christ it doesn't make you a Christian it shows that you're a Christian when you're baptized and it shows that I believe in the blood of Jesus Christ that will wash away my sins and that Foundation gets built and nothing nothing will hinder that Foundation if it's strong and it's in Christ if it's built on the words of a man if it's built on if it's built on your mother if it's built on your father if it's built on your grandmother if it's built on anything else but Jesus Christ it'll fail but if it is built on him it'll always stand strong and let me tell you something you can live your life studying him and studying his word and you can't even scratch the surface of how great he is you can't even scratch the surface of the love that that man had and the love that he still has you can't and he is always willing to take you back brother Manny can 43 years man and he chose him at 50 years old to deliver deliver I remember I was reading my Bible one time I was really down it just made a big decision in my life and I opened up the Bible to the book of Acts I was repenting really down and I I looked and it said Saul Saul why persecute us without me it's hard for you to kick against the pricks I said Lord I just don't understand that what does it mean the Lord directed my my eyes over to the margin and it and explain what the Pricks was it was actually a a tool used to prod cattle and then the Lord showed me this is what I've always done to you I've always tried to get you to move in this direction but because of your head strongness you always kick back at me and it took just cleaning the Slate until he was finally able to deal with me and push me in the direction that he wanted me to go and that's the Apostle Paul here he had his religion he had his his rules he had his his Torah he had his understanding and it was not right and here he Paul is and he's kicking and kicking and kicking and persecuting and persecuting and persec finally the Lord put him on his back and says why do you persecute me and he didn't know he says I thought I was doing right but he wasn't doing right he was sinning and every time he would sin God had give him a poke and he says who are you Lord and he says I'm Jesus the one that you're persecuting and then Paul went and was baptized it's a good first step brother if you want to go if there's anybody else to be baptized just go back and and see the the brothers in the back the if there's a sister that you can see the sisters in the back and then we'll bring you up and and baptize you as I said it's a good time to build a foundation [Music]

I mentioned that scripture that I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase so what happened was come on in you're Christian right here so what happened was our young brother here was you're at a youth camp am I right he's at a youth camp and you're driving home from uh from the camp from the church camp and the pastor was talking to him about being baptized and it Spurs something in his heart the Bible says that in Acts chapter 2 it said that Peter preached those words and they were cut in their hearts and then they asked they said what must we do to receive the Holy Spirit and Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what happened to our brother here the the pastor was witnessing to him and it cut his heart and he felt that he wants to be baptized and take on this name of Jesus Christ am I right say something you believe in the Lord Jesus yeah to chur Christian what's your last name Christian can't say loud enough but um brothers and sisters this young man wants to serve God he was witnessed to seed was planted water the seed sister ala you watch it grow going to be he's going to have a wonderful life hold my hand right here a Christian by your own confession I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] brothers and sisters God bless you appreciate as always seeing a soul coming to be baptized in these Waters is something that's very scriptural and it's a glorious day as I said on Wednesday night that um the angels in heaven are rejoicing when one person comes and is baptized like this and we Rejoice also with the angels sister Alba and family I believe that up up in the in the in the Realms that are not known there is a jubilee going on that another Soul has come to Christ God bless you brothers and sisters I I just say up here uh remember camp this week we won't have service tonight um we will have

I didn't know there's been quite a few people that have talked to me and it's it's really important many times that their prayer requests are read before the people and I know because they they really have confidence in the prayers of the Saints so make sure when there's a prayer request read from the pulpit or you see it come out on the WhatsApp or you you um I say it on on my WhatsApp broadcast make sure that you take some time to bring those requests before the Lord because the person who gave those requests has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence in our prayers so make sure that we're doing that my friend Heath Rickard he's had some health problems he's some of them are pretty serious please keep him in prayer he's in a lot of pain and he just he really he needs a touch he desperately needs a touch from the Lord Sister Green is Karen says she's getting pretty low and it could be any time that she goes to be with the Lord it'll be a glorious time for her and it'll be a glorious time in heaven when our dear sister goes across across that Veil comes into the presence of the Lord where all the other Saints are it's a place where we all desire to get to she's getting close now and just to be good to pray for her and pray for her family and Friends pray for our church we're at a Crossroads we're at a pivotal time and in the history of the Tucson Tabernacle makes sure that each one of us are doing our part bringing these decisions that we have to make before the Lord Jesus in prayer none of us want to make the wrong decision so please pray for the church pray that we're in the Lord's will that he would make his will known to us and that our hearts would be open enough to to um pray for the right thing it's about our heads [Music] as our heads are bowed take a moment think about your friends think about your family [Music] think about those that might have a need [Music] think about yourself and if there is a need that that you feel that would be for someone or for yourself [Music] where the Lord might look down upon an uplifted hand and know what's underneath that hand would you raise your hand holding that request that you have in your heart and knowing that the great heavenly father is looking over the banister of heaven and he's looking at these hands [Music] good Lord I raise my hand in the name of Jesus Christ Lord for these prayer

of Grace Lord where a holy God can be at one end and a and a sinful but redeemed people can be at the other end and Lord you can just move in our midst you can move with your spirit you can speak to our hearts Lord you can anoint our lips and anoint our ears Lord help me to not misspeak and help no one to mishear but help us all to draw closer to you we thank you for this opportunity to be here tonight in Jesus precious name our study of Acts showed the Evangelistic efforts of the early church exploded in Acts 13. a deliberate effort was now being made to travel not to escape persecution from Jerusalem but to spread the gospel the good news of Jesus Christ far beyond the borders of Judea and Samaria it's what we call evangelism I'd like to read two brief portions of scripture before we get into Acts 14. the first if you want to turn to it in your Bibles is the concluding verses of Matthew's gospel Matthew 28 we'll begin at the 18th verse now Jesus to the angel and so forth had told his disciples to go to Galilee and he would meet them there so this is shortly after his resurrection they've gone to Galilee and Jesus now comes to the eleven surviving disciples shortly after his resurrection and he says Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power how much all all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth for what purpose how do we keep our association with this all-powerful one what are we to do go ye therefore go it's a command it's an imperative it's not a suggestion because I've been given all power here's what you must do go and teach by example as well as words all nations everyone regardless of ethnicity Heritage background circumstances social class All Nations baptizing them in the name singular the name not the titles but the name of the father of the son of the Holy Ghost which we know is Jesus he said to go teach well what are you supposed to teach them teaching them I just told you to teach them here's what you're to teach here's the lesson plan observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and I just commanded you to go and blow behold if you do this you may rest assured that I the all-powerful one m not will be not was I am with you always even to the end of the world regardless of the passage of time I transcend time get your eyes off of time amen and if we then turn to Acts chapter 1 verses six through eight now this is in Jerusalem just prior to his Ascension that what I just read was shortly after his resurrection there's been this 40-day period he's getting ready to ascend so when they the remaining 11 disciples the same ones that he has just told us in Matthew that he has been given all power were therefore come together they asked of the resurrected Jesus saying Lord will thou at this time restored again the kingdom to Israel always wanting to know or think they do know or think that they want to know the future just like us always trying to unravel the Rapture or the tribulation or the bride or the or the church when this future event will happen What form will it take too often being distracted from what we should be expending our time and energy to accomplish so Jesus admonishes them he Jesus said unto them the disciples it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power stop asking me I've been given all power so if the father's put it in his power I have that power so I could tell you but I won't you're completely missing the point but pay attention now here's what this is all about it's not some secret knowledge or some obscure revelation it's not about escaping from this world but ye shall shall this is a certainty you you shall receive power where is that going to come from from me all power has been given unto me so for meat for whom all power is given the only source the repository I'll share it with you in the following way after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you the channel of grace through which I send my power to you and what's the purpose of you receiving this power ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea Samaria to the uttermost part of the Earth oh you're getting our purpose as Christians is simple spread the gospel you want to see Miracles a church like the book of Acts spread the gospel you want the power of God in your life spread the gospel you want to see the Holy Spirit move in our midst spread the gospel it's not rocket science it's bread the gospel and that's exactly what the book of Acts is all about telling the story of the earliest Christians and how they expended their lives their efforts their energies for one purpose spread the gospel let's take a quick recap of Acts that we've covered so far acts 1 gave the commission wait for the Holy Spirit we just read it and then spread the gospel to the entire world Acts 2 tells us that Spirit filling the Believers in the upper room and how they immediately wasn't the next day it wasn't after they'd studied some more it wasn't a few hours later but instantly they set about spreading the gospel even speaking words they themselves did not understand Acts 3 and 4 tells of a public miracle which led to many more converts to the way and the subsequent trouble with the religious authorities in Jerusalem acts 5 was about honesty with the fellowship and with God acts six and seven tell about Stephen the first martyr what was he guilty of spreading the gospel acts 8 tells of spreading the gospel to Samara and Judea to the Ethiopian eunuch coming to Faith acts 9 introduces solid it tells of Peter miraculous healing even raising one Dorcas from the dead getting him in position so that in Acts 10 when Cornelius has a vision Peter will be in the right place at the right time to do what spread the gospel to the first Gentile Believers the household of Cornelius acts 11 is the all two predictable reaction of people who objected to Outsiders becoming believers they have to go through what we did Fair it's not right but in Acts 11 when Peter tells them what happened and they hear the truth those who objected not only relented but they embraced the change acts 12 it tells us about Peter's escape from prison the death of Herod Antipas the one who had John the Baptist killed and mocked Jesus the morning of his execution and this brings us to the last two lessons we've had on Acts 13. which is all about what spreading the gospel here's a map it may be a little hard for you to see in the back that's a hint that you should sit closer to the front this is the Journey of Solomon Barnabas and John Mark so far from Acts 13. they left here from Antioch of Syria they sailed to the East End of the island of Cyprus salamis was the name of the city they worked away just since about 90 miles to the Western end to paphos had success in spreading the gospel message to the towns along the way just before leaving Cyprus they had an encounter with a sorcerer and the way the Lord dealt with them led to the conversion of the governor of Cyprus a man named paulus and at that time in verse 9 Luke tells us that Saul that's how we say in an English in Hebrew which means prayed for became known as Paul from paulus a Latin Roman name meaning small or humble they then sailed from Cyprus to perga the southern coast of what we Now call Turkey it's not the same as pergamus which is several hundred miles away John Mark left him at this point and he sailed back here to Jerusalem it's all in Barnabas continued Inland to Antioch of basidia it's about 94 miles if you could go in a straight line but the airlines were down that day so they had to walk through the mountainous terrain it was a bit more than 94 miles for them Paul preached a sermon there which Luke excerpts and summarizes for us in Acts 13 verses 16 to 41. well an antioccupacity they expanded their reach from those that worshiped in synagogues to the general Gentile population their vision for the mission and expanded persecution then arose we read about that in Acts 13 verses 50 to 52 where the Jewish people that did not accept Paul's teaching stirred up influential people in town and they were kicked out I think the Lord sort of nudged them to keep on walking well acts 13 ended with them journeying to Iconium which is this town right here it's about 76 miles in a straight line from Antioch of the city but again they couldn't travel in a straight line they had to go through the mountains footnote you see on the map that this region that includes Antioch and Iconium as part of this uh kind of peach colored thing it's called galatia glace is a region it's it's a province so later when Paul writes his letters to the Believers in galatia that the addresses include the churches that are established in this region that we're reading about in Acts 13 and 14. Galatians isn't written to a church in a city but to multiple churches in a region and finally while we don't know the dates and only the approximate years General consensus is that from the start of Acts 13 sorry I'll get it right there we go wrong button when they sailed from here until they eventually get back at the end of Acts 14 back to Antioch covers a period of about two years so this wasn't uh you know a quick trip we'll start reading from acts 14 now the first verse it came to pass an Iconium that they saw in Barnabas went both together into the synagogue of the Jews so they started as is normal for them with the people that believed in Jehovah the the god of the Old Testament the god of Israel and so spake they were so convincing and with the power in which they presented the message of the Gospel the Risen Messiah that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks now these are Hellenistic Jews Hellenistic Jews because remember they're speaking in a synagogue so and there may have been gentile people there as well but they were people that attended the synagogue they believed in in the god of what we call the Old Testament so they believed and they accepted the gospel message but the unbelieving Jews that is those who did not accept the gospel but spurned it stood up to Gentiles they joined forces with the non-jewish elements of the local area not just the proselytes that were worshiping in this synagogue and made their minds evil affected influence they influence them they poisoned their minds they turned them strongly against the Brethren that's primarily of course Saul and Barnabas but would necessarily include those that had been persuaded but they were not intimidated rather for a long time therefore not because of the opposition but due to the acceptance of the Gospel message that's what therefore is referring to they Abode Solomon Barnabas and Iconium speaking quietly in a barely audible whisper behind closed doors says they spoke boldly in the Lord and the lord gave testimony unto the word of his grace his Divine favor and the Lord granted signs and wonders miraculous healings and so forth to be done by their hands he backed up what they said but however in spite of this the multitude the general population of the city was divided divided in their opinion about what was being taught part held with the unbelieving Jews that the apostles were spreading some sort of heresy in part with the apostles that the gospel message in fact was true and when there was an assault made now uh I'm not sure if he's speaking in legal terms but but in our country if a person is charged with assault they don't have to touch you if they touch you that's battery assault is getting in your face when there was an assault made an attempt to violently attack the apostles both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their rulers religious and Civil Authorities to use them despitefully means to mistreat or abuse them and even to Stone them so they had this intent to really do harm but they Solomon Barnabas were aware that they became aware they found out they learned of it and fled they fled remember Joseph had a dream at night and the angel came to him and said flee because herod's going to kill that baby so they fled they got out of there they didn't walk slowly they escaped from Iconium until last written Derby cities of lycunia and then to the region that lieth round about the neighboring districts but were they intimidated there they continued to preach the gospel so here I realize that this big Arrow they're not in a boat out here it's just helping you see this little arrow up here going from myconium to lyster that's that's only about 20 miles everybody's absorbed that Geographic data from the map will continue on and there somewhere in town sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a nowadays we'd say having a Mobility handicap or perhaps just disabled or with a disability from his mother's womb in other words it's a birth defect he'd never walked never it reminds us of the man at Jerusalem at the gate called Beautiful who also had deformed feet from birth the same heard Paul speak we don't know what he's saying except we know it was the Gospel but it seems likely that he was testifying of some of the miraculous healings the way that the Lord had been backing up the gospel that they're sharing personally I think while he was talking he saw this man felt a nudge from the Holy Spirit and perhaps witnessed about that healing at the beautiful gate but we do read that Paul steadfastly beholding him just like I'm looking at Amos steadfastly beholding him perceiving that he had Faith to be healed response to what he was hearing Paul preach and testify Paul said with a loud voice to the man with deformed feet stand upright On My Feet and he he the lame man who had never never was leg muscles were undoubtedly atrophied I've shared you the testimony of what happened to me when I was just bedridden for a few weeks he didn't slow around him we're told that he leaped heaped up and he walked I want to shift gears here just for a moment and go back to this is 2023 let's go back 50 years to 1973. little personal testimonial I was in the Army at that time I'd been drafted in December of 72 and uh uh so I was off at Fort Ord California and in January late January of 1973 a sister Grace evenly came and visited Tucson she her testimony is in the back of this book the 11th commandment she was uh given up to die by um Mayo Clinic and she was just just at the end just at the end she felt that if she could get to one of brother Brown's meetings that she'd be healed her husband to challenge her about that and that's what she'd said they they made they found out about a meeting they lived up in Sault Ste Marie Michigan in that area came down to Chicago while they were checking into the hotel somebody robbed everything out of their car so she was in this meeting and and she she when she came to Tucson I was in the Army she stayed with my wife she stayed with Heather in the trailer that we were renting at that time and so sister Grace was there for a few weeks and uh and she shared this testimony you said you know when you're laying down and and you get up you know you push yourself up if you're getting out of bed or you roll or you do something you assist yourself you couldn't do that but one moment she was laying on this cot and the prayer was made for her and instantly she was on her feet instantly she was on her feet this didn't just happen in the book of Acts this didn't just happen in Acts 9 or acts 5 or in uh in in Acts 14. this happened in 1955 or 56 in brother branham's in meetings and and it happened in this room right over here I remember Sister Sammy Allen was in a similar situation and and she'd been brought to church into cot she was in the fellowship hall there while the service was going on and God touched her she was on her feet and that was just a few years ago in this very building Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he still responds to Faith when the people saw what Paul had done not just heard what he said let's I'd like to just pause another moment like Peter and John at their beautiful gate in Jerusalem this miraculous healing took place in public and the presence of Skeptics the benefit wasn't just or even primarily for the one that was healed but a public witness of the Gospel of the grace and power of God when the people saw what God had done through Paul they the the people the not yet believing multitude lifted up their voices they were excited loudly proclaiming saying in the speech of like cornea whatever that speech is their local dialect which could be why Paul and Barnabas didn't immediately respond had it been in Hebrew or Greek or some other language they were familiar with they might have said something sooner but they said and they proclaimed that gods are come down to us and the likeness of men these aren't men as they appear to be they must be divine beings part of the pantheon of Olympus a similar response to the crowd of caesarea that heard Eric gripper speak back in Acts 12. but in this case it it wasn't while wearing a silver robe Seated on the throne making self-againizing statements it was the miraculous healing you'll notice throughout acts that healings aren't done in prayer lines in churches they're far more public and draw attention to God's word and power and Truth testifying and backing the words that are being spoken and witnessed to the lost and dying amen spreading the gospel and they call Barnabas Jupiter that's the chief God Zeus to the Greeks and Paul mccurious Mercury Hermes in in Greek the messenger because he was the chief speaker well then the priest of Jupiter the Temple of which was before their City it hit the entrance by the gate brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice he intended to do sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul with the people they were excited Jupiter has come down Among Us which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it when they understood what was really going on and they saw this escalation of this misunderstanding of the people they tore their clothes it was an expression of grief of oh no it might have been their only clothes they weren't carrying a big suitcase right and they ran out among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the Living God which made Heaven and Earth the sea and everything that's in them when times passed suffered All Nations to walk in their own ways but not anymore nevertheless he left not himself without witness and that he did good gave us rain from Heaven fruitful Seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them put yourself in that position you worship this Pantheon of gods your Pagan background you know nothing about Jesus Christ but what these two guys have been telling you about you've seen this miracle well you know very well that no man can heal a lame person just by telling him something and he pops up to his feet nobody can do that it's not possible so it has to be divine power has to be what else could it be and how could divine power live in a human unless a human were divine we saw the Same Spirit worshiping a man a vessel used by God and brother branham's Ministry sadly we still see people deceived by this very Spirit today well there came thither to lystra certain Jews from Antioch of facidia that had driven them out and Iconium 20 miles away who had tried to do them severe harm and with eloquent words they persuaded the people the people who had recently wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods but we're now ready to kill them as imposters destroyers of the way of life demons or devils and having stoned Paul they didn't just threaten they acted and they acted so quickly and vehemently that there was no way to escape as he had done years earlier in Damascus let down over the wall in a basket or recently an Antioch of basidia it was these angry people from that Antioch who appear to have been instrumental in this action they were a little bit like Saul before the road to Damascus they stoned Paul inside the city unlike Stephen and they drew him they dragged his lifeless body out of the city supposing he'd been dead why did they suppose he was dead because he was they killed him well why do you say that Brenda Lyle stoning is not tossing pebbles at somebody it's not trying to chase them away it's grabbing big rocks and smashing skulls smashing bones breaking ribs mangling bodies blunt force trauma if this nowadays people might use an aluminum baseball bat Paul was dead you don't have to take my word for it brother Brandon said he was dead so this I this is one of the most amazing things to me how be it as the disciples stood around about him now who are these disciples what have they been here in here that Jesus rose from the dead that he's alive they'd seen miracles well if he's alive and raises people and this is his speaker his messenger this guy this well if he can raise himself from the dead a few years ago he can certainly raise this man from the dead they weren't going how sad though let's let's give them a decent burial let's get some nice flowers for his funeral they weren't just standing around him they were praying for his life to return and again brother Branham explains that they did this at huge personal risk they had faith and they had expectation and they stayed there until Paul rose up now this is uh well speculation on my part let me stand aside about 14 years from the time of this event Paul wrote to the in second Corinthians and he told about going to the third heaven and seeing things that he just couldn't describe brother random talked about going to what he called the first heaven when he had that Vision be or that experience beyond the curtain of time we know that when Stephen was stoned he had a vision of Heaven he saw Jesus standing around and and he he mentioned that Vision that he was having as his life was passing away Paul said I don't know if I was alive or dead I don't know if I was in the body or not but I had this experience he wrote about it 14 years after this and when he wrote about it he said it was 14 years ago was it this experience we don't know but it might have been it might have been and where did Paul go anywhere but lystra that's where they just killed him no he returned to lystra he was just outside of it he came to the city and the next day probably still bloodied and bruised in pain likely traveling on foot he departed with Barnabas to Derby Derby will be the end point of their journey I was thinking about this and realizing that Paul was martyred twice he died twice for the witness of the Gospel once right here and later in Rome when he was beheaded so here we see going from Iconium or from lystra to Derby that's their next stop and it's the last stop it's about 60 miles I've pointed out galatia before Leicester and Derby you're also in the in this region along with Antioch and Iconium we're going to come to these towns a little bit later this evening when we read a witness from from another New Testament Source Peter and and and we'll we'll find out a couple of the chapters down that there's a couple of ladies of faith that lived in this area we don't know which of those towns maybe it was in the region in between but there was a lady named Lois she had her daughter named Eunice Eunice and her Greek husband had a son timothius and acts 16 we'll see Paul revisit lystra and Derby and take on timotheus Timothy as a companion during that journey of evangelism eventually two of the letters that we have preserved in our new testament in the Bible are letters that Paul wrote to this young man first and second Timothy and what many believe are either his first or second epistle will be written to the churches in the book of Galatians there's another thing that just happened here in lystra until now Paul's managed to escape physical persecution we read in Acts 9 25 that he was Lord in a basket outside the wall of the city of Damascus to escape those lying in wait at the gates the governor of the of Damascus was in on that at the end of Acts 13 He and Barnabas were chased out of the city of Antioch of basidia we read in Acts 14 6 just a few minutes ago how Paul and Barnabas escaped the crowd that wanted to Stone them in Iconium but now Paul is seized he's stoned to death his bodies dragged out of the city of lystra I think he was expecting this sort of thing he wouldn't always be able to escape or Dodge we read about his Damascus Road experience in Acts 9. let's revisit that for a moment the Lord told a fellow named ananias to go to Saul and and at 9 13 ananias answered oh Lord I've heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name you really want me to go see this guy but the Lord said unto him ananias go thy way he's a chosen vessel onto him unto me bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake I think Paul saw it coming lyster would just be the beginning as I said Paul will die twice for the gospel and in second Corinthians 11 and 12 he lists a lot of the difficulties that he faced well let's get back to Acts 14. and one day Paul and Barnabas had preached the gospel to that City Derby and they're taught many of apparently with success without being attacked and it's likely that buried in that simple sentence Eunice and Timothy heard the gospel for the first time along with Grandma Lois after preaching and teaching in Derby they Paul and Barnabas started the long journey home they returned again to lystra that's 60 miles they're backtracking it remember Paul was brutally attacked he was killed by stoning in lystra Dakota bypass it gone directly to Iconium they could have gone East from Derby and made the way Overland to Tarsus and back home that way taking the short path voided all the places where they'd had trouble but they didn't they didn't take the easy route they didn't take the less risky route they had recent converts in lystra and Iconium and they refused to be deterred from verifying that they were continuing in the faith they wanted to verify that the word had taken effect in their life that they were filled with the holy spirit that they were continuing on in faith I imagine put yourself in the place of one of those that had participating in the stoning of Paul and Iconium I imagine there were a lot of shocked people in lystra when this dead guy walked back into town some weeks or months later I thought it was just a rumor those guys had snatched his body and buried it and made up a story but look here he is maybe witty was telling us about Jesus rising from the dead was true what a witness that would have been in that town to those people from Leicester they continue to Iconium another 20 miles and to Antioch of basidia another approximately 80 miles their return journey is is in these little dotted lines that are hard to see up here the dotted red so I made big dotted red arrows to help you find the little dotted lines so that's the return Journey Derby to Antioch of pasidia of verse 21. and what did they do in each of these towns and cities along the way the places they'd preach the gospel of Salvation to Jew and Gentile alike at Great risk danger cost they were confirming re-establishing so strengthening The Souls of the disciples the Believers those who had accepted the message of grace through the Gospel of Jesus Christ these these new these new apprentices of the faith and exhorting encouraging that the root of the word exhorting is to draw near to invite to comfort exhorting them to continue in the faith and telling them we must go through much tribulation hardships persecution anguish trouble burdens to enter into the kingdom of God these people were Witnesses of the terrible persecution and suffering of Paul and Barnabas it's not Theory from a textbook this is witnessed experience among these very converts to Christ this isn't look what's happening in China look what's happening in Ukraine this isn't their time and when they Paul and Barnabas had ordained them elders and every Church in each church assembly and had prayed with fasting they commended they presented they committed them to the Lord on whom they believed and whom their faith was placed ordained them Elders in every Church what does this verse mean what does that mean it's easy to just read through it or pass it and make an assumption but our pastor has told us if you're reading and you run across something in a verse be sure you understand it before you read the next verse so let's dig into this a little bit grab your shovels let's dig what is this word ordained other translations say appointed that particular Greek word means to stretch the hand some take this to mean voting but in this passage today is Paul and Barnabas so if they're voting they're the only two guys with votes the specific Greek word only appears twice in the entire New Testament the other place is second Corinthians 8 19. Paul is commending Titus to the church at Corinth he says who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace so the word translator ordained in Acts 14 is translated chosen in second Corinthians 8. in this case Paul and Barnabas are appointing elders and every Church in Derby lystra Iconium antiochrophicidia and so forth say okay so they appointed these peoples but then you have to ask what is an elder what is an elder the word translated Elder like most words has many meanings God told Rebecca that she would have twins the Elder would serve the younger and in this case it's simply a matter of birth order of age same meaning as older but but this term can also mean one who has respect or who has Authority not necessarily new to age let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 for some illumination on this from the Bible and I'll read a brief excerpt from a sermon of brother Branham on this topic but before we go to First Peter chapter five we need to understand who Peter is addressing in this Epistle of First Peter who is his audience First Peter 1 1 tells us Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered strangers now these These are believers that he had not personally met he doesn't know them so they're strange scattered throughout pontus galatia Cappadocia Asia and bythinia we'll get to that in a moment that these strangers are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ he says to you those strangers to whom that applies Grace unto you and peace be multiplied so we're back to our map so this is where Peter sent the letter i underlined them to pontus galatia Asia galatia so he's writing to what we would call Turkey to all of these regions here and I've marked with little uh red ovals here these four cities that we've been reading about in galatia Derby and Iconium and lystra and Antioch of pasidia there's writing to these very elders he's addressing these very people that Paul and Barnabas have just appointed so knowing the location let's find out what Peter describes as an elder in chapter 5 first Peter 5 1 he says the elders which are among you so this is just the whole church but now he's getting specific so I exhort I encourage I entreat I beseech who also am an elder I Peter I'm an elder too I'm one of you in Michael and not only that I'm a personal witness of the servings of Christ and also will be along with you a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed so to you Elders I exhort you to do the following feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof the responsibility you have positions of responsibility you have positions of leadership not by constraint not because you must or you're being forced to but willingly out of love compassion concern Desiring to fulfill your calling as unto Christ himself not for filthy Luke or not for money it's not a job or a job description not as a hireling it's a calling but instead of a ready mind that means with enthusiasm eager to serve neither is being Lords over God's Heritage this isn't the concept of of what Jesus told his disciples he's its greatest among you must be servant of all not toward and over everybody remember when brother Aaron was asking God when he was filling the role of Pastor Here For Those Years while we were searching and ask God what's Pastor what what is this all about and the Lord told him the Sheep are Gods they're not the pastors but being examples to the flock lead by example not by dictate and when the chief Shepherd Jesus shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away likewise younger submit yourselves under the Elder I think it's a bit of a double entender here not exactly a pun but but he's telling the younger ones to listen to the older ones but also to the Elder of the church yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed clothed enclosed wrapped surrounded never appear naked never appear without being clothed with humility for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble not false humility but Junior wines up here we see Peter has described the role or the position of an elder now brother branham's comment I want to read to you is from Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 number 1 1957. yeah I know the type's a little bit small again if you sit closer to the front seizure to read but I believe and the supreme authority of the local assembly yes Let each Church be its own choose its pastors it's deacons it's whatever it is and then that way the man in there has no Bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit and then Berta Brandon puts out a challenge show me by the Bible what's greater in the Bible than a local Elder to a local church that's right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each Church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in a brotherhood like that together like the ministers meeting we were in Phoenix on Saturday but the sovereignty of the local church we don't answer to that group but we desire to be in Fellowship as as brothers and sisters and with our sister churches go back to the closing verses of Acts 14. and after they Paul and Barnabas had passed through the region of facilia they came to the next region pamphylia and when they Paul and Barnabas had preached the word in perga so this is another 96 miles 100 miles or so from from Antioch it's a town they first came to from Cyprus a year or two earlier a place from which John Mark had left them to go back to Jerusalem they went down to the port city of Italia another 10 miles don't confuse that with Italy it's not Italy it's a town so you can see this they've come from Antioch down to ferga and now right here to this little Port City of Italia and since from that Port of Italia they sailed to Antioch about 300 miles from once they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled it's a I'm sorry I'm not sorry I'm going to share it with you anyway they've taken 72 verses to get from from Antioch of Syria to Derby they've taken five verses to get home you ever notice how when you're going home you just really want to get home like I remember one time we had a horse that we had purchased for our oldest son and we kept them over brother mcclintocks because we couldn't keep a horse at our place and we went over there and this was this was about 1982 or three something like that and and this horse was a was a retired barrel racer and and uh and so we took her down to a to a place to for the kids to ride the horse because that's why you have a horse and feed her all that hay and knock out the Stalls so you can ride it right so our daughter Gloria was perched on this pretty good-sized horse I don't know how many hands the horse was I had four Hooves I don't know how many hands in it but but Gloria's perched on this horse and she's she's about five years old or maybe she's six but I think she's about five and the horse is going around and then realizing that wait Stables right back over there there might be hey there so as soon as the horse was pointed I've done 72 verses I'm going to do five verses now the horse took off through the desert oh no I mean Gloria's feet didn't reach the stirrups right she's just perched on the saddle holding the reins and Nikki is that's the name of the horse is charging back across the desert and we're looking and chasing and we see Gloria and we think boy she's going to land in a cactus what's happened to our precious daughter we go running up to her and Gloria was typical Gloria she was up Nikki ran away so I jumped well I that's not very spiritual but I had to share that with you so so here's a map of their of their whole journey from from where they started to where they came back and and all of this uh all of that you're seeing here is is this last part of the journey we've read about in Acts 14. they've been gone for about two years according to most estimates they didn't travel in airplanes trains or buses they didn't have air-conditioned hotels to sleep in nice restaurants to eat in churches along the way to support them they didn't have access to API ATMs to withdraw funds no credit cards no telephones no telegraphs no internet No cameras to take pictures or videos to share with the folks back home no big suitcases with wheels to take the Wardrobe that they need to be gone for two years through heat and cold through desert and Mountain through snow every kind of climate you can imagine there in southern turkey is pretty harsh pretty extreme dry and damp and wet All Seasons inclined no consulates from which they could seek help if the local authorities gave them a hard time no hot showers no shampoo no body wash no recordings of sermons to listen to and be inspired by no music players not even Bibles to carry around and mark up or read no skulls or code disease the New Testament didn't exist these are the people that wrote it they hadn't written it yet not even the four gospel accounts they were preaching the gospel winning converts in hostile places using scriptures from what we call the Old Testament and most of that was recitation for memory if they were in a synagogue and the synagogue happened to have this goal of the Prophet or the or whatever they were reading then they could read it but synagogues didn't have a complete set of Scrolls a very very very expensive so what they had was what they could remember from what we call the Old Testament and the moving of the spirit backing up what they were saying because they were saying something very new what are our excuses I have I don't have an excuse don't talk to me about America in 1957. I think nearly everybody in this audience came to Christ after 1957. that what brother Brandon said about 1957 it's true and it was true back then but this is 60 years later don't talk to me about 1963 or 1965. if you have breath in your body and if your body is still aging then we have one task and we've been commanded to do that by Jesus himself spread the gospel it's too hard it's too hard Jesus specific words to the lukewarm last age be zealous therefore and repent the musicians could please return but the last two verses acts 14 when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them how we had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles first Peter with Cornelius group in caesarea now Paul and Barnabas in the various cities of pamphilia pasidia galatio what is now Southern turkey it's a partial fulfillment of ananias word from the Lord that we read in Acts 9 15. Saul's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel and there an Antioch of Syria they Poland barnabis Abode a long time months years with the disciples that's the complete acts 13 and 14. my brothers and sisters in Christ let's spread the gospel be like those early Christians if we could pray together one more time Lord Jesus it's encouraging and it's challenging and it's sobering to read about the sacrifices that were made by these early Christians going out just with your word that said go and you went with them Lord and and miraculous things happen wonderful things happen we're here today but because of what they did because of what you did through them help us Lord help me Lord to not just say things but to do things Lord help us all to be doers of the word to express your love to this generation we see around us that is dying and lost help us Lord we commit ourselves again to you in Jesus precious name I wonder as we turn this service over to our pastor I'd like to sing an old gospel song It Was Written there are various things say 1887 or 1890. it's called send the light I think you may be familiar with it there's a call I'm sorry there's a call comes ringing or the Restless waves and the light send the light there are souls to rescue there are souls to save send the light send the light send the light the Blessed Gospel Light Let It Shine from Shore to Shore [Music] white Let It Shine forevermore [Music] [Music] Let It Shine [Music] [Applause] let it shine forever Grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] Let It Shine [Music] forevermore saw the map that our brother Paul and brother Barnabas how much they went around and they they traveled all those miles and I think and as brotherly I was speaking I was I was thinking that that was a time past all of those dangers that they faced and all that they did that was for a Time past but preaching the gospel is more needed today than it was at that time back then but Lewis we don't have to go to Congo we can spread the gospel right here we can spread the gospel to our neighbors we can spread the gospel to our friends to the students at school we can spread this same gospel that they spread and as our brother said every miracle that happened whether it was raising up from the dead whether was healing a Layman whatever it was it was for one purpose and that was to preach the gospel because those people every single single one of them that rose up whether it be crippled or whether they be dead they all died again but if they got got that gospel they they have eternal life and they will never die god brother Lewis if you come up and enclose my brother I want to read a quote real quick brother Lyle I fact checked him this is this is what brother Branham said in 1956 December 30th he said speaking of what he said about Paul and how Paul was stoned he said this we believe by faith we receive it but if the brother not disputing with him I don't believe that but if the brother would have only read that how Paul was stoned to death and the Saints stood over him and prayed till they come back to till life come back into him amen our brother our brother Paul went through a hard time but I promise you brother Jeremy it was worth every single moment everything that he did it was it was worth every every step every mile every storm on the ship it was worth it all and Friends it is worth it to us to witness about this gospel that Jesus Christ saves that he heals and he will be for there for us when we crossed into the oversight other side if we will just believe on him brother can you just say a few words or just whatever you have on your heart brother Lewis good to see you praise the Lord surely we can say that the Lord has been so good to us and we go to the house of the Lord we we are coming under the expectation and that can just say thank you to from the bottom of my heart because the voice of God still a living voice we can surely say what a responsibility when we hear this gospel and our Prophet said we have more responsibility today than what they heard back then because we have received not only the world but the living world and we have seen so much we are living in the dying generation what responsibility what will you say to the Lord my brothers and sisters you have received Christ in you the hope of glory when people are dying everywhere every corner every street and we do have Jesus as a living God Amen may the Lord richly bless his servant and I can just say I've been praying and I say Lord speak unto me and the surely I said I don't know about you but if I have to say something today God has been so good

to my church I said I have to go I feel like I have to go over there and on the top of the mountain I said Lord speak it to me I know you got a different way of letting your children know what is your will but I'm going to church under the expectation and I just want a God to speak to me surely I said the Lord spoke in my heart and I say thank you so much thank you richly being able to obey to the voice of God that God has used a precious brother as a vessel maybe it was not for you but I can say 100 percent it was mine when it was for all of us you know what the prophet said if you cannot go

there we are so and and that song I really appreciate the effort that the Peterson family plus one put into that's all song that was just uh just wonderful it made me decide I'd [Applause] better I better get rid of my notes and talk about Joshua tonight instead the the mound that you see here in this picture is the modern day ruins of the place they sang about Jericho now we've covered an overview of the Torah the five books written by Moses we move on now to the next group of 13 books in the order that our Christian bibles are organized these are the his the histories Joshua Judges Ruth 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Kings 1 and 2 Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther job there's no test but that's what's next and gives you a preview of what's coming tonight got your track shoes on we're going to Sprint through Joshua we're going to get an overview of its contents there's going to be a lot of reading but before we do let's pray once again again to the one who inspired the unknown and unnamed author of this book lord Jesus we are so grateful that we can be gathered here this evening thank you Lord for these people that have come each of us that are here Lord because it's the last week of the year it's the last Wednesday we have in 2023 to tell you that we love you to tell you that we care to tell you how much you mean to us Lord forgive us where we have fallen short today Lord and let our hearts just draw together and draw dra to your word and draw from it what you have for us this evening Lord you you put it there for a purpose and you put it there for a purpose for us tonight in this place we thank you Lord and we thank you and we thank you again in Jesus precious name Amen in the simplest summary this book covers Israel's history During the period from the death of Moses to the incomplete conquest of Canaan under Joshua and the apportionment of the lands to to the various ancestral lineages of Jacob's sons as a person Joshua is is an inspiring story Moses faithful servant and follower the one who wholeheartedly believes in trusting the Lord's word becomes a new leader the rise of Joshua yahoshua in Hebrew the same name as Jesus thus parallels the one that we know as Jesus Moses commissioned Joshua to lead the people was recorded in Deuteronomy 31:7 Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with his people unto the land which the Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the Lord he it is that death go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed Paul recounts an early victory in the conquest as he shares examples of faith in Hebrews 11 we read in verse 30 by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days somewhat sadly the Book of Joshua also records the planting of the seeds of fulfillment of the prophecy Moses recorded in Deuteronomy 31 and 32 a prophecy of failure and ultimate ejection from Canaan also in the same portion of Deuteronomy as Joshua's commission we read in verse 16 of chapter 31 the Lord said unto Moses behold Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go whing after the gods of the strangers of the land whether they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my Covenant which I have made with them Paul addressing the Galatians Echoes the lesson of Joshua to his contemporaries some 1500 years later in Galatians 5 we read starting at verse 7 you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you but pointing to one of the root causes in galatia and as we'll discover in the Book of Joshua he summarizes a little 11 Levens the whole lump like the story starting with the Exodus Joshua shows that strong Godly leadership is necessary but by itself insufficient we each regardless of our gifts or calling must possess faith and once possessing it we must exercise it Joshua is not simply a history it's a warning that speaks to us across centuries and Millennia please be seated we can sometimes look at that at being a little kind of sad about the future failures that happen but you know the Jewish people say that the the five books of Moses were written to bring the law so that they could uh please God if you will but but really I think when you look at the end of Deuteronomy and where Moses is talking about the failure what they're really doing what God is really doing is not bringing them to the law he's trying to bring them through the law to The Ultimate Gift the ultimate Grace the ultimate recognition that we have to try we have to do all that we can but we can't depend on what we do we have to depend on him I should get back to my notes we're going to run out of time The Book of Joshua can be thought of as having three components the first is a narrative of the physical movements of the people the the battles with the Canaanites and so forth the second component is geographic it describes a division of the land including the internal borders between the various Clans or or tribes this includes a listing of the pasture lands and towns for the Levites scattered throughout the territory as well as Cities of Refuge the land a gift from God is divided by lot similarly the gifts of the Spirit in our lives are at the Lord's discretion we don't get to pick and choose he's not a tool in our toolbox we're Tools in his toolbx the third part is a warning and encouragement to trust in the Lord and to keep the faith a heads up here Joshua is full of violence we look on it 7500 miles miles away and 3,400 years later as as a type or as a lesson but for the people in Canaan at that time it was not symbolic it was horrific it was physical it was real for each Victory mentioned there were terrible consequences for those over whom the victory was won if nothing else Joshua should help us truly appreciate the grace of God in our lives and the blessing we have to be Here and Now rather than there and then at least I'm grateful for that Joshua has a total of 24 chapters if you listen to the voice message this morning our pastor read to us a large chunk of uh of one of the last of those chapters so we'll be able to save a little time this evening because we've all remembered exactly what he said when you listen to that this morning but we'll proceed through each of these chapters reading from some summarizing others be aware that the chapters and the events described in them are often not in chronological order often can be confusing starting what a good place to start Joshua how about 1 one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all the people unto the land which I do give them even to the children the descendants of Israel skipping to verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them skipping to verse nine have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest multiple words of encouragement and repeated strong courageous Fearless the Lord is with thee now we just read verse 9 the entirety of chapter 2 Falls between verses 9 and 10 chronologically but we'll just go ahead and read 10 and then we'll get into chapter 2 here pretty quick then after the events recorded in Chapter 2 Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan and go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it Jos josua then reminds the descendants of Reuben God and Manasseh whose land grant was east of the Jordan that they promised to help their relatives secure the territory west of the Jordan they renew their pledge to do so and in chapter two we read Joshua the son of nun sent out to shittum two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came unto an harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there and verse four the woman took the two men and hid them and when questioned as they hid said thus to the local authorities who were inquiring did you see these two guys there came men unto me but I didn't know where they were from skipping to verse n and after she misdirected the authorities which left she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did un the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side Jordan Sion and OG whom he utterly destroyed as soon as we heard these sayings our hearts melted neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord you your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath she extracts a promise that she'll be protected when Israel attacks Jericho and the spies replied in verse 18 behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread representing danger safety through atonement in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be when we attack and capture this city that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and furthermore if thou utter if you warn anyone about our business then we'll be free of this oath with which you've made us to Swear to protect you and she said according to your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the Scarlet line in the window and they went and came unto the mountain and Abode there three days until the pursuers the folks that were out looking for them had returned the pursuer sought them throughout all the way but found them not so the Two Men return turned descended from the mountain came to Joshua the son of nun and told them all things that befell them they said unto Joshua truly the Lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us in chapter three the nation crosses the Jordan River from the East to the West at verse 7 we read the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Thou shalt command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan ye shall stand still in Jordan and now Joshua instructs the congregation skipping to verse 13 he's telling them it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap verse 17 the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites were passed clean over Jordan now in Exodus after crossing the Red Sea they sang and danc the song of Moses was so inspired that in the Book of Revelation we read that they sing it but this time the time of crossing the Jordan the flood the spring of the year they don't sing and dance they build a memorial each tribe provides a male representative and in Joshua 4:4 we read then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel this may be a sign among you when your children asked their fathers in time to come in the future saying what's with these rocks what do you mean by these Stones you shall answer them the Waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off notice you may not recognize this but this is a form of Hebrew poetry when something is said and then it's same thing is said again slightly differently you'll find these kind of couplets in in many places and it's as I say it's a form of Hebrew poetry and it's wonderful in a way because it doesn't depend upon rhyming in pentameter and that so when you translate it into other languages it still retains that same format that same Beauty and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever now brother Daniel I think when Joshua was looking for guys he didn't say let's find a 73 year old guy to carry this Boulder I think he I think they got Daniel Jr and and other folks like him because this wasn't to be Pebbles this wasn't to be stones these were to be Boulders these were to be a burden they were to show the the the work and the turmoil and the travail they were a testimony they were a testimony just like two and a half weeks ago we had a testimony service here many of those testimonies were of many of you that have come through some pretty rough places carrying those Boulders on your shoulder to stack them up as a testimony as a witness and that's exactly what they did here the children of Israel did as Joshua commanded took up 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord spoke unto Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them into the place where they lodged and they laid them down there Joshua didn't stop there Joshua set up what another 12 Stones in the midst of Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bear the Ark of the C stood and at the time the book was written the author says and they are there unto This Day verse 14 on that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they feared that word there means revered were in awe of him as they feared Moses all the days of his life he didn't give them a reason to not unlike with Moses who stretched out his staff over the Red Sea the Jordan opened when the feet of the priests carrying the ark touched the water the waters returned when the priest's feet came to the normal Shoreline of the river and we read and the people came up out of Jordan on the 10th day of the first month and encamped in gilgal and the east border of Jericho so they're between Jericho and the river that's a distance of about six miles between the walls of Jericho and the Jordan River and these 12 Stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua pitch did he place in gilgal so we now come to chapter five you recall when we studied the book of Acts I mentioned that the people falsely accusing Paul of teaching against circumcision of Jewish Believers being a violation of the law of Moses that they could have picked a better example and here's why Joshua 5:2 at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time that is circumcise this second generation this new generation and this is the cause this is the reason why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised and their children whom he raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way 40 years under Moses 40 years Moses was disobeying the law of Moses if we want to take how the people in Acts were talking about it with all the Revelation that came they didn't practice this fundamental institution I I find that amazing the Lord said unto Joshua look how important this was to the Lord this day have I rolled away the reproach the shame the stigma of Egypt from off you this right was that important to the Lord as he told Abraham the same thing when he instituted it wherefore because of this the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day gilgal is derived from the word that means wheel and it means rolling this day I have rolled away the reproach and the reminder of that is the name of the camp remember in chapter 4 we read it was the 10th day of the first month when they crossed the Jordan now on the 14th day they observe the Passover in the land the next day the Mana stops we're told in verse 13 and came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against that means opposite near in in in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and demanded of him are you for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose off thy shoe from off thy foot the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so brother bradam tells us that Joshua met Jesus that in chapter six we read now Josh now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out none came in the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given unto thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and all the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall compass that means encircle the city all ye Men of War and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times and the P priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Rams Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout exactly what the song said this evening and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall send up every man straight before him well they did that in verse 20 we read so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people heard people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city now those of you sitting in the back you might want to bring your binoculars a little late tonight so squint or move forward this is a drawing from the excavation that was done Jericho back around 1950 and uh you can see this is what what it looked like at the time just a lot of dirt but when they got rid of that dirt that was on the level they found that there was a fallen wall it wasn't knocked down from the outside pushed in it fell down it fell out and there was a second wall around Jericho and it also fell down flat huh interesting the Bible says you dig in the right place and you find it it's there it's there I recently acquired a book Exodus route restored I was going to bring it out here but it's big and heavy and I I would have had to put it on my shoulder it provides an in-depth examination of the archaeology of The Exodus under Moses and the subsequent Conquest under Joshua now there's no archaeology that can say yeah trumpets were blown or people shouted but the archaeology can show that the walls fell down outward let's read on Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out then the woman and all that she hath as she SAR unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had unlike all those people in Noah's day more people listen to Rahab and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without outside the camp of Israel and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein well I know that these are a little bit hard to see but the guy on that side at the far end of the screen with a red shirt he's showing that here's these pots big big ceramic pots and what's in them seeds that had been burned burnt seeds there's evidence of the fire but the amazing thing here is that this shows that Jericho didn't give in after a lengthy Seas the people starving to death and all the rest of the things that happened in Warfare in those days they had plenty of food they had plenty of food no it the walls fell down when they blew the trumpet and when they shouted there was food there was everything they needed in the city it wasn't a Siege it was an instantaneous Victory and the archaeology demonstrates that 3,400 years later it's there as a witness and Joshua saved Rahab the Harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day because she hid The Messengers which Joshua was sent to spy out Jericho Paul refers to this also in Hebrews 11:31 by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the slies with peace and not only that we read in the list of the ancestors of of Jesus adoptive parents and Matthew as the children did so wonderfully this last Sunday morning I'll do it in the NIV to make it a little clearer talking about this lineage it says salmon was the father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab yeah this Rahab the Harlot a Canaanite a woman of Jericho Boaz was a father of OED whose mother was Ruth of Moab two of the only three women that are mentioned in the genealogies of Jesus adoptive parents and the only two that are mentioned by name the third one not mentioned by name was basba OED the father of Jesse Jericho wasn't just an important gateway to the land it contained an extremely important person a woman at whom we might look a scance but whom God looked upon with great favor we must be very very careful how we see and treat not only each other but everyone we find in chapter 7 that when the city of AI was attacked the army of Israel suffered losses and retreated they they discovered that a young soldier named achen had taken some things from the city of Jericho that he had been told not to touch his punishment was severe I think we all know that he and his family and everything he had were destroyed and the Disobedience was eradicated so it's important not just to seek the will of the Lord but once having it shown to us to follow in it Aon knew the will of the Lord was for him to not take that he disobeyed once this was dealt with Joshua led the forces of Israel to victory over AI as recorded in chapter 8 after the victory we read then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel and mount Abal as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of whole Stones over which no man have lifted up any iron that's Exodus 20:24 which you remember because we studied Exodus and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings the background in this slide is the archaeological site of an altar on Mount Abal believed to include that of Joshua it's been excavated in the last archaeologists have been there Excavating and sifting through things and they found some pretty amazing things starting about 2016 I think it's all very recent stuff the more the skepticism arises the more the Lord raises up a standard through science through faith through every Dimension that you can think of of human activity his witness is there it's consistent and it's true and he Joshua wrote thereon upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel Deuteronomy 27 we also discover in Deuteronomy that this altar Moses said when you build this altar in this place covered in plaster well makes it possible to write if it's covered in plaster otherwise it's just rocks that you've picked up it all fits together and all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side of the Ark and on that side before the priests the Levites which be the Arc of the Covenant of the Lord as well as a stranger as he that was born among them half of them over Mount against Mount girisim half of them over against Mount ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before that they should Bless the people of Israel that's Deuteronomy 11 and Deuteronomy 27 and afterward he Joshua read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law one of the things that they found in this site at Mount eel is some lead uh tablets that are kind of folded up but they contain cursings of the god of Israel in chapter nine the leaders of the cities of gibian jeffa Barth and kth yum pretended to be from an unnamed far country they're good actors maybe they were from the Hollywood of their day I'm not sure and Joshua and the princes of the congregation made an agreement with them to not kill them they then find out that these Travelers are in fact from the local area that God through Moses and Deuteronomy told them to annihilate they became bond bondmen in modern terms slaves to Israel then in chapter 10 now it came to pass when Adon zc adoni is is means Lord basically and zedek is is righteous or holy so this guy's title is is I'm I'm a righteous Lord king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and her King so he had done to Ai and her King and how the inhabitants of gibian had made peace with Israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibian was a great city is one of the Royal cities because it was greater than Ai and all the men thereof were Mighty and now they're in League with Israel wherefore ad onedc king of Jerusalem son unto ham it's not ham it's ham king of heon and unto Pam king of yut and unto yafia king of leish and unto deil king of Egon and and Kings here are more like city managers or or Mayors today is like he sent to the to the king of Oro Valley and the king of South south Tucson and the king of Sarita okay so these are cities they're not countries as we think of countries and kings and he said to them come up unto me and help me that we may Smite gibian for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel I'm glad you brought your binoculars so we see here this red line in this map that's towards the outside wall there that's the route that Joshua takes from gilgal up to gibian which is circled in red and he surprises the Army assembled against gibian we read about two Miracles associated with with these battles one is that the Lord gives him a great Victory with more of the Enemy being destroyed by giant hailstones a massive desert hail storm we live in the desert how often do we have hail that's big enough to hit you and kill you it's a miracle it's unusual more were killed by giant hailstones than by the Army led by Joshua the city circled in yellow are the cities where the five kings were that came to destroy gibian again gibian circled in red if you can't see that map very well we got lots of seats in the front Okay I placed a rectangle on the other map which is modern borders and modern territories to show you uh where this other one is zoomed in in front to give you an idea where this particular campaign was fought in blue I circled I alone this is where the second Miracle occurs while they're fighting we read that the sun over gibian and the Moon Over the Valley of Ione Stood Still for about a day by the way you may have heard about oh there's a computer simulation they did at Nasa at Caltech and it shows that there's a day that's missing or almost a day and there's 20 minutes that's missing those reports are not true you can look it up you can research it you can contact NASA or jet propulsion labri Caltech if you want or you can take my word for it those reports are not true there's controversy over what does this actually mean the the the Hebrew word Dam has many meanings to stop also means to cease to forbear to hold peace to quiet self to us to be silent uh to stand still to chry to wait so we don't know the the mechanism by which God performed this miracle but we do know that whatever it was it was miraculous and we read in the New Testament of another Supernatural occurrence in the valley of Iowa did you know what it was nobody's raising their hand okay I'll tell you then Luke 24 we read behold two of them that went that same day to a village called Deus which was from Jerusalem about three score fur belongs it's located in The Descent to the valley of ion and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commun together and reasoned that the miraculous happened again in the valley of Ione and Jesus himself Drew near and went with them a personal note brother Arie May recognize this this is a painting that was done by Brother Steve schwitzer about 45 years ago of of a mon are the large building that you see there that was built about a 100 years ago when we lived in Israel nearly 50 years ago my oldest brother Paul and his family lived there helping to repair it to restore it in fact his youngest daughter was born in that building and her name is Iona because she was born in IO and and the foreground of this painting you can see a little bit of an arch and whatnot is the ruins of a fourth Century Church complete with Mosaic floors and believed by some to be the site of the building in biblical emus where Jesus broke bread brother Arie you may recall we had communion in one of the upper rooms of that building with brother Green in 1976 in the ruins there's a baptistry indicating that baptism by immersion was the practice at that time okay back to Joshua chapter 11 we read of a northern campaign of Conquest West again the same thing a rectangle in the modern map showing you what's going on in the other map uh I'll tell you what's on the map um it's it's it's various battles that are described in chapter 11 and while it's a little bit hard to see and I apologize for that because I I got this map from uh from a program that made it hard to make things Bolder but in any event you'll notice that most of the fighting most of the things that are going on here the red is the path of the children of Israel the blue is the path of the of the bad guys if you will that uh that these battles occur in the Hill Country what they're conquering is the Hill Country when you get down by the by the shorelines uh there's not too much activity going on there well chapter 12 lists the kings of the various cities and territories defeated under the commands of Moses and of Joshua in chapter 13 there's a Flash Forward in time and we learn verse one now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and stricken in years I I I love this can you see the humor here Joshua I'm going to reveal something to you my friend you're old and stricken in years and and and and you can just say you're old you don't have to say you're stricken in years right Hebrews a very compact language and it's expensive to to write things down so to take the time to write this and to write it twice I just think God has a wonderful sense of humor I I read this and I just well I did more than chuckled Thou Art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed the extensive territories that remain are then listed the territory east of the Jordan is listed where the descendants of Reuben manasse and Gad were given under Moses here's a pop quiz for you it's the descendants of Reuben manasse and Gad what do those three guys share in common okay they're all firstborns they're all firstborn son Ruben is the firstborn of Leah Manasseh is the firstborn of Joseph who was the firstborn of Rachel and Gad is the firstborn of Zila who was uh Leia as slave okay that was just a pop quiz you're not going to be graded it's fine but there's a warning sign that gets flashed in verse 13 nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the gites nor the maites but the gites and the maites dwell among the Israelites under this day this is in the land east of the Jordan This is while they were still under the leadership of Moses incomplete chapter 14 starts the process of dividing the land both conquered and still to be conquered among the descendants of Jacob and Joseph at the start of this there's something that we learned but but notice that they're dividing the land even though they haven't conquered it yet it's part of the territory that's described I think that speaks to Faith but let's there's a little bit of a surprise it was a surprise to me in Joshua 14 at verse 6 we're going to learn a little bit bit of something here and the thing we're going to learn I'll make it easy for you is that this these campaigns these battles after they crossed over from Jericho until they stopped fighting was about seven years that's a long time to be fighting but seven years Joshua lived for decades after they crossed the Jordan but they stopped fighting after seven years the children of Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and Caleb the son of jhuna the kenite now now some people say well well he was a mixed multitude guy or he wasn't Jewish or something but but when they're picking the 12 Spies earlier back in numbers to go into the land and and check and and see what's going on and the 12 guys come back and Joshua and Caleb say we can take the land and the other 10 guys persuade people that they can't that Caleb is the representative of the tribe of Judah he is a major guy in the tribe of Judah so he his dad would jauna and the the kenite doesn't mean that he's from some place called Kenny and therefore he's a kenite it just it has something to do probably with where he was from but probably in Egypt because he'd been in Egypt for 4 something years they hadn't been in Canaan anyway calb came and said unto him thou knowest the thing the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee and Kadesh barnea 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from KES barnea to spy out the land and now behold the Lord has kept me alive as he said these 45 years ever since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old excuse me so he's age 85 it's 45 years after being a spy they want wandered for about 38 years after that uh uh rejection of going into the land at that time so that leaves about seven years for the conquest of Canaan now some people do the math and say well it's six years because it was this month and that month and other people say well no it was really eight years seven years plus or minus now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jauna heon fore an inheritance Hein therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of jauna the kenite unto this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel the name of hrin before was cirat arba which means settlement or Community number four and the land had rest from war so at age 885 of Caleb they stopped the fight so this map shows in Salmon I guess that's the right color to describe that as being uh the territory the approximate borders the region of the territory that they that they conquered but their territory that their promise goes all the way to the Sea so a lot of that white area between the Mediterranean and that salmon colored area is land that is supposed to be theirs but they didn't take so under Joshua the hill country was bacon some of the Southern desert and the Jordan Valley but the campaign ended with large portions of the divided territory still in the control of the Canaanite population why is that I'll give you a lead in when we when we get to the first part of the Book of Judges you may hear about that that why that was which would be next Wednesday approximately or we may not hear so you might want to go ahead and read chapter 15-8 continue describing the borders within the division of the land land and in chapter 18 we read the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them the background of this slide is the archaeological dig now occurring in Shiloh this is where the Tabernacle was pitched this is where the ark resided when we get to the book of Samuel Samuel served under the priest there at the Tabernacle at Shiloh this is that very spot the ark was moved to Shiloh about 1399 BC it remained there acting as a de facto capital of Israel certainly its spiritual center for over 300 years until the Philistines capture it around 1094 BC Shiloh is located about 20 miles north of Jerusalem chapter 19 concludes the land division among the tribes and 19 ends these are the inheritances which elaser the priest and Joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation so they made an end of dividing the country so when we see in uh acts: 126 where the disciples cast lots to to choose a replacement for judas's carriot they were following a long established practice so here what I've done is I've taken a a modern map on the one side and in the middle the approximate division of the territories among the tribes and you'll see that different Maps will show things a little bit different but it gives you the general idea and even if you had binoculars you probably couldn't read the labels of all that but that's not what's so terribly important what I wanted to also put in there the black lines that I put in show you the borders of modern Israel and the red lines show you the Palestinian territories the West Bank and Gaza just to give you an idea of the things you see in the news today and what's going on and how that fits into the into the Book of Joshua how it fits into things today you know it's it's interesting that we read about something that's 3,400 years ago and then we turn on the news today and you see exactly the same places and exactly the same struggles and exactly the more things go on the more they seem to not really change that much anyway I just wanted to give you that I that idea of context and and again this shows the territories of uh divided on the one side versus the territory they actually conquered on the other side so you can see that uh way over here the purple going up on that edge is ashers territory he uh he's going to have a hard time living there because they they didn't conquer that and a big chunk of what's called West manasse uh a large chunk of Dan big piece of Judah they uh they've got some work ahead of them so I think there's another lesson in there that that we can take and that is to be strong to be encouraged and to press on Don't Stop Don't Stop chapter 20 identifies six Cities of Refuge this is for protection of one accused of murder but more likely guilty of what we would think of as manslaughter it becomes a safe place to act as a temporary place to stay until he or she may stand trial this is a major advancement in criminal justice distinguishing between causes of death as opposed to the social status of the accused and the deceased Joshua 20 the Lord also spake unto Joshua saying speak to the children of Israel saying appoint out for you Cities of Refuge whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses that the Slayer that kth any person unaware bears and unwittingly May flee thither and they shall be your Refuge from the Avenger of blood and when he that doth flee unto one of these cities shall stand at the entering in of the Gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the Elders of that City they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the Avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the Slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not Before Time hate crimes that's something that we hear about a lot today and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the Slayer return and come into his own City and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled excuse me please so this map I've circled in red the Cities of Refuge I realize you probably can't read them but you can see that they're scattered throughout the territory three on the east side of Jordan three on the west side of Jordan the one in the middle on the west side is a city of sheam which plays a big role in in in many things here in uh this portion of the Old Testament uh now they're not close together if you happen to be unlucky enough to have accidentally killed your neighbor and you're halfway between those places you're going to have to almost run a marathon you've got you got to cover 20 miles before the people that are mad at you can catch up to you okay that was supposed to be a little bit of humor sorry in chapter 21 a total of 48 cities and their surrounding pasture lands are divided out amongst the priest and Levites from the various Clans territories that's what we were talking about the other day about uh um in uh in in in Samuel where Hannah yeah Dad yeah yeah okay that's something private revealed publicly so when we get to the fir the book of 1 Samuel uh you've got a clue that that there's something interesting coming up okay um in chapter 22 we see that people are often prone to think the worst about others it's a warning to us to be careful how we View and especially how we interpret the actions of others Joshua 22 verse one then Joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the halft tribe of Manasseh and said unto them you have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice and all that I commanded you You' have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the Commandment of the Lord your God and now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren as he promise them therefore now return ye and get you into your tents and unto the land of your possession which Moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side Jordan but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you to love the Lord your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep his Commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul it's good advice to all of us so Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went into their tents so far so good as they turn into their inheritance we get to verse 10 when they came unto the borders of Jordan that are in the land of Canaan the children of Reuben and Gad and Hal tribe manaza built there an altar by Jordan a great altar to see too and the children of Israel heard say behold the children of Reuben the children of G and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an over an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of Jordan at the passage of the children of Israel uhoh when the children of Israel heard of it the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh to to go up to war against them go to war these guys had just been their brothers and arm standing shoulder toosh shoulder and putting their lives on the line for seven long and dangerous years but the instant they hear of others even close Associates doing something that's not according to their interpretation of way they thought the prophet had said their Revelation they want to excommunicate them in this case to go to war to kill them fortunately they're willing to communicate before they knock their arrows and their bows the leaders of the various PL Clans came first to those whose lands were east of the Jordan and said in verse 16 thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord what trespass is this that you have committed against the god of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord and that ye have build it an altar that you might Rebel this day against the Lord we've got our altar in Shiloh what do you do in building an altar down here remember an altar is made of uncut Stones so this is an effect carefully arranged pile of rocks it's not unlike the 12 Stones stacked in nearby gilgal or the Joshua placed in the midst of the Jordan River as memorials or reminders When Future Generations would ask what this group of rocks means and the ones moving back across Jordan declared in verse 26 guys you got it wrong therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but it may be a witness a testimony between us and you and our Generations after us that we might do the service of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time come you have no part in the Lord you live over on that side of the river we live on the better side of the river you're on the wrong side of the tracks you can't be part of us therefore said we that it shall be when they should say to us or to Our Generations and times to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it's a witness between us and you not against us between us God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord and turn this day from following the Lord to build an altar for burnt offerings meat offerings or sacrifices beside the altar of the Lord Our God that is before his Tabernacle in Shiloh and when pinkas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him heard the words that the children of Ruin and the children of G and the children of Manassa spoke it pleased them go Gosh guys we misunderstood their motive we misunderstood and fellowship is restored we must not be quick to judge others or impute the intent behind their actions we should always we should always seek understanding often we react based on limit and perhaps inaccurate information guilty we need to respond with love not accusation we need to be circumspect not jump to conclusions we need to go to the source not second or third hand information rumor gossip Snapchat Facebook Instagram X social media no moving on to chapter 23 the second to last chapter Joshua addresses the leaders of isra Israel towards the end of his life and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from their enemies round about so this is years later that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age Joshua called for all Israel for their Elders their heads their judges their officers and said unto them I am old and stricken an age and you have seen all the Lord your God hath done unto thee all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you he goes on to rehearse many many of the things that they have witnessed and experienced verse 11 take good heed therefore unto yourselves that you love the Lord your God else if you do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they unto you know for a certainty there is no doubt the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you scores in your sides thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you we conclude in chapter 24 with something that may surprise you pardon me Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to sheim I love sheim to sheam and called for the Elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God and Joshua said unto all the people thus saith the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt this is what our brother Daniel read this morning in in his message to us all but did you notice Joshua the leader the general is speaking as a prophet thus saith the Lord God of Israel it's only two times in the Book of Joshua that he says thus sayeth the Lord this is one of them the other there's in in uh chapter uh seven I think it was after the sin of achen so a number of things are rehearsed and then in verse 13 we read this is again Joshua saying thus sayeth the Lord and I have given you and I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which he planted not do you eat and I think at this point it stops being Joshua speaking as a prophet but now responding to the prophecy now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth it takes both and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods verse 19 Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord he's a holy God he's a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if he forsake the Lord and serve other gods okay looks like I blew it again brother Jordan then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that Heath done you good and the people said unto Joshua but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve and his voice will we we obey so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance and shck them did they do it did they serve the Lord and not forsake his ways and Obey him the people that took this pledge skipping to verse 31 we read and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua which had known all The Works of the Lord that he had done for Israel so I think the answer is yes they made that pledge and they fulfilled it but sadly many in the following Generations did not as we'll see as we continue through the Bible and Joshua the first of the history books ends much as Genesis the first book of the Torah with mention of the bones of Joseph also in the second to last verse just as it was in Genesis we read and the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt buried they in sheim and a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shakam for 100 pieces of silver back in Genesis 33 and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph it's the musicians would please come sheum is a city on the border between Manasseh and Ephraim it's hard to see there I've circled sheam and this kind of gray area is a territory of rhri and this green area above is ter territory of manasse sheum lies in both territories it's a border it's on the border between manasse and ephriam which are the sons of Joseph it's the sight of the horrible Massacre by Sim and Levi it's the last place in Canaan where Joseph had peace his neck stop searching for his brothers in Genesis was when he went from shakum to Dothan and was there beaten and sold into slavery thus Joseph's bones are laid to rest in peace in the very spot of his inheritance shared by his two sons whom Jacob had claimed as his own and on the very plot of land Jacob purchased some 500 years earlier and that's not all was one of the six Cities of Refuge speaking both of mercy and Justice what a poetically beautiful and fitting way to end the first of the book of histories along the way this evening we noted a number of things we can relate to I think in our lives today lessons of Faith consistency not jumping to conclusions not judging others not relying on second or third hand reports or imputing motives motive or intent and so on to follow the lord as he guides us through life and not be distracted from this primary goal or mission to be obedient to do the things the lord requires of us aren't you glad that this book has been preserved for us by faithful scribes for three and a half thousand years and its story contains lessons that are so Timeless we can apply them profitably to our our lives today in Tucson in 2021 as our pastor comes to close the service and thinking about Joshua as well as the theme of the service on Sunday morning making room in our heart for God to write his story let's worship together and song with Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all the kingom of my heart for if he's not Lord of everything then he's not Lord at all God bless you brother amen I uh want to highlight a couple things our brother said one thing is a bit humorous when the Lord was telling Joshua you had to tell him a couple times you are old and you are stricken in years when that angel stood before Joshua when he looked out and he saw this man in armor coming with his sword and and and how powerful he looked that man that was coming towards Joshua was not an old man Joshua looked at him he drew his sword and he said are you for us or are you for an enemy I think Joshua was like 80 years old wasn't he about that when that happened so Joshua was not aware of his age he didn't care Caleb wasn't aware of his age either when Caleb is as uh brother Lyall said when Caleb came to get his inheritance he looked up at the mountains and he saw this hill country of Judea and he said I want these Hills I want to take that mountain right there and that mountain just happened to be full of giants the Anakin and Joshua said I want to take it or Caleb said I want to take it Same Spirit as he had before as Joshua had I also want to point out I believe it was in Joshua chapter 22 I believe believe that you said when um it was Reuben and Gad and manasse good job on the firstborn that that helped me Reuben and Gad and manasse they built this Altar and they wanted it for Fellowship they wanted to reach out to their Brethren just like Joshua had built had built the stones at gilgal and placed them there they had placed this Memorial there am I right and it was for Fellowship they wanted to say hey here's what happened here and word got out to the other tribes and they thought that these people had fallen into idolatry they thought that these people had fallen into sin and they started preparing for battle this would have been a civil war between this country that had just formed and it was all because of a misunderstanding Thank God as brother Lyall said thank God they thought enough of each other to talk to each other and how many times do we fail at doing that let's all stand do you appreciate brother Lyle in the Book of Joshua I do too what a powerful story this is when this is is what they had all wanted for 40 years they wandered in the wilderness and only two of them went over Joshua and Caleb they went over and the walls of Jericho and brother Lyall even showed us the archaeological evidence the walls of Jericho fell down they went through and all of these great stories and all of these great lessons that were taught us in that book and it's amazing that it's considered a history book but wow how many beautiful lessons are in that book how um how precious brother Joe if you come and close in prayer oh I will serve thee because I love thee you have G life to me I was nothing before you found you have gi life to me there were heart broken pees ruin lies of why you ride on calary

that comes from the text of the book of Lamentations it's our immense privilege and Grave responsibility to share with you this time about the book of Lamentations and I apologized to the kids when they came in there was no quiz hand out for them I know the only reason you came was for the quiz so I apologize that I didn't get that ready lamentation what is that it's it's a lament the act of bewailing an audible expression of Sorrow to express grief for or about to mourn to grieve audibly to wail the book of Lamentations is a collection of five poems bewailing the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple it's read aloud in Jewish synagogues the world over on the date called Tesha of Tesa is Hebrew for nine and a is a month so on the ninth month ninth day of the Hebrew month of a they read this text the book of Lamentations that's the date of the destruction of Solomon's temple in 587 or 86 BC and it's the date of the destruction of the second temple in 70 ad0 it's the saddest day in the Jewish calendar this year Tesa baav fell on August 12 and 13 just last week from Sunset August 12th till Darkness on the night of the 13th before we open the sacred book and read from it please join me in prayer to the one who inspired it Lord Jesus we're so grateful that we can be gathered together that we can draw strength from you and from each other Lord Lord this is not a a book of Celebration and rejoicing but as you taught us in Ecclesiastes Lord that there's a time to mourn A Time To Laugh A Time To Dance a time to re born a time to die so Lord we pray that you'd be with us as we approach this book this evening Lord that we can find in it Lord lessons for our life that we can apply in Tucson Arizona in August of the Year 2024 because your word is Everlasting it always applies help us to apply it thank you Lord forgive us Lord where we fall short Lord May no words be spoken tonight that would cause anyone to stumble but Lord May there be something said that would help someone Lord we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you for your presence with us amen we sometimes sing songs like Standing on the Promises every promise in the book is mine but we're often careful in choosing which promises we want to claim which rules we wish to obey keeping that in mind for our opening verses and while we're standing and you'll be standing for a couple of minutes it may get slightly uncomfortable but Lamentations is not a comfortable book so while we're standing let's read a couple of short selections from the book of Deuteronomy first consider these instructions about leadership from chapter 17 think of what we learned of King Solomon earlier in this series Deuteronomy 17:14 when thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me Thou shalt in any wise set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose we know that was Saul and then David one from among thy Brethren shalt thou set King over thee that mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother and now come specific commands to anyone who would have that position of leadership as a King rule number one he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses one sorry for as much as the Lord hath said unto you you shall henceforth return no more that way rule number two neither shall he multiply wives to himself that is heart turn not away rule number three neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold he's not to seek wealth and it shall be when sth upon the throne of his kingdom that rule number four he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites and it shall be with him and rule number five he shall read therein all the days of his life read your Bible pray every day isn't just for Christians today it goes all the way back to 1400 BC some of the reasons for these rules are that he may learn to fear the lord his God and to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren and that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his descendants in the midst of Israel we know Solomon failed at each one of these and this SED the seeds of division in the Kingdom which occurred as soon as his son rabam took the throne in fact if you think back to the recent lessons that we've had in the book of Hebrews you no doubt realize that in the list of face Heroes of chapter 11 the only King mentioned is David no mention is made of Solomon in fact Solomon is never ever mentioned by Paul or by any other author in the New Testament after the book of Acts well you know the history Israel immediately went into idolatry Judah attempted to blend worship of the Lord with other gods doesn't work turning now to chapter 28 our second of two readings this is about blessings and curses and it's really about conditional promises we read starting at verse one it shall come to pass if thou notice not ye but thou thou was second person singular so this is addressed to the nation as a unit if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth so again it's the unity of the group and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God skipping to verse 7even the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways verse nine the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee he swore it unto us oh but wait this is a conditional promise of blessing it's by no means unconditional if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee recall what happened when uh Rahab talked to the spes before they were going to come in they were afraid they'd heard these blessings continue on through verse 14 verse 15 but it shall come to pass here's another conditional promise you have a choice to obey or not if thou Wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all what portion uh the ones you personally approve of uh the ones you have a revelation concerning no the modifier here is all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that how many all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee again as a nation a unit a long list is given skip skipping now all the way down to verse 49 it's a long list the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the Earth as Swift as the eagle flies a nation whose tongue Thou shalt not understand so not Egypt not of Canaan remember the promises God now makes to the nation as we consider some of the Lamentations that will soon read a nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor show favor to the young he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land when will he stop until thou be destroyed and also shall not leave thee either grain wine or oil not petroleum olive oil or the increase of thy cattle or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed thee until you will not be recognizable as a nation and he shall besiege thee in thy Gates we'll see what that means in Lamentations in all thy Gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trust us throughout all thy land and he shall beseech thee in all thy Gates throughout all thy land which the Lord thy God hath given thee these next verses are so hard to read to contemplate the horrors of of these promises but they are indeed among the promises God made with the people through Moses the prophet are you ready verse 53 Thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the Flesh of thy sons and thy daughters which the Lord thy God hath given thee in The Siege and in the straightness where With Thine enemies shall d distress Thee I don't know if you can imagine such a thing and if that's not Dreadful enough we come to one of the most disconcerting verses I find in this portion of scripture which is verse 63 it shall come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to not and you should be plucked from off the land whether thou goest to possess it the Lord shall scatter thee among all people from one end of the Earth even unto the other and there shalt thou serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even of wood and stone among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the soul of thy foot have rest but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart failing of eyes sor of mind please be seated choices there are consequences to the decisions that we take the actions that we make good and bad the book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Torah written by Moses concluding about 1406 BC it ends just as the nation of Israel is about to cease its wandering its diaspora if you will and enter into the land of promise the book of Lamentations describes the horrors of the final Siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 587 or 586 some 820 years later it is at the time that the last remnants of the nation are about to be expelled from the land of promise and enter a second diaspora and we could simply read the book of Lamentations together and we shall God willing it's a series of five poems four of which are acrostic a total of only4 verses it's shorter than the 119th Psalm I'll find a crostic for you when we take a look at the laments themselves but I think we need some context before we tackle the book and by the way I'll have you here less than two hours how did the nation come to the condition that horrific destruction would be the cup from which they would be forced to drink previously in this series we've covered the section of the Old Testament we call history so you have an idea of the emergence of the monarchy under Saul after the period of the judges the rise of David as the celebrated King the success ession of Solomon and how he set the stage for the destruction of the Kingdom which was thror apart at his death by the actions of his son rabam the trigger dividing the Kingdom of Israel came down to excessive taxation forced upon the People by a tyranical government bent on self-aggrandisement rather than serving its citizens but that was just a symptom that's just a trigger the cause was forsaking the Lord the split happened about 9:30 BC in his mercy God raised up prophets to rebuke and correct and redirect his people and their leaders when they went astray so it's no surprise the prophets come to the Forefront of scripture when the nation of Israel splits into two kingdoms and plunges into idolatry we read in the histories about prophets like Elijah Elisha Mika what we call the oral prophets the ones that didn't leave us any writings in the mid 700s BC the first of the writing prophets appear most of them wrote over a period of years the start and ending of which are somewhat ambigu a few were pretty specific as to the years of their Ministry such as Amos or the start of Isaiah's Ministry but in 723 BC the unthinkable happens the Assyrians brutally conquer the Kingdom of Israel and they don't just conquer Israel they depopulated scattering the people throughout the Assyrian Empire this is shown sort of with the red line there as they're taken away but Baron territory is not good for defense nor does it generate much tax revenue so the Assyrians repopulated the land with settlers and throughout their empire indicated in green this is why we later read of in the northern kingdom Galilee of the Gentiles it was repopulated with Gentiles in 723 BC you'll note the map doesn't show a kingdom of Judah recall when we studied Isaiah a few weeks ago Hezekiah was under siege in Jerusalem the Assyrians under their King sakb had already conquered nearly all of Judah the Lord destroyed The Siege Army at Jerusalem sakra returned home and was subsequently killed by two of his sons but while Israel was depopulated Judah became a tributary of Assyria a tributary doesn't exactly mean a stream feeding a river but it's the same idea it means that Judah paid tribute taxes Ransom extortion to Assyria it's a very critical time for Judah the temple meanwhile had fallen into neglect priests had failed for a long time to proclaim the law and in general to do their duties King Josiah who reigned in Judah some 60 years after Assyria conquered Israel orders the temple to be repaired in the rubble inside the temple that is being cleaned and fixed a bit like our church is undergoing Renovations now an ancient scroll is found it's part of perhaps all of the Books of Moses the Torah it's brought to King Josiah look what we found in the rubble in the temple and it's read before him I'm sure it included portions of Deuteronomy that we read at our opening this morning this evening Josiah is a gast falls on his face in anguish and repentance calls for the nation to return to the Lord he sets the example and there is a Revival unfortunately the Revival is shortlived apparently it's superficial for most folks after all this 2 Chronicles 35:20 when Josiah had prepared the temple this is now 609 BC Neo which means lame we don't know which Pharaoh it is Neo king of Egypt came to fight against that means near or in the vicinity of kemes by Euphrates and Josiah went out to be battle against Neo but Neo sent ambassadors to Josiah saying what have I to do with thee that king of Judah I come not to battle against thee this day but against the house wherewith I have War for God commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me that he destroy thee not nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from Neo and the Egyptian Army he hearkened not unto the words of Neo from from the mouth of God and Josiah came to fight in the valley of megiddo perhaps Josiah assumed that since there was a prophet in the land Jeremiah he'd be the one that God would speak through to tell Josiah what he should or shouldn't do how could the Egyptian pharaoh a heathen possibly be speaking the word of God there's a point here we can take home we must always be careful that we don't miss God when he chooses to inform us through a source we might not normally trust or respect we shouldn't limit God Josiah is killed in battle jeho Kim becomes king shortly thereafter Judah fall falls back into idolatry having conquered ass Syria the Babylonian Army comes to Judah it's now 605 BC the first three sieges of Jerusalem by Babylon jeho Kim surrenders to the Babylonians and and a small group of captives are taken to Babylon what does this Mark the beginning of what we call the Babylonian captivity and it starts a timer that Jeremiah spoke of of a 70-year period after which Babylon would be judged we read in Daniel the first chapter first verse this occurred in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it besieged means you surround it you cut it off from all transportation from all Food Supplies from everything you isolate and the lord gave jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand he surrendered with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shar to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God and the King spoke unto ashpenaz the master of his unic that he should bring certain of the children of Israel this young men not kids and of the king's seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and tongue of the Cal Deans recall the warning in Deuteronomy about being conquered swiftly by a nation from afar whose tongue they did not understand skipping to verse six among these were the children of Judah Daniel haniah mishel and Azariah this Begins the conquest of Judah by Babylon in the initial carrying into captivity starting that 70-year period that I just mentioned but time goes on what happens in 598 BC jeim left on the throne as a puppet King Rebels against the Babylonians he's killed jeho his son takes the throne for about a 100 days Nebuchadnezzar again besieges Jerusalem carries away jeim and his wives and children to Babylon along with the Mighty Men the Bible tells us the Craftsmen the workers of metal the extended royal family a total the Bible tells us of some 10,000 captives he raids the temple he leads the Bible says and I quote the poorest sort of people of the land he installs zedekiah as his puppet king of Judah about 10 years pass and zedekiah warned by Jeremiah don't do this he ignores the prophet and he Rebels against Babylonia he's got some other prophets that tell them oh you're you're going to do this we're the Lord's people these Heathen Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem for the third time when the city Falls it is raided of all its remaining wealth and completely destroyed the temple is completely destroyed the ruins are set on fire zedekiah is removed from the throne and Gentile Governor Galia is installed what God had promised in Deuteronomy 28 and 1406 BC began with the Exile of Israel in 723 BC is completed with the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 587 BC okay we'll stop the history lesson I wanted to give you context about why there is this terrible tragedy there'll be more to cover as we go into other books of the Bible as we continue this series but I wanted you to have an overview of how we came to the destruction of Jerusalem from our opening verses in Deuteronomy why it was ultimately destroyed I think that this context is so important to understand as we prepare to read Lamentations let's take a look at writing style and Define acrostic acrostic poetry I I I said i' do that I should probably follow through have you ever wondered why the 119th Psalm shows the first Hebrew letter Alf as a label even in an English language Bible translation or or why at verse 9 it shows the second Hebrew letter or at least declares the label Beth all 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are listed in Psalm 119 in their proper order each letter is followed by an eight verse section each section is like a mini Psalm self-contained able to stand alone all of the eight verse sections of this Psalm begin with the Hebrew Alphabet letter that declares the section notice the first eight verses all begin with the same Hebrew letter Alf I don't expect you to know the Hebrew alphabet so I've highlighted the first letter and yellow remember Hebrew reads from right to left so you can see the one you can see the English on on the one side the Hebrew and the other but olive the second verse Olive third verse Olive all the way down the word that is chosen begins with that same letter for eight verses then at the ninth verse the second group of eight you get the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet bet and all eight verses of that section of the Psalms begin with the letter bet and then gimal do avov and so forth down through the entire Hebrew alphabet for the kids here's the alphabet on the one side the one you might recognize and on the other side the one you might not the Hebrew alphabet the first two letters are alfet alfet alphabet so that's the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet the 26 letters of our English alphabet so it goes alfabet gimal on down to the final letter Tav just like ours goes a b CDE e down to Z well this method of poetic writing leading with the alphabetic sequence is known as acrostic requires Great skill to write this way I I don't possess that skill Psalm 119 is a very intricate example of the form but it occurs in simpler ways in several of the Psalms sadly when translating from Hebrew to another language like English or Spanish this sort of structure is lost the only way to appreciate it is to learn the original language okay brother Lyall so what why are you bringing this up that's the 119th Psalm Lamentations is mostly acrostic four of the five chapters are acrostic chapters one two and four we might call Simple acrostic each of the 22 verses begins with the succeeding letter of the Hebrew alphabet so verse one starts with olive verse two with bet and so on to verse 22 with t let's quickly look don't try and read the Hebrew so we see the first 11 so it's ol of bet gimmel do I want to call that VAV but in modern Hebrew it's VAV in Biblical Hebrew it's w Zion [Music] T Shin Tav it's the 22 letters and that's how that Lamentations is written chapter 2 is also a simple acrostic written the same way chapter three has 66 verses three times 22 so as you may have guessed like Psalm 119 the first three verses begin with the Hebrew letter Olive the next three the Hebrew letter bet and so forth till you get to the final three verses beginning with the Hebrew letter T chapter four returns to the simple acrostic in chapter five though it also contains 22 verses it's not a crostic my personal Theory don't hold me to it's just my idea about chapter five is that the writer is so overcome with grief and pain that he can no longer contain the expression in this form and you'll notice that not only are the verses in chapter 5 not acostic each is very short it's like he is just out of of Tears he's out of words he's out of energy one final stylistic note the first word in the first verse of the first chapter is the Hebrew word that's the Hebrew name of what we call the book of Lamentations they just call Ita is the Hebrew word that means how how did this happen how did we come to this how moving on the authorship of Lamentations is unknown some traditions ascribe it to Jeremiah but even the most ancient Hebrew texts the Dead Sea Scrolls for example which contain the first portion of the book of Lamentations they don't indicate that however the Septuagint an early translation of Hebrew into Greek claims Jeremiah wrote it if we strip away all the Traditions about how it came to be the earliest copy of the septu we have is from a monastery copied in the 4th Century ad in English translation it reads and it came to pass after Israel was taken captive and Jerusalem made desolate that Jeremiah sat weeping and lamented with this lamentation over Jerusalem and said how does the city that was filled with people sit solitary she's become as a widow she that was magnified among the Nations and princesses among the provinces has become tributary I've highlighted the prepended commentary text on this screen and yellow again this statement of Jeremiah's authorship is not in any Hebrew text it was added by someone along the way okay brother while enough about historical context literary style speculation about who wrote Lamentations we know who inspired it so let's read it I'm going to read from the new King James translation you can follow in the regular King James if you wish the N kgv is primarily replacing some archaic words and in some cases using some line formatting or capitalization to suggest poetic intent Lamentations chapter 1 Jerusalem is portrayed as a grieving Widow how lonely sits the City Jerusalem that was full of people how like a widow is she who who is great among the Nations the princess among the provinces has become a slave she weeps bitterly in the night her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she has none to comfort her all her friends have have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies Judah has gone into captivity under Affliction and hard servitude she dwells among the Nations now nations in the Bible means peoples Gentiles heathens it doesn't mean political entities like the United States or Mexico or something with borders that are internationally recognized that's not what nation means she finds no rest all her persecutors overtake her in her Dire Straits the roads to Zion another name for Jerusalem the roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the set feasts all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins her young women are afflicted she's in bitterness her adversaries have become the master her enemies Prosper for the Lord has afflicted at her because of the multitude of her transgressions the lament recognizes the root cause of the horrors now being reported her children have gone into captivity before the enemy and from the daughter of Zion all her Splendor has departed her princes have become like deer that find no pasture that flee without strength before the pursuer and the days of her Affliction in roaming Jerusalem remembers all her Pleasant things she had in days of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy with no one to help her the adversar saw her and mocked at her downfall Jerusalem has sinned Gravely therefore she has become vile all who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yes she eyes turns away her uncleanness is in her skirts she did not consider her Destiny therefore her collapse was awesome a spectacle she had no comforter oh Lord behold my Affliction for the enemy is exalted the adversary has spread his hand over all her Pleasant things for she has seen the Nations the Heathen enter her Sanctuary those whom you commanded not to enter your assembly all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their valuables for food to restore life see oh Lord and consider for I am scorned is it nothing to you all who pass by behold and see if there's any sorrow like my sorrow which has been brought on me which not the armies of Babylon but which the Lord has has inflicted in the days of his Fierce Anger from above he has sent fire into my bones and it overpowered them he spread a net for my feet and turned me back he's made me desolate and faint all the day the Yoke of my transgressions was bound they were woven together by his hands and thrust upon my neck he made my strength fail the Lord delivered me into the hands of those whom I am not able to withstand the Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty men in my midst he is called an assembly against me to crush my young men the Lord trampled as in a wine press the virgin daughter of Judah for these things I weep my eye my eye overflows with water because the comforter who should restore my life is far from me my children are desol it because the enemy prevails Zion spreads out her hands but no one Comforts her the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that those around him become his adversaries Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them in the midst of all this upon reflection she realizes she recognizes the Lord is righteous for I rebelled against his commandment here now all peoples and behold my sorrow My Virgins and my young men have gone into captivity called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests my elders breathed their last in the city while they sought food to restore their life see oh Lord that I am in distress my soul is troubled my heart is overturned within me I've been very rebellious outside the sword beves at home it's like death they have heard that I sigh but no one comforts me all my enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that you have done it bring on the day you have announced it they may become like me let all their wickedness come before you and do to them as you have done to me for my transgressions for my size are many and my heart is fate the next lament begins from the perspective of an observer how the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger he cast down from heaven to the Earth the beauty of Israel and did not remember his footstool in the day of his anger the Lord has swallowed up and has not pied All The Dwelling Places of Jacob he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah he has brought them down to the ground he has profaned the kingdom and its princes he has cut off in Fierce anger every horn horn is a symbol of strength every Horn of Israel he has drawn back his right hand symbolic of strength Power Authority he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy he has blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire devouring all around standing like an enemy he has bent his bow with his right hand like an adversary he has slain all who were pleasing to his eye on the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his fury like fire the Lord was like an enemy he has swallowed up Israel he has swallowed up all her Palace say he has destroyed her strongholds and has increased mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah he has done violence to his tabernacl if it were a garden he's destroyed his place of assembly the Lord has caused the appointed feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion in his burning indignation he has spurned the king and the priest the Lord has spurned his altar he has abandoned his Sanctuary he has given given up the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy they have made a noise in the house of the Lord is on the day of a set Feast the Lord has purposed to destroy the wall that offense the protection of the daughter of Zion he has stretched out a measuring line he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he has caused the rampart and wall to lament they languished together her Gates have sunk to the ground he's destroyed broken her bars her her King and her princes are among the Nations the Heathen the the law is no more her prophets find no vision from the Lord the Elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground and keep silence they throw dust on their heads and gir themselves with sackcloth The Virgins of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground and the Observer now breaks down my eyes fail with tears my heart is troubled my bile is poured on the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the infants faint in the streets of the city they say to their mothers where is grain and wine we're starving where's food where's something to drink as they Swoon like the wounded in the streets of the city as their life is poured out and their mother's bosom how shall I console you to what shall I liken you oh daughter of Jerusalem what shall I compare with you that I may comfort you oh virgin Daughter of Zion for your ruin is spread wide as the sea who can heal you your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive Visions they have not uncovered your iniquity to bring back your captives but have envisioned for you false prophecies and delusions The Observer gathers himself all who pass by clap their hands at you they they hiss and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem is this the city that is called the Perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth all your enemies have opened their mouth against you they hiss and Nash their teeth they say we have swallowed her up surely this is the day we have waited for we have found it we have seen it the Lord has done what he purposed he has fulfilled his word which he commanded in days of old he is thrown down and has not pied and he has caused an enemy to Rejoice over you he has exalted the Horn of your adversaries their heart cried out to the Lord oh wall of the daughter of Zion let tears run down like a river day and night give yourself no relief give your eyes no rest arise cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord lift your hands toward him for the life of your young children who faint from Hunger at the head of every street see oh Lord consider to whom have you done this should the women eat their offspring the children they have cuddled should the priest and Prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord young and old lie on the ground in the streets My Virgins and my young men have fallen By The Sword you have slain them in the day of your anger you have slaughtered and not pied you have invited us as to a feast day the Terrors that surround me and the day of the Lord's anger there was no Refugee or Survivor Those whom I have borne and brought up my enemies have destroyed the third lament is at once horrible and hopeful verses 21- 58 in particular Express hope faith and trust in the midst of Affliction it reminds us of job though God slay me yet will I trust him the he in this lament section is the Lord as if the author is telling his lament to a third party I am the man who has seen Affliction by the rod of his wrath he has led me and made me walk in darkness and not in light surely he has turned his hand against me time and time again throughout the day he has aged My Flesh and my skin and broken my bones he has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and woe he has set me in dark places like the dead of long ago he has hedged me in so that I cannot get out he's made my chain heavy even when I cry and Shout he shuts out my prayer he has blocked my ways with HED Stone he has made my paths crooked he has been to me a bear lying in weight like a lion in Ambush he has turned away away my ways and torn Me In Pieces he has made me desolate he has bent his bow and set me up as a target for the arrow he has caused the arrows of his quiver to pierce my loins I have become the ridicule of all my people their taunting song all the day he has filled me with bitterness he has made me drink warmwood he has broken my teeth with gravel covered me with ashes you the author now switches from third person and addresses the Lord in the second person you have moved my soul far from peace I have forgotten prosperity and I said my strength and My Hope have perished from the Lord remember my Affliction in roaming the wormwood and the g my soul still remembers and sinks within me and in the midst of this affliction this I recall to my mind therefore I have hope through the Lord's mercies we the author now speaking as a group that he is a part of we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is your faithfulness the Lord is my portion says my soul therefore I hope in him the Lord is good to those who wait for him to the Soul who seeks him it is good that one should hope and wait quietly for the Salvation of the Lord it is good for a man to Bear the Yoke in his youth let him sit alone and keep silent because God has laid it on him let him put his mouth in the dust there may yet be hope let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him be full of reproach for the Lord will not cast off forever though he causes grief yet he will show compassion according to the multitude of his mercies he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men to crush under one's feet all the prisoners of the earth to turn aside the Justice do a man before the face of the most high or subvert a man in his cause the Lord does not approve who is he who speaks and it comes to pass when the Lord has not commanded it is it not from the mouth of the most high that woe and well-being proceed why should a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins let us search out and examine our ways Psalm 51 and turn back to the Lord let us lift our hearts and hands to the God in heaven we have transgressed and rebelled the author again appeals directly to God you have not pardoned you'll have covered yourself with anger and pursued us you'll have slain and not pied you'll have covered yourself with a cloud that prayer should not pass through you'll have made us an offscouring and refu in the midst of the peoples all our enemies have opened their mouths against us fear and a snare have come upon us desolation and destruction my eyes overflow with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people my eyes flow and do not cease without interruption till the Lord From Heaven looks down and sees my eyes bring suffering to my soul because of all the daughters of my city my enemies without cause Hunted Me Down Like a Bird they silenced my life in the pit and threw stones at me the waters flowed over my head I said I am cut off I called on your name oh Lord from the lowest pit you have heard my voice do not hide your ear from my sighing from My Cry for Help you drew near on the day I called on you and said do not fear oh Lord you have pleaded the case for my soul you have redeemed my life oh Lord you have seen how I am wronged judge my case you have seen all their Vengeance all their schemes against me you have heard their reproach oh Lord all their schemes against me the lips of my enemies and their Whispering against me all the day look at their sitting down and their rising up I am their taunting song repay them oh Lord according to the work of their hands give them a veiled heart your curse be upon them and your anger pursue and Destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord the fourth lamentation how the gold has become dim how changed the fine gold the stones of the sanctuary are scattered at the head of every street the precious sons of Zion valuable as fine gold how they are regarded as clay pots the work of the hands of the Potter even the jackals present their breasts to nurse their young but the daughter of my people is cruel like ostriches in the wilderness the tongue of the infant clings to the roof of its mouth for thirst the young children ask for bread but no one breaks it for them those who ate Delicacies are desolate in the streets those who were brought up in Scarlet Embrace Ash heeps the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom which was overthrown in a moment with no hand to help her her nazarites this this means princes separated ones her princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk they were more ready in body than rubies like sapphire in their appearance now their appearances blacker than suot they go unrecognized in the streets their skin clings to their bones it has become as dry as wood those slain By The Sword are better off than those who die of hunger for these pine away stricken for lack of the fruits of the field the hands of the compassionate women have cooked their own children they became food for them and the destruction of the daughter of my people the Lord has fulfilled his Fury he has poured out his Fierce anger he kindled a fire in Zion and it has devoured its foundations the kings of the Earth all inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy could enter the Gates of Jerusalem because of the sins of her prophets those are false prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed in their midst the blood of the just they wandered blind in the streets they have defiled themselves with blood so that no one would touch their garments they cried out to them go away unclean go away go away do not touch us when they fled and wandered those among the Nations said they shall no longer dwell here the face of the Lord scattered them he no longer regards them the people do not respect the priests nor show favor to the elders still our eyes failed us watching vainly for our help and our watching we watched for a nation that could not save us they tracked our steps so that we could not walk in our streets our end was near our days were over for our end had come our pursuers were swifter than the Eagles of the heavens recall Deuteronomy 28 they pursued us on the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the Lord was caught in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the Nations rejoice and be glad oh daughter of Edom you who dwell in the land of O the cup shall also pass over to you and you shall become drunk and make yourself naked the punishment of your iniquity is accomplished oh Daughter of Zion he will no longer send you into captivity he will punish your iniquity oh daughter of Edom he will uncover your sins and the final lamentation Lamentations five not acrostic verses are short the lament is is drained remember oh Lord what has come upon us look and behold our reproach our inheritance has been turned over to aliens and our houses to foreigners we have become orphans and wfes our mothers are like widows we pay for the water we drink our wood comes at a price they pursue at our heels we labor and have no rest we have given our hand to the Egyptians and the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread our fathers sinned in are no more but we bear their iniquities servants rule over us there is none to Deliver Us from their hand we get our bread at the risk of Our Lives because of the sword in the wilderness our skin is hot as an oven because of the fever of famine they ravished the women in Zion the maidens in the cities of Judah princes were hung up by their hands Elders were not respected young men grounded the millstones boys staggered under loads of wood the elders have ceased gathering at the gate the young men from their music The Joy of our heart has ceased our dance has turned into mourning the crown has fallen from our head woe to us for we have sinned because of this our heart is faint because of these things our eyes grow dim because of Mount Zion which is desolate with foxes walking about on it you oh Lord remain forever your throne from generation to generation why do you forget us forever and forsake us for so long a time turn us back to you Lord and we will be restored renew our days as of old unless you have utterly rejected us and are very angry with us the musicians would please come Lamentations is such a difficult book to read despair horror extended suffering and death is the opening chapter of a saga that stretched for centuries then Millennia a punishment for sin after constant patience appeal for repentance and Reconciliation the obvious lesson here is that we should seek the Lord follow his will keep his Commandments not to avoid the penalty but from a heart that loves him when I read this book to prepare for tonight I could not help but think of another time in the environs of Jerusalem of some 600 years later another lament if you will Luke 22:41 and Jesus was withdrawn from his disciples about a stone's cast and he kneeled down among the olive trees and the Garden of Gethsemane overlooking the kidan valley where the blood from the sacrifices flowed and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in an Agony Jesus prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow to me Lamentations is a reflection of what was to come a shadow if you will another great suffering for sin but this time it was Christ the sinless suffering for me The Sinner only this time it would be the atonement for each and all of us and unlike the lamenter crying out for vengeance to the ones the Lord used to punish them Jesus prayed father forgive them and taught us to love our enemies and do good to them let's close this portion of the service and worship to the one who suffered the punishment we deserved who paid the price for our sins Here I Am to Worship light of the world you step down into darkness open my eyes let me see beaut beauty that made this heart adore you hope of a life spent with you and here I am to worship here I am to bow down

There is no service tonight and there's also no service Wednesday night. And then also at the end of service after everyone's done praying and musicians is closed, we're going to uh be clearing the chairs here in the main sanctuary. Brother Ed's organizing that. So if you brothers want to get with him after service to help him with that, that would be appreciated. We have a few praises, some prayer requests turned in this morning. Let's just go to the praises first. Sister Rachel Ghetta wants to just thank us for praying for Sister Meline Geta last Sunday. She went through her procedure just fine with no pain. Praise God. Amen. She asks that we continue to pray for her as she has one has a second part of the procedure this coming Thursday. So, let's just continue to keep her in prayer that the Lord would help her and strengthen her. Amen. Brother Ed and Sister Kathy have a few prayer requests. A couple um they first asked for uh their sister-in-law, Sister Susan Lepicart wants to thank everyone for our prayers. She's feeling better, but she still needs a touch from the Lord for a complete recovery. God bless you. And also from Brother Ed and sister Kathy Dooall, our daughter Ruth would like to thank everyone for praying for her. Her surgery went well. She is at home recovering. Thank you for praying for her full recovery. Amen. Then some requests here. Sister Sarah Codner requests prayer for her daughter Shana. For the last couple of months, she's been having stomach problems. Doctors are doing tests slowly but haven't found the cause. Still having more tests. God bless you. Sister Ameilia writes, \"I have an unspoken prayer request, an urgent unspoken prayer request before the Lord. Please help me pray for this need. Thank you.\" Also, I talked to sister Sarah Zam Brunan. She when she came in, her dad's still in therapy. Be there another few weeks, it sounds like. And so, let's just continue to remember brother John in prayer and the family strengthen strengthened them all. Sister Kathleen, it's good to see you and the girls in service today. So, just remember them all. It's been a trying ordeal. The Lord is faithful. Amen. Brother Bobby Wartz. Uh we had some communications with him this week and Sister Barbara King and he's just started radiation and treatment and chemotherapy pills. So far he hasn't had any nauseousness from the pills and so they're just thankful for that. But it's obviously a lot of trying times for them and the strength is weak and so forth. So let's just remember him in prayer and his brother, brother Michael Wartz. It sounds like it's going better there, but they I'm sure would to covet our prayers. Continued prayers. Amen. You all have a need this morning. Want to make known with an uplifted hand and unspoken need. Let's just go before the Lord this morning. Lord, we know you're a great big God.

You can satisfy every hunger, every thirst, Lord. You can take away the the wrong hungers and the wrong thirsts in our hearts, Lord, and replace them with good ones, Lord. We ask that your Holy Spirit would just come and dwell in our midst, Lord. Dwell in our lives, Lord. You would just help us, Lord. forgive us of our sins and our iniquities, Lord Jesus. We ask for these prayer requests, Lord, that you would just go to each one, each need, Lord. Touch each person, each individual, each family, Lord, spoken, Lord.

We would do all things pleasing and acceptable to you, Lord. Be with the service this morning. Continue to be with our worship and praise, Lord, and our glory. Glory to you, Lord.

Lord God Almighty, Lord, to think the angels cry holy as they Lord fly around your throne. They cover their face and their feet in humility, crying holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Father, to think that that same almighty God that created the heavens and the earth, that great eternal being would look down upon this congregation this morning and hear our prayers and receive our worship. We love you, God. Thank you for this opportunity. We pray Lord that your hand would be upon service and Lord that everyone would leave this building this morning. Everyone would leave like they did on the way the road to Emmas and they would say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us by the way. Father may the same be this morning. May the spirit speak something to each of us. I pray that they would bless us and bring us through. Lord, we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Friends, do you appreciate our worship team? &gt;&gt; Oh, we are not worthy of the gifts that God has given us. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. First, thank everybody for their patience in our construction. We uh the these walls are going to get dry stacked stone and and we're going to finish the outside walls here, but we're moving forward. The carpet's going to go in if the Lord's willing starting tomorrow. So, that's why all the chairs um have been moved from the north wing there. And then we're going to move after service, we'll move all of these chairs over there. So, we're moving. We're moving in in the right direction. Uh, somebody left a carpet right here. I did. This is the carpet. That's that's going to go on the floor. I didn't mean to leave it there, but I did. Uh, you know, I think the Lord I think he likes the way he way he made us. I really do. I think he's I think he's proud of us and I think we all have things to overcome and with our church and moving forward. I think that um it's going to be really nice. I don't think we'll ever finish. We'll always be constantly doing something. But I think it's going to be really really nice when when we get done. Uh, welcome to our visitors, Russell and Linda Lee. I met you before service back there with the Rory. God bless you. Welcome. It's good to have you. I think the world of that kid. It's good to have you, Alex. Who is this with you? &gt;&gt; Josh. Joshua. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, Joshua. Welcome. God bless you. You're always welcome to come. We appreciate bless you. If I miss any other visitors, I want to tell you we appreciate you coming and worshiping with us this morning. I uh like I said, I think the Lord, he makes us in certain ways. And we all think that, wow, I wish that I could do this better. I wish I was better at that. Or I I constantly keep making this mistake over and over. But I want to stand back for a minute and look. I think he's pleased with the way he made us each. I think he gave us each weaknesses &gt;&gt; and those weaknesses God can take those weaknesses and turn them around and be a glory to him. So I think that we we get down at our on ourselves sometimes but and you have weaknesses and you should overcome these weaknesses but remember God made you that way. Somebody asked, we were with the kids last night in the upper room and uh one of the youth asked,\"Well, why do why did God allow sin to come in the world? Why didn't he just make it perfect?\" That's a question that wow so many people have asked, especially when they're wondering, \"Should I serve God or not? Is this God real? Why would he make people sin and do really awful things all the way back to the Garden of Eden?\" Cain killed his brother Abel, one of the very first people that had ever lived. God allowed sin there. And you can see why someone who might be a a new Christian or or wondering about God and how he does things. Why would he allow this? Why would he allow sin? Why would he allow suffering? So many people suffer. We all suffer. Why does God allow it? And they so the kids asked that last night and the answer is there. I asked I asked some of the youth around and some of them came up with some very good answers and I think they were all right. One of the answers was well it builds character in us this suffering. It does very very good answer. It does it builds it builds character and and it just it helps us all the way. But the answer is one of the main reason that he allowed sin in the world is because he was God and God has attributes. God is a father. The father created the heavens and the earth. He was the beginning of it. But God is also a savior. So to be a savior, you have to have something to save. and you would have nothing to save if there wasn't failure in the world. So God allowed each of us to have weaknesses and he allowed Adam and Eve to have weaknesses. He allowed every person to have a weakness. And when they don't follow God and they act on those weaknesses, like we shouldn't do, but when we do, then God the Savior steps in. and he takes care of it and we just lay it at his feet. And I do believe I believe he makes us with these these weaknesses. And I know I feel like the Bible says, \"Confess your faults one to another.\" And it's like, \"Okay, here comes pastor. He's going to tell us another thing that he did wrong.\" And I do. I I have weaknesses. And yesterday we uh one of the kids at the youth uh gathering that we had last night, one of the kids asked a question. And the question was that some friends were asking questions about maybe why she dresses a certain way or why she um her hair is done a certain way. And she asked why do different denominations why do they believe different things and why she didn't say this but why is there conflict between different churches and different ways of thinking and my answer was I just went back to Jesus's time and I I described the different denominations that were in Jesus's time there were the Pharisees which were the common people they believed in prophets they believed in the resurrection and there was a Sadducees and they only believed in Moses. They were very legalistic. They only believed in temple worship. And then someone mentioned the Zealots. The Zealots were they believed that the Romans should be overthrown and the Messiah would be a great m great military leader. And then basically I said that they all had different perspectives in the Bible and on the Bible and God can use these different perspectives for his own good. While some may be good at at speaking to this group, well, they might not be good at speaking to that group and then that group um might be good to speaking at this group and and then God makes a way for everybody really to come in. So, I I gave that explanation and I'm very careful with the kids. I I don't want them to get the wrong idea about things. I want them to live moral lives. I want them to come to church. I want them to fellowship with each other. I don't want to get let them get caught up in different divisional doctrines and that and I I I simply answer their questions very simply and I try to just bring them back to the Bible. Well, I was driving home last night and I felt the Lord was maybe speaking to me. And all of us have that where you feel like the Lord's telling you something. all of us, we should we should have that voice that there's something that he's just talking to you and you listen and and I felt like he was telling me you didn't answer the question. And I said, I know. And then I felt like he said, well, what are you going to do about it? And then I said, \"Well, confess on Sunday morning and tell everybody.\" And I I think it God maybe used my weakness and maybe not in in just being very careful. And I think God wanted me to address that in front of the whole congregation this morning. And I think it's more appropriate to do it in in front of the congregation. As I said, I'm very careful with the kids. I I just want to be very very easy with them and just point them to the Lord Jesus. Point them to their parents because and I tell them all the time, your parents love you more than anyone else in this world. So always stick with mom and dad because they will stick with you. So the question, why do we have so many denominations today and and why are there so many different doctrines? And I will add to that question. Why do these doctrines separate us so much? And why do we believe so differently? And we all claim to be Christians. The Sadducees, let's go back to Jesus's time. The Sadducees had a doctrine that separated them from everyone else. They believed that the temple was the headquarters and anything any worship outside of the temple was sub subpar. It was below standard to them. That they were the elite. They were the chosen of God. They didn't believe in angels. They didn't believe in the supernatural. They believed that Moses, the prophet, was the absolute and the true mouthpiece of God. And none of the other prophets were up to that standard. This is what the Sadducees believe. They did not believe in a resurrection. There were no miracles. There were no healings. They believed only the first five books of the Bible written by Moses. They believed that those were the only ones that were truly inspired by God. and they were open to working with Rome, their occupiers, and making deals with the Roman Empire. That was a that was a Sadducees. The Pharisees, they had doctrines that separated them from everyone else. They believed in the prophets. They believed in the resurrection. They believed in miracles. They believed in the temple worship. But they also had synagogues throughout Israel and and other places in the world. They believed in angels. They believed in the observance of over 600 commandments in the Bible. They believed interpreting interpreting the law in a contemporary way, adapting the law to modern issues. They did not agree for the most part with the Sadducees making deals with the Roman Empire. And this all was less than these Pharisees. They were they were the elites. They were better than the other ones. So they were the elite and chosen of God because of their doctrines. And then I believe it was Josiah mentioned the Zealots. And there was one of Jesus's disciples that was a Zealot. No, Simon. They did not believe that the Roman Empire should have any part in Jewish life. They believed that just the presence of the Roman Empire was in violation of their God-given rights to their land. Their deep commitments to the Torah, to Moses's writing, justified their violent ways in their violent opposition to Rome, their occupiers. The Pharisees and the Sadducees, they were elite over the Pharisees and the Sadducees because of those doctrines. They were the elite and the chosen of God. So, they all have one thing in common. They all have a couple things in common. They all have Moses in common. And they all think that they are better than everybody else. These are all Jews. These are all people that believe the same. So each one of these three three groups, they separated themselves because of certain doctrines. As I said, they believed all they all believe the same prophet. And we think as we look back on the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the Herodians and the Zealots and and them, we think that they're all wrong. But I asked the congregation today and as I'm ministering this morning, if you lived in the times of Jesus, you would have probably been part of one of these groups. And I ask you, would you have had the doctrines that put you at the top of the list saying that this is the most important thing that I believe and I would have separated you or you would have separated yourself from the other Jews. All right. So, put yourself in these positions as I'm talking about this. Where would you have been? Would you have had doctrines that separated yourself from other believers and put those doctrines up to the top and made those doctrines more important than the other ones, just like they did. And times change, friends. Times change, but spirits don't change and people don't change. So, the same things going on today would be the same things that were going on back then. I want to continue on our prayer series. And as I'm reading from this prayer from Jesus that I'm about to read from, I want you to ask yourself what Jesus thought was important when he's praying. And if and do your doctrines line up with what he thought was important and what doctrine was what doctrine was most important to these Pharisees and Sadducees to separate them from Jesus? And do you have doctrines? Do I have doctrines? Do any of us have doctrines that are so important that we would want to separate ourselves from Jesus Christ today and still say we believe Moses? Still say we believe Jesus. I want you to put yourself in this position as we go through Christ's really final prayer for the church. What doctrine do we have that separates us from other Christians? When Jesus said that there will be one fold and one shepherd, what doctrine do we have to separate us from that fold or to say that we are the only fold? When Jesus prays that his disciples would be one, what doctrine do we have that encourages us to separate from the other believers in Christ? And would your doctrine would it justify going against this prayer of Jesus Christ and do the same that the Pharisees and Sadducees did? As we're going through this prayer, as always, put yourself in the Bible. Where would you have stood? So the question is why do we have so many different beliefs and still call ourselves Christians? And it's a that's something I want everyone to consider this morning. And I'll go a little farther and I'll say that if we separate ourselves on the same lines that the Pharisees did, and there's there's many ways to separate ourselves. baptism, clothing, political views, claiming leaders, Martin Luther, John Wesley, Willie um William William Brandom, Billy Graham, Sunday worship versus Saturday worship, different Bible translations is a big one. I've heard different people outside of our church say that our church is right because we use the King James Bible and not knowing anything about what we teach or anything about the doctrines that this pastor teaches, but just because you use the King James Bible, you must be right. It's so easy. And they're here this morning. Think about it yourself. All of us. I'm just presenting the question and you make your own decision on your own personal beliefs and then you make the decision on if you would be one that fights against this prayer that I'm about to read or if it or if you would support it today. We've been going on for the visitors. We've been going this on this series of of uh on the subject of prayer. And I say it every time. It's the most important thing that a man or a woman can do is pray. And here is Jesus's really his final prayer for the church. This is the same night that he had the last supper. This is the same night that he was stolen away and taken to be crucified. This is the same night that he was with his disciples and he was praying for for them. This is the same night that he was betrayed by Judas. This is the end of his mortal life. The last night that Jesus Christ is on the earth. And this is a this is the big prayer. And as I read it, ask yourself if the doctrines that separate you from other Christians line up with Jesus Christ. We all call ourselves Christians. John chapter 17. We'll read the whole prayer. John chapter 17 says this. These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, \"Father, the hour is come. glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. So he's not separating anybody right here except those who give their lives to Christ and those who don't. Verse number three. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I love that part. I I just I love that part. This is one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible. Remember, Jesus last name is not Christ. Christ is a title. It's a Greek word for for the Hebrew word Messiah. And this is the only place that I know of that Jesus called himself Jesus Christ. The entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is really it's about this one man about this man Jesus. Again, from Genesis all the way to the end of Revelation, it is about one man &gt;&gt; and that man is God. And you know what? That man's whole life was about me. was about you. &gt;&gt; That whole Bible is about one man and his life was about me. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in. He gave his life for us. He did everything for us. And the whole Bible, everything about the word is about Jesus Christ. And yet he lived his life for me and he gave his life for me. &gt;&gt; I have glorified thee on earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. Jesus is praying here. Again, remember this is it. This is the final prayer for the church. I have glorified thee on earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, f oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. He's talking about his disciples. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and they have known and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didest send me. So the first part of this whole prayer is that Jesus saves us from our sins and these disciples believe Jesus and that Jesus should be glorified. Nothing else. Remember this is it. This is the exclamation point at the end. of his ministry. It's all about Jesus. And where there are division, divisive doctrines that separate, where are these in his prayer? Where are all these little doctrines that divide the churches, that divide the denominations? They are not present. At least they're not present yet in this prayer. And we'll keep going. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me. For they are thine, and all are mine, and and all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. I am glorified in them. Who's glorified in them? Jesus Christ is glorified in his disciples. Have you seen any justification yet for any division? It gets stronger. So does Jesus's very disciples. All those that take on the name Christian, Jesus is glorified in their lives. So how many people I told a story last week about a woman that was going to going to a church back east and she said, \"I love the things that Jesus says. I I love his doctrines. I I love I love all of all of everything about Jesus, but I would be a Christian. if it wasn't for the Christians and how the Christians act. And I think that we glorify Jesus Christ. Someone should look at us and want to be like us. &gt;&gt; Never feel like they have been mistreated by us but have been loved by us. And there should be that draw of the Holy Spirit that that people want to be a Christian because of the Christians. &gt;&gt; They shouldn't not want to be a Christian because of the Christians. They should want to be a Christian because of the way a Christian acts. &gt;&gt; And Jesus here is saying, he's like, they glorify me. I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those who thou hast given me, and may they be one as we are one. &gt;&gt; So who's Jesus? Who's he praying for here? He's praying that they may be one as as the as the father and the son are one. And who is he talking about? He's talking about the church. He's talking about Christians. Is there anywhere yet that we can justify separating ourselves in Jesus's prayer? That they may be one as we are one. Who's he talking about? Is he talking about the Pharisees? Is he talking about the s Sadducees? He's talking about those that follow him. While I was yet with them, while I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those who thou those who those that thou gavest me, I have kept. And none of them is lost, but the son of predition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. So which Christian is lost? Only the son of destruction, and that's Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus for something else. And now come I to the unto thee to thee. And these things I speak in the world that they might have my glory fulfilled in themselves. My joy, I'm sorry. That they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. He's praying that a Christian life would bring us joy. And it does bring us joy. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bring us hardships. It doesn't it doesn't bring us these heavy burdens. We put our burdens on him. But instead, so many people who call themselves Christians, call themselves believers are miserable because they think that it's their they think that their separation, their doctrines are more important, their core doctrines, and they take themselves and they bring themselves outside of Christ and it makes them miserable. It makes them miserable because they're thinking about all the bad things, all the problems. And it's just it it makes a miserable person. And Jesus is here is saying, \"Listen, if you truly accept me, you're going to have joy. Your life is going to get better. &gt;&gt; Your life is going to be filled with this spirit. Where there's divisions, he doesn't want us to have those. At least so far in his prayer, we don't see any divisions. Where are the doctrines that that try to separate us in this prayer? They're not there. He's saying that you need to be one and it's all about one and that's Christ. I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. And when someone preaches Christ truly Christ, then he's hated in the world. And he's especially hated in church all the way back. The religious spirit that claims to believe the Bible is the strongest spirit against Christ. The strongest spirit against God was not Mary Magdalene. was not Peter out on his boat. The strongest spirit against Christ was in the churches, &gt;&gt; was in the synagogues. Those were the ones that crucified him. Those were the ones that hated him. &gt;&gt; And it was because not of their sins. Not because one was a prostitute over here and it and and she was not because one was a a liar and a cheat over here with Matthew and he was not because of them but because of Annis and Ananas and Simon the the Pharisee. They were the ones that wanted to kill Jesus. It was the religious people. Jesus Christ did not line up with the Pharisees and Sadducees or the zealots even though all three believed the prophet Moses. I pray not that thou should takes them take them out of the world but thou should keep them from evil. They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. So the Sadducees would say the Pharisees are of the world and the Pharisees would say that the zealots are are of the world. Pharisees and the Sadducees and everybody else is all looking at each other and they're all in the world. And Jesus is like, \"Hey, come out of the world.\" We think of the world as being drugs and alcohol and all that. And that is, but it is also that Pharisee and Sadducee spirit. It's very worldly. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. As thou has sent me into the world, even so I have also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall be which shall believe on me through their their word. So believe on me through their word. I believe that Jesus is praying for the Tucson tabernacle back then. And now it is manifested in people who truly believe Jesus Christ here in our church and in many other churches. And notice it says, \"But for them also which shall believe on me through their word, not certain doctrines that separate outside of Christ, but believe on me.\" Jesus Christ is what he's saying. If I be lifted up, he said, I'll draw all men to me. And then he said another place, no one can come to the father except by me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Neither neither pray I for these alone, but for them which shall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one. As thou, Father art in me, this is the second time. As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, and they also may be may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. One who? that they may be one, one in Christ. And if we can just become one in Jesus Christ, then the world will believe that God sent Jesus Christ. The world will become Christians because of the oneness that Christians are with each other. Each church, if you truly have love and unity within that church, the world is going to see it. And the world's going to want to be part of that. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one even as we are one. I wonder, stop there for a minute. Think about your prayers. You wake up in the morning, you pray your noon time prayers, your evening prayers. Whenever you pray, think about what you pray for. And are you praying for what Jesus prayed for? &gt;&gt; Are you praying for unity in the body of Christ? &gt;&gt; Are you praying what Jesus prayed in his last prayer for the church that they would be one? Why are we not praying for that? How much would unity mean in our lives? How much unity? How much would unity mean between a husband and a wife, between a father and a son, between a daughter and her mother? How much would that unity be? It would it would change the world if we would really desire unity and love for one another and set aside these little things that separate us. If we just had that desire, if we just put that at the top of our prayer list all the time, then things would change. But instead, we're not praying for what Jesus prayed for. The book of Acts, when Peter was in prison, he was taken. They were going to execute him. The church in unity, they got together and they made prayer without ceasing for Peter. &gt;&gt; And then a angel came, brought him out, brought him home. He walked in. They were continually praying. Look what Unity did at that time. And Jesus said, \"If just two of you will agree, just look at unity. If just two of you will agree when you pray, then you will receive what you ask for.\" Just unity between two people. Imagine if we had unity between 150 people. Imagine if we had unity with believers around the world. Again, as I asked you before, does your doctrine line up with this Jesus's prayer? And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one even as we are one. I in them and thou in me. That they may be made perfect in one. Whoa. May be made perfect in one. So unity brings on perfection &gt;&gt; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me. Again, he's saying this unity is going to represent Jesus Christ to the world. Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world. Jesus is praying that the ones God gave him, that he would be able to spend an eternity with them. Oh righteous father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee. And these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. Why is Jesus Why is Jesus's prayer here not constantly in our prayers? We forget the power of unity. I truly do not believe that Jesus would have prayed this if it were not possible to be there to happen. I believe that one day the church will come into unity. I believe that with all of my heart. And it's not this denomination or that denomination, this church or that church. It's the ones that have Christ associated with their name, Christians. Those are the ones that will come together in unity one day. Jesus Christ himself our Lord prayed for it. So the answer to the question about why different people believe different things and the reason we separate ourselves in those doctrines is because we lift those doctrines above Jesus Christ just as the Pharisees and Sadducees and the zealots and the rest of them did. We put those doctrines above this prayer of Christ. And again ask, what doctrine do I have that separates me from another Christian from another Christian church? And does that please Jesus? And one day that prayer of Jesus Christ will be answered. And I want to be part of it. Now, I have 15 minutes and I want to get into the Lord's prayer. Um, how could these things happen? How could unity truly come to pass? Really, if we would just do what the Lord prayed when he says he said, \"Pray like this. If we would just do what the Lord's prayer is, then we would come into unity.\" Look at look at how beautiful it is. Let me let me give a background first. I asked the kids last night. I said, \"There's something that most Christians recite in the Lord's Prayer that's not actually in the Bible. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\" Does anybody who Anybody know what it is? Not the kids. Let me let me read it. I I'll recite it. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us not of forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass pass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. The trespass part. Um where's Lily? Lily nailed it last night. It's debts and the trespass part to go back and I geeked out about on this a little bit over the week over the during the week and I was studying why does it say why' they change it? Why' they change it to trespass rather than debts? And it's because William Tinddale, and I I'll just do a little aside here. William Tinddale was one of the first English one of the first very good English translators of the Bible. So, he translated the Bible way back way back when and you know, they burned him at the stake for it because heaven forbid that someone get their own relationship with with Christ. Someone get their own relationship with God. Tendell suffered for his translation by being burned at the stake. But his translation came out and his translation there was not correct. He said, \"Forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.\" But then when the King James Bible came out in every subsequent Bible, it says debts and debtors. Forgive us of our debts as we as we forgive um our debtors. So what happened was the Church of England, let me let me read this right here. This came from classic theology website. It says this. But how did Tendale's translation get so popular? It's because it was used in the 1549 book of common prayer, which is the official book of lurggy of the church of England. And at that time, his translation was one of the most readily available editions that came from the Greek. Over time, English translations didn't follow Tendale's directions on those. But the book of common prayer kept it that way. And every service across the Church of England, that's what people said. And that is what was repeated and that's how it stuck. As this as time went on, the influence of the book of common prayer was felt in other denominations. Churches that made use of formal liturgy like um likely to say trespasses, Anglican, Methodist, Catholic, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox, while churches that don't use the same kind of formal liturgy are more likely to say debt debts, which is Presbyterian Reformed Baptist. So if you read the Lord's prayer, forgive us of our um it very plainly says forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors. Now I don't think it's that important because the very next verse Jesus says he says um this in Matthew chapter 6 he says when thou prayest let's see he says for he says but if anyways he ends the prayer and then he says the very next verse he says forgive us of our trespasses that we forgive those who trespass against us. So let's get into the Lord's prayer here in just a few minutes we will we will finish the Lord's prayer and if we really pray this friends then I believe that we will come into that unity that I was talking about. Matthew chapter 6 verse 5 and when thou prayest thou should not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corner of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into the closet, and when thou hast shut up the door, pray to the Father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. So if you really want to make a difference in someone's life, don't let anyone know what you're doing. Go in secret. Do your arms in secret. As Jesus said, do your prayers in secret. And this whole concept of prayer is setting aside your own self-serving motives and then entering into the mind of God. You want to I don't have time but Romans chapter 8 tells us that likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. &gt;&gt; So we get in those quiet places and we pray. But when you pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not therefore like them. For your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him, and after this manner, therefore pray. Okay, now we're getting into the Lord's prayer. Jesus talking to his disciples. Our father which hath art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. So first he is giving God respect. He's approaching him in a respectful way with reverence and humility. And then he's he's teaching us to approach God in this way. We're lifting up God in worship. The prayer the the prayer the the Lord's prayer opens up in worship and it closes in worship. And it says this, \"Now that we have approached God in the right way, holy and reverent, give us this day our daily bread.\" Now we present our need to God after we have worshiped him. Lord, I have a need. I'm having trouble at my job. I'm I'm having spiritual trouble. Lord, I need a touch from you. Remember Christ's prayer for unity in the church. And that's how he taught us to pray. We pray for these things that we desperately need need and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors. So you say, \"Lord, I understand that my dependence on your forgiveness is dependent on me forgiving others.\" So when we pray that way, we're reminding ourselves, Lord, I forgive someone who has done something against me. And now, Lord, I place this into your hands. I don't require an apology. I don't require any of this. I forgive their debts. I And someone when someone does you wrong, they incur a debt to you. And if you can forgive that debt of that person, then now you are where God wants you. Lord, I forgive them for what they have done. And forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. And lead us not into temptation. Lord, before we sin, help us avoid sin &gt;&gt; as we walk through life. Let us lead us away from the temptation of sin. Don't allow yourself to be placed in that position of sin. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say lead us not into sin. It says lead us not into temptation. If gossip is a temptation, maybe criticizing the sermon after church or talking about different people, then don't allow yourself to be placed in that situation. Don't go to lunch with the people that constantly speak negative words and draw you down. Lead us not into temptation. Don't put yourself in that spot. If you have a problem drinking, then don't walk into a situation that would teach that would tempt you to drink. &gt;&gt; If you have a weakness of inappropriate sexual desires, don't let yourself be in a position of being alone with someone of the opposite sex. Don't go into temptation. The sin is after temptation. If you have a weakness of looking at things on the internet, don't put yourself in the position of of having to overcome something. &gt;&gt; It's temptation. It's not sin. Lord, keep us away from the temptation. Don't let me go there because I might fall. &gt;&gt; Keep yourself away from the the temptation, the very appearance of evil. Stay away from it. &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. deliver us from evil. When we find ourselves now in a place that we shouldn't be, when we find ourselves in a situation where we need God to get us out, we cry, \"God, God, deliver me from this evil. Get me out of this.\" Now Jesus closes in worship again and lead us not into tempt unto temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom. Now he's worshiping again. For Lord, yours is the kingdom and yours is the power and yours is the glory forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. The worship team can come. And then he goes right into this. And this is William Tenddale. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also forgive you. Right into that. Right after the Lord's prayer, Jesus thought it was important enough to say, \"If you forgive men their trespasses, your father will also forgive you. But if you forgive them not of their trespasses, neither will you, your father, forgive your trespasses.\" Luke closes his prayer in this way. The um the gospel of Luke says the Lord's prayer like this. He says, \"And I say unto you,\" after the Lord's prayer is over, Matthew ends with Jesus saying, \"For forgive them of their trespasses.\" Luke says this, \"And I say unto you, ask and it shall be given to you.\" After he gives a parable, Jesus says, \"Ask and it shall be given to you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be open to you. For everyone that askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened. So Jesus is encouraging us. Pray this Lord's prayer. You start your prayer. Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. You start you get down on your knees or you stand with your face against the wall or what wherever you are. Lord, you are God. You are mighty. You are wonderful. Lord, I thank you that you created the heavens and the earth. I thank you that you placed me here. And Lord, I have now Lord I have this weakness. &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Now Lord, I have a need. I have a weakness or I have a need for money or I have a need for something. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive forgive us of our debts as we forgive those we forgive our debtors. We've incurred this. Lord, I I've I've done wrong and and I've had problems. Now I need you. And Lord, I forgive others. Now, Lord, I've done my part. Now I place it into your hands. Lord, help me. and lead us not into temptation. &gt;&gt; One of the keys, one of the things that we always we we just maybe read over that, Lord, don't let me fall into temptation. If walking into the grocery store and seeing maybe the alcohol there is a temptation, Lord, I want to stay away from that. If turning on the computer when I I I'm have idle time or getting on my phone when I have idle time. Lord, I I just don't I want to stay away from that temptation. Or if if your your wife says something to you or or your husband says something to you and it just it irks you, Lord, I don't I don't want to go there. I'm just going to I'm going to humble myself. And then you see that the peace of God is there. Lord, she owes me an apology. No, nobody owes anybody an apology if you're a Christian. If you're not a Christian, maybe you would think somebody owes you an apology. But if you are a Christian, according to the Lord's prayer and according to the Lord's prayer for unity, nobody owes you an apology. Because if they do, and if you want it, then you're not a Christian according to these words. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Now, Lord, I have a need. I place it into your hands. by your word, by your son, Jesus Christ, I place it into your hands. For yours is the kingdom and Lord, yours is the power and Lord, yours is the glory forever. Amen. Imagine, friends, if we prayed that prayer. Doesn't have to be those exact words, but imagine if we prayed like that. And then imagine if we prayed like Jesus did before he went to the cross. Lord, may they be one as as we are one. It wasn't all these doctrines. It wasn't all these different churches. Jesus is like, listen, all of that that's not that's not what matters. What matters is that you are one. And then if you are one and you love each other, then the whole world will see that we are Christians and they will want to be like you. But instead, people don't want to be like Christians today. shouldn't be that. They should want to be a Christian. And we should always represent ourselves as Jesus Christ. We should always represent ourselves as followers of him. If it's, as I said, if it's been to your wife or to your husband, to your daughter, to your son, to your parents, whatever it is, represent yourself as a Christian. And then just your testimony, just your actions will speak way more than all of the words in the world. They would see, I want to be like that guy. That's who I want to be like. He's a Christian. That's what a Christian is. I want to be like that. But you see over here, that's what a Christian is. I don't want it. I like Jesus, but I don't want Christianity. But there is coming a time Jesus Christ himself, God in flesh on earth prayed for unity and it's coming. Friends, do you want to be part of it? If you want to be part of it, then you handle the part that surrounds you. I'll handle the part that surrounds me. And then this will grow. It's like taking a stone and throwing it in a calm pond. and watch those ripples. They would just go and go and go and they go on forever. And if we can truly just start with our lives, start with our family, start right there. And then you watch how it spreads. That's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. Then Jesus Christ will return when that unity is truly there because there is power in unity. And friends, I want to be part of it so bad with all my heart. And the only unity that we can have is through Jesus Christ, our Lord, our Savior. And not from all the doctrines may be right. Not saying the doctrines are wrong. They may be right, but when they separate you, you've used them in the wrong way. I have decided to follow Jesus. Before we get on this song, told this testimony before, there was a great revival going on in Europe about 150 years ago. The revival like all of us when the joy comes in our heart, you know that Jesus prayed that the joy would be there. When when it comes in, we want to spread it to other people. We want to spread it to other places. And this revival started in Europe. And these these people had given their hearts to the Lord Jesus. And they had just such joy and such power and such love that they wanted to bring it to other countries. And this one missionary these missionaries go to India. And they start witnessing to these different heathens in India. These were not only one of this group of missionaries came not only to the heathens and the idoltors but to cannibals people that would eat, kill and eat their enemies to finally assert that power over them. Death wasn't enough. They wanted to do that just to say how much stronger I am than you. They these missionaries came and they witnessed to this place in India and there was a man named Nak Singh who heard this witness and he believed on this man Jesus Christ. He believed on these teachings. He believed these these missionaries must have set a good example. And this man believed and his family believed on this this novel concept of Christianity and Jesus Christ. And he started witnessing around his villages. And the village elders heard this. They didn't want any of this. They were warriors. They didn't want any of this peace and unity and all that stuff. That is not what they stood for. They didn't stand to reach out to other tribes. They stood to take things from other tribes, to destroy other tribes, to make it to where these other tribes wouldn't invade them. So this man, he's witnessing about this man, Jesus Christ, and about this Christianity did not line up with what they thought. So they start telling on each other and finally he gets to the village head and he brings this man before him and he says, \"What is this? What are you talking about? Would you have your village die? Would you have your village defenseless in this unity that you're talking about this love of Jesus Christ? Would you want your village to perish in that when these other people would these other villages would attack us? He brought before the chief and the man said, \"I have decided to follow Jesus.\" He says, \"You're forsaking everything that you've ever learned.\" And he said, \"The world behind me and the cross before me.\" He said, \"No turning back.\" So he took this man No Singh. He took his two young boys and they set his two young boys before him and he had the archers pull their bow back and he said the village master said, \"Okay, Noxine, does it mean enough to you to lose your boys? Will you recant from this nonsense?\" He says, \"Though none go with me, still I will follow.\" No turning back. They let the arrows go and killed his two sons. They brought up his wife. He said, \"Nox singing, will you recant?\" And he says this. He says, \"My cross I'll carry till I see Jesus. No turning back.\" And they killed his wife. before he died, he looked at the chief and he said, \"Will you decide now to follow Jesus?\" No turning back. And they killed him. years later, decades later, a group of other missionaries came to the same area and Knox Singh's testimony resonated not only with the people that watched his his family die, be executed, but it resonated with the very vi village elder and the whole village gave their hearts to Jesus Christ and became Christians. And when this other group of missionaries came, they said, \"Oh, we already know Jesus.\" And they told this story of this song that we're about to sing. I have decided to follow Jesus. It builds unity, friends, and it builds love. It is more important than any kind of little stuff that separates a husband from a wife. Any type of little stuff that separates a church from another church. It's beyond anything in the world. And it's what Jesus prayed for. Listen to this song. Let's all sing it together. I have decided [Music] to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. [Music] No turning back. &gt;&gt; Imagine that man standing there. He says, \"I've decided to follow Jesus. I will not go back.\" decided to follow Jesus. [Music] I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. [Music] No turning back. No turning back. The world behind me, the cross before me, the world behind me, the cross before me, the world behind me, the cross before me. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. &gt;&gt; Can you say the same thing? The world behind me and the cross before me, I'm not turning back. I'm not turning back to my old worldly ways. I want a change in my life. And this change, it's it's everything to me. That world may be addiction. It may be whatever it may be. Or it may be a religious spirit. But Lord, I set that world behind me. And I set the cross before me. And no, Lord, I will not turn back. I won't turn back. Though none go with me, &gt;&gt; though none go with me, still I will follow. Though none go with me, still I will follow though none go with me. Still I will follow. [Music] I won't turn back. I won't. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Think about this. Are you willing to be a Christian? Are you willing to say, \"Though none go with me.\" If I have to walk this walk of Christianity alone, if I have to walk by myself, though none go with me, if my parents won't go with me, if my wife won't go with me, if my husband won't go with me, if my church won't go with me, I am willing to walk this walk of Christianity alone. I am willing to do everything I can for that love and unity that Jesus Christ prayed for. And then if you do, Jesus said to take up your cross and follow me. That cross is a heavy burden. But he said it, \"My cross I'll carry. My cross I'll carry &gt;&gt; till I see Jesus. My cross I'll carry till I see Jesus my cross I'll carry [Music] till I see Jesus my cross I'll carry until I see Jesus. [Music] I won't turn back. [Music] I won't turn back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided [Music] to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, will you lay aside? Will you lay aside those things that so easily beset us? We lay aside th those things that separate us. And when you will you truly bow and will you truly pray along with the Lord Jesus that we would be one within our families, within our friends, within our churches, within the world, that we could be one in Jesus Christ and pick up your cross and carry that cross and follow Jesus. He prayed that we would be one. And I believe that his prayer will be answered. Let's bow our heads. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. And give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors. and lead us not into temptation, [Music] but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Lord God, I want to be a Christian. Lord, from the bottom of my heart, I want to be like that man from India who stood for you. I want to be like those disciples. Every one of them lost their life. are imprisoned. Lord, I want to be like them. I want to be able to stand for a living Jesus Christ. I want to be a I want to be able to stand for the unity of the gospel. Lord, I want to be able to stand with my brothers and sisters arm in arm who love Jesus Christ, who love you. Lord, I want to stand. Lord, give us strength to make that stand. I pray. Guide us, Father. We love you and we thank you. We ask Lord that we could be part of this great plan that you have to one day return and take away your waiting bride. Lord, may we be part of that and may we be that waiting bride when you return in Jesus name. Amen.\n"}, {"id": "2024-05-20 - The God of this World Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE:

a blessing of having you with us this morning God bless you I'm sure there's other visitors I don't uh I don't maybe see them right now but welcome and God bless you thank you for for coming I U I wanted to share before we get started I wanted to share a testimony from last Sunday's service I was um his mother's day and and you know it's important to me and I'm sure it's important to everyone here that we honor our mothers in the proper way because they mean so much to us so Stephanie and I were working on getting um our Mother's Day gifts ready and and um it was just we're excited about service and uh so what happened on Saturday is that we uh something the enemy will always throw a curveball into your plans and some Stephanie and I were dealing with some stuff we were some some people that were close to us family members they said a couple things that that got to us and and we were a bit upset with this with with the whole situation so Stephanie and I were at uh at home and we were talking to each other and we were just complaining to each other and and we shouldn't do it and that's why when I came to church on Sunday morning I was like that why that was one of the first things I said is never say anything about anyone even it's if it's in your private home and to your closest person which would be your wife or your husband or your children be careful what you say so Stephanie and I were we were complaining to each other and we shouldn't have and uh the day goes by and we had ordered these these cakes uh for the mothers and I don't know how many we had 70 or 100 cakes or whatever it was and we uh we were going through the day and I was studying for my sermon and Stephanie was uh she was busy doing her thing and we forgot to pick up the cakes both of us were so devastated and both of us knew immediately that this was a result of us complaining even between a husband and a wife complaining and this was the Lord showing his children I'm a son of God Stephanie's a daughter of God he was showing us hey don't you say anything remember what I said last Sunday that if we are a Christian if we're not a Christian then we have every right to complain when somebody does us wrong we have every right to defend ourselves if somebody talks bad about us we have every right to get our way if if we are right in the in this course but when you become a Christian you forfeit those rights you no longer have a right to complain even if you're done wrong you no longer have a right to go after somebody even if they come after you when you become a Christian you forfeit those rights so I was feeling really like a hypocrite on Saturday because they were closed on Sunday morning and there was no way for us to get the gifts for our CH for our mothers I was upset Stephanie was upset so Stephanie was with her family with marily Lee and um um Stephanie's Brother David her her sister Tanya or her sister um Melissa and their families and uh they were there was it a what was it it was a shower um it was a dinner of some sort and I was at home studying and Stephanie was she was so upset she had told me on the phone we forgot this and I was like Lord first thing I did was I went before the Lord and said Lord I'm sorry I shouldn't have been complaining this morning and that was the first thing Stephanie said is when we were talking on the phone I said we shouldn't we shouldn't have complained so first thing we did is we got off the phone and I pray us Lord I'm wrong I we need a we need a miracle here and Stephanie she was worried and they had the the group around there and so Stephanie's telling the family about what we had done about how we forgot the cakes and Tanya my sister-in-law David Carroll's wife she said David knows the owner of the company and he calls the owner and the owner saysure I can meet you there on Sunday morning before church and and give you everything that you need and and you can bring your um bring it to your your church thought Lord once again got on our knees Lord you are so great he is brothers and sisters when I give a testimony and you know me now I've been preaching here here long enough when I give a testimony it's to show how foolish I am and how in inadequate I am and how how much I have no abilities at all but when you surrender to the Lord Jesus then he can make a way when you surrender to God he will make a way for you if you would just humble yourself and come before him and say Lord I'm sorry I'm not capable I need you and he's always there e puts his hand on us says I'll take care of it but the thing that we did right was we confessed before the Lord and we confessed to each other and then he made a way I also gave a testimony of uh of a brother that um had got into it with his with his colleague at work brother Manny is it okay if I say that it's you I don't want to embarrass you it's all right okay [Laughter] so brother Manny sends me a text last week and he says this he says good Afternoon brother Daniel I've been struggling with a coworker he said I went off on him he said that's not me he says it wasn't cool and I feel really bad about it he said the coworker has no respect but I'm going to apologize on Monday he said can you pre please pray for me prayed for brother Manny and then brother Manny apologizes he couldn't wait as I said he couldn't wait to get back to talk with this guy to make things right because remember what I said it doesn't have anything to do with Manny if he did him wrong what matters is how you how you respond to it brother Manny made a mistake and he was going and he wanted to make this right no matter what this man had done to him so you know it was a long weekend huh bro and then he finally gets back there and he's able to talk to this man and to make it right and then he sends me this this text he said good evening brother Daniel I don't mean to bother you he said I patched things up with my coworker but he stopped talking to me it's fine I have no animosity or hatred towards him I did my part God has blessed me so much am he says I don't care what they say about me God knows where my heart is same as we did and and it gets better and I responded to him I said brother Manny you did your best now it's up to the Lord to work on this man so then brother Manning sends me another text with a meme of a statue a picture that's missing the midsection of there it is right there of the middle and it says how empty the soul is without Jesus and he he writes me this this is how my life was when I was of the world until I met Jesus Christ he broke them chains of bondage of the street life and he deserves all the praise amen thank you brother Jordan then another day goes by and he sends me another text and he says brother good afternoon and brother Daniel my co-worker came to me and told me he was sorry for snapping at me we shook hands and made peace with each other we gave each other a big hug now we can clap did you notice that in both of these testimonies we had to repent we had to admit our faults and we had to ask God for mercy and then when we show that we are nothing but sinners that is when God steps in and gives us a testimony both times we weren't looking neither of us we weren't looking for a testimony to tell everyone about that would maybe Lift us us up and brag about something that the Lord did for us both times we humbled ourselves and said listen I'm the sinner I'm the what's wrong Lord help me I repent and then God Made A Way that's how we have to do brothers and sisters we don't seek our own thoughts we don't seek our own way we don't seek our own will we seek what God wants in our lives I want the church to please we we um we're under construction now and uh there's a lot of decisions that have to be make made and I want the church to pray for our renovation in in the construction that we're going through right now pray that sister Martha has been she's been looking to see how much it costs to rebuild the pews and then we've also brother Ed and I have looked in to getting chairs to replace to replace the pews we're trying to make the right decision so please please pray that the Lord will help us and we are together as a group and we want what's right and brothers and sisters I tell you I don't want anything with Daniel Evans at all I want my thoughts I want my desires I want them completely out of everything I want Lord I want what you want I want what God wants for our congregation I want what God wants for our people and that's that's the reason we see so many problems it seems like everybody is trying to get their way they always put themselves and their opinions above anyone else it's a stubbornness and I think that it's it's I think it's the most prevalent I think this problem of looking to ourselves and trying to serve ourselves is not not only the biggest problem in this church I believe it's the biggest problem in the entire world right now it's people trying to get what they want trying to please themselves and their opinion matters more than anyone else's what we should be doing is seeking God's will on these things putting him first and no matter what his decision is I don't even have an opinion on it Lord I want what you want that's how our attitude should be have your way Lord have your perfect will in every aspect of my life and that I know that's going to be better if I could just find his will I know it'll be better for our church I know it'll be better for our families I know it'll be better for our communities I know it'll be better about for our country we see the Holy Spirit if he would if we would just open our elves up instead of closing ourselves and try and get our way if we would just open ourselves up to him then we would Prosper we look in the politics of today we see these two Waring factions against each other and if they would just stop and if they would pray and they would ask the lord lord what do you want do you think he's going to tell the Democrats something that he's going to tell the Republicans he's God he's one and he'll say the same thing but instead we're just trying to get what we want we're trying to vote along the party lines instead of seeking God on those things if they would seek God then they would agree I know there would be little minor disagreements when we when we let the flesh get in there but our country would return to its Original Greatness we were talking yesterday wasn't complaining um but was talking not totally complaining I was talking with Stephanie about our President we should pray for our president I don't care if you're for Donald Trump or Joe Biden or whoever it is we should pray for our leaders because we will prosper if they make the right decisions we were I was telling her that this this man I was reading a a thing on the news and I said honey he's he's not capable he's not he's not in his right mind and I and wasn't complaining was just stating a fact that's a good excuse never do that but I was talking I was talking to Stephanie about this and I said he's not capable he can't even walk up to the podium and I said who's running the country and before she even thought about it she said Satan I thought that's right that's the truth and we see that it's Satan running this country because everybody's trying to get their way no one's thinking of the best for the country or the people they're trying to vote along the party Vines we see it back in the Garden of Eden right at the beginning of the Bible we see the serpent come in and he wanted his way and he had his way with Eve he got what he wanted and then we see even his children we see that they go through and we see the evilness of Cain and how Cain wanted his way and he was willing to kill his brother just to get his way his offering was not accepted by God and it angered him and it it offended him so much so instead of changing to God's way he killed his brother because he wanted his way of doing things and as I said I believe this is the biggest problem that's in the world today is we want our way remember the song Can't Always Get What You Want don't look it up brother Joe is a different Arrow huh but it's true you can't get what you want you want to get what you should want is what God wants and in this Great quest in our lives to get what we want we follow we fall into the Trap Of Destruction and that's why we see Wars around the world that's why we see hating in politics that's why we NE neither side cares you see countries attacking others because they want something and they are not seeking God about it but Sheed when they when they attacked Israel and Israel defends itself they want their way they want to conquer those people they want them wiped off the match show me how that can be God right it can't be most of the time and we talk about we pray about something most of the time we go to prayer with the wrong motives a large portion of the time you just want to say I prayed about it rather than staying in prayer and getting an answer from God and many times those answers don't come right away they come after hours of prayer and days and sometime years of prayer then you finally get an answer and God sees your heart that you're sincere in doing this in James chapter 4 it says this verse one from whence come Wars and fightings among you he's talking about prayer from where does do these wars and fighting come come they not hint even of your lusts that war in your members that word lusts means Desires in this Modern English it doesn't have any sexual undertone it's because of your desires you lust and you have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may be consumed May consume it upon your lusts the NLT translation of that says and even when you ask you don't get it because your motives are all wrong you only want what will give you pleasure it's all about what you want and that's why God won't answer those prayers because we have a preconceived outcome in our Minds that we desire the right way to approach God is to say Lord let your will come into my mind and my heart and then I can do your will this has nothing to do with me it happens brothers and sisters it happens all the way from the very top all the way to to countries all the way down to churches all the way down to our individual families even a relationship between two people it's two people instead of getting on their knees and praying to the Lord and asking him Lord what is your will for me because I want to serve you I want to exalt you as the song was saying that we're singing We Sing the song but do we really want to exalt God or do we want to exalt ourselves do we want to serve ourselves eles but Lord I want to exalt you I want to serve you what is your will for us in our lives and you see sometimes that circle gets smaller and smaller because we have self self-promotion we have self-will and smaller and pretty soon we're the only ones standing in our Circle how does that go with drawing the circle bigger but more often the case that is the case and what's all the purpose in this Stephanie's answer to my question was who is in charge and she said the devil is she said Satan is 2 Corinthians chapter 4 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but we we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness manipulating other people to get your way nor handling the word of God deceitfully a minister trying to get his way by using the word of God as justification but by manifest manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it it is hid to them that are lost in whom listen closely in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God who is the image of God should shine unto them so the gospel is hidden to those that are lost and how is it hidden everybody knows everybody knows the gospel everybody knows about Jesus you may not believe Jesus but everybody knows about him so how can it be hidden the God of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe and if he didn't blind their minds then they would have received the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God but instead they serve themselves ultimately the spirit of Satan makes us the god of our own worlds what he does his spirit is he wants to be exalted as God he wants to set up high in the high places and be as God over the people as the Bible says but he also wants us to follow him he wants the people to be like he is and then if we have his Spirit then we exalt ourselves as gods of our own worlds so that now we become the center of everything that is in our lives instead of God we become the center the center when Jesus and it's says how can how can Satan be the God of this world when Jesus was tempted in the wilderness Satan offered him the kingdoms he offered them everything so how can you offer someone something that you don't have we see that he is the God of this world because he owns it it's his and now he has created his own Eden here on Earth where he is the God and he wants us to do the same he wants us to follow in his footsteps so he's this spirit is Lord or this spirit is I'm going to be Lord over my life I am going to be the ruler I am going to live my life for myself Genesis chapter 3 when they fell in the Garden of Eden Genesis 3:22 and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever so mankind is creating their own world with their own knowledge outside of God and they're beginning to trust now in their own merits in their own feelings in their own desires rather than trusting in God for everything and then he kicks them out of the Garden of Eden even in nature humans even in the in the natural world humans through their technology now they can change the hormones and and they can make their bodies different than something God has created mankind now has the ability to change the gender of a man or a woman this has never been the case how can this be it's because they're God over their own lives I don't care what God Made Me I don't care what God says I am going to do what I want to do and now we have we're able to use technology to do it Deuteronomy 22:5 says this a woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall the man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination to the Lord thy God a woman should not wear masculine clothes and a man should should not wear feminine clothes that's meant to separate the genders a woman should look like a lady a woman should look feminine and a man should look masculine you should be able to tell the difference otherwise the Bible says it's an Abomination it disgusts God they all wore a robe back then but those the sisters wore a feminine robe and and the brothers they wore a masculine robe there was a difference and you see if you saw a man wearing a woman's robe you'd say there's something wrong here and that's what he said he said I want this these genders separated but now we can even change our anatomy now it's beyond clothes a woman can dress up like a man and look like a man but now she can change to a man a man can change to a woman and it's all because of self-will I am here on this Earth to get my way I'm here to serve myself and that's what I want that's the extreme but we're all subject to that influence every one of us let's go back to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake Paul is saying that we are not preaching these things to serve ourselves and get our way the Amplified Bible says this for we preach not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord and our and ourselves merely as your bonder servants for jesus' sake so we're not preaching this to benefit ourselves in fact we're slaves for Jesus's sake it's the other way around the minister is preaching to get his way or to further his narrative like the politicians do and to prove that his doctrines are right then he's thinking of himself and not Christ there's so many ministers I do that but I ask have they had a true experience with God where they completely surrender to the word and they are willing to preach whatever the Bible says even if it disagrees with their way of thinking that's a question to ask for all of us that stand in this pulpit and all of everyone else that listens to the one standing in the in the pull pit again Paul's saying he's saying we're not preaching this to promote our own Ministries but in fact we're we become your slaves we lowering ourselves to serving you for the for the gospel of Christ's sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have it this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the of the power may be of God and not of us again it's not about me it's not about getting my way and these Earth and vessels you know what they are they're us they're human beings that all although unworthy they contain The Treasure of the Holy Spirit we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body these Earth and vessels then that power that raised Jesus from the dead will dwell within us and the Holy Spirit will dwell in these Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us so what does that mean it means that we need to surrender Our Lives brother and sisters to God to him remember in the Garden of Gethsemane came down to the end he could have walked away he knew that they were coming to get him and here he is bowing on his knees the man Jesus the man remember he was Flesh and Blood he was a human being and there he is and he's crying out to God and he's says Lord let this cup pass from me but thy will be done not my will that's a Christian that is the way we should be for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh what is that life of Jesus that life of Jesus is a surrender to God complete surrender Lord I don't even want to have opinion I just want what you want tell me Lord show me what you want and I want to fall in line but it's the hardest thing for a human being to do today there's life if we die to our own thinking if we die to our own stubbornness if we die to our own desires there is life so how can we have he's talking about that we die and then we live how can we have both death and life let me read that that scripture again for we which are which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake everybody dies from Adam until now everybody with the exception of Enoch and Elijah everyone has gone the way of death so he's saying here we all die that death that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our Mortal Mortal self so how can we have both life and death the last verse verse 12 answers it so then death worketh in us but life in you the life comes from the spirit of God death comes from the Mortal bodies we teach our children they watch us and we we show our children how to we want to get our way no matter what and then we teach our families to do that we teach our children to get your way in life I'm talking about everyone I'm not just talking about sexual immorality I'm talking about all of us that we spend our lives trying to get our ways rather than surrendering Our Lives to the desires of God for his will I really I use the example of changing your gender because it's so blaring but it's the same spirit all the way down in the churches all of us we are going to be the center of our world and we create this world around us where we are God and our opinion matters more than anything else you hear when when I'm witnessing to people you hear that oh I'm spiritual or I have something that you know you ask them do you know the Lord do you know God is there something in you that that wants to know God and then they they respond if you if you witness to a lot of people they respond that oh I'm spiritual or I have my own relation and what they're saying is that I I Am The Sinner of my world and I'll have a God in it as long as God does what I say as long as God listens to what I do what I say what I tell him to do then yeah God can come into my life otherwise I don't want God the exact opposite Psalm 81 says this verse 7 thou call callest in in trouble the Lord's speaking the anointing upon the psalmist thou callest in trouble and I delivered Thee I answered thee in the secret place of Thunder I proved thee By the Waters of meba Sila do you remember from our Wednesday night bible study what Sila means it means pause it means take it means take a moment and digest what you just read what you just heard here oh my people and I will testify unto thee oh Israel if thou will hearken unto me there shall be there shall no strange God be in thee if you listen to me neither shall thou worship any strange God I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill it but my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of me so I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts and they walked in their own counsel how true is that today we went through the Book of Judges and how Israel could was condemned because everyone did what was right in their own eyes they made their decision based on their own morality or their own understanding without dilig ently seeking God they lived in a world that pleased themselves rather than pleasing God verse 13 oh that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked in my ways I should have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries I would have come to help them if they would have just listened to me rather than doing it themselves the haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured forever he should have fed them also with the finest of Wheat and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee you missed the blessings of God because you wanted your way it's a shame I was talking with the kids on Friday night in the upper room and it was it was a smaller group of us so we we had a little bible study and uh Camila had on your phone you had your daily scripture and it was Matthew 28:19 go you into all the world and make disciples and I asked the group I said what does that mean why would you want to be a disciple what what what does that mean why would you want to be a disciple of this man Jesus how would that benefit anyone and and what does that even mean to be a disciple and come I think it was you that gave the the answer is that we all want to be identified with something we want to be identified through social media with this influencer or that in influencer and she said to be a disciple of Jesus is to be identified with him I thought that was really better than any answer I could have given and then it goes on and says to be baptized and we talked about what does it mean to be baptized and it's requirement that you are baptized in his name that you are no more your own person now you are taking on the name of God and you are no more your own person you surrender to God and you are making this public confession and that's what baptism is Lord I want to be with you I'm done Daniel Evans is finished now it's all the Lord after our discussion Hano and I had a chance to talk and and he asked he asked me when I was baptized and and just some some personal questions about my testimony and I told him I said well I said I gave my heart to the Lord on my 21st birthday I said I was a sinner I wasn't living right and I said said I I felt in my heart I felt condemned so I gave I made a commitment to the Lord and I gave my heart to him there but I didn't yet have the Holy Spirit that was a change in my life believe me that was the most pronounced change in my life that anyone has ever seen that that has seen me but has has known me but that wasn't it so time went on and H started asking about the Holy Spirit and and when that I receive that Holy Spirit and by this time it was just him and me talking and I said that there was a a time that I knew that I had received the Holy Ghost and and uh I don't know if Sister Yunis is back there but it was similar she gave a testimony one of our testimonies nights it was similar to that there was I was driving home from work it was late at night and there was something about this the the Lord was dealing with me and I knew I had completely surrendered to God and it was no more my own world it was no more I was closed off and I was the God of this world it was Lord I will do anything that you want I will preach I will say I will do anything that you want me to do because it's no more about me I want to surrender everything no matter what it is and now it's about you and I told him that was the moment that I knew that the Holy Spirit came into my life came into my heart and it wasn't that I spoke in tongues it wasn't that I even had an emotional response I wasn't crying there was nothing different about it other than I was sure I have the spirit of God in this vessel this Earth and vessel and that's how I know Lord whatever if I can just find your will whatever that will is whatever it takes I want to be that Stephen in the book of Acts he said he makes a statement he said you always he's talking to the Pharisees that are that are going to Stone him they cast him out of the city and they're standing there this man this young man named sa of Tarsus is there and they're going to kill this man and Stephen looks up and he says you always resist the Holy Ghost and it's because they want what they want themselves they want to be the god of their world it's like two Waring armies I am one Army you are one Army and God is the other Army and we're fighting against God it's our nature brothers and sisters don't say that you haven't been that way because you have you were born like that and we're fighting against God we want our way God wants his way and when two armies are fighting against each other and one Army is prevailing is overcoming the other Army there's this thing called surrender you raise up your hands and you give up and then you are under the control of that other Army that dominating Army that just won the battle that caused you to surrender you raise your hand say I give up raise the white flag say don't shoot anymore but imagine if you don't surrender imagine if the if the two armies against each other and this Army says we are going to fight to the last man we're not surrendering one after the other they fall and if you don't surrender you will be destroyed God is the prevailing Army I promise you Jehovah God has never lost a battle that's right if the people will put him first and not sin show me a place where they ever lost but when they sin is when they lose so us when we surrender then we come into the care of the other Army and we are completely subject to that other Army we lay down our arms we give up that other army takes in as a prisoner Paul said I am a prisoner of Christ not I'm going to rule my own world not I'm going to do it my way but now I become a prisoner of Christ Jeremiah the Lord sends him one day to see this Potter the Lord raises him up he says go over to this Potter's house and watch him work do you know what a Potter is when you have the clay and they have the thing that spins around and and the Potter takes the clay and he puts water on his hands and he starts forming this pot and he puts his hand in there and and makes makes this vessel and and then he takes it and and they he fires it well Jeremiah's watching this Potter God's with him he's saying watch what he's doing so he's watching this guy and the thing's spinning and he's forming this and there was a imperfection in the pot and the Potter sees it and he mashes it back up reforms it puts it back on the thing that spins around and starts forming it again then Jeremiah God tells Jeremiah he says behold the clay that is in the Potter's hands he said so are you in my hands he says see how I can recreate this thing that had blemishes that was messed up I can take it and I can reform it he says now go and tell the people what I said tell them this experience preach this sermon about this Potter so Jeremiah goes and he goes to the people and he preaches this sermon to the people Jeremiah 18:12 and the people respond to the prophet Jeremiah's sermon and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will do everyone do the imagination of his evil heart the NLT says don't waste your breath we will continue to live as we want to stubbornly following our own evil desires the enemy has the same purpose he's trying to get us to continue to follow along the way that we're doing and not surrender to God like this like this lump of clay there was a blemish and there's so many blemishes in me I see so many sins and I see so many things wrong with me and it's just like Lord all right here we go again Mash me up and for me I want to be that perfect vessel and he says I can do it God tells us I can do it just surrender to me I'll close with this man John the Baptist I believe he was the greatest of them all have pretty good reference in saying that is Jesus said the same thing this man John the Baptist it's a young man he was from the priesthood he goes in the wilderness as a young man and he is his whole desire and I can prove that John the Baptist more than anyone I have ever seen aside aside from the Lord Jesus wanted God's Will and it didn't matter what his will was John wanted God's will so he goes in the wilderness and he lives he comes out of the Wilderness and he starts preaching repentance and he starts preaching like hey you're not all that you need to repent and you need to come to this these Waters and be baptized for the remission of sins so he's preaching this and the lord gave him some Vision John 1 ver 25 and they asked him and said why baptizes thou then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias neither that Prophet John answered them saying I baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not he it is who after coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latched I am not worthy to un loose these things were done in bethabara Beyond Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world right there we see that John was the first Christian this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me this is the one I told you about this is the one that's coming after me who is far greater than me this is him and I knew him not but that he should be made made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water NLT says I didn't recognize him as the Messiah but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode on him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said okay so John's saying the one that sent me to baptize the one that gave me my commission this same one which was who was God this same one told John upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost so John had an experience before this happened he saw this in a vision or or however the Lord spoke to John and he said that this one that's coming this is the one that's not going to baptize you in water but he is going to baptize you with the holy spirit of God the same God that moved across the waters in Genesis chapter 1 that separated the light from the darkness that created light upon the Earth this Same Spirit is coming and it's not going to be water like I'm baptizing you with you're going to get baptized with that Spirit was John's old Ministry hisory look how important to John this is and I saw on bare record that this is the Son of God again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus John and Andrew now this was John's whole Commission in life this was everything thing to John this was his whole Ministry that we're talking about but John more than anyone else as I said John was not the god of his world John's world did not revolve around his ministry John was willing to give it up at any time for God he was willing to say I'm wrong he was willing to do anything this great man John the Baptist and I'm going to prove to you that he was willing to do that the musicians can come and get ready Luke 7: 19 this is after this is John's in prison now these people hated John he was thrown in prison they wanted his head and here he is and his disciples were come to him and John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying are thou he that should come or look we for another so John is asking he's saying hey I know I preached this message I know I did I I know I preach to you all of this stuff but I want to be right I could be wrong it was the most important thing to John the Baptist that he was right with God not that he was proven right not that he was the god of his world but that he was right with the father no one else mattered to John so he said hey can you just go ask him I know we had this experience I know I know I said all of this but this is so important just ask him am I right when the men were come to him they said John the Baptist has sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or should we look for another and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight then Jesus answered and said unto them go your way tell John what things that you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised the poor to the poor the gospel is pre preached preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me another translation says God blesses those who don't fall away because of me the Messiah requires a lot but God will bless those who when they hear the true gospel preached that they won't fall away until their own selfishness to their own Traditions but they will surrender to God and when the messengers of John were departed then Jesus began to talk to them to his people he began to speak unto the people concerning John and he says what went you out in the wilderness to see he said a reed shaken With the Wind many of these people that were there were baptized by John but what we went you out to see a mo a man clothed in soft rment behold they which are gorgeously appar which are gor gorgeously apparel and live delicately are in the king's courts but what went you out to see a prophet I say unto you much more than a Prophet this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face Malachi chapter 3 is quoting which shall prepare thy way before thee for I say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in in the kingdom is greater than he and all the people that heard him and all the publicans Justified God being baptized with the baptism of John but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves being not baptized of him they wanted their [Music] way and the Lord said where unto where unto then shall I liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you but you have not danced we have mourned to you but you have not wept for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine you say he ha the devil the son of man cometh eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man a wine bibber a friend of publicans and sinners they're calling Jesus worldly because he didn't line up with their religious world that they had created in their [Music] minds but wisdom is Justified of all our children you see John the Baptist he was willing to go before whoever it was and say I was wrong I was mistaken about my religion I was mistaken about the way I thought but do you see his heart he had a pure heart and he was right but the reason he was the greatest of them all is because he was was willing to Humble himself for God and he wasn't wrong he was very much right and I see that how many of us are willing to say you know what I may have been wrong about the way I believe I may have I may have have have thought wrongly about certain things about maybe some of my doctrines I could have been wrong well not me brother I'm sure about what I believe are you more sure than John the Baptist was when he looked across the river and said Behold the Lamb of God I think not we always have to be willing to Humble ourselves and say I am not the sinner of My Universe I am not the the god of my [Music] world the God of this world ultimately becomes ourselves brother and sisters we want our way and God you can be my God as long as you'll serve me that's the way of the world that's the attitude of the world but we should be falling down on our knees and crying say Lord I just want your will Jesus said he said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it it's going to be those that actually surrender to the the Lord those are going to be the ones that find it Jesus said many will come in that day and say have I not done many mighty works in your name have I not cast out devils in your name maybe healed the sick in your name have I not done all these things and Jesus will say depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you the Pharisees they look looked the part but the disciples they were these of the Pharisees thought there are these these worldly people that came out of the world that they had a tender heart brother Manny they would do anything Lord whatever it takes I'm going to do it I may have this bad past I may look this way and but Lord I just want to serve you I want to make it right with my colleague at work I'm willing to say I was wrong I'm willing to say I looked at people and I judged them wrong I condemned them and I'm the one that should be condemned as I said My Testimony with my wife we repented Lord we're sorry for complaining we have no right to complain you've done everything and we just we just want to be in your will and then look what he did he talk about a miracle right there sitting next to my wife was the one that knew the owner of the the company he says I'll take care of it he says you're my child that Potter that clay he says no I'll just REM mold it you're okay you're all right but I've done all this Lord I've messed up I I've sinned and I've I've I've made all these mistakes he's like it's all right just let me do it don't be the god of Your World let me be the god of your world and then he can remake us Bible says that we seek out our own salvation through fear and trembling am I saying that you should question what you believe yes I am go before God and ask him Lord am I right am I right in the way that I think I want to know you don't question him because you want to break the rules you don't question him because you want to sin you question him because you want to be right but God can't come into your world you need to come into His World that's the truth brother Josiah I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every prayer sit on my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire and all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him that same spirit is what I want to see in me all I want to see is Jesus Lord let that spirit that was in Christ Let It Shine forth from me sh through humility that he had hurt and self-inflicted pain and everything that I thought gained will lay before the holy consuming fire words of knowledge in his name Healing Hands that touch the lame but lay before the whole holy consuming fire all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus Shine Shing through me all I want to see oh all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus Shine through me and hear him say and hear him [Applause] say Well done my preious one oh well done well done my faithful [Music] brothers and sisters can you imagine John the Baptist he was struggling as I said the greatest the greatest of them all and there he was struggling Lord I just want to be right dear God let me just let me just be right you're the one that matters to [Music] me I can see why Lord let me be a John the Baptist I can see why he was so special in God's mind and he said when those two Messengers came back can you imagine how he felt when they said brother John the man that that was on the river that day that you said Behold the Lamb of God God that takes away the sins of the world that man he said to come back and tell you things that we saw he said to tell you that the sick were healed he said to tell you that the blind were given their sight he said to tell you that the that the the poor had the gospel preached to [Music] them Imagine John how was right I was right can you imagine how he felt in that song wasn't too long after that that they cut his head off because of his testimony can you imagine how he felt when he went up and he heard those words that Josiah just said well done a good and faithful one brothers and sisters if we could just surrender ourselves and not try to get our way in life if we can just search the Lord say Lord I'm willing to give up anything I don't care that's how I feel feel like Lord I'll preach whatever if it disagrees with something that I've said before Lord I'll preach what you lay on my heart for all all of us here there's a reason it says that you will work out your own salvation through fear and [Music] trembling not that you're going to rely on the pastor I'm like that Clay Pot constantly having to get rebuilt it's not that you're going to rely on any Prophet or anybody else you're going to rely on the one that did save save you you're going to rely on the perfect Lamb of God but you have to talk to him you have to know what he says and you have to be willing to forsake everything you have to be willing to say you know what I was wrong about this I was wrong about that you're not greater than John the Baptist and he did it and then it came right back around said no you were right but because you surrendered your life because you were willing to follow me come on in well done my good and faithful one all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me and hear him say Well done I [Music] preious [Music] one well done my faithful one all I want to see is is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus shining through me let's all stand G I [Music] Surrender I

while while they get get here in Tucson good friends from Brother Caleb Perez's Church there in New Mexico as you know I love brother Caleb very very much um we uh brother Jeremy um was texting me today brother Jeremy bagot and uh boy he had a fall um sister Roberta writes this she says please pray for brother Jeremy um he was playing and chasing the kids and he dislocated his finger and did something to his knee and he has that urgent care right now The Perils of having children uh um sister Roberta brother Jeremy I just talked to him when I walked out right before I walked out um his his finger when um when he started to fall he was running in between tables when he started to fall his his he grabbed something his finger got caught dislocated his finger and then his um he turned his knee and I think hit his leg and boy he showed it to me out here in the parking lot and it looked really bad so they went to Urgent Care and no broken bones everything is fine and he said he's going to be sore for a while he'll he'll miss a couple days of work but but everything's good with brother Jeremy um sister Rachel Gara she writes remember my grandchildren Asher and Chloe in prayer they have been fighting a bug thank you for your prayers from sister Rachel and um then uh sister Shirley has a has a praise report that she wanted to share and I'll I'll read it here she says I would like to give praise to God about two weeks ago I was going through a hard trial and was asking God to help me through the trial at the same time I was praying at the same time I was praying God showed someone what I was going through so they could pray for me God helped me through the trial God is so good I can't praise him enough I also thank God for Christians I like that part sister Shirley he can I like God I thank God for Christians that he can use when we are in need brothers and sisters we are a body that body is knit together and there are different parts of that body and each part is vitally important brother Jeremy was running around and he and he hid his his knee and his finger and all of a sudden that knee and that finger became the most important part of his body because it was in pain 1 Corinthians 12: 26 says when one member of the body suffers the entire body suffers and that's with sister Shirley she's giving praise that that the Lord used somebody else to help her and reveal that to that person at that same time that she was suffering and then they were able to pray about these things and worked it out amen doesn't it feel good to be in this battle with other Christians let's all stand and we'll go to prayer the that's the only two um prayer requests I have from sister Rachel and sister Roberta let's bow our heads and if you have a request upon your heart you can raise raise your hand and make it known to our Lord as our brother said this morning raising our hand is important God's looking down and he sees that raised hand and he can take that just like he could took he could take a couple fish and a couple small pieces of bread and he can multiply and fee 5,000 he can take a an uplifted hand and he can cure cancer he can change the world with just an uplifted hand our heavenly father you saw the hands and Lord You're word is a discerner of the thoughts intents and intents of the heart and the Bible says that you are the word so father you

nothing but the blood of Jesus Amen it's good to praise him yeah brothers and sisters can I have just a few minutes to talk about the word I um I'm just so blessed the Lord Jesus is so good to us let's let's bow our heads for just a moment father we invite your presence once again Lord that now that we have worshiped father and Lord as we read a little bit of your word and talk about your word I pray that you would also be with us tonight in Jesus name amen you can take your seats bu can I have that M there's something there is just there's something about praising the Lord that there there's really there's nothing like it we can we can preach the gospel and you can you can learn something but then there is a time also for worship and the lord loves to be worshiped and he loves to be worshiped through song and praise and and I mentioned this last night at our meeting and it's very important when we are listening to music whether it be in our car and our at home and our earbuds wherever it might be music was designed to worship and as you are listening to to the music that you're listening to or you're singing along you are worshiping and I ask you what are you worshiping as you're listening to the music and singing along the Lord has given us music and the devil so often he has taken music and he perverts it and he turns it into something that worships him and looks at him so brothers and sisters music is is vitally vitally important I gave that I talked about that last night and we had some visitors and uh there was there was three uh Mormon missionaries that were there and after our service they they wanted to talk and and we had a really nice conversation and uh the one that was kind of the leader in the group he said hey I wanted to tell you what you said about worship and about listening to music he said uh he said sir he said I fall short there he says I never thought about that and then both of the other ones these are good boys both of the other ones said the same thing I know I know I do too and we had it started a really nice conversation with them and I told them they they said well why are you why are you here what's your story and I gave a little bit of of my history and I said you know I said one of the biggest things with me was that I saw that there was many times preaching a narrative or preaching a what a church thinks rather than genuinely seeking God and seeking what he wants instead of just preaching what my church says or or what a certain book says but Lord what do you have for me to do what is right in my life and what would you like me to say and I said that's the reason I said I got I got really discouraged and as I was talking I knew who I was talking to as I was talking to these young men one of them he bowed his head and I could see that it was starting to get through and he knew what I was talking about the one he was like oh yeah yeah that's that's good and the other one took what I was saying and he applied it to his own life and he and he stopped talking and the other two would talk and this young man he he wouldn't he wouldn't say anything else and I could I could see that he applied this to the LDS church and how they are going out not necessarily to win souls but to win converts to their church and brothers and sisters we need to be careful that we are not doing the same thing we are not trying to win a convert to the Tucson Tabernacle or to anything else what we are trying to do is introduce someone to the Lord Jesus Christ that is the most important thing it's in every Epistle of the New Testament everyone without without exception that is the motive behind them and if if we truly have the Holy Spirit of God that is what we are going to do and many times that witness can come through just worship just songs sister Rachel I I heard secondhand a testimony that you gave how you had something on your heart was it you and then brother Josiah sang the song and it gave you the answer if that's true raise your hand it was a song didn't necessarily have to be the minister up here reading the Bible and breaking down the Scriptures it was music it was praise it was it was adoration to the Lord Jesus and it gave an answer we should always have such high expectation of what the Lord can do in a worship service come expecting it's not just oh this person I like this person singing or or I like the way that this sister plays the piano or the brother on the guitar or whatever it is no I want to come and I Lord I Want To Praise You I Want To Worship you and that was what our meeting was about last night that Lord we just want to praise you we can set aside any differences or any doctrines they don't matter anyways what matters is that we know our Lord and we know our Savior Jesus Christ there's a story about a king in the Bible his name is Jehoshaphat and we all know the famous story of Jehoshaphat and Ahab and Ahab brought 400 prophets to Jehoshaphat he asked he said have you josaphat asked him he said would you like to go to war with us and and or Ahab asked josph that and josph had respond and said hey we're brothers I'm Jud and you're Israel we were once perfectly together we're still Brothers yes but let's seek the Lord's will on this and Ahab says I have 400 men of God prophets of god let's bring them down there and they were all in one Accord but there was something about this man Jehoshaphat it's it didn't seem quite right he says don't you have just one more and then there was mcka mcka J Ahab hated him and he said go on up go to battle but if you return at all God didn't speak to me prophesied of the death of this King and I always wondered they went to battle I always wondered why did josa go why did he why did he go and fight with this man Ahab and they went to battle and you know the story Ahab got killed in the battle he was shot an Archer just pulls up and shoots wasn't even aiming at anything and there Arrow comes down and goes in between a and ahab's armor and kills him I always wondered why did he go to battle but maybe the question is why didn't I read the next chapter the Bible's wonderful so what happened was josaphat went back home went back came back home safely got out of the battle and he probably thought he was doing pretty good and then a prophet came to Jehoshaphat and he says something very strange to him he says he says should you help the ungodly and love them that hate the Lord therefore is right wrath upon thee from before the Lord 2 Chronicles chapter 19 says that so then Jehoshaphat he gets this word from this prophet and he says we got to do something about this so he goes and he starts what we would call in today's in today's U vernacular in today's language he goes and he starts preaching the gospel across Judah and he starts encouraging the people to get closer to the Lord come out of the world get closer to the Lord and and let's let's put our lives behind God loving the Lord then after he did that he hears word that there were armies forming against him and against Judah these were not just armies these were overwhelmingly powerful armies and there's no way that Judah could ever survive this Jehoshaphat doesn't know what to do and he says to the people he says fast and pray he says brothers and sisters we are about to lose our kingdom we're about to lose our homes this Army that is is coming out of inti brother Li I believe it's it's uh it's southeast of Jerusalem this Army that's forming down there is is massive and it's going to come against us and we have nothing to do we need God people start praying and then a very unlikely Source gave a prophecy from god let's turn to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 verse 15 in this man that gave the prophecy it wasn't a king it wasn't the prophet that had just spoken this man named juu this was a different man you know who it was it was a song leader it was a worship leader that gave this prophecy this was a man who was filled with the holy spirit that loved the Lord and then God came down through this worship leader and says these words 2 Chronicles chapter 20 we'll start with verse 15 and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but is God's tomorrow go ye down against them remember this is this is an unconquerable army that's coming against them they had no chance but he says go down against them behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeru you shall not need to fight in this battle I'm in 2 Chronicles 20: 17 now ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you when you love to hear a prophecy like that oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the coites and the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high they were worshiping they were praising the Lord the battle hadn't even started yet and they were already praising the Lord for the victory because they had word from God and they Rose early in the morning and they went forth forth Into the Wilderness of tocoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe as prophets and so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that should that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever so Jehoshaphat this great king this great warrior he receives word that the battle is the Lord's and it's not yours and brother he sends out not The Archers not the calvary not the footman he sends out the piano player he sends out the guitar player he sends out the singer he sends out the symbol player and he sends them before these great warriors and they start praising the Lord and they start singing and you got to wonder what these Warriors thought wow these little guys and here they go out before this Army that was before them and they're singing and they're praising just like we were doing today sister hope we're singing We're praising we're loving the Lord and that's what they're doing they're out there just thanking God singing how important is it to praise him to love him and to sing praises to Him and they go they go down and what they didn't know is over here the Lord had ordained another Army that nobody knew about it wasn't from Judah it wasn't from Israel it was for someone else and then this Army comes out and starts fighting with this other Army and here's the singers and they're praising and they're singing and they're playing and they're going and they're fighting and killing each other all these other people and then once they're done then the army that I was just talking about this big one then they get all scared and they start fighting each other and every man every Warrior was killed so here comes the army of Jerusalem they come down and all they see is dead bodies they don't see there's not a there's nobody to fight and it's because the worshippers went forward if the musicians could get ready and what I want to do is I want to give us a little taste of we what we had last night with our musicians and and playing and singing and that's what happened here is the worshippers went out and and as I said don't ever underestimate the power of worship worship it's wonderful when things get hard I Praise Him amen when things when I get all turned around when I get sick I praise and brother Jeremy back at this when when I talked to him before I came out here he was praising God not because he got hurt but he was praising God that that the Lord protected him and can you imagine how the worshippers they go out before the before the the Army and they're praising and here comes the Army and you know what happened even if you couldn't sing you started praising you started singing you started praising you started thanking God for his goodness and that same God that was back there with the King Jehoshaphat is the same God that is here and he is the same one that we worship today that's right bring him out of History yes sir Lord you are alive you're great you're wonderful you are the almighty God and you have already won the battle amen you won the battle brother ly he won the battle on the cross that battle there was no more battles after that he went on this cross and he died and he destroyed death hell in the grave and then he raised up in the power of the Resurrection in the power of the Holy Spirit and then it's so wonderful that my sins were forgiven that day but you know what he promised he promised oh yeah and by the way that same spirit that Rose Jesus Christ from the grave in Acts chapter 2 is the same spirit that is promised to us amen so we praise him for it praise the Lord amen he is wonderful it's the same Spirit The Same Spirit that was with Jehoshaphat The Same Spirit that was with Paul and Silas when they started singing and the the gates of of the prison threw open and they walked out it's the same God and it's he can be contacted through praise amen amen so we're going to sing [Music] praise a prais in the valley all praise on the mountain all

glor y ever till my rur soul shall find rest beyond the r amen how many's ready for just a little bit of rest right it's not a it's not a rest from from fighting where we got to go back to fighting it's a rest it's a true rest and I I really believe that when you when you find your place in the Lord you find a place of rest it doesn't mean it's not hard right it doesn't mean it's not a battle but I rest in his ability to win that battle amen and that's there's but I believe this song's talking about a rest that I don't know if we've experienced yet we were talking about that brother that maybe going on he's about to experience some real rest real rest got to lay down the weapons don't have to pick them up no more I look forward to that but we're here and we got a battle how many's how many still fighting how many is tired of fighting I'll raise my hand but we got the Lord on our side amen and right when I right when I fail right when I drop the sword he picks it up amen he picks it up he picks me up and he carries me forward it's not a it's not a cliche it's not a metaphor for it's not a nice thing it's the truth yes it's what the Lord does for us he goes ahead and fights our battle for us we just need to we just need a claim it this morning amen I just appreciate the the song service appreciate the worship and I can't sing but I certainly like singing with the musicians here we appreciate them we appreciate brother Dan as always for just his friendship and his um his kindness and his invitation to to stand behind the pulpit that is um he has responsibility over and we don't take that lightly we always want to fall into the channel That the the pastor is in the spirit that the pastor is in so that it's a blessing to the people amen you don't want to come in and say something that that would go against anything but we want to just say what God has to say amen and so I just always want to uh to look at it that way and to to Really Just Surrender I pray that you would surrender too yourself to the Lord this morning um you know it doesn't do much good for a speaker to surrender if the ears aren't surrendered to wow you know a a speaker could be surrendered and and and Words of Life could flow forth not from me but from the Lord and if your ears aren't surrendered and your hearts are not surrendered um it'll be like seed that just fell on Stony ground and I know we get hard and I know we get thorny right but let's just let's just uh let's do a little plowing this morning even if it's right now in your mind just say Lord I came here with with uh with an argument I came here maybe I got in a little uh you know nobody been married has ever been in argument before maybe you gotten a little uh uh fight on the way to church or maybe you just have a battle going on maybe you just pray to the Lord right now Lord just set that aside I want to hear from you this morning and and I I trust that he will help you do that how many is looking forward to hearing from the Lord this morning amen that's the only thing that's going to do us any good my word's going to fail brother Dan I could say this I know what you you know what I mean your word's going to fail it's going to fail but we we we have the reason why you gather here this morning is because we have a word that does not fail and that's the one we want to hear this morning let's let's read a scripture I kept you standing um a scripture I think it's really familiar but um I'm going to read it anyways if if you would Ephesians 4 11 um a lot of what we believe is based upon the scripture I've heard it quoted uh my whole life and uh I'm not going to bring anything new to it but I'd like the Lord maybe just to open up uh an standing if we could this morning Ephesians 41 when you have it say Amen should be familiar to us he says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now just something to point out if he's telling in the scripture that he gave some these things he must be talking to those that He gave it to he's not talking to the apostles he's not speaking to these prophets and these evangelists he's telling you the Church of God that he's given you these things for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry you know if you want to be in the ministry it's not an easy path it's work the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ that word edifying means uh maybe you know this but it means to build it means to actually construct and to build up so the ministry the fivefold ministry as we call it has been given to build or construct God a body for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the building the construction of the body of Christ dropping down to 16 For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto same word the construction or the building of of itself in love dropping down to verse 29 he says let know now listen who is he talking to all right he gets a you get A+ A+ he's talking to you and he's talking to me he gave you and I a Ministry can we say Amen to that he gave you and I something that would help build us into a body that he would be pleased with and now he's going to give us more he says now you that I'm talking to he says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of same word building and constructing that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to approach your word and your throne now Lord not not with any preconceived notion Lord not with any thoughts of our own we just want to open your word have you give us an understanding of it Lord may you just take these these words of a man Lord that are are are fallible and will fail Lord and may you strengthen and turn them into your word Lord may your spirit just come and speak to any Heart Lord that is wanting to hear from you this morning that's pulling that's in expectation Lord I believe that you've bound yourself Lord to meet that expectation and that's what we trust on this morning Lord we ask you just come and talk to us now Lord out of your Bible in Jesus name amen you may be seated uh might be a strange scripture to start with we all kind of know that scripture but uh I I I just like that thought of the of the ministry and really what the purpose of that Ministry was given for is to build a house and uh I'll get on that here in a minute I want to read another scripture it's okay I got I got a few scriptures to read if you don't mind uh I hope it's still okay that we turn in our Bibles and read some scriptures right that hasn't gotten too old uh 2 Corinthians 4: 8 um it's a a couple scriptures here I'll try to go fast um I don't want to take too much time this morning but I want to give all time to the Lord and also be considered of you all here I want set a uh uh set myself a little timer just so I have something to ignore when it goes off rather down so but I could I can say that I tried no I really want to to try to to try to be uh uh graceful with the time you've given me this morning Ephesians second I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 4:8 it says we are troubled it's still talking to us we are troubled on every side oh amen right I can say Amen to that one I feel troubled on every side sometimes yet we are not distressed we are perplexed but we are not in despair persecuted how many fell persecuted all right we got a couple pers persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down on but not destroyed yes sometimes we're cast down by Family sometimes we're cast down by work by our jobs by our own selves amen cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body we're talking about a body being built a body being constructed and we want more than anything I believe that you're on the same page with me we want more than anything to see the life of the Lord Jesus being made manifest in that body there's no point in constructing a home anybody that's in construction there's no point in building a home and putting the nice furnishings and and finishes on it if nobody's going to live in that house right if it's just going to sit there empty what was the point of doing all that work for which for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh I want to drop down to uh verse 17 it says for our light Affliction We Were cast down we're persecuted we're attacked on every side and yet the Bible says I know that you are but that's light Affliction for is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and I love this verse it says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal and the first verse of the next chapter flows right from that it says for we know if our Earth House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens I'm going to read you something I I I I I know it's okay to read a quote I want to start off with this if you don't mind it says more and more I am made to believe that people are not getting to christow you say you start off on a negative well just just wait now I am here to help in every way that I can and make my statement as clear as I know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as I look and I preach Across the Nation and watch the people I am fully persuaded the prophet of God says that the people are not getting to Christ and I believe that it's the enemy that's throwed this hindrance and the reason I believe this is because he talking about the Lord is not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a Dogma or a Doctrine or a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ the word and I that's why I think that people are resting their Eternal destination upon some Dogma or some sensation like some say I danced in the spirit I spoke with tongues I felt fire run over me and you know that all those things can be impersonated by the devil wow now does it mean those things are wrong no no it doesn't mean they're wrong it means they are something that can be impersonated it doesn't mean that they're not there isn't a genuine out there I think that we're taught by the word that if you see a counterfeit dollar bill are you following me yeah if you see a counterfeit dollar bill that's the best sign that there's a real dollar bill out there right you can't make a counterfeit of something that doesn't exists or something that's not real the best sign that there is a real experience that there is real emotion with God is that there's an impersonation of that emotion but he's trying to get a point across to us that we are not to look at those things as evidence that we are doing the right thing they are a benefit they are a maybe the word is they are a bonus they are a thing that is good when the Lord allows it to happen but it does not mean the Lord is with you if they do happen I know that sounds a little bit backwards but that's exact sometimes we're taught if you're not doing these things you don't have the Lord if you're not dancing you know and I hear both sides of it if you're not dancing in the spirit well the Lord's not in your service and then I hear the other side but but also if you're not being still and listening to the Small Voice well then the Lord's not in your service and I think I I think we're looking at the wrong things sometimes and I really like to talk to you this morning if the Lord permit about a change in perspective a change in our point of view you know sometimes we just have the point of view I have the point of view that I'm attacked at all sides and I forget that I haven't been defeated I just look at the one perspective and I think okay I see that I'm being attacked but I failed to have the perspective that wait a minute I'm still standing wait a minute I haven't been defeated I fell down I got beat I'm on my knees but I'm still alive I I haven't been conquered yet why is that Lord but I'm just concentrating sometimes on the hard thing that's happening to me oh Lord I'm going through a trial and then another trial comes and another trial comes and another trial you know he allows every single one of those trials that not one thing if you're a child of God how many how many is a child of God I just want to make sure okay good that was that was like 99.9% that that's pretty good there's 100 I will say it's 100 that if you're a child of God that not one trial can come upon you that the Lord hasn't said yes I'm going I'm going to let that happen you can touch this but you can't touch this you can affect this part of that sister's life but you can't touch this part that brother who's going through this I'm going to let you let him go through that I'm goingon let you Satan uh have a shot at him but you can't take his life where do we find that we find that in job if you're going through and job just didn't go through one trial he went through it was uh One messenger comes in oh your all your children are dead another messenger comes in all your herds are dead another messenger comes in oh this and then all of a sudden he's sick and then his wife comes it's it was literally trial after trial after trial and sometimes I feel like I'm just in I'm I'm going well it's going good and then there's sometimes it's just like it's it's hit after hit after hit after hit but it's but it's a perspective that God is trying to get me to see he said there's one thing that he cannot impersonate and that's the word he says in a debate between him and Jesus each time Jesus defeated him he said it is written the word and I believe today that the reason people are not coming to Christ is because they are appointed to a denomination come on you say well wait a minute we we're appointed to a denomination we're not in the Lutheran Church we're not in the Catholic church if you're not being pointed to the one who's going to inhabit the house that is being built you're being pointed in the wrong direction I I I want to just say this and I hope you get what I mean but if you're being pointed to the ones who were who were building the house they're not the important ones if I could just say that again there is a Ministry given and the job of the ministry is to build a house anybody ever moved into a house that should be an easy one all right do you know who built it now maybe you built it but if you don't if you didn't build it do you know who who built it have you ever met them would you move into the house anyways yes because who built the house doesn't necessarily matter what matters is that you are moving into that house and I think sometimes so much focus is put on the ministry because they but they are actually just put there to help build a house what really matters what really we need to be poed to is who is going to come inside that house and inhabit it who is going to come and make that house a home is it going to be the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ slain for us or is it going to be the spirit of the Builder who built the house I know that's I know maybe that's a confusing question but I think sometimes according to what I'm reading we're being pointed to the wrong thing we're being pointed to that person or or somebody who may have just been appointed by God to preach one message and that one message maybe just put on the trim around the side of the house that's all they were there for maybe this is a last message I'll ever preach and maybe it was just to like move some dirt up around the house and just smooth it out maybe that's the only purpose I've had but guess what God is using that and other Ministries to build a house what's really important is you because you're the house that is being built you're the house that's being built he cares about the house because that's what he's going to come and live in it's not that he doesn't care about the ministry he doesn't care about Apostles and Prophets of course but they are his workmen to really build the thing that he cares about which is you that's a point of view that God wants to get across to us that maybe you are focused on the one building you and not focused on the one who's going to come and live in you and it's important Ministry is important I'm not diminishing the ministry but really they're the servants that build the house you he say that many times they're pointed to a denomination you come to our church this is his in quotations you come to join our church or you read our catechism or you believe our Doctrine anybody ever hear that in the message yes sir yes they are pointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without Christ proves in their own life is vindicating that very thing the ministry is given to help build the construction of the house that's it not to come and live in the house not to be the lord of the house not to rule over the house to help build the house how do they do that by looking into the word by the way we should be I can I can say this because I'm also a sheep I'm not a pastor I I could say this as a sheep I need to be looking into the same exact word that the pastor's looking into I need to be reading exactly the same Bible that he's reading because how am I supposed to know if what he's feeding me is sheet food if I don't know what sheet food is right now I tell you I've been guilty of eating food served to me that I didn't know what it was and it wasn't the fault of the person feeding me it was my fault because I didn't go look at what I was being fed I just accepted it and said oh well it's coming from the ministry building the house it must be good that's not good enough you have to make sure that the material being used to build you is from God does that make sense preaching the gospel is not just standing behind a Pulpit and preaching the word he says that the gospel did not come to us in word only but in power and demonstrations of the holy spirit so to me it's not just somebody who can who can preach well or speak well it's somebody when you look at their life when they're not standing behind this Pulpit that their life actually preaches louder than the words that they're saying that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit what does that mean in signs and wonders no no the fruit of that spirit is evident in their life that's somebody you can say okay you can come and work on this house because this house can can everybody just say this house this house is a house of God this house needs to be built up to God would be pleased to come and dwell in it and so it's important that you as the house look at what you're being built with and who is building you I hope that I hope that that's okay to put that responsibility on you it is important brother Dan it's it's actually one of the most important things you you can do and and the the beautiful part is that if the ministry is operating properly it's not building the house of God according to their ideas according to their specifications you know I have a a part of my job um this is going to be a little bit boring so you just bear with me part of part of my job is is is a little bit boring it's like I just stare at uh plans blueprints all day it's it's it's that boring that reaction you had is exactly how boring it is it's just you stare at plans all day and it's just 2D images sometimes they're graceful and they give you like a roughly 3D but you just stare at them and I I I hope this analogy makes sense cuz this this is how I think of things you know if I'm reading that plan and and and and there's a there's so much information on that plan that you actually can't fit it all on one page okay so you get even just a simple house let alone a building like this but a simple house might be might be 15 20 pages and if I'm staring at that page and it tells me I'm going somewhere with this it tells me that that a wall belongs right here okay it tells me about this wall and I look at that that wall and it says okay you need to build a wall right there it tells you where it goes and you take off you have the blueprint you've read in your Bible it says resist the devil and he will flee from you you say okay I'm going to go and I'm going to Build That Wall and you go to Build That Wall you immediately are going to have questions if you if you know what you're doing you're going to say well wait a minute um I can't see from a top down view how tall that wall is what if I only build the wall this High what if I build it too high and now it's sticking out into the weather what do you need you have to go and find in the blueprint that information and listen I I know this is a stretch but you cannot do that if you just want to see things from your perspective wow you have to go back into the blueprint and you have to search and first of all to even do this okay to even do this let's put on our spiritual cap we're not we're not building a physical house let's put on our spiritual think cap to even do this you have to first say I don't have all the information and right there gets about 90% of Christians today I don't have all of what I need to do this job instead a lot of Christians and I've been guilty this oh I know it because I've read the Bible and I've listened to the message I know what it is I need to know and I know that this brother or so and so is telling me something else but you know what I really know what the truth is I know what it is I've had something revealed to me and no doubt we've had things revealed but it just so happen happens that someone else might have that other page that you need to look on to see how tall that wall is and God will do that on purpose just to see if you'll go and seek out that information just to go and see if you will be willing to look at something from somebody else's perspective and I think maybe I was speaking here before and I think I did this uh maybe not but I think it's a great uh example if I were to say um Joe well let's see I'm want to pick on somebody who can I pick on Daniel I like that you got volunteered I I I didn't I I didn't plan on saying this you just forgive me but brother Daniel I think I picked on brother Aaron before what is the what's the front of this Pulpit look like it's a cross brother Dan do you see a cross I don't you think brother you I love brother Daniel yeah but he's he's off the word not right he's off the word if if only I could get him the revelation of what I see if only I could get you the Revelation that there isn't a cross on there there's like a door there's a light there's a Bible you don't see any of that uh you just need to come up a little higher brother you just right you just anybody hear that phrase you just need to oh you just need a little bit more Revelation you need to come up a little bit higher you need to come and stand where I'm standing and yet he has a perfectly and so to everybody here a perfectly truthful view of what the front of this Pulpit looks like and yes do I have a view that maybe you don't see but who needs to be willing to say you know what I'm going to go and I'm going to see exactly what it is you're talking about oh there is a cross right there oh you know what the Bible does say that oh you know what when when the prophet of God said this maybe he really did mean this but the the thing is is I haven't walked if I'm not willing to walk a mile in your shoes that right out of the word I better be able to to walk a mile in your shoes and then maybe I'll see where you're coming from cuz maybe you went through something brother Daniel that put you in that position right there where you're sitting where that view of the word now the word isn't just four sides the word is eternal but let's just say this is the word your view of the word was shaped by your experience that put you right in that chair and because I haven't been through that experience this is so simple so I know I I know you can't miss this it's so simple but your experence put you right there and if I'm not willing to see something from another perspective there is no possible way I could know the word of God and then there's no possible way my house can be built properly anybody ever live in a house that's just a 2d wall nobody right nobody if if a Builder turn you over that your your house is complete it's beautiful and you open the door and you just step into the Earth on the other side nobody will accept the house right but somehow I think sometimes we're we're the devil it's really a trick of the devil to to to make us satisfied with one view of the word of God wow one view of the word of God just one vision of it and oh I know the whole thing look at it's it's 20 feet tall how deep is it well don't worry about that right now it's 20 feet tall and it's got windows and it's doors it's a beautiful house but but if you step around just a little bit not you have not even much just a little bit oh there's no side to the house there's no inside there's no roof I couldn't see that from where I'm at I and again this is so simplistic but I think that we I think and I know that we do this sometimes just as individuals and we do it as a church as well because uh generally a church is a collective of people who think the same way and so but as individuals I think we we really limit how much of the word of God we can experience by not taking in somebody else's experience by not taking in a perspective of somebody else and you you you you you go try to Build That Wall and you just how wide is it how tall is it what's on the other side of it is it painted is it dry well what it you don't know because all you have is the information now you can go back to the blueprint and you can check it but but but the Lord is so good he's been taking that same blueprint and he's been showing somebody else that page of the plan now if you want to say well I want to know everything first of all that's not how God works God's going to put you in a if if you won't if I will not willingly I'm just tell you how the Lord works and it's it's it sounds harsh but it's the most beautiful thing he does if I am not willing to go sit where brother Daniel's sitting and see that perspective of the word the Lord will cause or allow a trial to come wow for my benefit that puts me in that position so then I can look up and see exact actly what it is I needed to see you say oh trials are hard yes there's trials and yet we're not dismayed we're in a fight and yet we're not defeated we're in those things because God is saying I want you to look at me in a different light I I I don't care if you've been a Christian for 10 days or 10 years you have not seen all there is of God Amen and and I I I would go to far as to say if we ever ever ever get in the position spiritually in our mind where we think we've seen all of God I would say that's that's about as close to blasphemy as you could get because BL because God is eternal and you can never see every side of him he always if you don't take anything else take this he always has A New Perspective for you to see him in even after he takes you and I go and I he puts me through a trial and I'm sitting where brother Daniel's sitting and I see that guess what there's another side over here there's another side from here there's another side from here and it's an eternal word we're talking about a four-sided Pulpit it's an eternal word of God wow and you can come back to the blueprint we know that but it's really God wanted to show a different perspective you know um the prophet of God I'm I'm going to keep moving I hope I didn't take too long with that but he says there's two places where two different men are speaking of justification let's just take it back to the Bible now if if you if you want to believe what I'm telling you that's good but let's go right to the Bible and we'll find it two different men speaking of justification one of them was Paul one was Peter Peter was justifying Abraham I'm sorry Paul was justifying Abraham by his faith talked about Abraham talked about his faith Peter however was justifying Abraham by his works now you might be in the Paul side of things and this is what the devil wants us to do okay are you for Paul or are you for Peter that's right and you know brother Dan he's not exactly for Paul he's more of a Peter guy but I kind of see Paul so how about I just start another church I'm just going to say the way it is I'm going to start another church and anybody that likes Peter more hey we preach Peter over here we preach Peter now we like Paul but but Peter it's about works and then let me show you all the quotes that I have about works and then I can back up what I'm telling you and pretty soon I have you convinced that my perspective is the right one wow but if we look at the full thing he says Paul said he was justified by faith Peter by works now they did not contradict one another right out of the message they were looking at it from two different viewpoints Paul was speaking of Abraham's Faith that's what God saw in Abraham and Peter was talking about his works now listen we believe in works but yet we also believe that you can't do enough works to be good enough to go it's almost a paradox right we believe in faith and yet the Bible says without works your faith is dead and and and the and the and the word explains it very simply your faith is what God looks at and the works of your faith is what men look at did we catch that because I can tell you brother Josiah all day what my faith is but you're looking at what I do you're looking at what I say you're looking at how I act you're looking at How I Live you're looking at how I speak you're looking at how I treat somebody I disagree with and somebody I don't disagree with you're not listening to me talk about my faith to you you're looking at my life and what I'm doing and God is exactly the opposite you can tell God oh God I prayed to to you oh God I love everybody God I do this and God's looking just at your faith what does your faith produce he's not looking at your works because anything good that you have done he did it what he's he's looking at your faith you can tell God all day what you're going to do but God's looking at your faith and that's such a simple explanation of that but but if you have the mentality if you have a spirit really upon you that does not allow you to see A New Perspective you'll start to pick side es inside of a Bible that we say we all believe in you're not even picking sides between Pharisees and the disciples anymore you're picking sides inside of disciples and pretty soon you'll pick sides with something Jesus said against something else Jesus said somebody will send a scripture to somebody and somebody else will send a scripture back oh well he also said this and all of a sudden we got Bible fighting Bible I don't need to go into quotes cuz we we know that already quotes fighting quotes it's it's a mess what has happened is we're not getting to Christ we're being pointed to denominational thinking which denominational thinking is really simple it's it's it's thinking that divides us that's really the simple breakdown of it and and he says here and Peter was talking about what man saw because man had Faith he'll act like it his life will show it to others I just want to finish that quote off uh Moses needed a new perspective you know Moses had seen God in a burning bush I would like a physical burning bush experience I would love to see a physical burning bush experience but then God comes to him again and it says later on that God spoke to him face to face so he gets one perspective of God and God is you know what Moses there's more to me than that there's more to me than just that I'm going to speak to you face to face and then Moses gets to a point he says Lord I've seen you in the burning bush I've spoke to you face to face but would you just Show Me Your Glory and he gets he and the Lord says I'll put you in the Clift of rock and he walks by and he says at the backside of the man that's not a perspective Moses expected he thought he was going to see something glorious and God gave him a perspective he never would have thought he was going to see but it was God saying I have so much to show you you just need to want to see it oh you say oh I want to see it I want to see it brother Daniel might have that perspective that I have for for you well I don't know if I want to see that anymore Lord show me another view of your word I'm going to put you together with this sister of this brother over here Lord show me a perspective of your word I I was trying to I was putting together with this brother and sister over here Lord show me a new perspective of your word and he's trying to and because of my stubbornness because of my uh my thinking that I know everything or maybe that I know more than that sister does or that brother does I don't go and view it from their persp perspective and you know what God's going to do from his mercy and Grace he's going to knock me down until I'll look at it from the point of you that I've been begging him to let me look at it from and and that's harsh that's that sounds like a cruel God he's not cruel he's not cruel he saves us from ourself it's not just from Satan right he saves us from oursel that's true he he he saved us from Satan 2,000 years ago really before the foundation of the world but today it's work he has to save us from oursel every single day that's true I want to keep keep moving here uh uh uh time is going all right I I want to I want to there's something I always have believed and I just talk to you from my heart if that's okay um I don't believe that we should shape oursel according to the world would you agree with that okay um I don't believe that we should spend time looking at the world's doing or getting into the things of the world would you agree with that okay however I do think it's very valuable to see what is happening in the world to pay attention to what is happening in the world because that is a perspective that God is giving you to tell you the spirits that you see attacking the world are the spirits that are attacking you if you want a Viewpoint if you want a window into what you are going to be battling today or tomorrow or next week you need to look at what what's going on in the the world and that's where it's working that's where the spirit has won and it's taken control and that's the spirit you're going to be battling you say well I don't think that we're battling in the world oh let's let's just talk about it um the first the world is so divided right now and angry at one another right well at least America is everybody hates each other everybody's fighting everybody's split into politics or this issue or this issue doesn't it sound a lot like some of the churches sometime yeah maybe oh you saying oh it's we're not split into politics uh you haven't been in church very long sometimes it's politics or maybe it's just a Viewpoint of of the Bible or Viewpoint of the message or Viewpoint of this doct Viewpoint of this and all of a sudden in our church and in our belief we're just divided divided divided divided divided divided because you can see out in the world where it works and we battle that and that is the spirit we're battling and and and I'm going to go as far as even say this you know maybe the spirit that that right now is attacking our nation with with men who don't know that they're men and women that don't know they women you say I don't struggle with that issue but yet as a church spiritually sometimes we struggle with that issue we're not in our place we don't know who we are we don't know who we are that's comes right out of the message we don't know sometimes who we are there is an identity crisis I believe in the Believers today that we don't know who we are and all you see when you look at into the world and you see somebody who's confused about who they are that's where that spirit's working in the physical but in the spiritual we're being attacked by that or maybe you're not being attacked by that but I'm being attacked by that it's identity it's it's literally an identity crisis and it's all through the Bible when they take when they take Daniel and the Hebrew children and they take them over and they capture them and they're and they're living with foreigners they're living in the world the first thing that they try to do is get them to forget who they are wow they say we're going to change your names to these different names physical you say well we have the same name we've always had okay then they'll try then the second thing they did was try to change their diet physically how about spiritually you know what it's okay it's okay maybe just let brother Dan read the Bible and listen to the tapes and you just listen to what brother Dan says now I know brother Dan's not telling you that but I believe that spirit's attack that will tell you you know what you don't need to dig into that word for yourself just take whatever the the they're building the house just sit back and relax and let the house be built that's a spirit that's trying to take away your identity and I Know a Man LED from God I know brother Dan's LED from God because I think he'll be the first person to tell you you go get in that Bible you go pick up that bible you hit your knees you you read a message you read you read a scripture you do that so that when he comes out here and starts preaching you're like oh yeah I read that I know what that's about I know exactly where he said that oh you know what I hadn't heard that before but when I take what you just said and I take it with what I know I got a fresh new perspective right now CU it's just as dangerous for me to only have the perspective I of one Minister as it is just to have my own we are a we are a multi membered body which means think about it now we have every advantage over the devil we have every advantage over the devil because we have your perspective brother your perspective sister your perspective sister your your experience you've been through there's not something that the devil can attack you with that somebody in here hasn't gone through or is going through or you know the Lord brought me through that just come and talk to me a little bit and I'll tell you how he got me through that trial but if you want to sit over there by yourself and I don't know how I'm going to make it I don't know how I'm be delivered it's the devil forcing you to look at things just through your eyes but yet seek out somebody else you know what brother I I hate to bring this up but I know maybe you struggle with drinking how did you overcome that oh this is exactly how I overcame it now I don't know if this is going to work for you but here's how that Pulpit looks like from my point of view and I'll tell tell you what the word of God works like this if he did it one way for one person he'll do it same way for you but what you have to do is you have to go seek out how he did it for that person which takes you and I this is the hard part saying I don't know and that's like some of the hardest words is I don't know and I'm wrong and yet that is what God is asking of his people that's I don't have it with me but I I there is a quote that says that he wants you and I to say I am wrong because then only then can he actually teach you yes he's trying to do the same thing to us he's trying to get us to feed on I'm sorry but there's uh this may be unpopular opinion there's no good news I don't care if it's Fox News or CNN or this other website it's all the same thing I'm sorry there's no good political party I I I'm sorry there just isn't one yeah is there one that might be better than the other it's the it's the it's two sides of the same coin the goal is to bring down anybody who is a God's child there is no middle ground there is the seed of God and everything else there is no neutral party there is there are people that are certainly nice and kind but if they're not a seed of God they are against you that's a that's my perspective you don't have to accept that and you say well that sounds pretty cynical it's it's it's not cynical it's be guarded be guarded against yeah you you said it yesterday brother Dan you know we we are not looking at sometimes what God is doing today but we certainly look at what the devil is doing to us today that's a trick of the devil to keep your focus on his perspective oh he doesn't have control of me all he has to do is introduce a little bit of bad news a little bit of uh anxiety a little bit of uh bad feelings a little bit of this and pretty soon you're looking at your church your life your family your walk with God from Satan's perspective and if you look at it from his perspective I'm sorry but you're lost cuz he's telling you you're lost he's telling you you're no good he's telling you you can't be healed he's telling you you can't be delivered of that and if you listen to that you're seeing everything from his perspective and God's on the other side saying I've already delivered you I've already healed you I've already done these things but you need to look at it from my point of view but so many times in this message I'm just going to go I just let's go on a little tangent if that's okay uh okay A lot of times we hear in the message uh I'm the the sisters get real beat up sometimes when you listen to tapes when you listen to preaching it's always about how the sisters are dressed how the sisters hair how the sisters skirts how the sisters are doing this right and I believe in that I I believe in what it says and then a lot of times in the message brother bam will go okay now I'm going to talk to you uh Brothers for a little bit can I just talk to you Brothers for a little bit he'll say you men that'll let your wives do that and I just be honest brother Dan when I heard when I hear that you've heard it a lot right he I kind of was like oh that wasn't that bad right am I alone brothers or am I the only one that it was like man he kind of really he spent like five minutes like getting on the sisters and then when the men he's like and you men that'll let your wives do that and it was like one sentence I was like I wasn't too bad right oh was pretty good yeah and then what happens is now you don't have to say Amen to this part but what happens is is men will hear that and they'll go yeah you know what uh let's sit down wife you're dressing like this you're talking like this you're gossiping like this you're wearing this you're acting this way and and the and the and the message says that I shouldn't allow you to do that so now they take that little quote and they go and they start clubbing their wife over the head with it and trying to beat her into submission but really if you look at that quote from another point of view what brother randam is saying he's saying you men that let your wives do that meaning your wife is doing that because you spiritually or physically are doing that your wife is out of order because you're out of order and you say oh no no no my wife no you don't understand brother I tell my wife to do this I tell my wife to live this way I tell my wife to pray I tell my wife to to pray with our children you it's going to get quiet for me too because this is the truth I tell my wife to do this and and she doesn't listen to me me and the problem is is that she is listening to you she's doing exactly what you do so if she doesn't see you running your household like a man of God how is she going to run her household like a woman of God you say well I don't I don't dress him properly I don't do this but if you're not being the example of the household then the perspective that your wife has is you wow or or are we the kind of are we the kind let's just put on our spiritual thinking cap are the we kind of ministry or pastors or churches that tell somebody how to live but don't live it ourself we sometimes we have no problem telling somebody what's in the Bible oh if you just read what's in the Bible they said don't do that but are we living it wow are we the kind I'm sorry welcome to being the man of the house that's the man of the house oh man it's the man of the house right we're just the right brother brother Dan I don't envy your job is the pastor because you're the man of the house you're the man of the house and for our houses I'm sorry man but if something's going on in our houses you may not like me very much but this applies to me and I've been guilty of this and when I say I've been guilty I don't mean 10 years ago I mean like yesterday if your house is out of order they're doing they're following you that's not a pleasant perspective but if you want to see the the way to get through it you'll say Lord that's hard but I want to look at it from that perspective Lord how do I get in line so then my children and my wife look at me and I don't have to beat him in line with the message in the Bible and preaching just live it and watch them go oh I want to be that way oh that's how I want to be you give them A New Perspective I'm um I'm trying to hurry now he says I think I think we see the same thing today with uh I I I I feel like every everywhere I go I just head on Fellowship between churches but I feel like everywhere I go I see some I see in myself I see in our church I see that that is the battle W that's a battle to to have fellowship and and the reason why is because we don't always see the same way now I gave you the example brother Daniel saying that that's that's what that Pulpit looks like but now just just take the pulpit out of it and just add the Bible which now has you know thousands and thousands of words in it and let's not even talk about the message on top of that which has thousands and thousands of words and all the different points of view is a perfectly good reason not to have fellowship with somebody perfectly good reason right just it's a good reason they don't see it like I see it and I know I've been given Revelation so I must be right I don't think we ever like say that out loud but I think sometimes our actions are that way um but until you've walked a mile in their shoes sometimes individually and sometimes as a church as well I believe that this church has been through things that maybe another church hasn't been through would you say Amen to that am but they've also been through something you haven't been through you say I just don't understand how that church could see things that way maybe go walk a mile in their shoes maybe go up against the persecutions that they've been under maybe suffer like they've suffered and it's like somebody can battle just think about this somebody can battle I'm I'm going to confess to you a little bit like you know I have I have friends I have family members that battle battle anxiety and I haven't battled that and if I'm being honest with you it's very hard for me to see it from their perspective not that I don't care for them not that I don't pray for them not that I don't you know want Deliverance for them but I have a I have trouble empathizing I'm just I'm just bearing it all out for you right now it's the truth I'm not proud of it I have trouble understanding why you could be anxious for something because I don't have anxiety but yet that same person might look at me and go you battle with this that's that's like why would you battle with that you ever feel like I'm not going to tell anybody my battle because there's no way anybody else battles with this or there's no way anybody would even understand why I would be battling I've been a Christian for x amount of months years whatever it is I shouldn't be battling that I'm just going to hold that insight and keep it to myself and how is somebody else you know the Bible says confess your sins not to him one to another because what you've now done is you've now given somebody who has the right Spirit who's who's willing to get down with you and kneel and pray you've given them a perspective that they didn't have before and now they can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you and they can go into that battle going okay Lord I don't battle this anxiety but I have been given a perspective of I never had before and and I just that's that's why I think it was so it's it's so beautiful when you see through the Bible you see it with Jesus and you see it of course in the message that that that the Lord allowed people's the discernment think about discernment now I'm just preaching about what we read about in the message there's a lot of times that ministers or or or people don't suffer through some of the things people suffer through well that's my timer they don't suffer I told you I ignore it but I was really trying to okay they don't suffer through things people suffer through and yet through discernment God allowed God allowed Jesus to see exactly what somebody was going through why so that he could enter in to that you know what discernment became in some of the prayer lines and even when you see it in the Bible it became a Viewpoint instantly into that person's life because how is even Jesus supposed to enter in for you if he wasn't tempted in all things and the Bible allowed him to be tempted in not some things if I'm telling you right now if you battle something in 2024 Jesus was tempted with it why so that he knows your perspective he knows what you're going through CU he's seen the world he's seen Satan and he's seen living life through that exact same perspective and yet without sin so that when he entered enters in with you it's true there's a scripture that says this I it's in John 16:12 it says if you want to write it down it says I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now now I love that scripture because one he's going to tell you many things and and you are going to be able to Bear them isn't that beautiful that he has a word for you that maybe today you couldn't handle how about the maybe this morning when you woke up you couldn't handle it but maybe right now you can that's how God does things just like that look through the Bible and see how many times God says the word immediately immediately when God does something well I better wait 20 years and then I can get this word from God I can bear you can bear it you might be able to Bear something right now that you couldn't bear five minutes ago because that's what the power of God changing your perspective can do for you and he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come every spirit-led person I believe your spirit-led you have to get out of your own way first that's like that's the hardest thing for us to do is get out of our own way we always want to say it's Satan in our way it's so and so in our way it's brother this it's brother that sister this it's work whatever it is I'm sorry but we're in our own way there there there's a quote I just love this quote it's so it's so small he says um uh I was told a little bit of time ago they had a jet plane that can make those noises we hear around shakes the windows when the plane has gotten so fast it crosses its own sound it's called the sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound listen to this when it goes beyond its own sound it's almost unlimited what it can do it's not it's not you going beyond the sound of your pastor it's not you going beyond the sound of ministry it's not you going beyond the sound of your church it's not you going beyond the sound of your your husband and your wife it's you going beyond your own sound which be which means your point of view your perspective all the things you think all the things you believe you've got to go beyond that and when and if you go beyond that because sometimes it's overwhelming is it overwhelming a little bit Danel like okay what perspective am I supposed to have now I'm really confused just step outside your own and the spirit of truth will be there to lead you to the perspective that is right for that time and that place but you have to be able to go beyond your own sound your own feelings your own opinion even your own experience and and your own Revelation no doubt they're good I I don't I don't take away anybody's experience but God has more experience I don't take away your salvation it's probably I I would say isn't it the greatest day of your life but there's more and if you can get beyond your own sound it's almost unlimited what you do don't worry about what perspective you need to go see the spirit of truth will lead you exactly where you need to go in that and he says and he can show you things that you've never seen and take you to places you've never been before I he didn't he didn't say that was for the newcomer the the the person who just became a Believer that's for every single one of us there are places in this word and in God you have never been before do you want to go there do you want to experience it do want to see things from a different angle from a different perspective every spirit-led person wants that it it it's so I love this he says maybe if your healings lingered a bit watch watch the perspective God has I think sometimes brother Dan I I'm praying for something and I don't it doesn't happen right away and I think this is what I think God must look at me and be like oh you're so like why aren't you getting it ah why aren't you just why aren't you doing this why aren't you believing this way why aren't you praying this way why aren't you just have faith that's what I would do God isn't me his ways are not my ways and and I got to tell you this he his ways are not your ways either you ever prayed for healing and you it didn't come you ever prayed for deliverance and it hasn't maybe you're doing that right now maybe if you're here's right out of the right out of the word maybe if your healing is Linger a little bit God has got confidence in you that you will hold on look at his perspective his perspective is the one I want and guess what he wants to give it to you in fact he's trying to do that right out of here out of two sentences but do I remember that when I'm going through the battle I'm attacked on all sides do I see it from his perspective I I'm I'm I'm I'm shoved down To The Ground by enemy do I see it from his perspective that I'm not no I'm not defeated I've not been beaten I'm not I'm not I'm not going to give up I don't know about you but there I'm not giving up I I do I feel like giving up yes I feel like giving up there's a lot of times I feel I just being honest with you there's times it's like oh this is It's hard I'm not giving up if it cost me my life if it cost me everything that I have I'm not giving up there's there's I believe that you have to claim that though brother Dan can't claim that for you brother brandom can't claim that for you Jesus himself cannot come down and claim that for you he cannot force his perspective upon you now what he'll do is he might knock you down you know there's there's a there's a guy we probably have heard of him there's a guy who is traveling on a horse to a town he didn't have a particularly good view of God in fact fact he persecuted those that believed in God Paul and he had a certain perspective when he's traveling down this road and in order he just wouldn't come to God but in order for him to come to God because he was a seed and the greatest sign the Bible says that you are mine is that I rebuke and chastise you sometimes the greatest sign that you're his is that he might let you get knocked down so that you can see it from a different point of view he literally knocks him off his horse now he's laying on the ground and I love this he goes and what does he see he sees a light he doesn't see he doesn't see anything but a light and he's and and he sees a light and yet the light speaks to him and says and it gives him an even higher perspective and says I'm not just a light I'm Jesus I'm not just a good scripture a good quote a good message I am Jesus if you want to see where I'm at literally gave him a new perspective there's there we're talking about Moses I'm I'm closing talking about Moses God looks at the children of Israel and you realize he gets so angry at the children of Israel that he says I'm going to wipe them out that doesn't sound like a very good perspective of God right and yet the spirit of God in Moses has a different perspective so God has a perspective he says you know what they make me so mad I'm just going to wipe him out and I'm going to start over and then God because he's balanced because he sees all things because he's looked at everything from every point of view because he's Eternal God himself in Moses said no let me give you a new perspective not new but let me show you where I'm looking at before you wipe them out you have to wipe me out God himself realizing not realizing because he doesn't learn anything new but God himself knowing I I need to see things from All Points of View it's not just enough that I can react angrily and wipe out the the people that I've worked so hard to deliver no no there's me over there saying oh no wait wait a minute walk a mile in my shoes come over here where I'm sitting I'm Daniel I'm sitting over here look at the children of isra from my point of view oh they're beautiful they're my children I love them I'm going to die for them and God being God is satisfied with with that to me that is like it it is the most like beautiful thing of God is that he doesn't do what I do he doesn't react upon a singular point of view he doesn't react upon emotion he doesn't react upon 10e of belief system built into him he doesn't react on those things he sees things from the proper perspective and I'm going to I'm going to close with this um is continuing that that that quote he says when you receive the holy spirit and get born again then the devil begins to tempt you you being tempted anybody being tempted all right that's good news from this perspective that's good news that means you got the Holy Spirit oh and he says oh you're wearing the same clothes and you look like you used to devil ever come and tell you I thought you were born again here you are thinking the same thoughts you used to think here are doing the same things you used to think he's trying his best to get you away from that New Perspective that you've been given but God changed you and you are sure that something happened inside of you and God changed your life and it doesn't make any difference what the devil says get away from it because you're sure that is God and he says we need one another now more than we ever did need one another I think about that meeting yesterday brother Dan we could go to the meeting and say you know what I didn't I don't agree with 100% of what every brother said but but I found myself thinking I I wonder what that man's been through that's really what I left wondering what has he been through to give him that point of view and I think if I could do that I I start to gain because here's the beautiful thing about God is when he gives you a new perspective you actually still keep that old one he just grows you into a house he grows you into a Christian he grows you into a child of God you don't have to you don't have to lose what you've known the Bible says I think it's in in in Peter about the stature add to yourself add to your perspective this and you start to get this this picture of who we should be as as a Christian and I I had other notes but I think I think I've taken the time that I need to take and I I pray that that that even just in these broken words that you could it doesn't matter how old you are how young you are look at this look at things from a different perspective and are there wrong persp of course there wrong perspectives if something's telling you that you're defeated take them right back over here right back over here to this Bible oh no no I'm sorry Satan you you're can attack me from all sides but you cannot defeat me you know what I may be down but I'm not dismayed I'm sorry if somebody's has given you that perspective you can feel free by the by the word of God to reject that perspective but if it's something that you don't understand let the spirit of Truth lead you where it's going to lead you amen let's just let's just stand I'll turn over to brother Dan I thank you for the for the extra time I hope I used it used it well so God bless you stay here okay brothers and sisters that was good do you appreciate that oh I uh I got to say I'm not usually like this but I wish I had a couple hours now to preach man that was really good that got me excited that was that was exactly exactly if it was for no one else it was for me brothers and sisters that was good you know what you know what I was thinking when he was closing you know I was thinking God has perspective and I thank God that through the blood of Jesus Christ through his son Jesus Christ that he is able to lower himself to see things from our perspective and I than that he is a high priest as being that is able to be touched by by our Feelings by our our sicknesses by our needs and as he was closing I was thinking the devil has a perspective too and one day it's going to be [Applause] y the bottom of the souls of the feet of God's Saints one day it's going to be that way and by the grace of God by the grace of God Jesus Christ is our he is the Conqueror amen he is our Champion brother brandham said one time as our brother was was preaching brother brandham said that to truly have your prayers heard for someone else is to be able to enter into that person's suffering to be able to get down and to see and to feel that person's pain to put it in brother Ryan's words to be able to see from that brother or that sister's perspective and then when you can really enter into that suffering that is when you're able to get through to the Lord in prayer for that person brothers and sisters as as our brother was was speaking I was I was I I was so thankful that not only are we trying to to see other people's perspectives but Jesus Christ sees from our perspective and he mentioned Moses and brother brandom always said he said many many times he said how could Moses have a better idea than God had when he was saying Lord that you should go back on your judgment of the people and let me tell you something that was not Moses speaking that was not a man speaking right there was none other than the spirit of Jesus Christ speaking through that prophet and making intercession is a foreshadow of what was coming when the man died on the cross and he gave God another perspective and instead of looking at me brother Joe instead of looking at you his perspective was looking at his perfect virgin born son of God and the perfectness of Jesus Christ is God's perspective on us brothers and sisters please take heed to what our brother said and look at things from other perspectives other than yourselves look in every situation when you get angry when you get frustrated look at someone else's perspective it's not always we don't always want to look through things through our eyes look through things from other people's eyes eyes and as a brother said Walk In Those Shoes brother Josiah Made for [Music] More I know who I am cuz I Know

Let's stand and sing that song. For a long time I travel down a long lonely road. My heart was so heavy in sinners sink. Then I heard about Jesus. What a wonderful hour. I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out through his saving power. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by his wonderful grace. I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out and show me the way. Like a bird out of prison that's taken his flight. Like a blind man that God gave back his sight. Like a poor wretching beggar who found fortune and fame. Well, I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out through his holy name. Well, thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus and been born [Applause] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by his wonderful grace.

Oh, I'm so glad that I found out that he would bring me out and show me the way. Amen. Sing. He abides. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk away for the hand of God. In all my life I see that the reason of my plans. Yes. The secret alles that the comforter abides with me. He abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk their way for the comfort of abide with me. Oh, once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within till I heard Jesus died upon the tree. And I fell down at his feet and licked a peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides with me. Oh he abides. He abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.

I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the way for the comforter confides with me. Oh, there's no thirsting for the things of the world. They've taken wings. Long ago I gave them up then instantly. And all my night was turned to day. All my burdens rolled away. Now the comforter abides with me. He abides. Oh, he abides. Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way for the comfort abides with me. Amen. You guys may be seated. Um let's sing I will bless thee, oh Lord. And then I believe Sister Hope has a song. Sing this one and then you can bring your special after that. I I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with the heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh Lord. Sing that verse again. I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with a heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise. With the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord. With my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise. With the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord. We will bless thee, oh Lord. We will bless thee, oh Lord. With the heart of thanksgiving, we will bless thee, oh Lord. And with my hands lifted up and my mouth filled with praise, with the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord. [Music] I drifted on the flight's many days. Okay, Sing it with me. He searched for various ways. Troules he had some but not from [Music] above. God gave him his son on the wings of the dove. On the wings of the snow, white dove, God sends his pure, sweet love, a sign from above on the wings of the earth. [Music] Jesus our savior came to earth one day. He was born in a [Music] stable in a manger of h though he rejected but not from above. God gave us his son. On the wings of the letter, on the wings of the snow, white dove, God sends his pure, sweet love, a sign from above on the wings of the dove. Though I have suffered in many ways, I cried for healing. Both night and day. Faith wasn't forgotten by the father above. He gave me his son. On the wings of the t. On the wings of the snow, white earth, God sends his pure, sweet love, a sign from above on the wings of a dove. Though the prophet has left us, he showed us the way. He said, \"Go unto Jesus from day to day.\" For he has proised from the depths of his love. He'd send down his [Music] sunlight on the wings of the earth. On the wings of the snow white dove, God sends his pure sweet love. A sign from [Music] above on the wings of the [Music] earth. Amen. I was debating and I uh like usual I came to the wrong conclusion. I uh saying, \"Lord, do you want me to give this testimony or not?\" And uh I decided not. Obviously, I'm going to because Sister Hope sang that song. That song is um special. So I've given the testimony many times about how brother Brandham told my dad that he had there was a popular song on the radio by a country music singer named Ferlin Husky and named On the Wings of a Snow White Dove. And uh he asked my my dad, my grandfather, he said, \"Have you ever heard that song on the radio by Ferland Husky called On the Wings of a Snow Whiteeyed Dove?\" They said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"I have a message I want to preach.\" And he said, \"I want to title it on the wings of a snow white dove.\" Now, this happened in 1961 that he told my dad this. He said, \"I have a message that I want to preach and I want to name it on the wings of a snow white dove.\" And when you hear that sermon, you know, you'll know it's my time to go. And as I've said, I've given that testimony be here here a number of times. And um he preached that sermon November the end of November 1965. And within within 30 days, brother Brandham had gone to be with the Lord. Um the testimony I wanted to share was the the verse that sister Hope sang that wasn't in the original song that I believe Brother Brandaman wrote it though. had suffered for many days. Did you sing? I think you sang that verse. He had suffered with a stomach condition and it was with him pretty much his whole life and he had an experience in Sabino Canyon in 1965, the same year that he passed away. And you probably know the story. It was a a vision that he had of this squirrel that many years earlier had gone down into his stomach and and just torn his stomach up and he had suffered with this stomach problem. And this time in 1965 when he was up in Sabino Canyon, he saw that same squirrel and in a vision and it had jumped to hit his mouth like it had done before and it missed and it hit a cactus. I assume it was a choya cactus and killed itself. And brother Ram knew that that was the end of his stomach problem. And he said, 'Lord, he said, and and right there in that sermon, Sister Hope with that same title, he says, why now at the end of my life, me an old man, the end of my life, he was 56 years old. Why did the Lord choose to heal me now and not before? Well, he did. And my testimony that I'd like to share is I gave a testimony of being healed of a stomach problem in uh I don't know it's probably 15 years ago. We were in church and I I told it was either Sunday morning or Sunday night. I told about how the a friend of mine had laid his hands on me and prayed for me and I had suffered with this stomach condition for my whole life and at that very moment the Lord healed me. Well, I think I've given that testimony here in church, I think three times. And I think I've given it uh other places. I think maybe one or two times. Every time I give that testimony, the next day I have worse stomach problems that I've ever had in my whole life. And it hits me and it hit me this week. And oh, and it's back to the handfuls of Tums and and drinking the water. And but you know, it gives me faith because I should know it's coming because that's the only time that it hits me is when I give that testimony. So, you know that just as just as we know that God is real, we know that Satan is real, too. And he hates us and he want he's coming after us and he's got a punch. My I was talking with my brother a couple hours ago. He was giving me a testimony of uh somebody that was in our gym there that had given his life to the his heart heart to the Lord. And right after he gives his heart to the Lord, right after his son drowns and is killed. And my brother um ministered and said that Satan is a counter puncher. He fights, but he fights. We take a swing at him and he's really good at taking a swing back. And that's what he's done to me this week with my stomach. And it's like, you know what, Satan? Because my stomach's so upset and because I have that acid reflux coming up, you know what? It helps my faith because I know you're real, too. But I also know that God healed me. And I know that it's going to be gone and it's going to be gone forever again until I give the testimony again. And you know what? I'll give the testimony again and I'll suffer through it. Satan, friends, Satan hates you. He wants you to go to hell. He wants you to go to the same place that he is going. Jesus loves you and Jesus wants you to go to the same place that he is going, which is the heavenly kingdom, which is eternal life. And you know what? It's up to you where you go. Brother Bram said, \"Satan voted against me. Jesus voted for me. And how I cast my vote is what determines my eternal destination.\" So, it's in our hands. We can choose God or we can choose Satan. We can choose to look at the symptoms or we can choose to look at the promise. Amen. Sister Hope, thank you for the song. It always inspires me to give that same testimony. I know you can quote it by heart. It's okay. You can tell other people, too. It's it's a blessing. But but this one was especially a blessing because my stomach is is just really upset right now. And when you were singing that song, I thought of that squirrel and how that vision how it missed him and it was killed forever. And brother Brandham said, he said, \"Why me?\" An old man at the end of his life. And he was gone. Brother Jeremy, that was preached, I believe, on Thanksgiving 1965 at Jack Moore's church in Shreveport. And then within a month, Brother Rand with the Lord. Just amazing. God bless you. I uh I didn't mean to take your time. I thought it'd be an encouragement to you. God bless [Music] you. I had this song on my heart on the list, but uh as she started talking, I uh decided to pick above all out of the list and above all powers and above all things. I think it's fitting song. Above all power, above all kings, above all nature and all created things. above all wisdom and all the ways of men. You were here before the world begins. Above all kingoms, above all thrones, above all the world has ever known. Above all wealth and treesures of the earth, there's no way to measure what you're worth. Crucified, laid behind the stone. You live to die, rejected and alone like a road. Trempled on the ground. eternal fall of me above all. Let's go back to verse one. Above all [Music] powers, above all kings, above all nature and all created, above all wisdom and all the ways of man, you were here before the world begins. Above all kingoms, above all thrones, above all wonderers the world has ever known. of all wealth and treasures on the earth. There's no way to measure what you will [Music] crucified. Laid behind the stone. You live to die. Rejected and alone like a rose trampled on the ground. He took the fall on me of our home. Crucified laid behind the stone. He lived to die. Rejected and alone like a rose treble on the ground. He took the fall and [Music] abing. that that line, you live to die. He lived to die so that we might die to live. It's it's just it's just the perfect balance. The reflection. The reflection. I I I love it. I love it. And the last time since we met in our study of David, Jerusalem Day was observed in Israel. the reconquest of the old city in the Temple Mount on the 28th of IR on the Hebrew calendar May 26th this year but was June the 7th 1967 58 years ago. June 7th is this coming Saturday. Last Sunday, June 1st was the first day of Sh\u00e0uot, the feast of weeks, what we know is Pentecost. That was on the Hebrew calendar. On the Christian calendar, it will be this Sunday, June the 8th, right in between on June 4, sandwiched between the Jewish and Christian observances of Pentecost. And we all think of that Pentecost, the year Jesus rose, when the Holy Spirit came and empowered those in the upper room to boldly declare the gospel message there in Jerusalem. I'm excited tonight about our lesson on David. It will culminate with his conquest of Jerusalem and I can't help but be encouraged by the timing, Jerusalem, Sh\u00e0uote, and Pentecost and our study of David. If we could stand together and approach the Lord in prayer before we uh before we proceed. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful that we can call upon your name. We know, Lord, that you're here in our midst, Lord, and we just we just long for that those those times, those moments when we can just bask in your presence, just feel your spirit near us. Lord, I pray for our pastor Daniel this evening with his stomach that's still bothering him, Lord, that you just grant him complete relief from that. That we just send it right back to Satan. We don't accept it. We don't want it anymore. Lord, I pray that you would forgive us each one this evening. Lord, wherever any of us have fallen short and especially, Lord, perhaps selfishly, I ask that for myself, Lord, that nothing would be said here that would mislead or discourage or confuse anyone. But Lord, that you might be glorified. Lord, we're just grateful that we can have this opportunity. Continue to be with us. Bless us. Thank you for our musicians, those that lead in worship, Lord, to help us lay aside the cares of this world and draw our focus onto you. May our focus remain on you this evening. We ask in Jesus precious name. Amen. For our opening verse or verses, I'd like to read a portion of a psalm of David. And and of course, it'll be found in Acts chapter 2. It's part of Peter's sermon in Jerusalem on Pentecost. Pentecost is in Jewish tradition the day when Moses received the Torah on Mount Si. Many practitioners of Judaism this weekend will hear the Ten Commandments read in a synagogue and then they'll go home and spend all night studying the Torah. It's also the traditional birth date of King David. It's also the traditional death date of King David. Peter is speaking to a crowd of pilgrims fully aware of these traditions. And he's standing not far from David's tomb. In fact, it's almost certainly visible to him and many in the crowd as he speaks. The traditional site from the 9th century AD is indicated on the satellite image of Jerusalem marked with the Star of David. But I've also put a question mark near the south wall of the old city in the Temple Mount, which is the more likely location based on the biblical texts. Regardless of the uncertainty today, its location was known in Peter's day. Peter is speaking of Jesus and David on Pentecost in Jerusalem. And he's quoting from Psalm 16. We read in Acts 2, for David speaketh concerning him, the Messiah. Psalm 168, I foraw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved. Psalm 16:9, therefore did my heart rejoice, my tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh shall rest in hope. Psalm 16:10. because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer tholy one to see corruption. Psalm 16:11, \"Thou hast made known to me the ways of life. Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.\" Peter then begins preaching, \"Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you the patriarch David.\" He's both dead and buried and undoubtedly gesturing. He says, \"And his suppler is with us to this day.\" You can see it. It's right here. Please be seated. For the past several weeks, we've examined the life of David through narrative and psalms during the years before he became king, the formative years. Tonight we'll look at the life of David through the transition to the royal years when he became king. We're now at a place in David's life where the book of 1 Chronicles contains many of the same events as the end of the book of 1 Samuel and all of the book of 2 Samuel. We'll start tonight's lesson of David becoming king by reading from 1 Chronicles 10. The same account almost word for word is in 1st Samuel chapter 31. Both accounts, however, leave out a very important detail. And by the way, we'll be reading a lot tonight. And that's a good thing because we want to hear from him, not from this guy. 1 Chronicles 10. Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa. We talked about the setup for this battle last time when David was sent home to Ziglag while the Philistines went up uh to the uh forces of Saul that were in the north. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and upon his sons. And the Philistines slew. They killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Mushua, the sons of Saul. And the battle went sore against Saul. And the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. For Samuel Count said he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his armor bearer, \"Draw thy sword, thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.\" But his armor bearer would not. For he was sore afraid. He was very afraid. So Saul took a sword and fell upon it. Both accounts leave out the fact that Saul's attempt at suicide failed, leading you to think that Saul falling on his sword ended his life. But it didn't, as we'll see in a few minutes. But he soon did die. And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword and died. So Saul died and his three sons and all his house died together. 1 Samuel says, \"So Saul died and his three sons and his armor bearer and all his men that same day together.\" Well, both accounts then tell of the rescue and burial of Saul and Jonathan's bodies by the men of Yabesh Gilead. 1 Chronicle then immediately starts 11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, \"Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. And moreover, in time past, even when Saul was king, thou was he that led us out and brought in Israel. And the Lord thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel. Thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king at Hebbron. And David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. So we have Saul, Jonathan are killed, their bodies are rescued and and and buried and Israel gathers themselves in three verses. We have David made king over Israel. Zero verses from the death of Saul to chapter 11 verse one. Quick and easy, right? What do you think took? few weeks. Doesn't take that long to come from the north down to Hebron and say, \"Hey, you're our guy.\" Wrong. You might remember when we studied in the book of Genesis that there was this white space between the end of chapter 40 and chapter 41. And chapter 41 tells us that this was a gap of of two years. It's between when he interpreted the dreams of the butler and the baker and interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh. The Bible is silent about what happened in those years, but we were able to determine and infer some of the significant events that occurred. Well, there's a similar white space between the end of 1 Chronicles chapter 10 and 1 Chronicles 11. I've shown an excerpt from the Hebrew text over on this side because this doesn't have verses and chapters and all that, but there's a space and that space is significant. It's like the white space in Joseph's life and it's also a period of about two years. It's called reading between the lines. In fact, 2 Samuel takes four chapters to get from the death of Saul to 1st Chronicles 11:1, which is the same as 2 Samuel 5 verse one. Well, what happens in the first four chapters of 2 Samuel? What happens during those two years? Any guesses? Civil War. There's a civil war. We often think, well, Saul had a United Kingdom and then David had a United Kingdom onto Saul and then it split. Saul had a united kingdom, then it split. David reunited the kingdom with Solomon and then it split again permanently. So, let's read. The text starts by filling in that missing event that I mentioned at the death of Saul on Mount Gilboa. Now it came to pass after the death of Saul when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalachites and David had abodeed two days in Ziglag. You might recall from last time that uh the Philistines had gathered here at Aphek. They had sent David back to Ziglag while they went up to fight with Saul. The forces were at Jezreel. They met at Mount Gilboa. David gets back to Ziglag, finds the city burned. the people have been stolen. He and 400 of his men cross this uh this little brook down here and they go to the Amalachites and they rescue everybody and they come back to their ruined city. And now they've been back for two days. No internet, no texting. He doesn't know what's happened up in the north. He he'd like to know. It came to pass even on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn earth upon his head. And so it was when he came to David that he fell to the earth and did obesence. And David said unto him, \"From whence come thou? Where are you from? How'd you get here?\" And he said unto him, \"Out of the camp of Israel, I am escaped.\" David said unto him, \"How went the matter? I I pray thee, tell me.\" And he answered that the people are fled from the battle. Many of the people also are fallen and dead. And Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. And David said unto the young man that told him, \"How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan and his son be dead?\" The young man that told him said, \"As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, Behold, Saul leaned upon his spear, and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. And and when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.\" And he said unto me, \"Who who are you?\" And I answered him, \"I am an Amalachite.\" He said unto me again, \"Stand, I pray thee upon me. Slay me. Anguish has come upon me, for my life is yet whole in me.\" Notice Saul has been badly wounded by the archers. He's tried to end his life by falling on his sword, but he's still alive. He's now leaning on his spear in absolute agony, trying to commit suicide before he's tortured by the Philistines. He calls for the stranger to kill him quickly and his misery quenches fear. A mercy killing. So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure he could not live after that he was fallen. and I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither to my lord. I I obeyed your king's command. Then David took hold on his own clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him. And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel because they were fallen by the sword. We must keep in mind David has the heart of his shepherd. The descendants of Jacob are his people. He feels responsible for them. He's been selected by God as the king to succeed Saul. Though Saul's a troubled man who hates David personally, he was also selected by God to be king and rule over the nation. And his son, Crown Prince Jonathan, was David's very best friend and most trusted ally. And David said unto the young man that told him, \"Where are you from?\" And he answered, \"I am the son of a stranger and Amalachite.\" David said unto him, \"How was thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?\" And David called one of the young men and said, \"Go near, fall upon him.\" And he smoteed him that he died. In the future, when David wants to build the Jerusalem temple, the Lord will tell him that he can't because he has shed too much blood. We'll see this trait of David throughout his life. Perhaps a lesson to us to not be quick to condemn others. David said unto him, \"Thy blood be upon thy head, for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed.\" Now, I I like to read an associated psalm. And and there is no psalm about this, but David did compose a lament revealing his heart. David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan, his son. And a rather curious verse here in parenthesis also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow. Behold it is written in the book of Joshua. This verse is generally believed to be a reference to this lament titled the bow. It may have been meant as a warning to not underestimate the danger of the archer. Either way it was part of a collection contained in a scroll titled the book of Jasher. We say jasher. The Hebrew is Yeshua meaning straight or righteous. But that book has not survived. We only have this lament. The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places. How are the mighty fallen? This is plural. Are not is. The lament is worth both Saul and Jonathan as well as the people. How are the mighty fallen is a recurring refrain in this lament. Tell it not in Gath, publish it, declare it not in the streets of Ashcolon. Why? These are Philistine cities. Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor nor fields of offerings. For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away. The shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. They were brave and valiant warriors. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. He speaks in this manner of whom? Saul as well as Jonathan. And in their death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle? Oh Jonathan, thou was slain in thine high places. I'm distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan. Very pleasant hast thou been unto me. Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. Some isolate this verse and claim that David and Jonathan were homosexually involved. No, it's speaking of the extreme grief that David felt at this news. How much he valued the friendship between himself and Jonathan. He then ends with, \"How are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished?\" Well, it came to pass after this that David in the ruins of Ziglag, at that time still in Philistine territory, David inquired of the Lord, saying, \"Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? This place is destroyed. Lord, where should I go?\" The Lord said unto him, \"Go up.\" David said, \"Whi shall I go up? Where?\" And he said, \"Unto Hebron.\" So here again we see this map. That's where the battle was. You can see the scale of miles. The distance from Ziklag to Hebron is maybe 25 miles, maybe 30. Hebron's in the midst of Judah. You might recall that that's where Jacob lived when Joseph uh left and went up north and got sold into slavery and sent down to Egypt. It's where Jacob lived when Joseph sent the carts to come and take him to Egypt. So David went up to there and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezelitis, and Abigail, formerly Nibal's wife, the Carmelite. And his men that were with him did David bring up every man with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. And the men of Israel, no, no, no. The men of Judah came and there in Hebbron they anointed David king over the house of Judah and they told David saying that the men of Yabish Gilead were they that buried Saul. You might remember when Saul became king, not everybody was happy about that, but one of his first acts was to rescue Yabish Gilead from an attack and threatened mutilation by the Ammonites, which you read about in 1st Samuel 11. And this was the act that united the kingdom under Saul. And David sent messengers unto the men of Yabishgilead, and said unto them, \"Blessed be ye of the Lord, that you have showed this kindness unto your Lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.\" And now the Lord showed kindness and truth unto you, and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing. Therefore, now let your hands be strengthened. Be ye valiant, for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them. David's praising them at the same time trying to draw them into his fold and make him their king to fully replace Saul to again unite the kingdom. But Abner, the son of Nurr, now Abner is a close relative of Saul, either an uncle or a first cousin. The genealogies say that uh that Kish had a brother named. So that would make him his his uncle, but it also talks about children there suggesting he was a first cousin. So we don't really know, but he's a very near relative. Abnner the son of Nurr, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbath, the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanim. Remember, Saul and three of his sons were killed in the battle of Mount Bilgoa, but Gilboa, but Saul had a fourth son, Ishbos. Abnner is the military leader of Saul's army, the one whom David insulted when he snuck into Saul's camp and took his spear and water jug, which we covered last time. Regardless, Abnner is intensely loyal to his relative Saul and thus Saul's bloodline, which David had promised to not destroy. So Abnner takes Saul's remaining son, Ishbos, and Abnner made him king over Gilead and over the Asherites and over Jezrael and over Ephraim and over Benjamin, over all Israel. So here on this map, I've drawn in the approximate border of uh his Bosch kingdom in red there with his capital at Mahanim. And David is meanwhile ruling Judah from Hebbran. And as always, I've got the six-pointed star marking the location of Jerusalem. Ishbos, Saul's son, was 40 years old when he began to reign over Israel. And he reigned for two years. But the house of Judah followed David. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. Well, since his Bose only reigned for two years, this tells us that that white space that we saw in 1 Chronicles between chapters 10 and 11 is about two years. Well, back to the start of his Bose's reign and the beginning of the civil war. And Abnner the son of Nur and the servants soldiers of his Bose the son of Saul went out from Mahanim to Gibian. And Joab the son of Zariah and the servants soldiers of David went out and met together by the pool of Gibian. They sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, the other on the other side of the pool. This is not sitting side by side in lounge chairs at a resort pool drinking pink lemonade having a friendly chat. They're on opposite sides of a pond. They're each leading an army and they're there to fight. So here we can see that uh David's guys have come up here from Hebron and Abner's guys have come down this way and they're here at Gibian Saul's old headquarters of Gibia right next door to Gibian. Th this is a difficult passage for me to read. Abnner said unto Joab, \"Let the young men now rise and play, make sport in this context, fight before us.\" And Joab said, \"Let them arise.\" Joab agrees to the contest. And there arose and went over by number 12 of Benjamin, which pertained to his Bose, the son of Saul, and 12 of the servants of David. And they caught everyone his fellow by the head and thrust his sword into their side. So they fell down together. Wherefore that place was called Yeah, you can read it. Which is in Gibian. In other words, the 24 combatants all died. Let them play. Let the games begin. It's a gruesome spectacle. You're sending these guys there to fight. It's the modern equivalent isn't quite to this level. It's like mixed martial arts cage fighting or something. The intent here is you fight to the death. It reminds us of a millennium later when Roman gladiators will fight in an arena while people sat and watched. There was a very sore, a very fierce battle that day. Abnner was beaten. the men of Israel before the servants of David. So there's now war between Ishbosa's army under Abnner and David's army under Joab. Well, the rest of the chapter describes towards after this battle uh Joab's brother Aahel, which is one of David's mighty men, chased Abnner. Abnner warned Azahel to don't follow me, but he wouldn't stop following. Abnner winds up killing him. Toward the end of the day, Abnner and Joab agreed to stop fighting. Abnner, his men returned to Mahanim. Joab and his troops returned to Hebron after burying Azahel in Bethlehem. We'll see that Joab was then out for vengeance against Abner. That's the end of the first battle, not the end of the war. Chapter three. Now there was long war, two years, between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker. Meanwhile, unto David were sons born in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnan of Ahenoam, the Jezelitis. The second Helab of Abigail, the former wife of Nabal the Carmelite. The third, Abselum. We'll hear about him later. The son of Maka, the daughter of Talmi, king of Geisher. Geisher is a territory within Manasseh, modernday Golan Heights. And the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith. And the fifth, Shepha, the son of Abatel. And the sixth, Eitham by Eglot, David's wife. So, David got to Hebron with two ladies. Now he's got at least six. These were born to David in Hebron. We'll see later that he also has daughters that were born to him during this time. They're not listed, but we'll find out about them when we discuss a future rebellion under Abselum. And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. So Abner is cementing his leadership within this Israel kingdom of the north. Well, this goes on for a while. Abnner and Ishbos have a big falling out over a concubine of Sauls, and Abnner decides, you know, this isn't going so well. Uh, we're losing. We need to reunite the kingdom. This this just isn't working. Abnner's a power behind his Bible tells us in these verses that Isbos was afraid of Abner. So, we get to verse 12. Abnner sent messengers to David on his behalf. He's apparently fed up with the spoes, seeing the direction of the war, saying, \"Who's is the land?\" Saying also, \"Make thy league.\" In other words, a covenant, a contract, a treaty, an agreement. Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto thee. Let's come together. Let's get this thing figured out, and I'll deliver the rest of the kingdom to you. I've got the power to overthrow overthrow Ishbas. I put him up, I can pull him down. He's a figurehead. And David said, \"Well, I will make a league with thee. But first, there's one thing I require of thee. That is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou bring first my Saul's daughter when thou comest to see my face.\" Remember, they were married. They very much loved each other. She saved his life when Saul was trying to surround and kill him from their house. Saul then took her and marry her off to somebody else. David sent messengers to Ishbosh Saul's son, saying, \"Deliver me my wife Michael, which I espouseed to me for 100 foreskins of the Philistines. And Ishbosas sent, and took her from her husband, even from Faliel, the son of Leish. And her husband went with her along, weeping behind her to Bahoreim. Then said Abnner unto him, \"Go return.\" And he returned. Meanwhile, Abnner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, \"Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you. Now then, do it. For the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, \"By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.\" Abnner also spake in the ears of the the leaders or elders the tribe of Benjamin. Abnner went also to speak in the ears of David and Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. In other words, he's talked to everybody. He's found out what they want in their treaty so that they can stop the war and and and everything will be settled and well, you won't take vengeance on this guy and whatever all these terms are. He's got everybody to agree to this. He's the diplomat now. So Abnner came to David to Hebron and 20 men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. And Abnner said unto David, I will arise and go and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league, a covenant, an agreement with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. Then David sent Abnner away and he went in peace. So far so good. Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop there. Returned to Hebron from from a raid, and they brought in a great spoil, a lot of plunder with them. Abnner wasn't with David and Hebron, for David had sent him away. Abnner was gone in peace. When Joab and all the hosts that were with him were come, they told Joab, saying, \"Hey, Abner, Abnner, the son of Nur came to the king.\" And David sent him away. And he let Abnner go in peace. Then Abner came to the king and said, \"What have you done? Behold, Abnner came unto thee. Why is it thou has sent him away, and he's quite gone? Thou knowest Abnner, the son of Nurr. He came to deceive thee, to know thy going out on thy coming in, to know all that thou doest. You can't trust Abnner. He's spying to strengthen himself against us. And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abnner, which brought him again from the well of Sira. But David didn't know anything about it. And when Abra was returned to Hein, Job took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smoteed him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of Azahel, his brother. Remember the one that Abner had killed after that first battle. This seems to be common in the culture. Recall various cities of refuge were established under Moses and under Joshua throughout the land when it was conquered by Joshua and the tribal allotments were made. The purpose so was so if a person was killed the person responsible could escape to the city where his case would be heard and if it turns out it was accident then the as long as a person stayed in the city of refuge they were safe. But numbers 35:27 says and the revenger of blood find him without outside the borders of the city of his refuge. The revenger of blood shall kill the slayer and shall not be guilty of blood. In other words, you had permission to do this blood vengeance thing. And we're clearly told that Joab, rightly or wrongly, was acting as a revenger of blood. And afterward, when David heard it, he said, \"I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord forever from the blood of Abnner, the son of Nur.\" He then curses Joab and his descendants and relatives. Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house, and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or or that is a leper, or leanth on a staff, or falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. So Joab and Abishe, his brother, slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Aahel at Gibian in the battle. David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him, \"Rend your clothes, gird you with sackcloth, mourn before Abnner.\" And King David himself followed the beer, the coffin, part of a funeral procession. They buried Abnner and Hebrron. The king lifted up his voice, wept at the grave of Abnner. All the people wept. The king lamented over Abner and said, \"Dide Abnner as a fool dieth. Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into feathers. As a man fallth before wicked men, so fellowst thou. And all the people wept again over him. And all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day. David's swear, saying, God, do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or ought else, till the sun be down. All the people took notice of it. It pleased them. Whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. All the people in all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abnner the son of Nur. David's honoring Abner in this way sends a calculated a deliberate signal to the inhabitants of his Bose kingdom that David's not responsible for Abnner's death. Remember they've just concluded a peace treaty. Oh yeah, peace. I'm going to kill your head guy. No. So this is a very awkward situation diplomatically. The king said unto his servants, \"Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?\" And I am this day weak, though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zariah, be too hard for me. The Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness. Chapter 4. When Saul's son Ishbos heard that Admir was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble and all the Israelites were troubled, really worried. Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands. The name of one was Bana. The name of the other Rahab, the sons of Rimman, a Barathite of the children of Benjamin. So one day about noon, as this Boseit lay in his bed taking a nap in the heat of the day, these two guys entered. They came into the house. is supposed to lay in his bed in his bed chamber and they smoteed him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night. And they brought the head of Ishbath unto David to Hebron and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbos, the son of Saul, thine enemy, which sought thy life. The Lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed. Saul's line is cut off of all of his sons. Now David answered Raab and Bana his brother, the sons of Remma and the Barathite, and said unto them, \"As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziglag, who thought I would have given him a reward for his tidings. How much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth? David commanded his young men and they slew them, cut off their hands and their feet and hang them up over the pool in Hebron. Pretty gruesome stuff. But they took the head of Ishbath and buried it in the suppler of Abner and Hebron probably for convenience. Notice the the treaty with Abnner did not require his Bose's death, only that David would become king. David had promised not to cut off Saul's line. Well, now we get to 2 Samuel 5:1, which is the same as Chronicles 11:1. We've just got through the blank space. Then came all the tribes of Judah, no, Israel, to David unto Hebbran, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou was he that led us out and brought us in Israel. And the Lord said to thee, thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain ruler over Israel. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron. And King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel. It's now a united kingdom. David was 30 years old when he began to reign. He reigned 40 years in Hebbran. He reigned over Judah seven years and six months. And in Jerusalem he reigned 30 and3 years over all Israel and Judah. And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. Now recall our opening scriptures from 1st Chronicles 11. Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron and made a covenant with them and Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. and David and all Israel went to Jerusalem which is Jebus. You remember our opening sequence of scriptures. We saw there was a gap between 1 Chronicles 10 and 11 and the Hebrew text it was clear we saw it was a bit over two years but we just saw in 2 Samuel 5:5 as well as 2 Samuel 2:1 that David ruled from Hebron for a total of seven and a half years. Is there another gap? Yes, there's another gap here. It's clear in the Hebrew text. This is a much smaller gap on the page, but it's five years, not two. So, he ruled over the combined kingdom for about five years from Hebron before going to Jerusalem and making it its capital. Okay? Doesn't tell us what happened in those five years. So, we're not going to go two and a half times longer than we just went to cover this gap. The king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, which spake unto David, saying, \"Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither.\" Thinking, David cannot come in here. This is a taunt. It's an insult. The Jebusites are saying, \"Even our lame and blind inhabitants can prevent your forces from taking our city. We're impregnable. Don't even bother trying. You're no match for us.\" Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, the same is the city of David. And David said on that day, \"Whosoever getth up to the gutter,\" gutter, we'll get to that. Getth up to the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of Dave's David's soul. He shall be chief and captain. Wherefore, they said, \"The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\" The the complete Jewish Bible translation's a bit clearer. What David said on that day was In order to attack the Jebusites, you have to climb up from the spring outside the city through the water tunnel. Then you can do away with those so-called lame and blind whom David despises. Hence the expression, the blind and lame keep him from entering the house. And in the King James italicized statement, he shall be chief and captain. That's really a statement about Joab from 1 Chronicles. David said, \"Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.\" So Joab, the son of Uriah, went up first and was chief. Well, let's take a closer look at all this. What's the big deal about the Jebusites? And what's the big deal about Jerusalem? Until now, it has not played a role in our story. In fact, Jabus, the city of the Jebusites, which eventually was expanded and became Jerusalem, at that time was a small walled city. It covered about 11 acres. It's not even a city block. This is this is nothing. Until now, in Israel's history, it had not been conquered. Not by Joshua, not even up to the time of Saul. It's not to say the people known as the Jebusites in general had not been weakened or reduced in number and size over the years. It's only to say that Jebus, the city of the Jebusites, had never been conquered. Joshua 15:63, talking about all the conquests. As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out. But the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day. From the book of Joshua, in the book of Judges, we read, \"The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin Jerusalem until this day when Judges was written.\" Somehow the city seemed unconquerable, 11 acres. Joshua tried and failed. Judah tried and failed. Benjamin tried and failed. They apparently weren't causing trouble. You never read about raids by the Jebusites. It's the Philistines, the Ammonites, the Amalachites, and so forth. Why the sudden interest and trying to take it now? Consider the early history of our nation. The 13 original states were along the Atlantic coast. The southern states, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, allowed slavery. The seven northern states, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, did not. In choosing a location for the nation's capital, a compromise was reached. a small territory on the border between these two regions. The border between Virginia and Maryland was set aside as being part of neither state, part of neither region. And in the approximate geographical center of the nation at that time, most people lived along the coast. So even though these territories are shown going in, people lived along the coast here and along the coast here. Washington is pretty much the middle. They might have gotten this inspiration from David. Consider David's situation. Saul had his capital at Giba in the territory of his tribal affiliation, Benjamin. David of Judah had his capital deep inside Judah in the city of Hebron there. And Saul's thing was there and this other fellow Mahanim was way up here. Jabus that is Jerusalem was not part of any tribal land. It was unconquered. Yet it was on the border between Judah and Benjamin. When Joshua describes the borders in the book of Joshua, Jebus is stated as being part of the border of Judah in Joshua 158 and part of the border of Benjamin in Joshua 18:16. As we just read in Joshua, the children of Judah couldn't conquer it. Judges tells us the Benjaminites couldn't either. Centrally located, it's the perfect location for a politically neutral territory from which to rule the united monarchy from Dan to Beersa. When we think of ancient Jerusalem or the city of David, we imagine the old city that we see today. the huge temple mount, the Dome of the Rock, the Elsa mosque, the Western Wall, and so forth. I marked the walls of what we called the old city in yellow in this satellite view of modern Jerusalem. You can see the Temple Mount right there. We'll zoom in a little bit. Here's the old city again with a Temple Mount Plaza indicated, but in David's time, it was very different. Here's the same image of modern Jerusalem with the area of the city of the Jebusites that David conquered outlined in pink. The area which will become known as the city of David. It still is. That district is known as the city of David. And you can can't make it up. And there's a road that goes right through there. And that road is called the city of David. It's not what you expected, is it? It barely covered 11 acres. It's not even what we call the old city. Why was it so resilient to conquest? Here's a cutaway view of the topography of Jerusalem, the height or altitude. The vertical scale is exaggerated. You can see the present old city wall and you can see the temple mount area there outlined. The city of the Jebusites, which David conquered, is on this little ridge in pink, this little finger of land. Here you can see a a valley on your right to the east of the city. It's called the Kidrron Valley. It's deep and steep. The hill rising on your right, marked in green, is the Mount of Olives. A smaller valley marked here in blue is called the Tyropean Valley, which means the valley of the cheese makers. Don't ask me why. It cuts right through the old city in the edge of the Temple Mount. It's largely filled in today, but in David's time, it was steep and narrow in the area of the Jebusites. Again, in pink, there was a wall and a steep reinforced area to protect from the north towards what would become the Temple Mount. This view shows those two valleys marked on a zoomed-in view of the modern city. The ancient Jebusite city location outlined in pink is today still known as the city of David. The location has a very important strategic water source. Water is everything in the desert. I think we know something about that with that huge flooding.3 of an inch of rain we had last week that we somehow survived. Well, this is the Guihan spring. Recent archaeological discoveries indicate the Jebusites had massive towers and walls to protect the water source. And the spring, by the way, feeds the pool of Salom. And the spring is a gushing spring. It's not flowing all the time. It flows and doesn't. And water gushes and stops. So, it'll flow a large amount of water, then no flow for a while, then another gush. This is the approximate path of the channel that fed the pool. Again, the city is outlined in pink. And you say, \"Well, that's pretty easy to get to.\" No. No. In ancient times, that channel that fed the pool was cut into bedrock and then covered over with massive stone slabs. Water was all important. Ask brother Daniel about how important water is. This is an illustration of the water system based on archaeological findings over the past few decades. So the Guihan spring protected and defended channels this water to the Salom pool along that way and what amounts to an underground channel or tunnel. There's a massive rock cut pool. This here has been cut into the bedrock. So you've got water coming from a spring protected with massive towers. It goes through this essentially underground channel that's been cut into the bedrock to go to this pool. And then up here's a tunnel that's been dug. And so they get water inside the city because you can see the ancient wall ruins of the ancient walls onto the bedrock. This is the modern ground surface here. So they get water with buckets or whatever quite a ways down and then go through this tunnel and bring it into the city. Water was drawn, as I say, probably with buckets and ropes. The intricate system has been around since about 1,800 BC. This is the end of Joseph's life, 350 years before the Exodus, 400 years before Joshua entered Canaan. This was a fortified place and they had plenty of water. Yeah, the people that are giving you a problem have to go get water someplace else. That rock cut pool here. Here's a a little bit of some of the excavation of it. It's pretty deep and pretty steep. And a final note on this, but the King James version uses the word gutter in verse eight. David said on that day, whosoever getth up to the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites. Other translations typically say water tunnel or water shaft. The Hebrew word, I'm sure you're all wondering what the Hebrew word is, right? The Hebrew word is senor, translated gutter. That word senor only appears two times in the entire Bible. Only twice. The other time it appears is in Psalm 42:7. A verse I think that we're all familiar with. Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water spouts. All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Here it's translated water spouts. Other translations typically say the noise or roar of thy waterfalls. Jewish publication society says the roar of thy cataracts. Personally, since this only appears twice, I wonder if David in writing the psalm is associating the noise of the gushing nature of the Guehon spring in conjunction with that shaft or rock cut pool. The noise of the surging water would help to mask any noise that Joab and his fellow invaders might make as they climb to sneak into the city and open the gates to let David's army in. So David dwelt in the fort and called it the city of David. David built roundabout from Milo and inward. 1 Chronicles tells us that Joab repaired the rest of the city. David went on and grew great and the Lord of hosts was with him. And Hyram, king of Ty, sent messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house. David celebrates the dedication of his house as recorded in Psalm 30. A psalm and song at the dedication of the house of David. I will extol thee, oh Lord. Thou hast lifted me up and has not made my foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord, my God, I cried unto thee and thou hast healed me. In Hebrew, this is poetry. You have two lines that say essentially the same thing but in different ways. That way you can translate it to other languages and it carries through. It doesn't upon pentameter and rhyming verse and all that sort of thing. Oh Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave. Thou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh ye saints of his. Give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. His anger endures but a moment. In his favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. Lord, by thy favor thou hast made my mountain to stand strong. Thou hast hide thy face. I was troubled. I cried unto thee, oh Lord. Unto the Lord I made supplication. What profit is there in my blood? When I go down to the pit, shall the dust praise thee? Shall it declare thy truth? Hear, oh Lord, and have mercy upon me, Lord, be thou my helper. Thou hast turned for me my mourning and to dancing. Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. Why? To the end that my glory, my voice may sing praise to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever. What sort of lessons can we take home from this portion of the story of David? We see David move from being selected to eventually rule Israel to its fulfillment. A civil war, eventual peace, the conquest of Jerusalem, David settling there, building a palace from which to rule the nation. To me, those blank spaces are significant. They tell us we must be patient. God does things in his time, not ours. We can depend on his word, but not on our own interpretation or expectation of its timing. David knew he was anointed to be king over all of the land of promise, but he had to fight for it. Fight on the one hand and patiently await the Lord's timing on the other hand. Remember that opportunities that he had to kill Saul and wouldn't do it. The outcome, he's going to be king. He's going to rule over the nation was never in doubt. But the path was not an easy one. Nor was it swift. It contained pain, anguish, rejection, danger, betrayal, a seemingly unending struggle. It also contained times of peace, happiness, contentment, fulfillment. Does it sound familiar to any of you? Both kinds of times are in our lives. I think in the first gap of two years, there was civil war. But in the longer gap of five years, we're told very little. David reigned in Hebron over the reunited kingdom until he moved the capital to Jerusalem. We're not told what happened in those years other than a list of sons born to him, and we're not sure which were in the first two years and which were in the second five. musicians could please return. At the end of all this, David conquered the city of the Jebusites. Hyram built a palace for him, supplying both the materials and the builders. We saw David's rejoicing in Psalm 30. We often remember a line from that psalm. Sorry. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. We must hold on to those things which we believe the Lord has promised us. Endure and work in the interval between the promise and its fulfillment, just as David did from the time he was anointed by Samuel until he reigned over the entire nation of Jacob's descendants. When David closed Psalm 30, he wrote, \"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing.\" Sometimes I wonder if we dance enough. Thou hast put off my sackloth and girded me with gladness. Why? Why has the Lord done this? To the end that my glory, my voice, may sing praise to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever. The Apostle Paul wrote in many of his letters admonishments to be thankful always. Let's close this portion of the service and turn it over to our pastor while we sing. Give thanks. Give thanks with a grateful heart. I'm off key, aren't I? Help me out, brother. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. in faith because he's given Jesus Christ his son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Help us everybody. Give thanks to the holy one. give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son. And now what the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. because of what the Lord has done for us. And [Music] now what the weak say, I am strong. Let our poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks. Do you like the blank spaces and how Brother Lyle could take the blank spaces in one book and fill it in with another book? I got I got another short story. That's what I do. I was when I was a kid, Denise, I was probably your boy's age, may maybe a little bit younger, and I was uh I was reading my Bible and I got to that part about Abner and um Asahel. Asahel or Heel. Aahel. And you know, a boy, you know, I was like maybe 12 years old or younger and I'm reading this story and this whole dialogue is going on when they're sprinting and Abner's running and he's ahead of um Asahel and and he's running and he's turning back and he's saying, \"Back off, man.\" You know, back off. and and the guy just keeps running and and uh is Joab's brother and he could run like a deer and here's Abner and he's going and I'm I'm in my Bible and I'm reading this thing and I still remember you know as as a kid in parents it's so important to get your kids in this Bible because the stories in this Bible are far better than any Star Wars or any stories that you that you ever see. I was into Star Wars, too. I had a kind of an overactive imagination when I was a kid. And anyways, I'm just getting into this story and I'm I'm reading and they're running and and Josiah Abner was like he was like, \"Bro, back off. You don't want me to stop.\" And this guy just keeps coming and keeps coming. And Abdar stops and he takes his spear and he does this like ninja move and takes the back of the spear and stabs this guy that was chasing him and kills him. And I I still remember as a kid I was like, I like Abner, you know, he's this guy's great and he was honest and and and I'm reading this and I turn the page like, \"Oh man.\" Then Joab goes and just like sneaks sneaks him off by himself and takes his spear and just murders him. Totally unfair fight. But when I was reading that, I just remember like this is this is an amazing story. And the Bible records these kind of behind the scenes things. And it was just such it was such an interesting thing to me. And at like 10 or 11 years old, I still remember the visions I had in my mind of the story and how just how great of a man David was and kind of just this Joab. He was just a I think the Bible I think David responds to him as a as a bloody man later and he just he didn't have any um didn't have a conscience conscience to him and uh it was just the story that brother Lyall was telling I was just like man this is so interesting and it's just so deep and then he got to the the pool of um Saleom Huh? The G. Yeah. The Guehon. The Guehon spring. Yeah. Yes. So, so all all of this. Now, I'm going to I want to geek out on hydrarology to you, but there was a So, I went there in uh I don't know if five or six years ago, whatever it was, I went to Jerusalem and Hezekiah. So, we got we got to know our Bible. So Hezekiah, we have Saul's the first king. David's the second king kind of. Um Saul's son was in there a little bit, so he may have been, but we have basically Dave Saul David. And all of this is happening around this spring of water. And there's there's no water. It's about the same climate we have here in Tucson. And later on, the last great king of Israel digs a tunnel from this water source, digs it through, I assume it's limestone, through the rock into the walled city of Jerusalem so that they could get the water inside of there. And and all of this has its roots right here in what brother Lyall was reading to us today. I uh I love it, friends. I love the Bible. We we got to we got to stay in it and we got to teach our kids this word. It's the more you teach them, sit them down and tell them stories at night and and this will stick with them. It stuck with me. And I mean, Brother Manny, you can be 50 years old and it sticks with you, you know. Do you appreciate Brother Lyle? I do so much. [Applause] Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you for your word. Lord, I just Oh, as I go through this Bible, I just love it so much. And brother Lyall, he goes through and reads so much out of this 2 Samuel and in Chronicles and and Lord, it's just such a wonderful story, but it's not just a story, Lord. It's true. Then he tells us, \"What lessons can you get from this?\" Lord, we thank you for those lessons. We thank you for the Bible. We thank you for the grace of the Lord Jesus. Lord, we're just grateful. We're grateful that that you love us enough to preserve your word and give us an opportunity to read it and Lord to even place oursel in this word. We thank you, Father. Thank you for brother Lyle for his love for you, his hard work. Lord, these these lessons don't come easy. They take a tremendous amount of time and research and reading and studying. Lord, we thank you for the time that he put in. I pray that it would, Lord, that it would take hold in our lives and that it would be well worth the time that he's put in that we might take it and Lord, we might be better people. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for this church and all the loved ones here and the love we have for each other. Lord, there just there's I could never stop and saying thank you. Bless us now as we go. Father, guide our path. Be with us. Father, protect us along this life's journey. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ. Christ his son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the holy one. Give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ. his son. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. Because of what the Lord has done for us. give thanks. God bless you, friends. Please read your Bibles. Read it on your own. Sit down, sit in a comfortable chair, open up the Bible, read it on your Bible app, whatever you want to do. and just enjoy it because it's good. Don't don't feel pressured like, \"Oh, I gotta do this or I'm gonna just dedicate um I'm gonna dedicate an hour or 30 minutes a day to reading reading my Bible.\" Do it because you want to do it because you can sit down and when you really get into it, it is great. It it's just it I told somebody one time I was witnessing to this lady. I said, \"The more you pray, the more you want to pray.\" And the more you read your Bible, the more you're going to want to read your Bible because it doesn't disappoint. I love our Wednesday night Bible studies. I want to keep doing it. It just it's it's a blessing to me. And I think that we're moving forward as a church and we're we're learning these things, these foundational beliefs that make us a Christian. God bless you, brothers and sisters. You're dismissed. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. because of what the Lord has done for us. And now let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks. Give thanks. [Music] I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind.

In the light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes. Let me see. In beauty that makes this heart adore you. hope of a life spent with you. And here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together lovely. Allto together worthy. Allto together wonderful to me and king of all days. Oh so highly exalted. [Music] Glorious in heaven. Oh Lord, comely. You came to this earth. You ced all for sake became. And here I am to worship. Here I am to bow out. Here I am to say that you're my God.

You're all together lovely, allto together worthy, allto together wonderful to me. [Music] The words to that song say, I'll never know. And it made me think about Mary after she had heard from the angel said that and she pondered those things and she does have a little a little baby and watches him grow pondering that and all the time it was God working all the time it was God doing what he hadn't planned. Maybe now how you see it and how I see it and sometimes we wonder God where are you? But he's working all the time. He's bringing everything accomplished. We would maybe make the road go differently. We would say, \"Lord, it would have been better, but he knows best.\" We thank him for that. Sister Shirley Moore asked us to remember for a man she met outside the church who was in a car accident. I told him we would pray for him and the church, the church would. So, didn't have the name of the person, but Lord knows who that is that says, \"Please pray for my little sister, Kelly Dripper.\" Says she needs all the help we can give her through prayer. As much as we see sometimes wonder, Lord, where are you? God answers prayer in his time. Amen. Sister Merrily says, \"Please pray for my sister Sue, I believe that's Wilson, she has pulmonary fibrosis and is on oxygen uh most of the time. She's also a widow and is trying to live on her own, but it's very hard. You know, she's not on her own. God is with her. He's an everpresent help in the time of trouble. So pray with me. And she lives in Montana. So she's part of our family here then because our sister's part of our family and if our Lord can be touched by the filling of our infirmities and he would give his life for it then how much more would we say Lord if you have a need something you want to raise your hand and say Lord remember me. So Lord, as as you've heard these requests and they don't come as a surprise to you, you didn't have to stop and try to figure out how you're going to, Lord, you've already provided. And we just want to say thank you. Every hand that is raised and every heart represented, those that are listening in, Lord, and those that might hear this at another time, Lord, you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, if we have failed you, and we know we do, Lord, if we have failed one another, we forgive one another as you've forgiven us, Lord. And we thank you for that, Lord. And as as our brother Ryan here this morning, Lord, that you would just give him that that assurance even right now that all is well, Lord. What you've placed in his heart and you'll feed you'll give to us what we have need of, Lord. We thank you for all things, Lord. And as the offering is taken up, Lord, may we be we be willful givers, Lord. Chill cheerful givers, Lord. And it be put to the use that you have designed it for, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We give you glory and honor for what you've already answered and done for us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. If Sister Naomi would make way, let's just sing that chorus one more time. And here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together worthy. All together wondering, all together wonderful to me. [Music] [Music] of the glory of Jehovah. Paul preached that all is lost save Christ. John said he is precious by leaning on his bosom. So for a moment may I humbly testify? Did I mention that I love him? How I worship and adore him when I could see he made a way for me. And did I mention he's been faithful to every promise he ever made me? I love him. That's all I have to say. How many sermons can be preached about my Jesus? How many songs can be sung about God's son? There are not enough words, enough notes in the music to tell the story of all myior. [Music] Did I mention that I love him? How I worship and adore him? When I could sing a way, he made a way for me. And did I mention he's been faithful to every promise he ever gave me? I love him. That's all I want to say. And I faithful to every promise he ever made me. I love him. That's all I want to say. [Applause] [Music] Thank you for this cross, Lord. Thank you for the pay price you make. Bearing all my sin and shame in love you came in and gave your name. Let's sing that one more time. Thank you for the cross, Lord. [Music] Thank you for the price you pay. Wearing all my sin and shame. In love, you came and gave your name. And worthy is the lamb. [Music] Seated on the throne. We crown you now with many crowns. You reign victorious and you are high and lift up. [Music] Jesus, son of God, the treasure of him crucified. Oh, worthy is the lamb. Oh, worthy is the lamb. [Music] Worthy is the lamb.

I was just telling brother Ryan in the back that people here today that they just need to hear that God loves them and God cares and they just they just need to hear what this word is about. all the other things, all the other doctrines, all the other stuff that will all fall into place. But really, the sum of the whole matter is to serve God and to know that God loves you and he cares. He knows your name. And it matters to him, every single person here. Greetings to our visitors. First, um, I met Brother Juan Lopez back there. God bless you, my brother. It's good to have you back in service. Bless you. And, uh, Brother Josh Lopez over there. It's nice to meet you, my brother. Raise your hand. God bless you. It's good to good to have you in service. Nice nice to meet you. And, um, two uh, new friends that I have, I just met them outside. Janette and Ben. They're from the local community here. God bless you. Welcome. It's it's it's good to have you in service. I was talking with brother um brother Ben back out there and and I was telling them, you know, it's just on my heart to do something for our community. I've talked with the trustees about it. I I've mentioned that I want to do it. Brothers and sisters, if if we live here, and many of you live in this community, if we live here, then if we are truly Christians, everyone around us should be blessed. That includes the people that live next door. They should be blessed. They should be blessed number one, first and foremost, by our prayers, but second, they should be blessed by just having an outpost of Jesus Christ right next to them. All blessings should rest upon if we are truly walking in the light of Jesus Christ. Then you know when you turn on a light the darkness just flees away. That's right. And if we are walking in that light everywhere we walk, it should just be light. It should be spreading all all over the place. And that includes that includes our neighborhood here. So um Janette and Ben, welcome. Thanks for coming. We we we appreciate you. Thanks to all of our visitors. Yeah, Sister Connie. It's good to have you back in service. God bless you. Welcome, Heath and Melissa, my friends. Welcome those uh those Miller boys, man. You boys are first class. It's good good to have you in service. God God bless you. I'm just grateful, friends. I'm grateful that we have a church that stands for a a living God, a resurrected Christ, and one and and to live our lives like Christians. Jesus said, \"Prefer the other person.\" And it's just that simple. He did it. He died on the cross preferring the other person. And we should do do the same. Whether it be for our wives, husbands, our children, our parents, our neighbors, brothers and sisters in church, whatever it might be. Always prefer the other person. Uh for tonight's service, we will uh I want to have a prayer service tonight and I want to start um answering some questions. I asked the congregation if you have something on your heart you want to know maybe it could be anything it'd be how do I overcome this it be it could be brother Daniel how do you stand on certain certain doctrines it could be why do our church why does our church do this or it could be um I don't understand this scripture write them down put them in the box give them give them to uh one of the officials in the church or their wives and get them to me tonight I want to I got a I got a really sweet question from Sister Elizabeth uh Gara and it's a question that I just didn't get from herds that I've got from other ones is that when I pray how can I get all these voices out of my head and how can I really just approach the Lord in the right way and I think that that's a a question that I don't know if there's one that would be more important important than that one. So, I'll be talking about that maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes. I just want to just have just that one question tonight and then I'll just talk 15 20 minutes and then let's put it into action. Let's pray tonight. Amen. We do that. Um I want to announce uh brother Steve Robson and and the Flagstaff Church where brother Ryan here is from. They're having their annual meetings August 1st through the 3rd up in Flagstaff and uh Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Um ministers are Evan Kerion and Daryl Ward will be ministering. Um I've heard of heard those names, but I don't know either of them. But I do know brother Steve Robson and I know that he's uh he has good discernment with ministers. So please uh I want to encourage the church to attend those meetings. Again, that's August 1st through 3rd. And we're not having camp this year. So even if the youth wanted to plan a trip up, maybe the church could help in in some way with transportation or something like that. So that's August 1st through 3rd. And uh from that same church, a dear friend of mine, Brother Ryan Long, I first heard Brother Ryan preach, I don't know, a year and a half ago or so at a minister's meeting. And I saw in Brother Ryan something that I think is so rare in the world today. And that is a man that is an individual that has his own walk with the Lord and has his own understanding of the scriptures. And he's not dependent maybe on an organization or maybe a way of thinking. I believe he's dependent on the Holy Spirit. He's not perfect. None of us are are perfect, of course. But when I heard him speak, there was something in my heart that uh that really drew me to him. And I know that we've heard him. We've heard brother Ryan preach a number of times over the past year and a half or so here and and he's been a blessing to me and and I told brother Ryan yesterday I said you know said a pastor is a shepherd and I try to lead the sheep to the green fields and I try to lead the sheep to the good nutritious food but there's sometimes there's vitamins that I just can't give them. And I want to bring in maybe others that maybe are full of those vitamins that can give that vitamin that maybe the pastor can't give. I'm still I'm still looking after the sheep and I want them to be nice and fat in the gospel. And I'm doing my best, brothers and sisters. So, so join me in welcoming our brother Ryan Long from Flagstaff here. And brother Ryan, feel free. I feel like these are your friends now. You know them and they love you and you love them. [Applause] You're worthy of it all. You're worthy of it all. [Music] For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. [Music] You're worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. One more time. You're worthy of it all. Why don't you just lift up your hands worship worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. Amen. Amen. Before we approach our scripture, let's just approach the author this morning. If you would just bow your heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we can never, Lord, pray enough to you, Lord. And we want to just approach you, Lord, before we open your word, Lord, and before we set aside this small portion of time, Lord, and we want to just prepare the ground, Lord. And Lord, if there be any distractions, Lord, in my mind or in the in the mind of those that are listening this morning, may we just even just for a time, Lord, would you help us set those aside, Father, and may we just receive from your throne this morning, Lord. May you just take Lord just words on a page and words from a insufficient person Lord and may you just expound those Lord to the hearts of your people Lord may you just protect their ears Lord protect their hearts Lord Lord we don't want to come here out of ritual Lord and want to come here because it's a custom Lord we want to come because it's a fountain of life and Lord that we can't live unless we get another drink of life from you this morning Lord we can't live, Lord, unless we get another taste of bread from you this morning, Lord, that this is what you mean to us, Lord. This is what your word means to us. And Lord, would you just help us, Lord, to surrender for this for this time, Lord, and may we see from that, Lord, just Lord, blessings that we just can't account for, Lord, in our lives and change, Lord. We just want to approach your your word now and with the the sanctity and and the holiness that it deserves. and we just love you, Lord. We just want to tell you that and we believe that you love us, Lord. But just help us to to make way for you this morning, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. Let's read a scripture. If you have your Bibles or you want to turn in Psalms 37, two verses. Thank you, brother Daniel. Thank you, Dan. Brother Daniel Jr. as well, the musicians. Just a real inspired worship service this morning. How many feels his presence here with you this morning? Amen. And if you don't, you know, maybe just uh take another look around. Maybe just let him show you how mighty he is and let him show you how good he is. Psalms 37 verse 23 and 24 it reads like this. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delightth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. You may be seated as I turn to one more scripture if you want to turn or if you want to note it down. First Peter chapter 2. 1 Peter chapter 2, we'll read a first, let's see, five verses here, starting with verse 21. For even here unto were you called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow in his steps, who did no sin. We just heard that in the song a few moments ago about Jesus Messiah did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again. And if I just read this scripture I just want to say thank you to brother Dan as always for the invitation and um it's it's always a pleasure to come down and speak to the saints and the people here in in Tucson. Uh, I really do feel like it's a a family and I've just come to know uh some and maybe most of you and just a real love and I hope that comes through in the message that it it's more than just coming up here and repeating words or saying words, but it's a real love that I have for the people and um I hope that that comes across in the message. I certainly love brother Dan and his family and the church here and just um sorry I just want to calm my nerves a little bit. So, I just uh maybe I start talking a little bit, but I pray that the Lord would just come and help me this morning. And you know, the scripture is talking about Christ um leaving us an example. And if I look at the example that Christ leads, it uh it's a pretty high standard that Christ leaves for us to follow. Would you agree with that? Um, when I look at this and I look at the steps that I'm supposed to follow at as a human being in 2025, when somebody reviles against me, when somebody does something against me that's wrong, you know, if I had the spirit of Christ, I would not do wrong back to them. Amen. And, you know, maybe we don't maybe I don't do wrong back to them in my actions or with my my physical body, but I wonder if sometimes I think about it in my heart or in my mind about doing something back to somebody. But Christ led us gave us an example that even when he was reviled, he reviled not again. And when he suffered, and boy, we suffer, don't we? He threatened not, but committed himself to him that judges righteously, who his own self bear our sins in his body on the tree, that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes you were healed. For as you were sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls. And I think this first verse, if I if I maybe had a I don't know about a subject, I'm not real good at subject or titles, but just something I've been thinking about a lot lately is just about about footsteps in the Bible and about making progress and about moving forward. Not for the sake of moving forward, not for the sake of progress itself, but because that's what I believe that the Lord calls us to do. I'm going to set a I want to make sure that I should have set this I got a free two minutes there before setting a timer. You forgive me. All right. Uh I I believe that the Lord calls us to move forward. We hear about staying with the word. We we hear about always constantly staying with the word. Stay with the word. If the word that would seem like it would be easy to do except for the word is always moving. The word is always what you understood today may not be the same thing as tomorrow as the Lord unfolds that to you. As the Lord, you know, shows more of himself to you. I don't know if I look back, brother Dan, I was thinking about this. If I could know what I believed 10 years ago and maybe even what I spoke about 10 years ago, I probably wouldn't even agree with myself. Amen. I don't know about you. I don't know if maybe you could hear a conversation that you had with somebody and just outside of the church, maybe you had an opinion on something 10 years ago. Would you go back and would you agree with yourself now? But see, we because we grow and we learn and we gain more knowledge, we gain more experience and then thus our experience not only in the world in our daily lives, but I believe our experience with the Lord should also grow and it should also change and it should also move. Amen. And I think the Bible is calling us to make footsteps. And it says here in the scripture that the footsteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And and I love this scripture because it says uh this is an important part. Though you fall, I don't know if this is encouraging to you, but this is encouraging to me. The Bible's not saying if you're going to walk after the Lord, you're not going to fall. That's an impossible standard, and that's why it's not in the Bible. But what the Bible says is though you might stumble. That's what the translation of this. Though you might stumble, you will not fall to the ground. And why is that? Why is it that is it impossible for a son and daughter of God to really fall to the ground to be cast down? And it says it right at the end of the scriptures because the Lord has you with his hand. And he has you with his hand because he knows that you're going to fall. He knows you're going to stumble. He knows you're going to trip over your own ways, your own thoughts. You might trip over brother Dan's thoughts or mine or somebody else's words might cause you to stumble. But if you are the Lord's, he has you with his right hand. It's not going to be easy. You might you might hear something. You might see something that just I just don't understand that. I don't understand what the Bible means about that. I don't understand what the church said over here. But but watch the Lord come and say, \"Okay, I know that you might stumble over this, but I have you in my hand.\" And that to me is a comfort. And and these steps that are ordered by the Lord, it's it's it's a couple ways to look at this in my opinion, you know, the footsteps are ordered by the Lord. So in one way to look at this, the Lord is is really commanding, he's ordering you that you need to take steps, that you need to move forward. But if you don't mind, I want to read you something that is uh that kind of gave me the basis for this thought. I hadn't planned on reading this, but I I'm going to this morning. This is something that I was just had these notes and my and my wife didn't know this and and she sent me this little this little snippet. I don't know who the author was, but she goes, \"I just read this today. It was awesome.\" She didn't know what I was studying on and she sent it to me about a week and a half ago. Can I read this for you this morning? It says, uh, \"God cannot order steps that you don't take.\" I don't know. Anybody ever been on the, uh, I'll just wait and see bench? Anybody ever sat on the B? Yeah, me too, brother Daniel. Anybody say, \"I'm going to wait and see what the Lord is going to he's going to open a direction for me, and when I see that the Lord opens direction me, that's the direction I'm going to I'm going to take.\" But that's not how the Lord works. He does not order steps that you don't take. You're praying for direction while you're standing still. I again, I got to raise my hand. I pray for direction so many times. Lord, give me a direction. And when I see you give me a direction, I I promise you, Lord, I'll move in that direction. And the Lord is saying, I want you to move so that I can direct your steps. You're asking for clarity while avoiding obedience. You want God to light a path, but you won't leave the driveway. He said this this quote says that's it's again I don't know who the author is, but it says uh it would seem real inspired to me. He says that's not faith. Do we hear that? That's not faith. That's fear dressed in spiritual language. I'm afraid to move. I'm afraid to move forward. But I don't want to say that I'm afraid. I don't want to admit I'm afraid. So, I'll just say, \"Lord, I'm waiting for a direction from you.\" Because that sounds It sounds pretty good, right? Sounds pretty good. But that is fear. I'm operating actually, I'm not really doing anything, Brother Daniel, but I'm I'm I'm operating in my mind off of fear and not off of faith. God is not in the business of steering parked cars. He's a God of movement and a God who meets you on the way, not just in the waiting. He orders steps, not stagnation. Because obedience, uh, excuse me, because obedience unlocks the next instruction. I'm waiting on an instruction from the Lord, but he already gave you one, and that was to obey him. That's right. And if I can't follow that one, and I'm waiting on number two, step number two, I haven't taken step number one yet. God didn't promise to order your imagination. He promised to order your steps. That means, it's real simple this morning. It means you've got to move. Even if it's trembling, even if it's shaky. I'll tell you this. Even if you stumble, he still has you with his hand. Amen. But how are you going to stumble, brother Daniel? How are you going to stumble so that the Lord can show you that he's got you in his hand if you're standing still? I I have never seen somebody trip and fall while standing still. I I I haven't seen it yet. If you're going to stumble, it means you got to be taking a step. And you know the Lord, it talks about in Revelations about this about this day and age. Now, I I know it's kind of hard to hear about your day and age when it's a when it's a negative thing, but the book of Revelations calls the Leoysian age, which we are in a lukewarm age. It's an age of comfort. It's an age of uh complacency. It's of an age of just staying where I'm at sometimes under the guise of I'm waiting on the Lord to show me where to go. And you know, Revelations, he would say, he says this in Revelations, you know, I would actually rather that you were cold or hot. And to me, when I hear this, I hear the Lord telling me, not not just telling you, Tucson Tabernacle, he's telling me, I would rather have you take a step in the wrong direction than to do nothing. I would rather have you step out and it just be in the opposite. I know we I think most of us want the will of the Lord. I think those of us that that seek the will of the Lord, that's what we want. We don't want to just walk off randomly and we just walk around. I I believe that our heart is sincere when we're asking for direction. I believe it's sincere. But I think sometimes that we we we have complacency and we have no movement because we're waiting on the on the movement of the Lord because we're afraid again going back to fear to take a step in the wrong direction. when the Lord is saying, \"I'd rather you step in the wrong direction so that I can order your steps into my will.\" And I think that's the condition of this age. I don't want to be a part of this age. And I don't want to be in the condition of this age. I don't want to use the condition of Leoya as an excuse for my walk with the Lord. In fact, it's not a walk with the Lord unless you're taking steps and walking. I got to walk with the Lord. I you don't have a walk with the Lord unless you're walking. Even if it's in trembling, even if it's small, you don't have to take big steps. You just got to take a step. Even if it's unsure, he's not obligated to choreograph a life you refuse to participate in. And if you never lift your foot, listen now, this is just not we're talking about in the spiritual now. We're talking about decisions that we make in our lives. Amen. Decisions we make in our lives are steps. If you never lift your foot, there's nothing for him to guide. We say we trust him, but trust looks like motion. Anybody ever done a trust fall? I don't know if I want to experiment with that right now, brother Dan. Right? But you know what I'm talking about, right? You trust fall, you put your arms out. It's not a trust fall until you do what? until you you got to you got to you got to surrender all the way, right? It you might look back and you kind of stumble and put your hands out. That's not a trust fall. A trust fall doesn't happen until you fall. But you got to you got to commit to it. You got to commit to and now I don't know what it is for you because I think for every person it's different in their lives, whether it be in their natural lives, in their workplace. I'm not sure where the Lord has has got you at. I think we're in multiple places that we need to make decisions. might be in your personal life. It might be in your workplace. It might be in your church life. It might be you just you just met God and you're not sure what direction to take. Just take a step. And if you take a step with him on your mind, he's actually obligated. We're going to read here in a minute that he's actually obligated to guide you. Which I love. I love I just love when the Lord obligates himself because then it cannot fail. It can't fail. when he obligates himself, you know, if I obligate him, well, then it's kind of up to my faith and it's up to how good I'm But. But when he obligates himself, you know, it's going to happen with 100% short. I just want to finish this. It says, \"Trust looks like starting the business or applying for a job or walking away from what's breaking you or saying yes to what scares you.\" Trust looks like taking steps even when the staircase isn't finished. the or the the Lord orders the steps of a good man. Now, let's just talk about that scripture for a minute. What is a good man? And if you think that you are a good man or a good woman, let's just start right there. I know this is so basic and this is just going to be real, this is gonna be real simple. That's just where I like to stay. Um, many men and women consider themselves to be good or good enough for the Lord to order their steps. And maybe because they don't do things that they consider wrong or things they consider sin. And there are a lot of people who don't consider themselves good. But I think the danger uh one of the dangers, you think there's not a danger of going to church, but there is a danger of going to church. One of the dangers of going to church and following the Lord is that you can become religious. And actually being religious is worse than being worldly. I don't know if you I don't know if you if that how that lands, but being religious is being is worse than being worldly. We'll talk about a couple of those issues in a minute here. Maybe maybe you agree, maybe you don't agree, but maybe by the end of this you might might see what I'm talking about. Maybe because we go to church or read our Bible or pray to God, I'm good and now the Lord can order my steps. But you know, as I read the Bible and I just read real simple the Bible, there's only one person who is ever qualified to be called good. We know who that was. All right. He's the only one who's ever lived in a body of flesh and never made a mistake and never did anything wrong and never sinned and never had a an evil thought. He's the only one. And when he in the Bible was called good because he was good. And when they said good master, he said, \"Why do you call me good?\" So the one person, think about this now, I think that we could learn from this. The one person who could be called good when he was called good said, \"There's nobody good but the father.\" He refused to take on the title of good. proving to me that without the heavenly father living inside, there's not one person that's good. So if I want to have my steps ordered by the Lord, I cannot earn that. I cannot be good enough for that. I cannot come to church enough for that. I cannot uh write all the right things in my Bible or read enough scriptures for that. I can't even I can't even pray enough for me to be good. The only way that I can be good so that the Lord can order my steps is to let the one that is good inside. That's so simple. It's just a simple basic message. But that is what I believe the Lord wants us to know. And he wants us not only to know, but he wants us to put into action. Not just say, \"Oh Lord, I believe that now. Would you just come inside and and then when you come inside, I'll take a step.\" But that's not what the Lord says. No, no. Take a step towards me and I'll guide you. Take a step towards the cross and watch the cross take a step towards you. Lord, he says, \"Come unto me. Pick up your cross and follow me.\" And that's not easy. I I we were just talking about this yesterday. It's not easy to pick up your cross. Jesus himself couldn't carry his cross and he dropped it and it fell. and someone asked it's not an easy thing to pick up your cross but he says pick up your cross take a step towards me I'll take a step towards you the only way you can be good enough and you know if you don't feel if you don't feel like your steps are ordered by the Lord anybody ever feel that way that you don't your life doesn't feel like the Lord has control of it fully I think it's time to start checking the good man and see if that good man is really in the pilot's seat or do I just let him in when things are going real real bad and then things are going real real good. I take over again. I didn't plan to say any of that, so we're just going to keep moving forward. All right, I been about 15 minutes. I want to give you some some some examples in the Bible. Would that be okay? I know this is real dry. This isn't a this isn't a big hurrah message, but um for for me, it's like this is I just want to I just want to take a step in the Lord. I just want to move forward with the word. That's what I want to move forward. these uh praise the Lord. These steps are ordered by the Lord and he directs you. Let's just let's just uh change gears. He directs you in the way that he wants you to go. And I want to tell you, and I think you know this, a lot of you are older than me and have been walking this way with the Lord a lot longer. Um and you could probably back me up on this. Brother Arie has does he always direct you in the way that you want to go? No. In fact, I would say it's hardly ever in the way that I want to go. It almost always looks the opposite of the way that I think I should go. Even when my goal is to improve my life with Christ and improve my Christian walk with him, I'll say, \"This is the direction I think I need to move, and I'm going to take a step.\" And then the Lord just takes me and like just turns me this way. But that's what he promised to do. And actually, that is a good thing when he does that because that means it's like, \"Hey, you're doing okay.\" You know, maybe he looks down at the footsteps of your life and your footsteps just look like this. But if they lead to him, then he's ordered them. And at the end of the road, where do those steps lead to? Though they might have went over here, and they might have went over here because I had control. But where did they end up? That's the place that matters. The children of Israel, they were led by the Lord. So what they would do, and I think you know this, but let's just go over it real quick. They would set up a camp. So they've left Egypt, and they would set up a camp. They'd have a tent. They'd build a tabernacle. Just I'm sure it it wasn't easy. They set it up just exactly and then they would camp around it. And as they camped around it, every morning they would walk outside and what the Bible says happened is that the that the cloud, the pillar would be resting on top of the tabernacle and saying, \"This is where I want you to stay.\" And I think it says sometimes it would be days, weeks, months, and even years. They would stay in one place and they'd walk outside every morning. They would look up and they would see the cloud over the tabernacle. Okay, we're going to be here another day. I'm going to go about my business. I'm going to go take care of my flocks. I'm going to go gather some mana. I'm going to go look after my family. We're here for another day. But one day they would walk out of the tent and the pillar of fire was moving. And it doesn't matter now you could say, okay, now this is the children of Israel, but this is picture us in our own lives now. It doesn't matter how comfortable they were. They might have been in the greenest spot with the best grass and their flocks are just they're prospering and they're like, \"Man, I really like it here. I really like it. It's beautiful right here.\" When that cloud started moving, it was time to pack up and it was time to go. I think sometimes I get a little bit comfortable in church. I get a little too comfortable with my worship. I get a little bit too comfortable in my daily life. Oh Lord, I pray to you, but it's, you know, it's exactly 15 minutes or exactly 30 minutes or exactly 5 minutes. I read x amount of scriptures every sometimes I just get a little bit comfortable. And if I'm not careful, I fall into a lukewarm condition. And a lukewarm condition is not always uh it's not always that you're not doing things for the Lord and that you're doing bad things. It means that you're just doing things that are comfortable to you. So we think about the lukewarm condition is like, oh well that's somebody's just kind of wishy-washy and they're just kind of No, no, no. It might be somebody that's super dedicated. They might read their Bible every day. They might pray every day. They might make every church service without fail. But if it's done out of comfort, if it's done out of repetition, if it's done out of ritual, then it's a lukewarm condition. And I'm not saying to not do those things. I'm saying, Lord, have I I'm saying maybe we could ask the Lord, Lord, have I actually taken a step with you recently? Or am I have I taken steps and then I came to a camp? I came to a point where you did something for me. I know you did something for me. I see the Holy Spirit. I see what you've done, but now I've kind of set up camp there. There's another example of this we'll read in a minute. Every day they'd walk out and they look and and and it doesn't matter. It just it doesn't matter how comfortable they were. They packed up and they followed the Holy Spirit. Footsteps ordered by the Lord. They didn't even know where they were going. They didn't know the next place they were going to stop and camp, but they went because the Lord said to watch the Lord just ordering more steps. I I wanted to talk about Abraham a little bit. Abraham called out by the Lord. He was called out of his father's house by the Lord. You know, if you actually look into Abraham's life, Abraham was wealthy. You know, he was not called out of a bad life. He was called out of a comfortable life. He was rich. He was just living in his father's tents until he was 75 years old. Talk about somebody living at home a little bit too long, right? He was in 2025. Brother Dan, we can say he was No, you I wasn't talking about you. You still got another You still got another 50 something years. You're good. If in 50 years you're still at home, Brother Dan and I will we'll be we'll be getting together, but that's okay. He in 2025, he was like in he was in his dad's basement. Now, I don't mean to talk about Abraham that way, but that's what the Bible says. He was in his father's house. He was rich. He was comfortable. didn't have need of anything. And the Lord said, \"Okay, you're going to have to leave all that behind. Leave all the family behind.\" Is that a hard one to do? There's someone in here that know exactly what I'm talking about. Leave all the family behind. Leave the comfort of home behind. And I'm going to call you unto a place. And the Bible says, \"I'm going to call you into a place you've never been to before.\" Now, what did Abraham have to do? Now, he didn't do things the right way. This is why I love the story of Abraham. Some Sometimes Abraham is preached on. and he's talked about and he's put on this pedestal which which he's the father of the faith, don't get me wrong, but he's put on this pedestal of something that I feel like I can't obtain. And I really think if you read through the Bible and you read through the story of Abraham, it's very attainable. It's very attainable. Like like Abraham makes a lot of mistakes, but I love I love that at the end of the Bible, it doesn't talk about Abraham's mistakes. It just says he he didn't even You know what I love is that he he he actually stumbled so many times. Let's I'll just read through him a few times. He stumbled so many times. But at the end of the Bible, it says he never stumbled. That's what it says. It said he staggered not at the promises of God. But I we'll read right here in the Bible where he staggered. But yet what God saw of him and what God inspired a writer to write down, he said he never even staggered one time. Because when God now when you see your steps, I I tell you when I look back, even if listen, if you could look back, maybe somebody just took a first step into this church, you might look back and see that step and it's just all over the place. Maybe you've been here 10 years and you can look back and see those steps and they're just going like this. But when God see those steps, they're exactly the way he wants them because they're ordered. Because he knows the end. And he might look at you and you might think you are all over the place, brother Aaron. All the things that you've done wrong and all the mistakes you made, but when God looks at your steps, he goes, \"Oh, my son Aaron.\" Yeah. He's never staggered one time. Never even staggered one time. Thank God for that. Because if I was in charge of writing my own part in the Bible over there in Hebrews, it would be like he was all over the place. He failed here. He did this wrong. He thought this. He was reviled and he reviled again. Yep. He suffered and he made somebody suffer for his suffering. But thank God he writes the final chapter of my life and your life. Abraham, he starts to take steps. He's called out by the Lord. So he's he, you know, maybe you could say it was like his first day in church. He was called out by the Lord. Oh man, this feels good. I love it. This is new. I I love this. And then one chapter later, you see him in Egypt. Oh, wait a minute. I thought the Lord called him out. He called him into a promised land. In the very next chapter, we see him down in Egypt. I I asked you, what was he doing in Egypt? It wasn't doing anything good. In fact, when he went down to Egypt, he lied. First thing he did when he got there, hey, wait a minute. Okay, you're my wife, but I need you to lie and say that you're my sister, and I'm going to lie and say you're my sister. And you know, really, if you look at that, uh, if you look at Abraham on Earie's life, he wasn't actually trying to protect Sarah, right? He's trying to protect himself. That's what it says. He goes, \"They are going to look upon you and if I'm married to you, they're going to kill me. He was he had himself to me when I read the Bible, I see, okay, that's a lot of stumbling. That's a lot of mistakes.\" And that's why it's encouraging to me. And that's why the faith of Abraham is attainable to me. But you know what he was always doing? He was always moving sometimes the wrong direction right down into Egypt where he didn't belong. But he was moving, you know, right before he went into Egypt. I know this is a little bit slow, but I I I think maybe we just stay right here in this part if you're okay. So I think right before he went down to Egypt, he came out of his father's house and he built an altar and he worshiped the Lord. But then you see him down in Egypt and he and he's down there for a time and he and he tells some lies and he does some things wrong. And then the Lord directs his steps and and he says, \"I need to keep moving.\" You know what he does? He comes back to where he built the altar. And I want to ask you, have you ever been to a place where he built an altar to the Lord? And if you if if you're confused what I mean by that, I mean, has the Lord ever really truly done something for you that you remember? Amen. And if he's really I I would encourage you. I I don't know how you would build an altar. Maybe if I asked myself, how do you build an altar into the Lord in in today's day? We're not going to maybe form a pile of rocks, although maybe that would help you. But how do I build an altar to the Lord? If I'm in a church service or I I'm going to I'm in a prayer service or I'm at home and praying and the Lord does something for me, maybe through somebody else. How do I remember that? You know, you have some blank pages in your Bible and if I just had a suggestion for you, I would fill up those blank pages with some altars. You say, \"You know what? On such such today, I have some in my Bible where the Lord did some things for me.\" I write them down. I say, \"Lord, you did this for me today, and I don't want to forget about this.\" And you might say, \"I'll never forget about this.\" But you know what? There's a lot of there's a lot of trials coming your way. And sometimes it's hard to remember exactly what it was that the Lord did for you. And then you got the other side of it. You got the adversary coming to you and saying, \"He didn't do that for you.\" You just imagine that was a really good thing. Now that you're here, you realize that's that's not that great. He's going to be right there in your ear just whispering to you. I know he is because he does it to me. That wasn't really the Lord. You just imagined that. That was just a good feeling. Uh, may you were in a good service. It was good, but it was just a feeling. But look at you now. Look at all the stuff you do wrong. You're down in Egypt. You said that the Lord brought you out. You said that the Lord did something for you, but now you're down in Egypt, and you're lying again. See, I told you you weren't his seed. That's what he's telling Abraham. But Abraham had an altar. He had an altar built. And he had an altar built that said, \"This altar is to signify that the Lord called me out of my old life.\" Amen. And when I'm in trouble, I'm going to come back to this altar. It's still there. Now, he built a physical altar. I'm going to come back and I'm going to worship at this altar and I'm going to pray at this altar. This is the altar that you can't take me past. And I think maybe you just note it in your Bible. I just giving you suggestions. It's not it's not a thus sayaith the Lord type of thing. I note in your Bible, this is what the Lord has done for me on this day. He did this and nothing. Put down there. Write it down. Don't let yourself talk you out of this five years from now. Don't let the devil tell you something a year from now that this wasn't real. This is real. Come back to that altar. If you now, now listen. What's the danger of an altar is that you stay there. And if you notice, read through Abraham's life. Read through Jacob's life. He built altars, too. But he didn't stay where the altar was at. You know what he did? He moved forward. Because I think I think sometimes I've been a little guilty of the Lord doing something for me and I and I make an altar and then I just stay there and I worship at the altar and two years go by and the Lord's like, \"Have you made any progress?\" I'm like, \"Lord, I'm right here at that thing that you did for me.\" And the Lord's like, \"I did it for you, but not so you could stay there.\" Yes. Amen. Not so you could just sit right there at that altar. I did that thing for you. That is from me. That's a testimony. Tell a testimony. Tell people about what I did for you. But I need you to take some steps. I need you to move on. Now, if you get lost, if you find yourself in Egypt, you can come back to that altar cuz I did that thing for you. But that altar, the altar to God is not God. Can I say that again? The altar to the Lord that you build is not the Lord. It's just a reminder of the things that he's done for you, in case you get lost a little bit. In case you start taking steps and the steps are wrong, he can bring you right back to that altar. But that altar that Abraham built was not because if you read through Abraham, I I I I give you a I just some homework. Go read through the story of Abraham and watch the altars that he built, including the one he was going to sacrifice his own son on. But he didn't stay in those places. He comes back to it uh after after going off and kind of wandering over here into Egypt. And I want to tell you, you can come back to that altar. Just just make an altar to the Lord. You can come back. I don't care if the devil tells you you can't go back. You you you can't be that person. You've messed up too badly. No, you haven't. Can I tell you? You have not messed up too badly for the Lord. You might have stumbled, but you were not utterly cast down. If somebody, even if it's your own, Listen, I love this. We're going to get to something. Even if it's your own self, Daniel, that's telling you that you're no good, don't listen to that person either. It's not always the devil. It's not always the devil. Sometimes it's my own thoughts. My own heart says, \"Oh, you're not good enough to be a Christian. You're not good enough to be a believer. You're not good enough to be even in the same sentence as Abraham. You are not because I said so, but because God said so. And then God obligated himself. Let's read about it. He says, \"The Lord made a the Lord made a covenant with man.\" So if let's just go over what a covenant is. Would that be okay? I don't care if we don't even get any farther than this. Let's go over what a covenant is. Brother, uh, let's say I make a deal with brother Lyle. I make an agreement with brother Lyall. This is how it would work in the Bible days. And I think we all know this, but if you don't know this, it's okay. Let's learn it right now. This is how it worked in the Bible that when they made a covenant with each other, they would take some animals. Now, let's say, Brother Laauo, I tell you, I'm going to sell you my car, and you tell me you're going to buy my car. What what what they would do is they would take animals, the the poor animals, but they had to be part of this. And they would cut them. They cut them into pieces. They take a a heer, and they take a ram, and they take a goat, and they they cut them into pieces, and they make a pile over here, and they make a pile over here. And then brother Lyle and I would we would walk together between the piles of animals. And what that would signify is if I don't sell him my car or he doesn't pay me, let it be done to us what was done to those animals. That's what a covenant meant. It was serious. It wasn't just it was more than just a handshake deal. If you didn't keep your word, there was a consequence to you not keeping your word. May it be done to me what was done to those animals if I don't keep my word. to brother Lao or if he doesn't keep his word to me. That's a covenant. You know, God made those with man. You know, he made one with Adam in the beginning. He said, \"Adam, you I'm this is what I'm going to do for you and here's what you need to do.\" And Adam failed and he didn't keep his side of it. And then he makes one with Israel. Now, now he didn't want, let me tell you this, he didn't want to make this covenant with Israel. Israel wanted this covenant. He called Israel out and he said, \"Look, I will be your God. I will take care of you. I will clothe you. I will feed you. I will do everything for you. Just walk in my way.\" And now Israel, Israel made uh I think it's called the biggest mistake they've ever made. And that's what they wanted a covenant with God that says, \"God, I want you to do something and I want to do something back.\" Now, that sounds good. If you're just if you're in church and you and maybe that just sounds good to you. Wait a minute. Well, so if you mean if I'm going to serve the Lord, I'm going to do something for the Lord and then the Lord's going to do something back for me. That sounds like a pretty good arrangement. Here's the problem is that the part that you have to keep, you will never keep. Unless you think that you're good. And if you think that you're good, you already have a problem. You've already not kept part of the covenant. You and I cannot keep a covenant with the Lord. Do you realize that we cannot keep a covenant with the Lord? We might be able to make a small little promise that we know we can fulfill, but I'm talking about a lifelong covenant with the Lord. We cannot keep that. And so when the Lord comes to Abraham, I love this. This is again, it should be encouraging. He comes to Abraham. Um I think it's in I I'll tell you the chapter in a minute. So he makes a covenant with him and he says, \"Here's the animals. Split them apart. Put a pile over here. Put a pile over here.\" And Abraham does it. And then the Lord says, \"Now you're going to go to sleep.\" And Abraham sleeps. And that evening, as he sleeps next to the pile of the animals that he cuts, the Bible says a flame, a torch walked between the animals. Abraham did not wake up and walk between the animals. The covenant that the Lord made with Abraham involved one person, the Lord. Amen. He did not make it dependent on Abraham, Abraham's faith, Abraham's goodness, Abraham's works, Abraham's anything. He said, \"This covenant is going to be dependent on me, the Lord, because I can keep the covenant. It doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't matter how you live. I if I'm the only person involved in this covenant, I can keep this covenant.\" And the Bible says he swear by himself. What a person to swear by. The Lord swore by his own self that that covenant would not be broken. In fact, he said, \"Let it be done to me like these animals if I don't keep my word.\" And the Lord is more than able to keep his word. And so, I I I don't know if you've ever heard this before, and I'm sure we have, but have you ever heard that the Lord's forgiveness and the Lord's love is unconditional? I want to tell you, it's unconditional. that that that you're never ever too low or too dirty or too vile or too filthy for the Lord to come and save and the Lord to come because he didn't swear by your goodness and your works. You'll have the devil to come in and tell you, \"Oh, you're just not good enough for the Lord. You're too you've done too many wrong things for the Lord to really save.\" He only saves people who are right on the verge of goodness. But that would be the case if you had made a covenant with the Lord and you had a part to maintain. Then you would have to be worried about what you did. You'd have to be worried about what you look like. You'd have to be worried about your life. But when you accept now listen the the covenant to the Lord for the from the Lord to you is unconditional. It's it's in whatever condition you are right at this moment. He says I give you this covenant. Now where is the condition come in? on your acceptance of that forgiveness to you is unconditional. He'll forgive no matter how bad you are, no matter how vile you are, no matter how to him it would be filthy, he'll forgive you. In fact, he already has done that. That covenant has already been made with you, but you have to accept it. And and Abraham's faith was not so Abraham could live a good life. His whole faith of the faith of Abraham that we hear about was all in accepting the covenant of the Lord. He's called the father of the faith because his faith, no matter how many times he stumbled, and let me tell you, he stumbled. I tell you, he went down to Egypt, but then later on he says, uh, you know, he his his nephew Lot goes out and gets captured by by an army. He goes goes and and Abraham's going to go and get him back. read the Bible about what Abraham says. You know what he says? Uh he says to the king after he conquers him. He says, \"Now give me back my goods.\" Oh, and also, yeah, give me lot too. His priority when he was younger was not good. He didn't He was like, \"Give me my stuff back.\" Oh, also, yeah, I'll take lot too. He He You know why? Because he was growing in the Lord. Abraham was growing in the Lord. But if you see him later on, he's concerned about Lot. He's concerned. He goes and stands above the hill of Sodom and Gomorrah. And now things don't matter anymore to Abraham because he's taken steps and the Lord has grown him. He now people matter to him. Before people didn't matter to him. Oh, I guess I'll take a lot too, but give me my stuff back. But Abraham constantly taking steps in the Lord. And the Bible says that the covenant that he made with Abraham that day is not just in Galatians 3:29. He says it's not just for Abraham, but it's for his seed after him. If you be Christ's then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise. That means every single promise made to Abraham is also for his seed. And if you recognize that covenant, I think it actually changes your footsteps. Amen. Because before you're taking footsteps in your footsteps look like this. H how do I how do I get some grace from the Lord? How do I how do I get some mercy from the Lord? How do I how do I worship him the right way? And I I'm not I'm not I'm not mocking these ideas. I think they're good for us to be conscious of the Lord and what he wants. But if you don't know, take a step. You say, \"I don't know how to pray to the Lord.\" You know that a bad a bad prayer is better than no prayer. Maybe you just got to take a piece of paper and write it down. Just write it down. You know, that's better than going, \"I don't really know how to pray, so I don't pray.\" A bad step, what we would think is a bad step, is better than no step at all. Because now he can order it. Now he can say, \"I'm going to show you exactly how to do that thing that you're doing.\" And I know he's going to do it because he made a covenant that he would do it. Now, people around the country thought that Abraham had lost his mind. Did you know that? He says he's going to have a baby. They thought he was crazy. But Abraham just kept moving forward. You gonna have it? How you feeling today, Sarah? I feel the same. Praise the Lord. Another step. Another step. 25 years of just making steps. Sometimes, brother Dan, sometimes I get tired after like a week, two months waiting on the Lord, three months waiting on the Lord, couple days waiting on the Lord for an answer. Abraham waited 25 years. But what did he believe in? The covenant. And watch him make mistakes. He tried to bring the promise to pass by his own means through the handmade. When I w when I read that, I'm like, \"Okay, uh, he staggered.\" And I go back to the end of the Bible. Nope, he didn't stagger. It It's a paradox. But the Lord, see, the Lord, this is what I love is God is not, if he makes a covenant with you and you accept that covenant, he's not even going to let you mess it up. He's not even going to let me mess it up. When I would mess up, he says, \"No, no, no. I made a covenant. It cannot fail.\" So, I'm not even going to let you mess it up. So, when you do wrong, I'm not even going to see that. No, I'm not advocating that we go and do wrong. That's that somebody, you could take this and go this extreme direction. I'll just live however I want to and the Lord's just going to wink at it. What you're saying is you're not really a son of God. You're not really a daughter of God. You're not really a seed of Abraham. Abraham did what the Lord wanted him to do and he made mistakes along the way. Amen. Let's just keep moving forward. You might say and you might say, you know, like I've already failed. Like you you're telling me this sermon, but I've already messed up. And and I'm just telling you just look at look at the life of Abraham. And and I'm telling you that what Abraham gained through his life is attainable for you. And and I think that that Satan attacks us on that point. And maybe we'll just I'll try to bring this to a close. The other way that Satan attacks you. There's two ways I think that he attacks you. And one of them is this. That you are good enough to be called a child of God. Now, this attack comes, I'm going to say, for the most part, on people who have been in church for a good amount of time, maybe even like me who just grew up going to church. That's who that I don't want to use the word veteran, but if I understand if I say veteran, do you know what I'm talking about? Like somebody who's been around church or been around a church life for a while, that's the attack they have to face. The attack they have to face is that you are good enough to be called a child of God. Well, I've been sitting in a pew and I've been doing this for so and so long. We don't say these things, but sometimes with our attitude, we look at somebody who hasn't been doing that as long as us and saying, \"Well, they're not good enough. You need to be living the kind of life that I'm living.\" And you are not, you know, that that's a battle. And and I'm going tell you that if you're not in a battle, you have a big problem. So I'm telling you about two battles that you should be in. One or one or both. But if you have no battle, I think that there's a problem. And I think the problem is you might be standing still. But that's for another time. So you are good enough. You are righteous enough to be called the child of God through your works. um that your works and your deeds and your sacrifice and your preaching and your worship and your singing and your attendance and your and your prayer life and your Bible life all good things they are worthy for you to be called a child of God. You say that doesn't sound like a battle but the problem with that battle is is that you and if and I if I do this I have made myself part of the covenant with God and it's dependent on my actions. See, what I've done is I've actually by saying that I'm good enough, I have actually refused the covenant of God that he made with himself and I've say, \"I'd like to enter a new covenant with you, God, like Israel did. And I'd like this covenant to be between me and you, and I want something to do with it. Look at the good things I do. Look at the Look at Lord, look at where you brought me from and look where I'm at today. I I'm not that person that But the Lord doesn't want that because you can't keep it. You and I can't keep it. And if you're if you're not if you're if you get confidence in yourself and not confidence in him, you'll start to want that covenant with him. And I think that's one battle. And and I just think about something so simple that the Bible says he'll clothe you with his righteousness. Amen. How can he clothe you with his righteousness when you're already clothed? With your own. You got to come to him with nothing. With nothing. And I don't mean I did that, brother, at the beginning of my walk. No. No, every day I have to come to him with nothing so that he can clothe me. And the other way I think Satan attacks you is the opposite side. That you're too low and you're too filthy and that anybody ever been told by the devil you've sinned away your day of grace. Okay, so that's a battle. You're in a battle. He's told me that. He's told me that a lot. You have sinned. You are not what you say that you are. You're not this. You're no good. You say you have Christ. You say that you've accepted salvation. You say you believe in the cross. You say these things, but then you go out and make mistakes and you go out and do this thing. And then you and and then somebody did something to you and you and even in your mind, you did something back to them. And then you know, somebody like me gets up here and reads a scripture. Well, if you're reviled against, you're reviled not. And sometimes Satan uses as an opportunity to come and go, see, you're not that thing he's talking about. Has he done that to you? You're not that type of Christian he's talking about. You're a failure. you're no good. But I can I can tell you that you I if it's dependent on you, you are a failure. Can we just say it just simply and plainly? If it's dependent on you and I, then you know what? It is a failure. It's as good as it's as good as done. But there was a covenant made that has nothing to do with me. All I have to do is accept this. And if you happen to be in the position, you say, \"I don't have either one of those battles,\" then you have the first battle. I just want to tell you that if if you think you don't have, you know, none of those applied to me, the first one applied. And I just want to say because I've had the I've had the thought, Brother Aaron, where I was like, \"Oh, man. I'm I'm I'm doing pretty good.\" It's It's rare. It's rare. and it's been for a moment and then I get humbled real real quick. But if you don't have if you don't think these battles apply, I think it might be the first battle. It's time to go check the good man again. I let's just let's just kind of come to a close here. I if you want to know if your footsteps are ordered by the Lord. Yes, you can look at your life and you can look at all the things you do and say, \"Lord, have you ordered my footsteps?\" Let's look at Abraham. Abraham lied about Sarah and called her called her his sister. And then he went through a a great period with the Lord where the Lord gave him a sign of circumcision. all these things in the Bible that we don't have time to go over. Then the Lord gave him a covenant that just just with the Lord, this is after Abraham had done wrong. And then uh the Lord himself in flesh came down. You know that God created a body and came down and had lunch with Abraham. I mean what a place to be. And we we look at that and we go, man, I don't think I could ever attain that. Like I'm so full of mistakes, right? So he he and then he has his name changed. He has his name changed to what the Lord wanted his name to be. And then he stands on a hill looking over Sodom. And he he he typifies not only does he typify the bride who's not going through the tribulation down there in Sodom, but he also typifies Jesus Christ who is saying an intercessor position saying, \"If there only be a hundred, don't don't do anything to them.\" He actually takes on the intercessor part of Christ that says, \"Look, if there just be if there be 20, don't destroy that city.\" Though the city was vile. If there'd be 10, don't destroy that city. And I'll tell you, Christ took it a step further. He said, \"If there'll only be one in this church right now today, who will not bow, I'll come and I'll die.\" That's the spirit of Christ. Are you that one? There's one. There's two. Are you that one that Christ says, \"If there just be one in Tucson Tabernacle, I'll go I'll be torn apart like those animals so that they can be saved.\" You know, you know, in that covenant God made that Jesus was actually the one torn apart so that you and I could be partakers of that covenant. That before we enter into that, before we can accept it, the blood from his son is how Jesus doesn't see what you're doing. But what does that take? That takes you putting it under the blood. That's why it's not a carefree life of sin. It's not a carefree life of this. It's it's a serious thing when you really have to come before the Lord and put it under the blood. So, he's standing up on the hill. And so, just imagine your life now. Imagine you if you had met God. You sat down and you had lunch with God. And then you stand with God and you're interceding. You're actually negotiating with God for the lives of other people. I mean, you you'd probably consider yourself kind of up here, right? And then one chapter later, he goes down into another place and lies again about his wife. Same lie that he did when he had started off. And I just want to ask you, have you ever done it again? Have you ever done it again? Have you ever had the Lord take you to a place where you believe that you're free from something and then you do it again? Amen. You ever you ever communed with God, whether it be in your prayer life, whether it be in a service, and you know that he heard you and you know that you saw him and you know that he did something for you. You know he changed you. Like Abraham had your name changed. You know that he's come in and done a work in your life and then you do it again. The thing that you battle, you do it again. And it's not discouraging to me when I read about Abraham doing it again. It's encouraging. Because sometimes, brother Dan, I've done it again. You say, you've done it again and I'll do it again. Why? Because I'm a failure. And when I try to enter a covenant with God as a failure, but I fall onto the mercy. I fall onto the grace. And and I trust I there is not a time I hope I hope we never in our Christian life get to a place where we think, \"Okay, God, you can let go of me now. I can walk. I can't do it. I I can't do it.\" And there's not a man or woman that I have met that can do it. There are good people. There are there are people who are so solid in what they believe and their faith is incredible and there but I know that if the Lord lets go, they're going to fall because that covenant cannot be dependent on you. It cannot be dependent on me. It cannot be dependent on our good man. And I I don't think that it's I think that because of the way the world is and the way that sometimes even even church culture is I I'm just saying this. I don't have a plan to say this. I just want to say this the way the Lord wants it said. I think because of church culture that it's looked on as a weakness to be helped by the Lord. It's looked on as a well, you don't have faith or you don't have this or you're not the kind of Christian because the Lord has to continually have his hand on you. That is wrong. That's wrong. That is not what we should be teaching in the church. And I'm just saying churches. I'm just saying churches. I'm I'm not not saying that's taught here. I don't believe that's taught here. But I'm saying that there is a there's the wave of of of confidence put into people that doesn't belong there. If I the moment I have a confidence in myself, I I'm I have missed something. I'm in a battle that I don't want to be in. The confidence has to be in that covenant that he made. The confidence has to be in the blood of his son that he tore apart for me. That's where the confidence has to be. If it's in me, I guarantee you I will go wrong. I could not guarantee anything more than that. That if the confidence that I have is in my works, it's in my goodness, it's in my ability. And you know what that is? That's a religious spirit. And that's why it's worse to be religious than it is to be in the world. Because then at least if you're in the world and you're living a life that maybe you don't like or that you're not proud of, at least you can turn to the Lord and say, \"Lord, I need you.\" But if you're living a religious life, you know how hard it is to turn to the Lord and say, \"I need you.\" Because the religious life is, \"I already have you and I'm good.\" That's what the religious spirit is. Is that I already have the thing that I need and I'm good to go. Instead of every single day saying, \"Lord, it's not on me. It's not on me, Lord. I did it again. I'm coming back to the covenant again. And maybe you got to come back. Now, I don't believe in I don't believe in I don't think it's a good thing that if you have to keep coming to the altar of the Lord over and over and over again for the same time. I think maybe maybe you never left it. Maybe steps aren't being taken. But if you have to come back to that altar, come back to the altar and say, \"Lord, I don't know what I'm doing. I've done wrong. I've gone out here and I've done something I shouldn't have done, but I built an altar right here. That one day, that one day, whatever it was, you did something for me. And I don't know where else to go, but I'm going to come back here. Will you help me? And that's something that a religious thing when it gets on you doesn't allow you to do. It says you are good the way that you are. You deserve to be called a child of God. Look at your works. Look at all the Lord's brought you through. Forgetting that it was the Lord that brought you through it and had nothing to do with you. All I did was accept it. That's all I did. Like the simple I just accepted it. Now that you know what? Accepting it takes faith. That's the faith that Abraham because you're going to look, if you're really being honest, you're going to look in the mirror and you're say there's no way the Lord made a covenant with that thing. I hope that's how we look in the mirror. in the in in the re in the re in the mirror of the word. I'm looking Yeah, I'm looking pretty good. Pretty good Christian. That's not where I want to be. I want to look in the mirror of the word and say, \"Lord, without you, I'm lost.\" Without you, I don't care if I've been walking this way my whole life. Without you, I'm lost. And I can look back on Abraham's life and that's what I see. And I I I don't know if I could just tell you this, but we'll close if you want to come, brother Daniel and you musicians, but just stay with what the word says and know that the word is always moving. It's always unfolding. It's always opening itself up more so that we continue to move with it. Now, there's more that could be said on that, but we'll just I think I think for time's sake, maybe that's that's sufficient. But I I could just I just want to encourage you to not be afraid to take a step. Maybe that could boil down the whole message of this. Even if it's the wrong step and you find yourself in Egypt, take a step. fall back on the covenant that the Lord's made with you and and and made with himself really and just accept it and watch him order your steps. They might be like this. They might be all over the states, but where do they lead at the end? And just a I think just a real simple message, but I have forgotten to do this so many times and I've concentrated on these big things and I've I've made serving the Lord so overwhelming. You ever feel that? It's so overwhelming. It shouldn't be overwhelming. It's simple. Take him at his word. He said he's going to do it. He made a covenant. [Music] It's time for the trust fall. It's time to commit to that trust fall and say, \"Lord, I can't do this. I I cannot do this. I need you to catch me. And Lord, if it cost me my life, so be it.\" That's the kind of steps he can order. That's when he can start to work is when I have that attitude. And I don't just say it because it sounds good, but I do it. I'm standing before you today because I'm going to take a step even towards something I don't think that I want to do and like to do, but I'm going to I'm just going to take a step for in the Lord. Let the Lord direct the rest. Let him take over. Amen. I think I think that's I think I'm done. Brother Daniel, thank you. God bless you.

better each day Lord to have that determination and that fire in our heart Lord we thank you for your word and for your love and your grace to us each one in Jesus name amen we concluded Genesis chapter 37 last time but we have some unfinished business regarding Joseph being sold to spice not slave but spice traitors who then sold him into slavery in Egypt let's go back a moment for opening verses I'm not going to surprise you and jump to some other place in the Bible we're in Genesis the brothers are in Dothan Joseph is stripped starving and thirsty beaten dumped into an empty and dry sistern meanwhile callously his brothers are having a meal while they discuss what to do with them and they some or all of the nine older brothers Ruben wasn't present they sat down to eat bread uh maybe at their lunch there they had some treats that Joseph had brought from Jacob's a little nuts and honey we know that Jacob likes to send nuts and honey to people so they're sitting there maybe enjoying this snack that Joseph had brought while he was starving in the sstn and they lifted up their eyes and they looked and behold a company of Israelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing Spicer and bomb and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt the spice trade must have been pretty good camels were not in wide use at this time a domesticated camel would have been a very expensive animal and Judah the fourth oldest about age 20 he saw this and he turned to his brothers and he said what profit what what do we gain what what advantage is it if if we kill our brother and and conceal his blood come let's sell him to the ishmaelites let not our hand be upon him for even though we hate him he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content they they consented they greed and their passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they that the ishmaelite midianites brought Joseph into Egypt now we'll get back to this map in this verse in a moment skipping down to verse 36 the last verse of chapter 37 the midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto potier an officer of pharaohs and captain of the Guard Chief executioner head of the Secret Service and the FBI and the CIA and Homeland Security please be seated there are at least three questions that come to mind when we read these verses why would the brothers think they could get away with their crime against Joseph and against their father by selling Joseph to these Merchants how would they know that word wouldn't get back to Jacob why would spice Traders agree to buy a slave and why does Moses who wrote Genesis make it clear that these were ishmaelites rather than simply calling them midianites once again you know me we need to get context well let's look at the probable route from Dothan to Egypt the brothers know the area they know the likely route the caravan's going to take from Dothan to Egypt and they know Joseph do you see the problem Joseph isn't going to be appliable quiet guys they attach them to the pack animals and force them to walk the next 300 miles to and across the scorching Sinai desert into Egypt he's young strong can survive the journey but he'll be talking he'll be bleading he'll recognize some of the route as well assume they cover 25 or 30 miles a day on the second day of the journey they're going to pass within 20 miles of heon of Jacob's home hey guys listen to me my my my dad's a very wealthy man very wealthy and if we just detour or or if you can send one of your servants to to Hebron look on the map I've got a little dashed red line for you to follow here my my dad he'll pay you a huge Ransom many times more than you can possibly make by by selling me to the Egyptian slave market you guys are all about making a profit right my my dad will pay plenty for me I tell you no questions asked he he's rich and I'm his favorite no no really I I I am Hey Hey My My grandpa Isaac and your grandpa Ishmael they're Brothers we're some sort of cousins we're family guys guys why won't you to listen to me please ow ow ow why are you hitting me shut up you filthy Hebrew we're going to take you to Egypt frankly we don't care if we lose money on you we're just going to enjoy seeing you suffer and know that you'll be suffering for as long as you live your short life toiling in the hot Egyptian sun you think it's only your brothers that hate you well what's really going on why wouldn't they make a small d sort to cash in on Joseph and how could the brothers have absolute confidence that Joseph would not succeed in persuading these Merchants to do so why would they be willing to risk everything for 20 shekels you're right we need more context first let's look at Midian where these guys came from but not looking so much at the place but but the person after whom the place is named the the founder if you will he was born to Abraham of coutura flashback 125 years or so Genesis 251 then again long after Hagar's departure sometime following Sarah's death Abraham took a wife and her name was coutura she bear him zimran and yakin and Medan and I and ishack and shua yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm shua we often think of Abraham as having two sons ishmail and Isaac but we see he had at least eight skipping down to verse five Abraham gave gave all that he had unto Isaac but Unto the Sons of the concubines zimran Jan mid Midian ishac and shua which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived Eastward into the East Country into the desert so the midianites were among the disinherited of Abraham Midian received a gift but not an inheritance he was sent away into the desert the Arabian penins Pula Abraham wanted nothing further to do with him nor they him when Abraham died and was buried none of curra's sons were listed as present Midian settled in an area he named after himself it's the area marked on the lower right of the screen it's in present day Saudi Arabia it's the place to which Moses the guy writing this book would later Flee for his life from Egypt and possibly where he began to write Genesis after leaving Egypt the second time moving on who was the first born of Abraham wasn't Isaac it was ishmail born of Hagar sarai's Egyptian slave Sarai who later became Sarah and Abram who later became Abraham received a promise of a son he had Faith Abraham believed God but he didn't trust God for the timing tried to take matters into his own hand slept with sarai's slave Hagar because Sarai didn't trust God's timing either well what did the Lord say about ishmail to Hagar his mother when she fled for her life from Sarai before ishmail was born the angel of the Lord found Hagar by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shure and he said Hagar sise maid once comest thou whether wilt thou go where are you coming from where where are you headed and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarah and the angel of the Lord said unto her this Egyptian slave said unto her her return to thy mistress submit thyself under her hands and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy descendants exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude you're going to get through this and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child this is not news to her but the rest of it is and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael God will hear because the Lord hath heard thy Affliction he'll be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he'll dwell in the presence of of all his Brethren ESV ends with he shall dwell over against or near all his Kinsmen well we expect ishmail and likely his descendants to be at odds with Isaac and his descendants and ishmael's descendants of course are called ishmaelites well Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born Genesis 16:16 it's on the handout all the scriptures that that I'm referencing although this ones may not be because we're not actually reading it he was a hundred years old when Isaac was born 14 years later Genesis 215 how is ishmail ultimately treated by Abraham let's flash back to the Celebration when the toddler Isaac was weaned at about three years of age making ishmail about 17 Genesis 219 and Sarah saw ishmail the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne unto Abraham mocking kind of like a normal teenage boy right 17 years old his three-year-old half brother over here look at this little God wherefore Sarah said unto Abraham Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son the son of this Bond woman should not be air with my son not not with my Isaac well the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son Abraham loved ishmail they were buddies they were pal they got along God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy Bond woman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called Abraham she may be throwing a hisy fit but listen to your wife whoa excuse me I don't know where we're at now we'll get there sorry I don't know what happened here you're getting a sneak preview well hopefully it'll come back oh okay thank you and also the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he's thy seed he's your Offspring he's your descendant Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle like a win skin a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar and putting it on her shoulder why ishmail is this strong strapping 17-year-old boy Hagar's carrying it because she's a slave and the child ishma now AED 17 and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beva that's the southern part of modern day Israel and Islam the Quran claims that hegar was in Medina not Bersa their version of the miracle to be described in the next few verses is why Medina is the second holiest place in that religion and the water was spent in the bottle they they drank it it's a long way they've been Walking In the Heat of the desert and and Hagar cast Ishmael under one of the shrubs a little shade and she went and sat down over against him a good way off about a bow shot a few hundred feet maybe from from here to the to the back wall of the church there or so and she said let let me not see the death of the child and she sat over opposite him to lift lifted up her voice and wept oh Lord what is this happening in her distress she forgot the promise that the angel of the Lord had made to her some 17 or 18 years earlier when I'm stressed out that she usually when I need to be reminded as well that's when I tend to forget and God heard the voice of Hagar no we have no idea but he heard the voice of ishmail he heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God Called to the lad no to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aith the Hagar fear not God ha heard your voice no God has heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad hold him in thine hand I will make him a great nation he's reminding hegar the promise he made to her before ishmail was born just like the previous time she's in the wilderness she's fleeing from Sarah and I'm a little nervous here okay and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water just like before in the desert and there's some water and she went and filled the bottle of water and gave the lad drink and God was with ishmail and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness became an Archer he dwelt in the wilderness of pan and Hagar took him a wife out of the land of Egypt you can be sure ishmael's descendants knew the story of the banishment visited upon Him by Abraham and Sarah and here in Dothan are descendants of Isaac the favored son who got the birthright and inheritance that should have been ishmael's Joseph's brothers are offering these ishmaelites from Midian another ill-treated son of Abraham the son favored by Jacob who himself is the son of Isaac whom Abraham favored over ishmail this is the the Hatfields and The McCoys there we go how can the Israelites refuse and at 20 pieces of silver the price is cheap these guys could afford camels the brothers knew that there's no way these ishmaelite spice Traders from Midian will ever let Joseph Escape nor sell him back to Jacob Joseph is going to Egypt to a life of slavery performing harsh labor in their broiling sun or toiling in a mine probably dying in early death how the Merchant's eyes must have glistened at the thought ah Sweet Revenge and even better his suffering will be in Egypt where our matriarch Hagar came from as what a Slave how old was our ancestor Ishmael when he was banished with Hagar 17 how old is this Hebrew grandson of the usurper Isaac the favorite of his father Jacob 17 She Came From Slavery you're going into slavery oh the irony yeah we'll take them well we'll only give you 20 pieces of silver and the brothers thought good riddance good luck with those dreams Joey bye-bye and now begins a 300 mile trk it is uncomfortable these guys hate him for what he represents yet yet that very hatred is what is saving Joseph's life but what's really going on here let's let's turn to Psalm 105 I'm using the SV for clarity here Psalm 105 opens up oh give thanks to the Lord always a good idea call upon his name make known his deeds among the peoples sing to him sing praises to Him tell of all his wondrous Works glory in His holy name let the hearts of those who seek the Lord Rejoice well what may be included in this list of deeds and wondrous works for which we are to sing praises to the Lord Brother Lyall I thought we were in the story of Joseph oh oh yeah you're you're right oh oh ver verse 16 when the Lord summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread the Lord sent a man ahead of Jacob's family Joseph who was sold as a slave Joseph's feet were hurt with Fetters his neck was put in a collar of iron until what he said came to pass the word of the Lord tested Joseph the Lord was sending Joseph to Egypt just not the way we often think of these things not on a jet airliner Warn and air conditioned automobile not staying in nice hotels eating in restaurants speaking to Friendly groups before jetting home not moving to a town with a church to attend but be en and starved Shackled betrayed dehydrated thirsting to a life of unrequited toil years later Isaiah knew this story of Joseph's hardship and misery deception and pain yet Isaiah said here am I Lord send me send me back to Joseph's Journey no mercy from his ishmaelite owners other than to keep him alive so he'll be marketable hot thirsty hungry sunburnt the metal collar even hotter in the sun burning his neck the shackles doing the same to his ankles and feet chafing them besides the heat feet swollen ankles raw bleeding blistered don't want him trying to run away and the smell not just sweat animal dung in urine the usual odors along our primitive Road or track but the spices many of these spices weren't for flavoring food they were for perfumes and incense the Egyptians that that could afford it would mix them with animal fat then put a GOP of it on their heads maybe smear some in other parts of their bodies their cleanly shaved bodies was a custom in Egypt amongst the elite as the day wore on the fat would melt run down their scalp neck and so forth to help offset the odors of an Agricultural Society replacing it with the fragrances of the elite I don't know about you but to me that sounds pretty disgusting would you want to put a glob of lard on your head mixed with some sort of cologne or perfume then let it heat up in the Sun and dribble down your face and neck neither would I but the Egyptians did and many of these spices were particularly aromatic they fetched a good price among the upper classes in Egypt and that's what Joseph would smell for the long forced March of two weeks or so the spices and other Goods weren't in hermetically sealed containers or wrapped in plastic bags or wrapped from Costco or something they were in poorest Sachs forced to along to a foreign land among people speaking a language he doesn't understand strange Customs a religion full of various gods and goddesses and very different culture far from home he would be associating these smells of the elite with the Heartbreak of leaving his family the cruel rejection of his brothers the taunt mistreatment by his owners pain hunger thirst The Thirst towards the end of his journey he would pass the Eastern edge of the Nile Delta an area we know is Goan on on the map here that's here this is uh it may not look terribly green to you but this is the Nile river flowing here you can see the desert's all brown and this is a very fertile area he's coming from Dothan coming down across the Sinai now he's at the edge of Goan at the Eastern edge of the Nile Delta it's Lush fertile almost tropical plenty of water lakes ducks and geese all sorts of wildlife he'd never seen before beautiful place little did he know that it would become the home of his clan as they became a nation a bit further on leaving the Delta area he would pass own later called heliopolis by the Greeks it was a center for among other things worship of the sun today this is a location in Cairo near the airport and there were multiple obelisks there well part of sun god worship these were Granite needle-like structures one piece stood on end with no supports not in a socket or got on a pit just flat on the bottom and placed on a solid surface unlike anything he'd ever seen this Obelisk and the photograph was erected at own to celebrate the 30th year of the reign of pharaoh cus R first shown on the right among other things sinus read the first established diplomatic and trade relations with various towns in Syria and Canaan which would have helped enable the Caravan of the ishmaelites to trade when Joseph passed by on his way to the slave market in Memphis this Obelisk would have been less than 50 years old this is an old photograph it's maybe a hundred years old or so of one of the obelisks that sesr one set which Joseph saw a solid piece of red granite standing 69 ft tall weighing 120 tons you can get some impression been size by the man standing next to the base which I've circled that's a full-size man not a kid that is one massive thing and here it is standing in the same place unmoved the weather War 4,000 years later it's the only Obelisk still standing in own it would have been new when Joseph walked by he would have seen it and oh by the way there may have been a a little girl playing outside as he was marched by perhaps she she stopped and looked up when she caught the powerful scent of the passing spice Caravan that smells like my daddy if so she might have noticed the out ofpl slave Tethered to the end of the line after it passed she probably went back to playing with her friends a a little girl daughter of the priest of an that would someday be Joseph's wife become the matriarch of two tribes of Israel and the only wife of any of Jacob's sons that is named in the Bible a very special little girl to a young man who had never seen anything more imposing than perhaps a two-story Stone building or a defensive wall around a small City such a sight must have been awe inspiring a gigantic pillar of granite carved with strange symbols just standing there he must have been wondering who are these people how can they do things like this as he continued on to the Nile he must have marveled at the size of the river in an utterly Barren desert much wider and deeper than the branch of the Euphrates near his boyhood home or the Jordan that he crossed about six years old coming into Canaan looking across it he would have spotted the Giza plateau and the mighty pyramids upon it pyramids that were only a few hundred years old the tallest most massive structures in the ancient world the Egyptians were masters of stonecraft many of their accomplishments are still all inspiring just ask the folks in the picture finally they came to Memphis the nominal capital of may have been U just outside of Memphis and established about the time Joseph arrived archaeological evidence suggest it was a little more than one of the royal residences the capital before then was stes another 400 miles further south along the Nile Egypt was earlier and from time to time became again two kingdoms with the capital for the lower Kingdom and for the upper Kingdom the reason for the capital shifting from time to time time from the Delta to thieves well let's rejoin Joseph now we've got a lot of context here let's rejoin Joseph as he arrives in the slave market Genesis 37 King James the midianite sold Joseph into Egypt unto potier an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard and in the ESV we read meanwhile most translations read meanwhile as as Jacob is mourning his son and won't be comforted meanwhile the midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to pitifer an officer of pharaoh the captain of the Guard now you may have noticed that chapter 37 which we read last time and had been reviewing this evening so far never mentions God I've skipped around and read from other chapters where references to God are present but in chapter 37 his mention is conspicuously absent he does doesn't speak he isn't even referred to moses' ancient audience may have been wondering just like Joseph and Jacob must have been wondering Where's God has he abandoned me why is all this bad stuff happening what did I do to bring it about and of course why me have you ever had the meanwhiles wondered where God was in the midst of your life let's do a quick summary an overview of part of chapter 37 and as we leave it to see the hand of God working in the background Joseph had to be sent from heon by his dad exactly when he was so he could arrive at sheam precisely when he did so he could happen to encounter a stranger who had just happened to overhear the brothers saying they were going to Dothan Dothan which just happened to be a perfect place to inspire a murder Ruben had to persuade his brothers postpone the kill and his rescue plan had to fail the passing traitors had to be Israelites who happened to have a grudge against Jacob and they had to be on the to gilean to Egypt spice route that just happened to go through Dothan they had to arrive at the precise moment that the brothers were eating and they had to have a motive for refusing a large reward for returning Joseph to his father they had to take him to a specific City in Egypt and to sell them on a specific day to a specific Man Who Would happened to be in the slave market at the moment Joseph was for sale and happened to have a use for another young male slave and happen to be Pharaoh's captain of the Guard God did and does use all sorts of people with diverse motives orchestrating the entire sequence in his perfect timing working behind the scenes with his invisible hand guiding it all just as we read in Psalm 105 God sent Joseph to Egypt and used people motivated by hatred and jealousy to accomplish his will back to our story chapter 38 deals with Judah and we'll get to it God willing at a future date because judah's story of transformation runs parallel to Joseph's and when they intersect well you won't want to miss it chapter 39 opens with a repeat of the last verse of chapter 37 with one significant addition shesis 391 Joseph was brought down to Egypt potier an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Israelites which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph the Lord was with Joseph I've been told I can't confirm that one Jewish tradition says that potier smelled the aroma that's associated with nobility as he passed near the slave market that Aroma shouldn't be there unless a heavily guarded Noble was present but in His official capacity he would have known of such a visit he had not been advised so he rushed in to potentially defend the unknown Noble who might need protection from the sort of folks that Gather in such places the sight of potier charging into the slave market looking for the source of the aroma would have struck fear in the people he's the captain of the Guard the Royal executioner a very powerful and physically intimidating person the crowd's perspective would have been one of intimidation by his sudden presence there would be a sudden hush fall on the Marketplace Piper's perspective would be surprise perhaps confusion and instead of seeing a noble perhaps in need of protection he sees a young man on the slave block that smells of nobility yet is clearly a foreigner young and strong though clearly abused Joseph's perspective on The Auction Block in a bewildering Place one of the largest cities in the world at that that time hearing a language that he doesn't yet speak in the midst of a culture he certainly doesn't understand among people whose values are very different than his and smelling like the spices he's been marching and sleeping with for the past several days a fragrance the crowd would associate with their oppressors and overlords making the crowd hostile towards him everybody hates me and suddenly this Hulk of a guy comes charging in weapon drawn searching the suddenly silent crowd and then he stares at Joseph eyes locked comes closer perhaps he sniffs Joseph wonders what's going on who is this guy potier walks to the person running the slave market indicates Joseph transactions concluded Joseph's shackles and collar removed Potter for points Joseph walks out of the market just ahead of him people moving out of the way clearing a path not because of Joseph that'll happen many years later right now he's just a foreign slave no the crowd Parts because of the guy right behind him potier one of the most powerful and feared men in the country how did this happen and the Lord was with Joseph and always had been H looks like we still have time let's move on into chapter 39 the Lord was with Joseph he was a prosperous man that takes time several years and he was in the house of his master Piper the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with Joseph and that the Lord made all that Joseph did to prosper in his hand Joseph found Grace in Piper's sight and he served potier and pfer made Joseph overseer over his house and all that potterer had he put into Joseph's hand this is a big deal today we'd say he was promoted through the ranks from janitor to the Sea Suite he became the Chief Operating Officer the the COO of the plantation and Piper's other business interests it came to pass from the time that Piper had made Joseph Overseer in his house and all that he had since he' made him his coo that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that Piper had in the house and in the field this represents the passive of some years it's from the Nile potier didn't March Joseph from the market to his house have a conversation along the way check out his LinkedIn profile on his ey Stone and decide to put Joseph in charge of everything upon their arrival at the place let me see here you dream you wear a fancy coat you help watch flocks of sheep you file reports wow you're just a guy I've been looking for it to run my business no no Joseph would have been put in the slave quarters taught how to do the most menial tasks learned to speak the Egyptian language hey Hebrew that means muck out the cattle stalls now go do it we learn from verse five that Piper had fields in fact Middle Kingdom Egypt officials were often compensated with land to farm for food and trade as as a high official Piper's Holdings would have been extensive near the time of Joseph an Egyptian official named MRI was buried his tomb was robbed but a sealed off area was Miss by the thieves thousands of years later it was eventually found by archaeologists it contained lots of detailed wooden models of Life on his estate this is a 4,000 year old wooden model of a cattle stall you can see the cattle you can see the people taking care of them the model on the left is of a granery with six workers filling the storage areas and several scribes keeping accounts it must have been a government officials six people are working and eight or nine people are keeping track of them I'm sorry I shouldn't just said that the model on the right is of a slaughterous with cattle and geese being butchered the models provide a glimpse of a state life in Joseph's era over a period of at least a few years Piper would have taken note of this exceptional servant for Joseph to become prosperous successful takes time and work determination Joseph would have spent years in the field learning the seasons how to plant how to get the best yield how to harvest and winnow and thresh and store and preserve grain after all in his first Dream he saw sheep of wheat Joseph needs to learn to master all aspects of Agriculture related to wheat he's in the field he's getting some Hands-On training and but specifically such agriculture is practiced in Egypt recall years earlier there was a famine in Canaan and Abram traveled to Egypt why because unlike the surrounding areas Egypt did not depend on local seasonal rains for crops the Nile is the longest river in the world traveling some 4,000 miles from the mountain mountains of East Africa modern day Uganda and Ethiopia nearby areas to the Mediterranean Sea the equatorial rains there far away from the Mediterranean fed the sources of the Nile the resulting flooding of the Nile came every year like clockwork the river would rise depositing fresh soil replenishing the Aid Desert along its banks when the floods receded the farmers then went into the mud and planted their crops as the water continued to recede lacking irrigation pumps the Farm Workers would employ device called a shaduf to move water from the river to the fields the result was good soil a reliable supply of water for agriculture very different from agriculture in Canan and Mesopotamia which depended on local seasonal rain often unreliable and a very real threat of famine and certainly all quite new to a Shepherd like Joseph and meanwhile there's always a meanwhile Joseph applied himself to learn the Customs the culture the language the dress of Egypt and and his station within that hierarchy as he eventually Advanced he learned how to win the trust and loyalty of those he managed how to motivate them to get the best from them and with complete Integrity to obtain Grace favor with his master poer I suspect Joseph's attitude became one of gratitude he could have been sold to a cruel Master condemned to work in the minds of the Sinai or the sewage pits who knows but the Lord was with Joseph and he prospered years of toil in the fields gaining experience and responsibility and eventually potier left all that he had in Joseph's hand he knew not ought that he had he didn't worry about anything he had no concern about anything except the bread which he did eat what's cooking today the estate was booming abundant crops healthy cattle everything running smoothly with excellent results and we're told Joseph was a goodly person and and well favored by now in his mid-20s Joseph was not only successful and smart and wise he was also a strong good-looking young man other translations say he was handsome well-built attractive should be no surprise he came from a line of Attractive people great grandma Sarah was attractive enough she was wanted by an earlier Pharaoh Grandma Rebecca was another good-looking woman as was his mom Rachel the Bible rarely comments on physical appearances but these three ladies along on with Joseph are described to set the stage for what happens next Joseph's been proed he's no longer working in the fields now he's working in the house danger works in the house centuries later Solomon would observe talking about a father's advice to his son for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life life and here's part of what this will protect you from to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids Solomon certainly was an expert in this area back to our text this time in the ESV is a language is a bit easier to follow as Joseph speaks after a time his m Piper's Wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said lie with me potier was a powerful man he may have been a poor husband but this isn't just about hormones or having an affair with a hired help she wants to dominate Joseph she wants to be in control manipulate him and maintain her self-image of irresistibility but Joseph much to her surprise bewilderment and embarrassment refused and said to his master's wife behold because of me Integrity honesty trustworthiness my master Piper has no concern about anything in the house he's put everything everything that he has in my charge he's not greater in his own house than I am nor has he kept back anything from me except you because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness against my master pfer and sin against God Joseph's God his religion is not the Egyptian religion with its many gods and goddesses and elaborate rituals he's a foreigner his God is foreign to the Egyptians and Joseph even as a slave torn from his home still worships and believes in the god of his fathers but he is also a hormonal young man in his mid 20s lonely subject to all the thoughts and desires that go with that and here's a beautiful woman urging him to satisfy his own longings and telling what he probably wants to hear you can be sure he was tempted as we read in Psalms God was testing him all the while Joseph isn't an angel he's human but he knows to give in would be wrong his final argument is that it would displease God so he resists another good lesson for us in whatever circumstances we find ourselves to trust in God and not willfully sin against him resist Temptations to sin resist means active engagement fighting I've never had to resist taking street drugs I've never taken them and never had any desire to they have no Allure or hold on me but other things in my life were Temptations I've had to fight to resist not always successfully and as she spoke to Joseph day after day relentlessly pursuing him he would not listen to her to lie beside her or to be with her you can be sure Mrs P was a beautiful Egyptian woman she was a mistress of the Palace of a very powerful and feared senior Egyptian official she was accustomed to getting her way no one denied her anything Joseph is painstakingly avoiding her avoiding any situation that could lead to her winning this battle whether by her strength his weakness or both battling day after day she was persistent she saw Joseph was carefully avoiding her her traps yet she was constantly coming on to him it's only reasonable the other servants in the house saw and heard and knew it was going on Joseph may not have been the first young man she went about to seduce but Joseph was probably the first to not fall for her WS or be threatened by her position to comply with her demands the struggle goes on it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within coincidence or had Mrs P instructed them to hide themselves or sent them to go do some task that we get them away from being near her when she saw or knew Joseph was on his way Joseph was being very careful to never be alone with her he managed the routine of the house so he was no doubt surprised caught off guard when entered the house and no one else was visible and Mrs potier caught him by His Garment she grabbed she seized his Kilt saying lie with me and Joseph left His Garment in her hand and fled and got out escaped to the outside the image on the right of the slide is from a tomb of a noble about Joseph's time the noble is standing next to his wife he can see her hand around around his waist and you can see how he's dressed you may have seen art depicting Joseph wearing a cloak or a robe or some turbine some heavy medieval stuff a lot of Renaissance artists thought that Egypt was in northern Europe I think they didn't dress like that in Egypt so Mrs P was grabbing at nothing more than the short cotton or linen skirt or Kilt when he ran out of the palace he was almost certainly wearing nothing and it came to pass when she saw that Joseph had left His Garment in her hand she had a tight grip on it as he pulled himself away and was fled forth out of the house he was gone and she was a woman scorned she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see she shows him Joseph's skirt pfer brought an in Hebrew one to us to mock to make fun of us laugh at us he he came in unto me to to to lie with me to force himself on me and I cried with a loud voice when he came at me I screamed she's rehearsing the story she wants the servants to provide to back up her later accusations the verse tells us she didn't shout when she called the men she didn't have to raise her voice they weren't very far away at the end she claims that she cried with a loud voice if what she was telling them was true the men would have already been there and she would have not had to call for them she would have been pushing and fighting not holding on to Joseph's Kilt not trying to keep him there in other words she was saying here's the deal as you can see this is that Hebrew Joseph's Kilt he came in here to attack me but screamed yeah I know you never heard me scream but I did what you heard me when I just now asked you to come you must have been distracted or something because remember if you're asked I screamed and that's when you came running got it and it came to pass when Joseph heard that I was screaming he left his garment with me and fled and and ran out of the house I screamed so loud he ran out and H and left his clothing behind it's nonsense of course no one heard a scream it was her pre-planned setup to seduce Joseph Joseph expected the servants to be around invisible doing their normal work routine they weren't and Mrs spottier grabbed his skirt and demanded that he be with her he ran off while she clung to his Egyptian cotton Kilt which came off and rabinal Legends asserts was torn and she held on while he pulled away so she kept Joseph's garment by her until potier came home and she spake unto her husband according to these words [Music] say the Hebrew servant which which you brought onto us he came in to mock me what happened it's all your fault poer you brought this disgusting slave into our house and made him your personal servant look what he did when he saw his chance he came on to me that nasty filthy Hebrew it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and screamed he left his garment with me it fled out it came to pass when pfer heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this man did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled and Joseph's Master took him and that's for next time what can we take away from this that can help us today Joseph was in a terrible situation he'd been treated evily by his brothers and by the ishmaelites yet he was successful in spite of it all the musicians would would please come Paul tells us in Romans 1221 be not overcome of evil Joseph but overcome evil with good his situation with Mrs P reminds us not only of Solomon's admonition in Proverbs but of the wisdom which Paul expressed in his letter to the Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians 5:22 were told abstain from all appearance of evil don't enable it right Joseph was careful to be sure others were around whenever he was in the house never alone with Mrs P a few verses earlier Paul tells those in thessalonia thessalonica see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you this is good advice we see it at work in Joseph's life in all situations good or bad God's will is that we follow for that which is good that we Rejoice that we pray and that we give thanks even when things seem insurmountable the situation impossible like Joseph is once again facing as we'll see next time let's let's sing as we close and brother Daniel Comes got any rivers you think are uncrossable God any rivers you think are uncrossable got any mountains you can't tunnel [Music] through God Specializes in things

spice Traders and and coming into Goan and seeing the the vegetation rise up in this beautiful place and these these giant um monuments built in the Mastery of the Egyptians and all that they did and

halelujah [Music] Stephanie and I were out walking the other day and we were talking about talking about brother ly's sermon last Wednesday and talking about um what I preached on on Sunday and I said honey these people these prophets these great Servants of God they were just like you and me I said we've learned that and Stephanie said she said but there's one big difference she said they've suffered they suffered a lot more than any of us have ever suffered and you wonder why they had such great character I have nothing else Fit For A King except this Hallelujah imagine Joseph down there in that well imagine Joseph these people that hate hate him not because of because of Joseph but because he was a Hebrew and they were ishmaelites and that rivalry between Isaac and ishmail comes all the way down to today and we see that hatred that that is just as prevalent today as it was when Joseph was there look at what happened in our day brother ly so eloquently said it they said they hate you they hated Joseph and they didn't care if it was 20 pieces of silver they didn't care if if his dad would have paid him more and look what they did a year ago to the Hebrews and look at how they made them suffer and look at look at the the ruthlessness it's not nothing's changed that rivalry is still here brother L thank you so much for showing us that makes it makes makes it so plain these prophets wow what a hard life Mrs P what a nasty woman you know and and what a great young man with with such character and I love what brother Lyall said that Mrs P this probably wasn't her first time Joseph he didn't fall for it God bless his loyal heart that character that is in these prophets I believe we can have that same character we may not suffer as much as they suffer and I know when we suffer boy it's it's hard on us but it does build character I am yeah amen all I have is a Hallelujah to give to the Lord I want to continue on with these great characters in The Bible Well um the L will come to the the last chapter of Joseph the Lord's willing next Wednesday and then we'll start up I might try to pull on brother Aaron a little bit more maybe you can help out in some of these lessons maybe some mothers could help on u in teaching about these these men of God and one thing that's been on my heart and I would like the church um to give me some feedback on this brother Jordan and I were talking before service and uh he told me something that that has been on my heart for a long time and and we did it a little bit on Sunday night but I would like to take a topic that you might not understand that and it could be it could be personal finances it could be music it could be it could be different translations of the Bible something that you don't understand that that would help you if if you did have a better understanding of it why do we do certain things rather Christians do certain things as long as it's bible-based um bring it tell one of the deacons or or tell one of the brothers tell Daniel and get the message to me and maybe we could devote a service here and there a Wednesday night to talking about these questions that you might have these subjects in the Bible and I and I could go through different places um that they are in the Bible and and help you to understand because you got to understand it'll help you and and just because the Pastor said so it doesn't cut it it's because brother brandom said so you need more you need to really understand these things so if you have something on your heart tell one of the brothers and and they can get it to me and give me some time to pray about it and and time to study on it and we can do some of those subjects I I would like um would you like to do that does it sound like a good idea I hope so um if it doesn't it won't do it but I I think um I wish somebody would have I wish I'd have had something like that when I was a kid um and I could just say you know I just I just don't understand I don't understand why we do these things I don't understand where in the Bible are my are is and divorce how come we don't believe in divorce we see it in Deuteronomy we see it in different places why do we not believe in it you know when I'm when I'm when I want to get married what type of a of a man or what type of a woman should I marry and where is that in the Bible whatever it is it's on your heart and I know that I know we'll be blessed by the brothers and bringing out these different characters in The Bible and I I want to be a good pastor I want to be able to show you these things in God's word Amen brother Josiah you come up and close in prayer my [Music] friend dear Lord Jesus we love you so much so inspiring this evening to hear about this character Joseph Lord I think we

of the Lord tonight while I have brother Kurt good to see you my friend well I have you standing let's turn in our Bibles [Music] let's turn to First Timothy chapter one it's a scripture I believe to lay a good foundation for this Acts chapter 9. First Timothy chapter 1 verse 12. and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer a persecutor and injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus those words of your servant the Apostle Paul father is we see his ministry begin tonight in this book of Acts father we pray that you would lay your blessings upon the word as I read it and Lord may we have the understanding to benefit from it and father to to appreciate it we love you Lord we ask that you join us in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats sister Eunice pointed out that I'm hoarse it's because yesterday's Services um last night they were uh there was there's a lot of uh the the volume was raised especially when I was speaking so that's that's why the vocal cards aren't in as such as good a shape as they usually are um it's good to see everyone it's it's good to see you know I was thinking about our young people have for the past couple days and and I'm just so proud of them sister Olivia a little sister I'm proud of you you know when you come into church and you're here and um you're just good kids it was so I'm so honored to see the the Roberts family there in church last night and wow they just looked they were just like glowed you know walking in there and I may be a little bit biased but wow am I proud I just I feel good about our our kids they um they're first class and I'm honored that that they would want to come to church and I want to make church somewhere that they enjoy coming that's why we have some of the projects we're working on I want I want this to be a place that they like to come to um and I I don't see Kenneth back there I grew up I woke up grumpy this morning too I didn't I didn't get enough sleep so God bless the little guy I could for the Jordan I relate to him and you know what Hosanna I think is my favorite song so so yeah I relate to the little guy um this saw or this uh Acts chapter 9 is that as I said this morning it's a pivotal pivotal place in this book of Acts and and really in all Christian history in Acts chapter 8 that we just went through but the Lyle preached on we see that Saul was consenting to the death of Stephen and we see another deacon besides Stephen who was stoned he was murdered we have another Deacon rise on the scene this man's name's Philip we heard where Philip came from and and we see Philip had Evangelistic meetings in these different places and then we see this man Simon the Sorcerer he comes in and and he starts he he looks and he likes this and he became he becomes a Believer and then he sees that these disciples are laying their hands on the people and then these people are receiving the Holy Ghost so Simon says he said Simon Says I wonder if that were that where that comes from Simon the Sorcerer says he says that he wants to be able to he wants to not receive necessarily the Holy Spirit but he wants that power that where he can lay hands on other people and they can receive the Holy Spirit and he offers to pay the disciples and we see that Peter rebukes him and then all of a sudden we see Philip back out and he's out in the desert and he's he's going along the Lord leads him to this man of great stature this important Ethiopian man and Philip jumps on his his Carriage there and he introduces him to the Lord Jesus and to me it's so interesting that he introduces him to the Lord Jesus by the word he was reading the word and you see this man and he saw the revelation of it and then he gave his heart to the Lord I'm going to talk today that there's different ways that people give their hearts to the Lord Jesus so we see this Ethiopian he gives his heart to the Lord through the interpretation of the scripture and then as brother Lyle pointed out they're out in the middle of the desert and all of a sudden they find water I'd like to know about a while where it was it was in an oasis was it some sort of a man-made pool what was it but that Ethiopian eunuch he says Hey and He commands The Chariot to stop commands it stop and he says here's water what prevents me from being baptized and Philip says if you believe with all your heart and he says I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and then Philip baptizes him there so let's start with a scripture here before we get to Acts chapter 9 let's start with another scripture and that's Philippians chapter 3 and it just kind of it sets a mood really for for who this man is that that was struck down that we're going to read about here in a minute that how much this man appreciates the Lord Jesus further on in his ministry Philippians chapter 3 let's start with verse 3. this is who is now known when this is written as the Apostle Paul and he says this for we are the circumcision which worship God and in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I'm more circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteous which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ wow yea doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord it's important that word right there my Lord we're going to hear something about that in in the scriptures coming for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and in the power of his resurrection and in The Fellowship of his sufferings be made conformable unto his death those are very very important things and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings really says that this man is the Christ if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after that if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus so he's saying here that I want to get a hold of the same Jesus that got a hold of me now this is 8064 according to your Bible said if you have a Scofield bible probably everybody knows this but if you have a Scofield bible in the in the sinner between the between the two readings here in the center and at the top it tells you the date the estimated date of when these things took place so according to to these dates Paul was struck down on the road to Damascus in 80 35 and he wrote this in Philippians in 1864. so this is some 30 years later and he's still had that that Zeal not as though I had already attained it either were made already perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that I may get a hold of that for which I am apprehended of Christ that that which got a hold of me and I'm still searching for it brother Kurt 30 years later there is this great man the Apostle Paul and he's still searching for it he still has a desire there's this still this burning desire to have it you know when we receive the holy spirit that doesn't mean it's like okay I got it I'm done no that fire starts burning and then it just burns more and more and more you just want more of the Holy Ghost and more of it brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the prize to I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus what beautiful words and you can tell those words just come from his heart he just loves it and he says he says you know he says I used to be this and even here 30 years later he still mentions it I used to be this but I am still pressing towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God and we see this man Saul as I said in in chapter 8 he started making Havoc of the church he started just going after them and and there was this just this hatred that he had for these people that didn't believe like him and he saw that this cult maybe was spreading and he's on his way to Damascus which is north of Jerusalem we see that that all of this what he would call a mess all of this stuff started in Jerusalem maybe in this Upper Room and then it went out and all of a sudden there's thousands of people who are following this this ministry of this man who's dead now and they're saying that he rose again and now it's starting to spread outside the city of Jerusalem and he sees that this place in Damascus this is a place a high population center for the Jews and so he goes and and he wants to kind of quarantine this place Jerusalem kind of like covid you know they had the coveted shutdowns and they shut down all the flights and all that here's what Paul is doing he wants to just just isolate it to them then we can kill them all in here put them in jail rather than having this squirt out and and then we have to chase them down all over the place so so Paul is he's looking how can we stop this and the problem in Saul's mind was you have this bunch of people who are following this man that was indicted convicted sentenced and executed put in the grave and now they're saying that this man raised from the dead how can this be true now it's it's proven Paul would say no no this is proven that this man didn't raise from the dead this was you know I've got the evidence here we've got witnesses that he didn't in fact you know this man Jesus was propagating this this prophecy before he died and that's maybe where where all and then it was he said it enough times Jesus said it enough time so people could jot it down so this was going around that Jesus had prophesied of his death I'll redo Matthew 16 21 quickly it says this from the time from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day now there's many scriptures of this prophecy being given openly so so many could hear it not the least of these is Matthew chapter 12 verse 40. it says Jesus talk and says this for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth so Jesus had prophesied that this was going to happen so so you have to look at it from Saul's perspective he's like okay he prophesied it now these disciples they're going to go and they're going to make it happen right so in Matthew 28 verse 12. I think we should read this one this is after Jesus died after he rose from the dead Matthew 28 verse 12 and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day wow this is a rumor and look how this rumor stuck and this must have surely was in Saul's mind or else he wouldn't have been able to justify what he's doing and how this a rumor like that and like the Bible says here it's it's probably reported under this day maybe 2000 years later how a rumor or a lie can stick with someone their whole life it can be said and it can be an exaggeration and then that said about that person and then people want to believe often want to believe that lie and then it's told from here to here to here and that person has that stigma for their whole lives even if it never happened it's a perfect example right here in the scriptures do you remember um it's in the Deep College to the deep that video when the the uh the people are coming in the prayer line and there was this nervous woman that came up there and brother Branham said something like there's a dark shadow over you and and he says I see he says it's a lie he said someone has told a lie about you they called you a witch and it was making it was just ruining her health and and she and she had a heart problem because of it and brother Brown said don't worry about that he says he said you know that's that's that's what's causing your heart problems go and and be healed or and recover whatever it was that lady had a lie was told about her and how those things they just stay with us and their rumors and you hear them today you hear them about brother Brianna many of us people have told rumors about us and and it's like you know what somebody told someone told that about me 30 years ago and it's not it's just not true but then it'll creep up it'll pop up and it'll go down and then and then it'll come but we should be so so careful so this trip as Saul he's heard these stories and this trip to Damascus is it's a long way it's not just over to Bethlehem it's a ways up there I don't know brother why what is a few days probably back then I would say something like that so so Saul's going and this hatred is just building in him and you know how you you stew about stuff you know you might somebody you might think that somebody did you wrong or you might think about about somebody that that maybe lied or did or stole something or took money and and it just it builds within you and you don't talk to that person you know how it is we've all done it right yeah we've all done it and and you think well I'm gonna I'm gonna tell him this or I'm gonna tell her that and and you get this whole scenario in your mind if if she says this I'm going to say that and and this and this and this and this well how come it never works out that way it never works out the way that we have it in our minds how how this scenario and that's what happened with this man Saul thank God so he is he's going and it's building and it's building and he's he gets almost he gets almost to this place Damascus and he's gonna stop by and he's going to get these papers from the Sanhedrin I assuming is and I'm going to take them out he needs permission to do it acts chapter 9 verse 1. by the way don't worry I'm not even going to get close to finished so we'll we'll stop when we stop and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went under the high priest now notice Saul's a leader here he's a young man but he's a leader and he had access to the high priest and he had he had the confidence of the high priest and the call and the high priest had enough confidence in him to write these letters this permission and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem who was it was you sister Debbie who was talking about the way was it sister Amelia yeah so so sister Emily is out there and overheard her talking about this the way and that they they weren't called Christians yet that word has not been invented so this is this is the way I'm not quoting the Mandalorian if anybody probably don't but brother Joe you laughed but but anyways this that's what they call them of this way and so uh he's going and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're shined let me go back to that one I want to make sure I read every word that if you found any in this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're shined round about him a light from heaven now later on when Paul was telling this story to this King Agrippa he's the grandson of King Herod um he tells it that this happened in the middle of the day and he said that this light later on as I said this this light was brighter than the sun that struck him down and notice it says there it says and suddenly so this happened this was a surprise he's just going along and he's getting fired up in Damascus maybe is out in the distance and he's going and all of a sudden Wham everything changes you know we talk about testimonies a lot and we love to hear each other's testimony and we love to give our own testimonies some people give their hearts you know there's just something inside of them pulling and then um telling them to go to church and then and then when there's an altar call we find them at the altar and and they may be weeping and and then something changes in their life we saw that last night where there's many that came to the Altar and I've still been getting testimonies about how that that that changed them coming to the Altar and then there's then there's other times that we've seen that that people can they might get a disease they might get heart disease they might get cancer or something like that and then all of a sudden they get serious about the Lord there was a there was when I was in Jeffersonville I got a phone call somebody had been watching YouTube and he was just searching religion or something and he came to brother branham's sermon on the token and he started listening to that and wow I like what this guy is saying so he got through and then he so he Googled it and he found our phone number he called and and uh it got sent to me he said I want to talk to somebody about the ministry he says he says I just want to give my heart to the Lord the phone called came to me I picked up the phone there was no hello from him that wasn't anything I said hello this is Daniel Evans he said I need the token what a way to start a conversation so started talking with them and the brother was just sincere man he was first class and and I caught he was living in Pennsylvania I called up a pastor a friend of mine there and the brother baptized him in the name of the Lord and you know when people first come to the Lord there's this sweet innocence that you see especially someone that that hasn't been around and I noticed in this brother and there was another brother that the same thing happened a similar phone call a similar thing someone I think gave him a track and he called and um he just fell in love with the Lord Jesus and both of these brothers the one brother's name is Adam the other one is Craig um Craig lived in Alaska and Adam as I said lived in Pennsylvania but they saw they would see how the Bible teaches and then they they really enjoyed brother branham's message they saw brother Brandon's message taught and then they would ask brother you know brother Branham taught against denominations and he said boy every time I listen to him he's against denominations he said man it seems like there's a lot of denominations out there and people that believe brother Brianna I was like huh really and both both these brothers said that and they they look they have this innocent way of looking and they say well the segregation this this group believes this and this group believes this and he said brother they're in the same town and I can drive across town in like seven minutes how come they're not in the same church that's like brother hey uh when you figure that out you tell me um then uh another another one that called one time so so they just it was witnessed to them so another one that called one time it was someone that saw a billboard and it had our website on there they went to the website it was a it was a girl young lady and she called I believe she was in Mobile Alabama I'm not positive about that but it was an Air Force Base there and she was in the Air Force and she called up and she said yeah she says I I started studying your website and she said um this teaching on the godhead she said I have a group of Christian friends she said would you teach our Bible study on the phone I said yeah I'd love to do that so they would call in and there was this group this group of soldiers these Air Force people and we'd have a Bible studies we talked we talked about whatever subject they wanted to and we talked about the godhead and and how that when you have the Trinity there's there's a problem because when you're praying who are you praying to the father or the son are the two most common you don't see people really praying to the Holy Spirit but how does that work when you have a monotheistic God but it sounds like you have two here so so we went through that and it was really successful then we went into the serpent seed and that's what really got them so there's a couple of that little bible study tonight one I believe um I think she's at brother Yancey's church and the other one um I don't know where he is but just a group of people just just gave their hearts to the Lord just so open and so so willing to hear and willing to understand these things and that's the same thing that happened to this Ethiopian that was out in in the desert he was reading this he's like man I just don't understand this and then this man of God came and said well why don't you understand it explained it and then the brother gave his heart to the Lord verse number four now he had just seen this light and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuteth it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks this is a this is a big time scripture right here they're all big time but this one there's just so much into it there was something about this Pharisee that knew this was God speaking to him this miracle he had fell on the ground and he was a he was afraid he was blind he started shaking and he says who are you Lord he knew that this one speaking to him was a supernatural being it wasn't just falling down and hitting your head it was something big and when he said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting you can imagine the fear that came on this man this is the one that I wanted to destroy this is the one that I didn't think was real and now he's speaking to me and he's speaking to me out of this light we just look at the significance of this moment and a few scriptures later we're gonna we're gonna see that it was in fact Christ that was speaking right there I think we already know that anyways let me read this quote to you from Brother Branham he says this the presence of God unrecognized he says when the light the pillar of Fire smote Paul down on the road to Damascus he recognized that he was in the presence of God now that Hebrew would have never called any other Spirit Lord besides he know that he was the that was the same Pillar of Fire that led his people out of the wilderness he said Lord who are you Saul Saul why persecuted thou me he said I am Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I return to God he was that fire that was in the burning bush that led Moses through the Wilderness and he returned back to that and now here he was on the road down to Damascus was stricken down I want to read another scripture that you've maybe never considered that's first Timothy chapter 6 verse 13. listen to this same Apostle speaking he says this I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keepeth this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the King of Kings and the Lord of lords now listen to this who only hath immortality so there's no way for the job we can live forever live eternally if it's not for this man Jesus Christ dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom the honor and power Everlasting amen this unapproachable light as Paul said is where this Christ dwells for time's sake I'm going to now let's do it we got time First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1. moreover brother and I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures this is the same man that was going to Damascus to kill everybody because they believed this and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve and after that he was seen above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles we're talking about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus here and I like this and here's Paul and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of due time so Paul is saying that my experience on that road to Damascus where this light came in and spoke to me it is the same as you all when you walked with him and talked with him and saw him the resurrected Christ I have the same experience because I met him on this road and he trembling back to acts six I mean back to Acts 9. verse 6. and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do now here right here in this scripture here is the evidence of Paul's conversion you know you hear about people giving their hearts to the Lord and Paul says Lord right here he's converted sister Shirley he's it's the old Paul's done he says I believe him now and he is addressing him as Lord he says Lord now look at it now look at a converted sinner what will you have me to do we see Paul under his own confession he's convert converted there and now as we when we give our hearts to the lord it's not Lord what can you do for me when we come to the altar or we may be praying or we may we may be on the road to Damascus and struck down but now it's it's Lord what would you have me do I'll stop doing this I'll stop doing that I'll start doing this I'll start doing whatever you want me to do the conversion of a sinner and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man okay since it's a Bible study we've got to stop right here for a minute this is an important one yeah this is what probably most Scholars say here is an absolute contradiction in the Bible I'm going to tell you why they say that let me read it again and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man brother if you could put an acts 22 9 for me brother Branham answered this question on questions and answers somebody asked him this question now look at that look at right here now let me read Acts 9 7 again you look up there and when the man journeyed with me stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man acts 22 9 says this and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me it says they heard the voice says they didn't hear the voice all right seems like a contradiction right do you know the answer I don't either sorry sorry I don't have to sorry to lift you up now I can come up with a solution that would work but I flat out don't know brother random someone asked him you know what brother Brown said of course I would know if he said he said I don't know he did he said you know he said he said if you don't know just say you don't know and and that's this is one of those things no it's not a contradiction this Bible is inspired and true from Genesis to revelation and there's many you can look up many different explanations to why this seems to contradict which one is correct I don't know so I wanted to mention that if you're ever faced with that that question verse number eight and Saul arose from the Earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and when he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink now this is a serious time for Paul was he fasting or was he depressed and upset I don't know but we know he didn't eat or drink and imagine how he felt during this space of three days he must have felt so bad I bet you Stephen kept coming to his mind and just just struggling with that Lord what have I done I mean I make little mistakes and I I just I feel terrible this was a Whopper that the the Apostle made he was he was the chief persecutor of God's people and you'll notice that Jesus said when Jesus spoke to him he said Saul Saul why persecute us thou me Jesus was not on the Earth we don't know if Paul ever knew Jesus we don't know if he was ever in a ever in a in a meeting we don't know anything we don't know there's no record of Paul ever seeing him well no we do have a record I just read it he didn't see him until he was resurrected in the light so we know Paul was not never there but how could Jesus say you're persecuting me it was because that he was persecuting his people so we need to be careful whoever that we're talking to or talking about or or in any way you're against Christ you're not against Joe Miller you're not against Daniel Evans you're against him so we should always use caution and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision ananias he said behold I'm here Lord I might want to go backwards you know what let me just read it in the good book here um it says here in verse 5. let's go back to verse five did I skip that it says this and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul saw why persecute us thou me and he said who art thou Lord and said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks I want to stop there for a second I've given the explanation of what that is it's a very important scripture to me when he says saw Saul why persecute it stop me it's hard for thee to kick against the Pricks but that word kick against the Pricks if you look I believe it's in the Scofield I'm not sure but that word Pricks is also called goads goads and a goad is something that you prod cattle with so when when he said it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks he's saying Saul I have been trying to hurt you too to the gospel you in your way of understanding in in your way of believing yeah you're educated you have you have a PhD yes you've grown up in this message yes you know all of these things but it's hard for you because I'm trying to move you and you kick against me this this goad is a it's it's instrument about this long it's a stick that's got a point on the end usually it's a point made of brass back then it's it's pointy and it's got a hook that comes back and when when they're trying to get the oxes to go into the shoot or wherever they poke them to get them to go and these oxes will kick back or a cow will kick back and they're just fighting against the one that's trying to push him in there and when they try to fight against them they probably get hurt worse it would be better if we would just go where God is leading us instead of being like Saul here instead of being so caught up in our way of thinking but no Jesus is like come on can't you see I've been trying to hurt you and you just kick against me and he trembling and astonish said Lord what will that have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the man which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and Saul Rose from the Earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was there for three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision ananias and he said behold I'm here Lord you know one of the things I'll stop right there for a second one of the things that I've heard so much growing up is that God will only speak to his prophet how many times have we heard that God will only speak to his prophet and then it'll go out that changed at the day of Pentecost now God speaks to the individual and we see this man ananias we don't know anything about you know we don't see him much in the scriptures he's just a Christian but he was on such a relationship with God that Jesus is going to speak to ananias right here I like ananias this isn't the one that was married to Sapphira they're two different ones and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in the vision ananias and he said behold I am here and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth I'd like to preach a sermon on that one day for behold he prayeth how sweet I'm hearing his prayers look at the import importance God places on prayer here and at this point he doesn't say that he's a messenger to the Gentiles he doesn't say that he's going to write most of the New Testament he doesn't say any of that he just says he's praying and had seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight now the Lord Jesus is telling ananias that hey Saul's already heard about this and he's expecting you then ananias answered well let me let me read this and he had seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem he's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this guy's big time this guy is putting people in prison he's he's sentencing people to death he's I mean he's dangerous and I'm gonna go to him and he's got the authority here in my city in Damascus from the chief priest to do whatever he wants to us and here he hath The Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer from my name's sake wow can you imagine this conversation first of all ananias is talking to the same resurrected Jesus Christ that Paul was talking to and I think about as I was I was sitting in the office there and I was I was reading this again and I was I was like wait a minute look at the difference between the Lord Jesus and the angel Gabriel I was thinking whoa ananiah said I'm afraid of this guy Gabriel comes down and talks to Zechariah John the Baptist dad and he comes down and he says Zechariah God has heard your prayers God is going to send you a son and and he's going to be this great person and Zachariah says how can this happen because I'm old and Gabriel says listen you're not going to speak a word until this child is born just rips him and he hear the Lord Jesus look at the tender hand of the Lord he says no ananias he's going to do great things and I just compared those two and and the Lord Jesus is the one Gabriel answers to and here here is just look at that Spirit difference there and ananias went his way and entered the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that hath appeared unto thee in the way as thou Hast as thou came it hath as Alchemist hath sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost do you see why we call each other brother and sister I love this part brother Saul how did he say that when he went to him this guy's big time did he say brother Saul God bless you I doubt it or was it uh uh brother Saul uh or or was it brother Saul I would have liked to seen that greeting right there brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and I want to point out something else in your King James Bible if you look at that verse 17 right there it won't show it on here but verse 17 it reads like this and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus do you see how even is in italics you know what that means it means that that word was added to the text that the King James translators it doesn't make sense Hebrew does not directly translate to English and here Greek doesn't directly translate to English it doesn't make sense if you do that so these translators they have to input words in there to make it make sense I'm not I when I read my Bible I read different translations I really like the English Standard Version so I'm not a King James only type of person but I do really appreciate the King James that they they'll put that in italics just to say hey we added this just so you know so it'll make sense that's what you get when we get a Bible study um let me read that again and ananias went his way and entered the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou acamest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost I I do appreciate this ananias again thinking of brother Jonathan's sermon this morning ananias didn't judge Saul I mean in in you can imagine these conversations among the Believers running him down Sam what a creep this guy is and how evil he is and all of this but here comes ananias gives him the right hand of Fellowship says brother Saul further and immediately that fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized now most importantly in that scripture we see Paul Saul was baptized just like any other believers of Jesus he had to come the same way now one thing that is very interesting to me we don't see how Saul reacted to receiving the Holy Ghost I don't think it's anywhere in the Bible I haven't found it how this man saw did he speak in tongues did he did it just did he just accept it and the Holy Ghost came in we don't really see that testimony did it happen right here when he was baptized we don't know but we know that the prophecy was that you would receive the Holy Ghost and we know if anybody had the Holy Ghost it was it was Paul but in this I don't necessarily see a place where he received it and how he received it which encourages me because I can just see that everyone receives it in different ways and I believe this man saw I don't know how it entered into him by by the laying on the hands or whatever it was but I do appreciate the author here Luke maybe not putting it in there I don't know if he did it on purpose I don't know if Paul said don't do it but from my studies and brother Lyle maybe you'll get to it when you come to it I haven't seen the actual time like when Peter received it we know the actual time when the disciples received it when Cornelius received it when all these ones received it we see the time but not in in this brother and I do uh I also want to mention as as we're our times winding down wow I uh didn't even get as far as I thought um I want to mention this that it says here and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized so the Apostle here was healed at that moment these scales fell off and he received his sight but I've heard so many times a statement that it sounds really good but we have to be careful when things just sound good and this one sounds really good I have heard when people are praying for healing or their their their seeking their healing and God starts to do something I've heard people say that God doesn't do things halfway that you'll receive it'll be completely gone that's not according to scripture and I I know that we we think that oh this is this is Jesus and Jesus healed Saul and and and the scales fell down or um this person was healed of cancer but but then later on they get cancer again friends we are all going to if God doesn't come everyone in this room is going to get sick and die every one of us if Jesus doesn't come so when when we say things like that no God can heal us and he does heal us of cancer I've seen people completely healed of cancer but I've also seen people like my mother who was honored deathbed Stephanie was there Daniel was there my mom could not even get up out of a chair and walk she was so bad stage four breast cancer she couldn't move she couldn't raise her arms she couldn't do hardly anything and we were there we were we were having a worship service and we prayed for my mom and the Lord came in and healed her honey she stood up you remember she hadn't stood up for weeks she was so bad so eaten up with cancer she stood up that arm that had been six months that she couldn't raise she raised raised both of those arms up and was worshiping the Lord with us the next day not a week later the next day she hiked in Charlestown State Park she hadn't been able to walk in months she couldn't she was out hiking and going yet later God took her with cancer but it was still to the glory of God so when when people say those things they mean well but they're not necessarily scripture Galatians chapter 6. says this verse 11. this is Paul the Apostle again writing a letter and he says this you see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand it's a little hint that Paul struggled with his eyesight from that point to the rest of his life he even says he did in other places sometimes he says he has a thorn in his flesh some people say it was his eyesight because we know that that he did struggle with his eyesight other people say it was sickness I don't really know what it was but Paul we do know after he was healed and he was healed he struggled with his eyesight so we see that God has his perfect way of doing it and his ways are not our ways his ways are perfect our ways aren't Let's uh let's have the musicians come friends I'm sorry I was so slow I just love this this book so much brother Lyle sorry my friend I'm gonna have to we're gonna have to to come back to this this one and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God but all that hurt him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name on this name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound under the chief priests but Saul increased the more look at the overcomer all of the stuff that it was set against solid and he could have just quit quit and went back to the synagogue but he stayed with it God bless the Apostle Paul God bless his life then Saul was certain days with the disciples that were Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God Amen way to go Saul keep doing it but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on the name on this name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound into the chief priests but Saul increased the more in strength this is his own people the Christians are are saying this but Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ all the other translations that I looked at says proving that this is the very Christ and after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him you know how soon are friends forsake us yeah this is just right after Paul got his conversion all of his friends in the synagogues all of his fellow Pharisees they're right there and they they turned against him and even so they conspired to kill him hmm I don't see any of Paul's friends old friends the Pharisees sticking with them there may have been some but they're not that I can see they're not recorded but they're laying in weight was known of Saul these people are trying to kill him and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in the basket ah he's starting to get accepted by the disciples now and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he is saved to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believe not that he was a disciple look at that and Saul was come to Jerusalem and he said he was he wanted to join himself with the disciples but they were afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple for heaven's sakes these are the people that are casting out Devils these are the people that are causing uh cripples to walk these are the people that are raising the dead and they can't believe that this man was converted and there's thousands of converts just coming all the time and they can't believe that this man's Saul of Tarsus is a convert that's how bad he was I mean he was worse than the guy at the gate called Beautiful when his in his crippled this man saw they couldn't even they couldn't believe that I stood up when I read that come on are you serious all right I'll close with Barnabas I like Barnabas and Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus now remember Barnabas this is the guy that sold his land and gave it gave it all to the disciples he was somebody that had great respect and look at how this man that had such respect among the disciples he vouched for him he said no he's a servant he's a servant of God and when he was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem then he spiked boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay in let's close there I like this let me read that verse number 27 one more time but Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way he was he was given the testimony hey here's what happened to him here's Paul's testimony how he had seen the Lord and the Lord in the way that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of the Lord Jesus so here's brother Barnabas and he's saying oh this guy's the real deal he's a Christian he loves the Lord he's been preaching the same thing that we've been preaching he's been successful in doing it and by the way he's got one of the most amazing testimonies that you've ever heard in your life that's this man Saul I got Jordan back there laughs think about Barnabas think about that great man and here he is laying his reputation on the line for this man's song and we see now that the Lord had blessed him and and what a great ministry what a great ministry this man had and it's starting right here in the book of Acts chapter 9. would you love it don't you love it this is how it all got started we're a Christian Church right here this is a Christian Church these all started 2 000 years ago in Jerusalem and now they're spreading up to Damascus we got we got ananias up there and Damascus and and Barnabas up there feels good feels good to have have a church that we can Fellowship in that that we can worship in and it all started right there friends I'll get to I'll finish the book of Acts chapter 9 on Wednesday let's stand [Music] Jordan [Music] [Applause] [Music] just [Music] foreign [Music] all realize [Music] it was in prayer for the Andy Andre would you come in close in prayer my brother foreign [Applause] [Music] so when we hear about the ax what what our boy was saying about the apostles it can encourage us to to have Grace toward each other that means I can see that Apostles they were not perfect they were men so even What the Lord Has Done for Paul it was difficult for them to accept Paul in their among I mean among them so you see so that means like they were humans but also filled with the Holy Ghost so that doesn't mean when you have the Holy Ghost you don't go to trials you don't have that's why we have differences in the message because we are humans so what we can be sure that the Holy Spirit who started to work will complete it in US [Music] amen do you have any father you are the same yesterday today and forever oh God we want to be like

We've got a a praise here from our sister Rebecca Zubbran. Praising the Lord. My dad, John Brunan, is home recovering. You may recall several weeks ago he uh fell off a ladder and severely broke his leg in a few places. And he's home now, still in therapy, still still recovering, but uh praising the Lord. He still has a bit to cover, says the note. And also reminds me that our uh sister Susan Lipicard in Switzerland that had that uh cancer operation and she's still at home recovering. We don't want to just because a request has been brought up every week doesn't mean that we should forget about those that have been brought. Got a very serious request this morning from our sister Erica Morales. Please really put this one in your heart. Please pray for me and my daughter Gia. Monday we are filing emergency papers for sole custody of her. Her home life with her father is no longer livable. So please, she's with me now. Nothing is more precious in our lives than our children. And to see them raised in an atmosphere of love and respect, being raised to serve the Lord, to honor him, to realize our relationship with each other. That this one really touched my heart. If we can just go to the Lord in prayer. If you have anything on your heart, anything at all, especially especially if it's for someone else, then please let's go to the Lord. Lord Jesus, we're in awe of you. Nothing nothing compares as we just sang. Mountains will bow down, Lord. Nothing can stand before the power of your name, Lord, with your spirit behind it and in your will. Lord, we pray for healing, Lord, for those that have asked for it, Lord, and for Lord, all those that are suffering, Lord. I I I I think of uh of my niece up in Presca going undergoing all the the cancer therapy and everything right now, Lord, but especially for this prayer for our sister Erica, Lord, and this home life, Lord, for her daughter that she could just be brought into the into that home, Lord, where where you are recognized, Lord, and where there's that love, Lord, that respect and there's no uh abuse or whatever the issues are that are going on that we don't know the details, but you know every detail. We thank you for this service this morning. I thank you that so many are here to worship you, to acknowledge you, to be together, Lord, in unity and faith, Lord, and just the love that you've placed in our hearts for one another. Bring us together now, Lord. And as our pastor comes to bring the word this morning and and another song or two of worship, Lord, and praise, Lord, and just recognizing our place, Lord, with respect to you, how we love you, Lord. How we Lord, we're just so grateful. We just want to say thank you and thank you again. And Lord, for the offerings and the gifts that are coming, Lord, we just pray that they'd be used in accordance with your will and for your purposes to further the kingdom, to bring others in, Lord, to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. We thank you and we worship you in Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can all have your seats. [Music] We could get some more guitar right here on this. this one. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm praying for everything's going to be all right. Lord, I see another battle. It's out in front of me. I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. He said, \"Do you remember where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you've come.\" And every time you ask me, \"Didn't I deliver you?\" So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? &gt;&gt; Didn't I walk on the water? &gt;&gt; I calmed the raging sea. &gt;&gt; I spoke to the wind and hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your resue? And I hear you when you call. &gt;&gt; I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. &gt;&gt; Then I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins. &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I do it all again. Well, she's talking to her father. She's hurt and so confused. She has no one she can turn to. Just God alone. She hears a voice so still and low. Says a move like that before. I'll do this little thing for you. I'll give you so much more. Didn't I walk on the water? Didn't I calm the raging sea? &gt;&gt; I spoke to the wind. &gt;&gt; It hushed and I gave you peace. Then I run to your resue. Then I hear you when you called. I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Did I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin? &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you. Oh, I do it all again. Did I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin? &gt;&gt; I searched until I found you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I do it all again. [Applause] This song has been on my heart for a little while. Uh, keep putting off singing it, but uh, finally decided to sing it. But, uh, name of the c the song is the cross. And, uh, there's a couple lines in the second verse that really speak to me. Um, who told you grace can't reach the messed up ones like you? Has the devil made you believe the lies he tells are true? When you're sure that you're the one who's wandered too far off, it's not too late. Just come home to the cross. So, um, actually the one I wanted was actually verse two. Everybody's got a list at least a mile long of every scar and every sin from everywhere where we've done wrong. I know we see our own faults and we build a list and other people build a list against us, but Christ doesn't see that list. The the next lines are but there's reason for rejoicing. The reason is because that list was nailed to the cross. So if you know it, sing it with me. [Music] [Music] You've been trying hard to bear the weight of all your shame. And if there's a God up there, you're sure he forgot your name. When your steps are getting heavy and hope looks all but lost, just bring it all to the cross. Who told you grace can't reach messed up ones like you? Has the devil made you believe the lies he tells are true? When you're sure that you're the one who's wonder too far off, it's not too late. Just come home to the cross. Come and see your savior's love that would die to make you new. Nothing you have ever done can change what mercy's done for you. And if you ever wonder if you're worth so great a cause, look up and see the cross. Everybody's got a list at least a mile long. every scar and every sin from everywhere we've done wrong. But there's reason for rejoicing. And the reason is because that list was nailed to the cross. Come and see a Savior's love that would die to make you new. Nothing you have ever done can change what mercy's done for you. And if you ever wonder if your word so great a cost, look up and see the cross. He was wounded for your wounds. Pierced for all your sins. By his stripes you are healed. He died so you could rise again. He let the blood and water flow. Did it all. Let you know you're the reason that he went to the cross. Oh, he's calling you to run home to the cross. Come and see Savior's love that would die to make you new. Nothing you have ever done can change what mercy's done for you. And if you ever wonder if you're worth so great a cause, look up and see the cross. Look up and see the cross. Look up and see the cross. [Applause] Thank you, brother Michael. Would you all stand with me as brother Daniel gets ready to come? We're going to sing, \"What a friend we have in Jesus.\" There's a line in here that says, uh, \"Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.\" It says, \"Needless pain we bear. which sometimes offends people because they say, \"My pain is real. What needless pain we bear just because all we have to do is give it to the Lord.\" The man who wrote this song was from Ireland. He moved to Canada, got engaged, and his fiance died the night before their wedding. So, he moved back out east. uh in eastern Canada and several years later got engaged again and again his wife to be died twice. He had that happen to him and he wrote in a tear stained letter these words to his mother. What a friend we have in Jesus. I would say that this this man had some pain that he bore in his life and he said we bear it and we hold on to it and we carry it with us only because we don't just give it to the Lord if we just give it to the Lord in prayer. Let's sing this verse. His name was Joseph Scriven. And I think this song is more alive than it was when he first wrote it. What a friend we have in Jesus. [Music] All our sins and griefs to bear. Oh, what a privilege to care. Read everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace. Oh, what peace we often forfeit. [Music] Oh, what needless pain we bear. [Music] All because we do not care. everything to God in prayer. As brother Daniel comes, let's just sing that again. Let's raise our hands to the Lord. What a friend we have in Jesus. [Music] all our sins and griefs to bear. What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; What an understatement about what a friend that we have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is truly a friend. He's been a friend to me my whole life. He's been a friend to you. What a friend that we can take whatever we have and just lay it before him in prayer. Let's pray. Lord God, thank you. Thank you for the spirit that's here this morning. Thank you for the congregation. Thank you for a place that we have to worship. Lord, thank you that you have been such a friend to us. Lord, there's there's not a friend in the world that we can count on except for you. That you will be there no matter what, Father. that you are with us and you told us, you made a promise that you will never leave us nor forsake us. Lord, we hold to that promise. We love you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. I think brother Ly said he feels good. I feel good, too. It's a beautiful, beautiful day. Welcome to visitors. I uh saw Brother Timman and Sister Peggy in the back. Welcome, Mr. Naomi Walters's brother and her sister-in-law. God bless you. It's good to have you. [Applause] And then I met a young man, uh I believe Josiah invited him to church. Ashton, where you at? Oh, you're way in the back. Welcome, Ashton. Good to see you. God bless you. Oh, Brother Joe, Sister Carrie Hogensson, I uh it's so good to see you again. I saw you on Wednesday and I just feel a kindred spirit with both of you. It's it's good to have you in service. They're longtime friends, I think, to many people here, especially Brother Ly, Sister Heather. It's good to have you in service. Welcome. [Applause] And I I don't know if I missed anybody. Boy, we got Tony and Stephanie brought the whole clan today. We got we got uh we got seven and we got Maddox and then we have Matt and then we have Mary, Mama Mary. We have the mother of Tony and uh then we have uh Micah, right? Where's M? Micah. Micah here. Good to have you. Good to have the whole family. And then of course, brother Mitchell, the father of them all. The father of them all. God, God bless you. And if I missed you, sister, welcome. If I missed any of the visitors, God bless you. It's It's good to have you in service. We um I've been I know we're not supposed to be proud, but I've been proud of the congregation lately. I've been getting some just some contacts as people have been asking about what do I need to do? What what do I need to do to to be better? What do I need to stop doing or what do I need to start doing? And it's been it's been just a real blessing to see what's on the people's heart. They want to take the next step. Even Heath before service, he came into my office and he's like he's like, \"Brother, the Lord's delivered me from all of these things.\" He says, \"I'm I'm not dependent on anything anymore.\" He says, \"No, no.\" Almost like, \"What do I need to stop doing now?\" And it's like, \"No, man. He The Lord works on the heart. &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. Just sit back and just let him work on you. Let him deal with with your heart.\" And friends, we look at our sins too much. We've been we sang these songs of worship this morning. Listen to the words in these songs. These songs are talking about how Jesus died for our sins, how he took our sins away and stop looking at your sins because you're going to find them. All of us, brother James, I didn't recognize you. Welcome. Good. Good to have you in service, too. I didn't look at these things. Don't look at the things that you do wrong. Look at Christ. &gt;&gt; Always focus on him. Focus on the Lord. And then you'll find that these sins that you do, these things that bother you, it's like, why do I keep doing this or that, they just kind of fall away if you're focusing on Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's that's the right way to be. And don't be like, and we're going to talk about legalism this morning because that's next in line with the sermon on the mount. Don't be the legalist always looking at the sin. look at Christ and then you watch how Christ will come into the heart and he'll make everything better. So, we've been going through this sermon on the mount. I I say it every Sunday and we've been going through this. This is a masterpiece of a sermon. And I got to tell you, it just keeps getting better and better as I'm reading through it and praying on it and looking what Jesus said. I was telling my wife the other day, I said, \"Honey, no one has ever spoken like this man.\" No one has ever said things like Jesus said from the beginning of time until now. Jesus's words are they're incredible. &gt;&gt; The wisdom that he spoke and how he just lined things out. We started we started this series on on the temptation of Jesus, how he went into the wilderness. He had to experience what we go through. Don't don't forget Jesus was tempted in every way that we are tempted. The Bible says that he but he overcame it and he show he showed us that we are able to overcome. And then we get into we get into Matthew chapter 5 and how we went through the biatitudes and and how that we became a Christian and how we become the salt of the earth and and the light of the world. And then then last week we talked about Jesus coming not to do away with the Old Testament. He didn't. Let's go to Matthew chapter 5. We'll get right into it. Verse 17. We'll review a little bit from last week. Matthew 5:17 says this. Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. So Jesus is talking about the law that Moses wrote and the rest of the the Old Testament and the rest of the Bible at that time. So he's basically saying it's all true. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, not one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. So he's talking about this law. So last week we talked about the sacrificial and the ceremonial commandments that were fulfilled in Christ and you don't need to observe those anymore. It's okay if like brother Ly will often say that that this is Yam Kapour or this is Feast of Tabernacles. It's okay to honor those. It's okay to remember what happened on those like on the Passover with with Moses and the death angel coming through. It's okay to do that. But those things are not required anymore. There's the the sacrificial lamb. You don't have to make a sacrifice for your sins anymore. that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The ceremonial washing that they did. Jesus and his disciples, they were out, they were out eating one time and they offended the priests because they didn't wash in the way that was the um the way that they were taught. baptism really into Christ, the washing away of the sins that fulfilled that symbolic gesture of the Old Testament baptisms, the Old Testament washings. And then there was the society laws that pertain to that time. So the Hebrews, they went through the wilderness and they were about to go over this Jordan River and into this new land. Well, in that new land were heathens, were idolattors. In this strange land, it was witchcraft and idol worship. And God gave them laws for that time that they wouldn't get caught up in what the Canaanites were doing. The Canaanites were the residents of the land beyond Jordan. He didn't want them to get caught up in the witchcraft and caught up in all the idolatry that they were doing. So, he made those laws. But we can take those laws, as we said last week, and we can apply them to today. It doesn't necessarily uh have to be how you cut your hair, like I talked last last week, but you can apply certain things in certain ways in your lives. And then there are the moral laws like the Ten Commandments, the laws about how to treat each other, what not to do. Those laws are still in effect. But Jesus is going to take those laws here and he's going to take them to the next level on this next section of the sermon on the mount. G Jesus and really to understand this whole sermon to understand what Jesus is doing and to understand Jesus's whole ministry you have to understand that that Jesus came not to to preach necessarily something that wasn't in line with the Old Testament. But he came to take the legalism that was in the Old Testament and to really bring it to life. Jesus's ministry, unlike the Old Testament, Jesus's ministry worked on the inner man. It worked on the heart. &gt;&gt; It cleansed God's people from the inside out. So, there are certain rules that like a legalistic church would teach. The preacher would preach and and he would he would they say these things, but it actually when you have a legalistic way of thinking, it actually brings more sin in to your life. When you have a set of rules that you follow, a set of whether it be um what you eat, whether it be your dress or how you worship or whatever that might be, it actually if you follow a set of rules, it actually allows for sin to come in. Here's what the Old Testament was. If there's a cliff right here that means sin, the Old Testament would allow you to walk right up to that cliff. walk right up to murder right there and not sin. It would allow you to walk right up to the edge of adultery and not sin. Like David looking at Ba Sheba, lusting after Ba Sheeba, he didn't sin until he had sex with her. But there was something that led all the way up to that point. Hatred. Hatred is you you you hate someone and it fers and it fers and you go right up to that point and if you can keep yourself from murdering, you don't sin. Some people, they did it and they do it. But Jesus is is saying, \"No, this this isn't the line. Jesus is working on the heart all the way back so you don't even get close to that line. And that's the Old Testament versus the New Testament. The New Testament, even though it does away with the rules, it becomes more moral. And we're going to see that here. So, the Old Testament really, it was built on legalism. But I want you to notice something in the Old Testament. For you Bible readers, you read from Genesis to Revelation. How many converts do you see in the Old Testament? Really none. There's a couple that came in by marriage. Maybe there's a like Rahab you see there and and uh you have Ruth that came in, but the Old Testament in its legalistic ways does away or does doesn't allow for evangelism. Doesn't allow to bring people into the church. Then Jesus comes and all of a sudden it is all about winning souls, all about bringing people in because it does away with the legalist way of thinking. I was talking with Stephanie on the way to um church this morning and we were talking about how it's all about winning souls and winning souls if we can just get that one soul to the Lord. But we have to be careful. What about the souls that are lost because of our legalistic ways? What about those? What about the ones that are that come in and are offended because of the way that we act or or because we try to put them in a box? What about those? What is that soul? Does that soul not matter? And that's what Jesus is coming for to do. He came and now when he starts ministering when that Holy Spirit starts to come no the morality doesn't go the morality actually the level of morality goes higher but now it opens the door for other people to come in and that is a Christian way versus the old testament legalistic ways nobody came in but it wasn't about that that wasn't the purpose but now when Jesus comes comes in now it's about everybody. The Old Testament was about this one lineage of people that really preserve the word and then we go to the New Testament and it becomes about everyone. Everyone who has a soul the New Testament was written for really the whole Bible was written for. So really Jesus is going to go into this that is no longer going to be an outward expression of rules. The cleaning is going to come from the inside out. And for this part of the sermon on the mount, we can see the difference really is going to be between the outward Christian and the inward Christian. The outward murderer and the inward murderer. The outward adulterer and the inward adulterer. Now listen to this. Matthew chapter 5 verse 20 says this. For I say unto you that except your righteousness shall shall exceed the the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. You have to understand who the scribes and the Pharisees were. These are the most holy of the holy. They are the most legal of the legalistic. The scribes and the Pharisees lived an outward life that was perfect. You could not put your finger on them or they wouldn't have been in the position that they were in. So no, but no matter how great they seemed to be, no matter how great these priests were, Jesus is saying your righteousness has to exceed their righteousness. How could that be? That's a rough one. That's a hard one because we are always looking on the outside. It's like saying, 'If you want to be part of our youth group for you guys, you got to bench press more than Daniel Jr. It's like, bro, I can't do that. Well, you have to. That's that's setting the bar. Or if or you have to be able to play the piano like Katie does or like Lily does. Well, I can't do that. That's impossible. That's what's if you look at this on the outward expression, it's like, well, I can't attain that. How can I have a righteousness as great as these others that ha that are so righteous? It's impossible. But that's the way most people think. So to be righteous, it may sound odd, but to be righteous, you need to first realize that you are as much of a sinner as anyone else in the world. &gt;&gt; That you are not better than anyone else. And when you drove, you may you may have seen some homeless people if you came on up on stone. You have to realize I am no better than that fentanyl addict that's assume the fentanyl position there. You are no better than that. And that is where you have to start. Listen uh to uh Romans chapter 3:9. I'll read the new New King James version of this. Romans chapter 3:9. It says this. What then? Are we better than they? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. So he's saying that, hey, listen, all of us are sinners. Whoever you are, we are all sinners. As it is written, there is none righteous, know not one. There is none who understands. There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is none who does does good. No, not one. You see how the apostles lowering all of us to say we are nothing. Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have practiced deceit. The poison aspir lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes. So these are both nonreligious and religious people he's talking about. Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore, by the deeds of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For by the law is the knowledge of sin. So there's no salvation here in the law. The New Living Translation of that says, \"For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands.\" The law simply shows us how sinful we are. Remember I was talking about your sins. Your sins will always be there. But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the law and the prophets. even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God set forth as a perpetuation by his blood through faith to demonstrate his righteousness. Because in his forbearance, God has passed over the sins that were previously committed. Wow. God has passed over these sins that were previously committed to demonstrate at the present time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of one who has faith in Jesus. So it says, \"No one is righteous, know not one.\" Verse number 22, even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all on who believe. So no, we are not righteous, but we are seeking his righteousness. Now listen to this. The Hebrews in in the book of Hebrews, it says that even the high priest, so the high priest on I believe it's called the day of atonement, the high priest would go into the temple. He would first make a sacrifice for his own sins and then he would make a sacrifice for the congregation. This is the one who lives perfect. This is the most perfect of the perfect, the high priest. He was the best living person. And yet he had to make an offering of sin for himself on that day of atonement once a year. But watch what Hebrews says. For such a high priest, verse number uh Hebrews 11:26, for such a high priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, un separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens, who does not need daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, and then for the peoples. For this he did once for all and he offered up himself. For he offered up when he offered up himself. For the law appoints as high priest men who have weaknesses but the word of oath which came after the law appoints the son who has been perfected forever. Speaking of Jesus being the high priest. Now, it says, remember the day of atonement, but the book of Hebrews says that that high priest had to make an offering for his own sins every day. Remember, this is the most righteous of the righteous. He had to make a sacrifice or he should have made a sacrifice every day for his sins. So, we look and we we see how he could say there is none righteous. No, not one. Even the best were not righteous. Now we see that Jesus says now now your righteousness needs to exceed these Pharisees and scribes. How does how do we do that? How can we we do it? You might say, \"Well, I have this sin and that sin and and how can I live up to this and I have to be my righteousness has to exceed these other people's righteousness? How can that be?\" And it's beautiful. Let me give you let me tell a story in the Bible of something that happened. There was a woman. The Bible says that she was a sinner. Other translations say that she was immoral. That's a fact. That's not being accused of being immoral. The Bible says that she was immoral. What she did, I don't know, but it was not good. And she had there was something in her that she was she was just she was repentant and she wanted to change. Jesus had been invited to a Pharisees house for dinner. And when Jesus came in, he was he was obviously been walking. And you know how when we walk into somebody's house, just out of courtesy, we'll take our shoes off and leave them at the front door. We do that so we don't track in whatever we were walking through. and we came in a car and probably walked across a concrete driveway and then yet we take off our shoes. Jesus came into this man Simon's house and he was wearing sandals and all and he didn't have a car obviously. He was walking through whether it be mud or whether it be dust or dirt or whatever it was. He was walking miles probably and he comes to this this Pharisees house and he walks in and what was the custom back then is to take off your sandals and then they wash your feet. So now you're clean just like we would take off our shoes for the little bit of dirt. You can imagine how much dirt was on Jesus's feet when he walked in. But nobody washed his feet when he walked in. You know, you can't take off your feet when you walk into somebody's somebody's house back then. So they washed your feet. So Jesus comes in. Nobody washes his feet. He's sitting there with with dirty feet. And this woman who I said the Bible says was immoral. She purchases this expensive jar of perfume ointment, very expensive. And she there was something about her that repented. There was something sad about her. She regretted her sins. So she comes in and she sees Jesus sitting there and she walks in and falls down at his feet and begins kissing his feet. Her tears are flowing down, washing the dirt off of his feet. And she is taking this this ointment, this perfume, and perfuming him and and trying to make him to where he feels good. And here is this Pharisee over here and he's watching and he says, \"If he was a prophet, surely he would know that she is a sinner.\" And you know what? She was. As I said, the Bible said she was. And she's there and she's weeping and she's repenting of her sins and doing all this. And Jesus looks at this Pharisee and he says, \"Hey, Simon.\" He says, \"What's your deal?\" He says, 'When I walked in, you didn't even pay me enough respect to wash my feet. You wash everybody else's feet, but I come in, you don't clean me up. And here she is, and she is weeping, and she is washing my feet with her tears. You didn't anoint me with oil. I felt terrible. I come in, I'm I'm sweaty, I'm tired, and then she comes in. You didn't You didn't make give me some oil to to soothe the sun or whatever it is. She and she comes in and she takes this expensive oil and she she anoints me with this oil. &gt;&gt; Who's righteous now? It's going to get better. Simon looks at him. He's obviously looking at what was going on in disgust. Disgusted. And he says, Jesus says, Simon, can I tell you a story? Can I say something? And then the Pharisees says, yeah, go ahead. He says there's two men. He says and and a man a rich man loaned one man 50 pieces of silver and the other man he loaned 500 pieces of silver. He looks at looks at the Pharisee and he says neither of them could pay pay it back. Neither of them could pay the money back. So the man says, \"I forgive both of you.\" And he says, \"Now,\" he says, \"Which one would love the man more? The man who he loaned 50 and forgave that or the man he loaned 500 pieces of silver and forgave that?\" Pharisees said, \"Well, I assume the one that he forgave more.\" He said, \"You're right.\" He looks down and he tells her, the woman that's washing his feet, he says, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" He says, \"Now go in peace.\" Think about what Jesus said. She had 500 500 pieces of silver that she owed and she was forgiven. This Pharisee only had 50, but he wasn't forgiven any of it because he didn't ask for forgiveness. He still owed the 50. And he would still be condemned of the 50 because he did not see receive forgiveness because he wouldn't humble himself like the woman. Now, who had more righteousness? Was it the Pharisee or was it the woman? It was the woman. Do you see how her righteousness exceeded the righteousness of the legalistic Pharisee? Another story, Peter, he's up on the housetop and we can give our hearts to the Lord's friends. We can come and we can start coming to church and we can we can see our sins as Peter did and we can we can get our forgiveness and we can make things right with the Lord and we can still fall into the legalism. We can have the full understanding of Jesus Christ as Peter did. And yet, we can still fall back into it. It's very easy to do. Peter's on the housetop. He had received the Holy Ghost at the day of Pentecost. He had the kings to the to to the kingdom. Peter had he had it all. He was the leader. And here's Peter and he's up on the housetop. And he's praying. And there's another man over here named Cornelius, a lowly gentile. He was an important person. He was a centurion. But this man named Cornelius who in the Old Testament these were dirty people. Cornelius was praying. Peter was praying. Cornelius sees a vision to go to Peter. Peter sees a vision. And in this vision comes down all kinds of animals. Now remember the legalism of the Jews. You're not allowed to eat catfish because it doesn't have scales. You're not allowed to uh you're not allowed to eat shrimp. You're not allowed to eat crab. I love shrimp and crab. And I'm really glad that that's in the past, but but they weren't allowed to eat it. They weren't allowed to eat a rabbit. There were certain thing they weren't allowed to eat bacon. &gt;&gt; Oh, they weren't allow It's okay. They they got through it. But they weren't allowed to eat any They weren't allowed to eat any of that stuff. So here is Peter and Peter sees these animals coming down and maybe he saw a pig and a slab of bacon right there and the Lord says, \"Peter, kill and eat.\" Now watch the legalism in Peter. Remember I Peter had given his heart to the Lord. He said, \"Not so. I have never eaten any unclean in my life.\" And then God says this, \"Why do you make unclean what I have cleansed? Why do you make common what I have made clean?\" Even though it was all through his history, all through his tradition, it was no, you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do this. And now God is rebuking Peter right there. Remember the lie, we see that the Old Testament laws of the diet were done away and it represented that lowly, dirty Gentile. And all of a sudden, Peter comes out of the vision. He's like, \"What does that mean?\" Um, can we talk to Peter? We were sent from Cornelius. He saw a vision to come see you. Peter's like, I'll be right there. And then he goes and he introduces these people to the Lord Jesus. Legalism doesn't work. Let's go back to Let's go back to um ah running out of time. Let's go back to uh Matthew chapter 5. You know, people And Keith, what we were talking about earlier, this sermon on the mount, we really have to understand that your righteousness cannot be dependent on you. It needs to be dependent on God. And people today think that they can fix themselves. They really do. They think that if they give their hearts to the the Lord, they say, \"I I'm going to quit smoking. I'm going to quit drinking. I'm going to quit pornography. I'm going to quit being late for work. I'm going to quit missing church.\" And that is the legalist mentality. And it didn't work. and it doesn't work today. But it's still human nature to want to do those things. Instead of quitting something, start doing something. &gt;&gt; Remember, I say a lot, it's not what you don't do for God that matters. It's what you do for him and trusting in him. Instead of quitting something, start doing something. If you want to quit missing church on Sunday mornings, start going on Wednesday nights. And then you'll find you'll go to you'll go on Sunday mornings, too. Start reading your Bible every morning. Start when you wake up, start praying. When you go to lunch, start praying. Pray during your lunch break. Before you go to bed, pray. Start reaching out to someone who needs you. Make that phone call. Send that card. Reach out and bring someone to lunch. Do something. Don't stop doing something. And you'll find that when you start doing something, the things that you want to stop doing, they just kind of fall away. You don't have the time to do them anymore. You don't want to do them anymore. You'll find that smoking and drinking and lying and gossiping and all of that. It just kind of gets squeezed out by doing Christianity. Christianity is not quitting. Christianity is doing. It's not doing. It's not which is, as I love saying, it's not what you don't do for God that matters. It's trusting in him, serving him, and doing what he says. Now, Jesus is going to make all that clear. Verse number 21, Matthew chapter 5. Listen to this. Remember what I said about going to the cliff. You have heard that it was said of the of them in old time, thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. All right, you go right up. The law let you to sin, sin, sin, sin, sin all the way to right here. Nope, you can't kill. All right, and here's what Jesus is saying. You have heard that it was said of them of old time, thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother Raqqa shall be in danger of the council, but whosoever shall say, \"Thou fool,\" shall be in danger of hellfire. Murder begins in the heart. Jesus is going he's he's going to the root of that problem. Murder is just the manifestation of something that started within. The law doesn't fix the heart. As I said, the law allows you to have hatred in your heart all the way until you commit that act. I was talking with I was talking uh the other day with my family and I was talking about the government shutdown and I was kind of worked up and and uh I said that they they're shutting the government down because they want to continue these COVID subsidies from from back in 2020. And I said, \"These idiots don't understand that they are ruining our health care system.\" And something said sin. Call Noma and Rocka. That means worthless. Don't call anyone worthless. And don't call anyone a fool. And here I am, pastor of Tucson Tabernacle, breaking the commandment that Jesus said. And I apologized and I shouldn't have said that. But how often does it happen? Every day for us. And these people that killed that the one that shot um Donald Trump, hit him in the ear. It didn't start with murder. It started with hatred in his heart. &gt;&gt; And it just built and built and built until he came right to the line. The law, he would have been fine. And then boom, down he goes and he shoots him. The same one that uh with the one that killed Charlie Kirk. Same thing. This hatred built and built and built in him. His heart was wrong. It started wrong and then he comes right to the point and then he commits the sin. But Jesus is trying to get to the inner man. He's trying to get to the heart and say, \"No, don't even start that way. Don't even say that the Democrats are idiots. Don't even say that. It starts that hatred. And don't say the Republicans are idiots either. It's Don't say anybody's an idiot. It starts that hatred &gt;&gt; inside of you. And for 99% of the people, 99.99 whatever, it won't go to murder. But still, you are opening the door to murder. Let's continue on with what with what Jesus says here. He is so wise and he's still talking about murder in this next verse. Verse number 23. Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Notice that Jesus is saying someone that has something against you. He's not saying, of course, you shouldn't have anything against somebody else. But he's not saying that if you have something against someone, go and make it right. He's saying if someone has something against you, right or wrong. If someone has something against you that may they may think that you've done something against them, go to that person that hates you. Go in love. Go in wisdom. Go to that person with the right words. Go to that person in the way that you would want them to come to you if you felt they did something against you. Don't let that malice start up in your heart because it leads to murder. It can lead to murder. Agree with thine adversary quickly whilst thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary delivered thee to the judge. and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out hence till thou hast paid the uttermost farther.\" What is he talking about there? He's talking about a court case. You've heard of settling out of court. And the reason Jesus is saying that, he's saying you don't want to go to the judge because you don't know what you're going to get. You don't know how that judge is going to rule and there's too much at stake. You want to That's why most most cases are settled out of court because you know what you're going to get. You don't know what that jury's going to say. You don't know what that judge is going to say. You may be as confident as you want to be, but they might not agree with you and boom, you lose. And that's how it is with the Lord. get right now because you don't want to take a chance that that person is the one in the wrong and you're the one in the right. You don't want to take that chance. My grandma um Evans mama, she's great. She was a funny lady. She uh very southern. She was driving and she shouldn't have been driving. She was too old. But she was driving and there was a lady, another old lady crossing in a crosswalk in front of her and she just plows right into her. And she says, \"Daniel,\" she says, \"I couldn't believe that.\" She said, \"That woman was on my windshield.\" And so it ends up in this big big litigation thing. And my dad and I went over to um to visit mama one day and she says she says, \"Yeah.\" She says, \"It's okay. We did a flea market.\" And dad said, \"What?\" She said, \"We did a flea market.\" And uh dad says, \"A flea market?\" He says, \"You mean a plea bargain?\" He says, \"Yeah.\" She says, \"Yeah, that's what I mean. We Sister Carol's laughing.\" You knew mama. Um she uh the I'm sorry, Sister Roberta. You knew mama. But she uh she got her words mixed up. But you see, it was better to settle outside of court because she didn't know and neither did the woman know how the judge was going to rule. And Jesus here is saying you don't want to take that chance. He says make things right while you are here. You have heard when he says that you have heard it was said in old times. He's talking about you've read it in your Bible. He's talking about that these are the commandments of God. He says, \"You have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery. But I say unto you that whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" We automatically probably think about pornography here or we think about obviously it's lusting after someone who's not your spouse. I was um I knew a uh a woman and uh she was she had met she was married and uh she she was from the United States and then this other man was from Canada. Both of them had spouses and families and they started corresponding via Facebook, sharing scriptures and this the these two they started calling each other and praying together on the phone. Seems harmless, right? And they started conversing more and more. Do you see? Don't go not just go to the edge but this started way back deep in the heart where both of them open the door of their heart to the thought of this other person. They talked more and more. Eventually they decided to meet and they met and what happened eventually he divorced his wife. She divorced her husband and they got together an absolute case of adultery. But the heart was wrong. If they would have been right, they would have known that Holy Spirit would have told them, \"Don't go there. Don't even think that that. Don't even entertain that thought.\" But instead, they went right up to the place thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it. And then they just jumped right into the sin. And Jesus is trying to attack here. He is saying that no you this is too far that the law let you go too far. Legalism lets you go too far. He wanted to get to the heart of the person rather than just the rules, just the law. Now here's so many people they say that a woman can entice a man into committing adultery by the way she is dressed. And I understand that. And and the sisters, the women should dress modestly. They should dress well. But I lay that 100%. I believe that scripture is talking about the man. That man has no right to look at a woman and want to have an affair with her. Want to that that open that door to where he might want to do that. Jesus here is saying, listen, if you do that, you are opening the door right at the beginning, the door to the heart. You're opening it up. And now what could happen next? What could happen next is boom, full-fledged adultery. And he's saying that listen, I know you may not have jumped over. You may not have stepped off that cliff of adultery, but if you are just entertaining the thought, then you've already done it. Then you just might just take the next step. The same thing with murder. He's like, if you just hate someone, if you call someone in a fool or something, you hate them. You're opening that door. How many times did this man that shot Charlie Kirk, How many times did he make fun of Charlie Kirk in the background? How many times did he call him names in the background? How many times did that happen and then it just manifested itself in murder? Jesus wants to get to the heart. He wants to get to where it begins. Amen. You with me? The worship team can come and we'll close. talks about we we we talk about the ten commandments and Jesus is going through the ten commandments and he he's saying that that no that that they were right you shouldn't do these sins but this sin it starts way back in another place you are just seeing the manifestation of these sins and then you see this precious ious little lady who was a sinner. She was immoral. What she did, we don't know, but it wasn't good. It was not something that she would want to brag about. And it was not something that we would want to brag about. But here she is. And what did she do? Why did her righteousness exceed the righteousness of that Pharisee? Is because she was willing to say, \"I'm a sinner.\" She was willing to say that I am a nothing. She was willing to say, \"Lord, I give my heart to you. I give myself to you and I'll do whatever I can.\" And the 500 pieces of silver were forgiven. But the little bit that the Pharisee owed, the 50 pieces never forgiven. He was condemned for that debt that he owed. You understand the meaning behind the parable of the Lord Jesus and why he put it there with with this woman and and with the Pharisees. Do you understand this sermon on the mount? Understand how amazing it is? This is Jesus. This is his first public sermon. And here he is and he is saying that no, the Old Testament's good. The Old Testament's right. I fulfilled it. I am that lamb and oh and the ten commandments that's right. But think about this. What about your heart? So you can lust after someone and still be right? No. Jesus goes all the way back to that inner man, to that inner person. And then that's where he is. That's where he's focused on. And we cannot be saved by the outward person. It can't happen. The only way that we can be saved is if God changes that inward person. Amen. I don't think, brother Arie, we don't have a baptism. Or do we? We don't. I don't think so. Is anybody Is there anybody that want to be baptized this morning? Okay, good. Friends, sermon on the mount. Keep reading it. Let's stay in this. I it seems like I only get to like two two two verses per but as I said it's okay. we'll just keep going. And and if if we're raptured, if the Lord comes before we finish, then maybe can you imagine Jesus and just sitting down and Jesus and saying, \"Lord, would you preach the sermon on the mount to us?\" And oh man, and then he could go in and he can elaborate on them and and just say those words and maybe say like, \"Brother Manny, this is what this is what pertains to you in this. And this is how you overcame in this. And sister Shirley, way back when when you went through this, this is how I carried you through.\" And the more that we're into the word, friends, the more that the blessings we receive. As I said, stop looking at the sins. Especially stop looking at the sins of other people. Then you don't want to fall into that same boat as the Pharisee. But stop looking at your own sins, too. When you start focusing on God, those sins, they just fall off. You don't have to worry about them. [Music] As the deer, as the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. Would you stand with me and let's sing that verse again? As the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. &gt;&gt; You alone are my strength, my shield. To you made my spirit near. &gt;&gt; You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. &gt;&gt; You're my friend. You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king. [Music] I love you more than any other so much more than anything. &gt;&gt; You alone are my strength, my shield. to you alone. May my spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; You alone are my heart desire and I long to worship you. &gt;&gt; So do you see that your righteousness can far out outstretched can far exceed the righteousness of any man or any woman, your righteousness. If you receive Christ's righteousness into your heart, then the rules and the regulations and and the um the the laws then they become living inside of you. And now it's not adultery that you commit. It's not murder that you commit. it's lusting or it's hating or it's calling names there. Now the Lord just keeps refining and refining and refining and then holiness becomes real in the person and then that person becomes a living representative of Jesus Christ and then you have a burden for others. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord, thank you for the wisdom that is in your word. Thank you, Father, that Jesus Christ himself, God made flesh, came and and preached the word to us. And it's been preserved for these 2,000 years that we might read it on Sunday morning here in Tucson, Arizona. and Lord that the meaning is still there and it hasn't changed. We thank you Father. Pray Lord that if there'd be someone here in this congregation they came here Father expecting something that they wanted Lord maybe a a question to be answered. They wanted healing Lord. Maybe there was confusion. I pray, Father, that these words from our Lord Jesus on the sermon on the mount would have answered the question, given them faith. Father, now as we go forward, Father, I pray that you would guide and protect each one, Lord, that your healing hand be upon each one. Lord, that we could be a representative to you, Lord, that we would take on your righteousness and be a light to the world. Father, we pray. We love you and we thank you in Jesus name. Amen. In my life, Lord, be Be glorified. Be glorified in my life. Lord be glorified today. Sing that again. In my life. in my be glorified. [Music] Be glorified in my life. be glorified today &gt;&gt; in your church, Lord. &gt;&gt; In your church, Lord, be glorified. Be glorified in In your church, Lord be glorified [Music] today. Sing one more time. In my life, Lord. &gt;&gt; In my life, [Music] be glorified. [Music] Be glorified in my life, Lord. be glorified today. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell the story about mama. I wouldn't have told it if if the lady would have been hurt. She she was she was just beat up a little bit, but uh it was a very funny very funny story. And I'm glad that they settled with the flea market and everything worked out. friends, we are blessed. We we we are blessed beyond anyone else. We're blessed to have a Bible. We're blessed to have each other. We're blessed to have a savior that is alive today and he loves us and he knows us. One thing I always tell someone that's new, not always, but usually I'll tell someone that's new that want to gives wants to give their hearts to the Lord, I tell them that the Lord knows you. He knows your name. And he cares now. He cares. Do you care about him? I do. Do you? &gt;&gt; I care about the Lord Jesus. No service tonight. Uh we will continue on on our Wednesday night um Bible study on praise and worship. Brother Lyle will be this Wednesday night. God bless you friends. Again, no service tonight. May God be with you.\n"}, {"id": "2025-11-23 - Dedicating the True Tabernacle, Tucson Tabernacle Church Dedication, Day 3 Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF FILE: 2025-11-23 - Dedicating the True Tabernacle, Tucson Tabernacle Church Dedication, Day 3: Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans - Clean.txt\n################################################################################\n\nSERMON DETAILS\n========================================\nDate:    2025-11-23\nTitle:   Dedicating the True Tabernacle, Tucson Tabernacle Church Dedication, Day 3: Daniel Evans\nSpeaker: Daniel Evans\nChurch:  Tucson Tabernacle\nType:    Full Sermon\nLanguage:English\nURL:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4ifq1b_FHo\n========================================\n\nI surrender to the king.

Burn like fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is awesome this morning. You may be seated. So before I I play this song, [clears throat] it's called song's called You Were Were you You It's It's You Were Worth It is is the song I'm going to play. Um I'm gonna just share a threeinut uh testimony that I've only shared with a few individuals. [clears throat] Um and I just trust it's going to help you to better understand who you are and just who who we are. So at the beginning of my uh my career, I was I was living in Bangkok, Thailand. And um I'm gonna just make this make this quick. Um, I was in this social gathering and I was talking to a number of people. One of them was this girl from Hong Kong. She was a Catholic. And shortly into the conversation, she asked me if I was a Christian. I said yes. Um, so after after a couple more conversations, um, you know, I I started just telling her what the Lord did for me and I said, \"Do you do you want to be baptized? Um, do you want to repent and be baptized?\" Um, what I wasn't expecting was for her to say yes at 11 o'clock at night. [clears throat] Um because I was like, I don't know where water is. Um so fortunately the the building I worked downtown had a fountain in front of it. So we hopped in a taxi. Um we drove down there. The security guard was was asleep half the time. Then he woke up when he saw us get in the fountain. But uh so I baptized her. We got back in the taxi. It's midnight. We drove back. [clears throat] Um so I was I want to tell you that that was just like the context. But the part I want to tell you about is what I want to hopefully encourage you and just help you with your faith. It helps. And the Lord just showed me this as I was on the on the flight from Tampa here a couple days ago because I I I hadn't remembered this and he never showed that he never I think he kind of explained to me why why um he allowed this part to happen. So I was laying in bed and I don't know if this was a vision but I wasn't I I dream a lot and it wasn't a dream. I think I was awake and I was in my room laying on [clears throat] my bed and um something a dark presence came to the room and started pushing me into my bed. Um and I could not get up um and I I cried um I cried Jesus, Jesus. And this is the first time I've heard an audible voice like there was something else. It wasn't just in my head a thought. There was an audible voice from the darkest place. It was from hell. And it said, \"The people of the Lord.\" The people of the Lord. And then another voice came and said, \"Get out of the room. Get out of the room.\" And it left. So I want to tell you that because Satan knows who you are. Okay? So you are the people of the Lord. God knows who you are. Do you know who you are? Okay. So, I'm gonna just give you the background for this song. Last uh last weekend before I knew I was going to be coming here, I sat down 10:30 at the piano and this song just just happened. And it happened as a result of just feeling very burdened for um a neighbor that we're close to. We did carpool with them and she's tried to commit suicide this year. Um just going through a really hard time. And I just wrote this song called You Were Worth It because you were so you were so worth it. And even when you think back um the very beginning of the Bible, it says in the beginning God created. He did that for you. And he did all the math, all the physics, all the biology. He did all of that. So you know that you're worth it. And he did that even for for people that don't accept him. and and he so so you you are worth it no matter what. And I just I just wanted to remind you of that and just give you the context. [clears throat] I have a story about somebody. You know, [singing] sometimes they feel like they are a nobody. But that's not what God said about you. Before there was time, he was all alone in his mind, not thinking about the earth and the stars. He was thinking of you. No matter how you are, he knows it. Whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it. You're worth it all. [music] You're worth it all. Oh, you [music] might think when you're looking in that sunrise, you're all alone there in the sunlight. But he made that horizon for you. [music] As the world's turning, we're lost in its meaning. Life has a way of only defeating our spirits all longing for something to guide [music] the way. No matter how you are, he knows it. Trust me, [music] whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it. You're worth it all. [music] You're worth it all. [music] Before you say goodbye, let [music] him look into your eyes and let him [singing] tell you that you are beautiful but [music] wasn't for your sin. Why on earth would he begin to [music] tell you all the reasons you [singing] are worth it all? Worth it all. No matter how you are, he knows it. Whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it all. Worth it all. Worth it all. You're worth it all. [music] Amen. Thank you, brother Stephen. Um, if the brothers want to make ready for the prayer requests and offerings, if we could stand and we're going to sing, \"How great is our God. How great is our [singing] God.\" Oh, sing with me. How [singing] great is our God? And all will [singing] see how great how great is our God. You believe that you were worth it all? you would look at yourself and say not worthy. But he that day when he had to make that decision, he had [music] taken his disciples with him and he said, \"We're going to pray cuz I'm about to go through something.\" And he and he came in a body of flesh so that he could be touched by the filling of your infirmities so he could understand. And he said, \"Father, is there another way we could do this. But he said, \"No, not my will, but your will be done.\" Cuz he saw you and he said, \"I've got to get to that one. You're worthy of it all. No question about it. I didn't make myself worthy.\" He took care of it all. Amen. You can say, \"Thank you, Lord. I appreciate that, God. There's nothing too wrong, too bad that you can't He will. Thief on the cross. He turned around and said, \"Remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" And he [music] said, \"This day you'll be in paradise.\" Somebody might have asked him, \"How did you get here?\" And he just [music] said, \"He said I could come.\" &gt;&gt; And if he said you can come, you're welcome. &gt;&gt; As he took paid for it all. Amen. Sister Rebecca Zbrunner requests here. Prayer healing for healing for my aunt Rosanna who has had a few operations on her intestines. [music] So again, he was wounded. He was bruised. So I would be covered. Pray for guidance for a not Lisa who has to find a new place to live in 3 weeks. Nothing impossible for him. If Lord, I have a need. And you know what that is. So I'll let you answer it, Lord, the way it should be answered. Lord, we It's hard for us to imagine that you would come down in flesh so that you could be touched by the filling of our infirmities. You even [music] question when that day came to surrender yourself to what was going to be some really hard days ahead of you. But you said not my will but thy will be done Lord. We have the same attitude. We have questions. We have desires. We have wants. But we want it to be directed and led by you, Lord. Because the end result will be what you've desired, Lord. You saw every hand raised. You see every every heart represented here. those that might be listening to in today, Lord, that they realize that if they were the only ones, you still would have given your life to redeem them, Lord. So, we just want to say thank you and we appreciate as they take up the offering, Lord. May we give with a cheerful heart, Lord, and then you bless it for its intended [music] use. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated at the Brassan. girls wants to start getting ready. The splend of the king. Oh, clothe in mesty. Let all the earth rejoice. Let all the earth rejoice. He wraps himself in light in darkness. Tries to hide. The gingles at his voice trembles at his [music] voice. And how great is our God. Oh, and sing with me. How great is our [singing] God? And all will see how great how great is our God. age to age and age to age she stands. [music] And time is in his hands. Beginning [music and singing] the end, beginning and the end.

He's the name. [music] &gt;&gt; And he's the [singing] name [music] above all names. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all praise. &gt;&gt; And my heart will sing how great [music] is our God. He's the name. And [music] he's [singing] the name above all name. [music] And he is. He's worthy [singing] of all praise. [music] And my [singing] heart will sing. How great is our God.

[singing] &gt;&gt; And all will see how great how [singing] great [music] is our God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; From the start, you've held a place in my heart. [music] Say kept your spirit from working in me. [music] I couldn't look at life honestly until the day my will gave [singing] away to the truth that I found in you. [music] Oh, [singing] I never knew just how good it could be to stand [singing] in your presence totally [music] free. I'm forgiven. &gt;&gt; Now I have a reason for living. [singing and music] Jesus keeps giving and giving, giving [singing] till my heart [music] overflows. I'm forgiving. Now I have a reason for living. [music] Jesus [singing] keeps giving and giving.

Jesus, [music] [singing] lamb of God, worthy [singing] is [music] your name. Jesus, [music] lamb of [singing] God, worthy is your name, [music] Lord God. You are worthy. We're grateful, [music] Lord, that you brought us together in this Sunday morning. Father, I'm excited maybe to see what you're going to do this morning. Lord, you've done so many things, great things. Now, Lord, we ask maybe that you would make yourself known in our midst this morning. That you would be here with us, Father. And Lord that every person that come has come into this building this morning father may they leave Lord receiving what they are expecting. May they receive father what they [music] have asked for. We pray what is written in your word. Lord you ask not because you receive not or you receive not because you ask not. And Lord, we are asking Lord that you would give us, Father, what's on our heart. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters. You can be seated. I think it's been a good two days. What do you think? [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now we come to the close of our church dedication. Uh first I want to thank all of the people that have worked so hard, especially the sisters that are in the kitchen that have been doing everything. [applause] [applause] It's been good food. Real good. And that stuff comes it does it comes at a price and they have definitely paid the price. They have worked hard and and it's for us. It's just it's they've working for us because they love us. So I really really appreciate what they've done. Uh the first thing I want to talk about is some directions that I want the church to go that I'm really excited about. The um the first thing is it's a it's a bit of a testimony. It's not just a bit of one. It's a very great testimony. Daniel and I were working on a project and we were trying, what we wanted to do is we wanted to put together a video for the church that we could just put it on our YouTube page that you could share with your friends and if somebody wants to be introduced to what we stand for at the church, just something really short that you could send them a le link or something like that. And so we tried and we interviewed some of you and and we did our best, but we're not pros. And it just wasn't coming together. And I was sitting in my den and I was actually at that moment I was going over this script that just wasn't working. And I get a text from my cousin who I don't talk to very often. and it popped up and it said, \"Hi, Daniel and Stephanie. I want to I had it on my heart. I want to gift you and your church a video that you can use to send people.\" And she says, \"I want to pay for it and I want this professional videographer that I know to do it.\" And he's like us. He's a Christian. He's a believer. And when I saw that text, I was like, \"No way. I know that we are in the Lord's will in doing this.\" My cousin Hope is and her husband Craig, dear, just dear wonderful people. Hope and I grew up together. We're the same age. She's like 10 years younger than me. Hope and Craig, stand up in the back. Yeah, you got to stand up. [applause] I love I love that girl. We've been we were very very close growing up. And I hope Thank you so much. If we could play the video in John chapter 17, Jesus prays that the disciples would be in such unity that the world would see their unity and know that God sent Jesus Christ to the world. Jesus is asking the father for a church that would produce such love that sinners would come to salvation not through their doctrine necessarily and not necessarily through their music but through the love that they have for each other. &gt;&gt; Spirit of the church is loving, caring. When I came here, the first smile I saw was actually sister Heathers and she welcomed me with a huge hug and I felt welcomed and not judge or anything. &gt;&gt; I would say uh loving for sure and accepting and we don't care what anyone looks like or what your background is, but we just want souls to be saved and them to come to the Lord and have a better life through him. &gt;&gt; My favorite thing about Tucson Tabernacle is the pastor. He has a lot of compassion and love for us. The second is the congregation and you know all the brothers and sisters get together and it's [music] all love. They don't discriminate. &gt;&gt; I think Tucson Tabernacle is a great place u for someone who is scared of meeting new people. We understand those struggles and those fears and I feel like you always have someone there to shake your hand or greet you and that helps so much to take that nervousness away. &gt;&gt; I value our pastor. He's very special. has a lot of depth and loves the people. That's for sure. And I value that very much. &gt;&gt; Gone to church all my life since I was born. But coming to Tucson Tabernacle uh changed my outlook as a Christian that a Christianity was not a set of deeds but was a life lived. I found that at the tabernacle that was the emphasis to live a life worthy of the gospel in the sense that others could see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing whenever you you hear the congregation singing and you know you're all just singing to the one creator. You're just singing to Jesus Christ and it's 150 whether it's 150 on Sunday morning or 50 people on Wednesday night. It's you get there and the spirit comes down because All of us are singing to one person. It's and that's the Jesus Christ. It's not about me. It's and it's not about the congregation. It's just about Jesus. The Tucson Tabernacle is a place of refuge where you can come in. You can feel accepted. [snorts] You can worship with great music, hear a Bible-based sermon, but it is also a place of ministry. You may be dealing with your own sins, but don't forget the guy next to you. He's dealing with something, too. come into this church to serve. Not to serve yourself, but to serve others. I promise you'll get what you need, but make it the focus. Make it your focus to serve others. That's the spirit of Christ. And that is the Holy Spirit. That's what I want to see in a church. That's what I want to see in the Tucson Tabernacle. And I really think that we are moving in the right direction. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thanks, Hope and Craig. God bless you both. And uh we'll get to this link. Just a a simple introduction to our church. And uh I pray that the Lord will use it. Another thing that I want to do, another direction that we have with this congregation is with our children, especially our little ones. It's important to give the kids what they need and give it to them early. Build that foundation in the young ones. So, I talked with Brother Jordan, Sister Martha, and I actually the other Wednesday or Sunday night, I believe it was, I brought all the kids up in the front, and Brother Jordan led them in a song, and it was just it was really cool. These these kids laughing and singing out loud. And what I want to do is once a month I want to have children's church and we'll do it on a Sunday night and the kids are going to sing. We'll have sing alongs. We'll have Bible readings. We'll have stories. It's going to be focusing on them. And hopefully they'll start singing specials. Hopefully they'll they'll start reading scriptures. And we might even find a couple of these little guys might even be the future preachers, maybe even the future pastor of this church. [applause] [applause] So, we'll put that on the calendar. And I think I I just have really high expectations for Children's Church. I think it's going to be something that these kids will always remember their whole lives. And then the last thing and this is very very important also I have uh a brother that I know he's in South Africa he's watching I'm sure right now his name is Steven Young. Stephen Young is a man of God. A real deal man of God. He loves the word with all of his heart and he has a calling in his life to be a pastor. He's pastored for many years and he has suffered. And one thing I I look at my life and most of my suffering has been because of my own doing. Almost all of it as I look back. Stephen lately has suffered because he has stood for the word of God. And he is, as I said, he's he's one of the best preachers I've ever heard. And now he's starting a grassroots effort to build a church in Durban, South Africa in his home. He's got a congregation of very few people right now. He's just he's been on the field doing this for about a month now, I guess. And he has about 12 in his congregation, which that number should sound familiar. That's how many people the Ephesian church started with. One of the greatest churches in the entire Bible. Stephen is he's just got a heart. He's got a heart for the people. He's got a heart for evangelism. And I wanted and I talked with the trustees and we all voted unanimously on doing this. I want to take one offering a month from our church and give it to Stephen to get him going. This isn't a forever thing. We're going to continue this as long as as he's progressing and as as long as he feels called to continue on doing this and until this church gets established. We now the Tucson Tabernacle has a specific overseas missionary program and that is investing in this church in Durban, South Africa. And let me tell you something, I don't think that we could invest in a better group of people than Stephen Young and this little group that's forming there in Durban. of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Dear brother Dan and the believers at Tucson Tabernacle, we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your prayers and for your supports for us during our the difficult times that we've been facing here. But we thank God for your love and for your support over there. So from all of us here in Durban, South Africa, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's [applause] we have an opportunity friends to give. We have an opportunity to support something that could be great. One soul is worth 10,000 worlds. But I look forward to seeing this work that we're doing in South Africa as being a great work. And it's neat because we get to see it from the very foundation of how this is this is going to go. This is these are not tithing. These are offerings. These are something that we can do on top of our um tithing to the church. This is a way that we are able to be generous for someone else. So, one offering a month we are going to send overseas to brother Stephen and the group that you saw there to hopefully get them a place to worship and continue on with brother Steven's outreach. And we're going to start with the offering that we took today. So, this money the trustees will are prepared this money will go to brother Stephen and as I said once a month. So that's the direction some of the exciting new things we have here at Tucson Tabernacle. Brother Steven will also give us um regular reports from the church. I look at these things. I look at our video. I look at the children's church that we're doing overseas missionary efforts. And I don't ever want us to lose perspective. We have to think, is it really going to do any good? Are these things all the the work that we've done really has it done any good? And I think behind the right souls and behind the right attitude and behind prayers, I think it can do good. But we can't lose perspective. all all of the renovations that we've done here at the church and all of the the stuff that we've done outside this church, it's just going to get old again. The carpet's going to wear out that we're going to have to repaint the walls again. We're going to have to redo things in the fellowship hall. There's going to be constant maintenance on it. It's not when when we're investing in this, it's it's a perishable thing. This church isn't going to be here forever. This building, this church will one day be be reduced to rubble. One day it will. But the souls that this church touches, &gt;&gt; those are eternal, &gt;&gt; that is the work that we focus on. &gt;&gt; And and the of putting out a video, it's good. And but it's that's not the focus. And and the children's church and having fun, that's not the focus. through renovations. That's not the focus. What is the focus? Is are we touching people and is it having an effect? &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is anything working? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves that in our own lives. &gt;&gt; We all are familiar with the scripture Malachi 4:5. My question is, have any hearts really changed? Has anything really happened? Let me read the amplified version version of Malachi 4:5. Behold, I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their ch to the ch to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Reconciliation produced by repentance. So that I will not come and strike the land with a curse of complete destruction. Reconciliation is what the amplified adds there. A reconciliation produced by repentance. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking the question, did it happen? Has that happened? Has it happened in our lives? I'm asking you personally, has it happened in your life? Has this produced something, a change in your heart? Has your heart turned back to the apostles and the prophets? &gt;&gt; Has it done anything? &gt;&gt; We're going to celebrate Christmas coming up. You know that we'll have the some people have the tree and the star and the and the presents underneath and all of this, but do we lose the real meaning behind Christmas [snorts] &gt;&gt; with all of the packaging? &gt;&gt; Do we lose the meaning behind it? Are the gifts, do they represent what the wise men brought to Jesus? Does the star on the tree, does that represent the star of Bethlehem? Does it represent the birth of Christ? Or do we lose it all and we just say Christmas? Oh, it's a Christian holiday. But have we lost the meaning of it just with the packaging? &gt;&gt; How about Thanksgiving? It's coming up this week. &gt;&gt; Do we understand what it's about? &gt;&gt; Do we understand the importance of Thanksgiving? how people gave their lives so that we might have freedom here in the United States so that we could have freedom of worship so that we could have prosperity in this new land. Do we understand as we're putting the turkey out and the stuffing and everything else? Do we understand the meaning behind it or have we lost it just in the packaging of Thanksgiving? &gt;&gt; Do we understand what all of these things are about? And how about this church? The Tucson Tabernacle was originally founded really on the promise of turning the heart of the children back to that of the fathers. My question is a reconciliation produced by repentance. Has it happened? Have hearts truly been changed? Has it produced a group of people who have such an outward love for Jesus Christ and for each other? Not with their outward works, but has it produced a love that people have as Jesus prayed that you would I would know you for your love one another. Has it produced that? really ask yourself &gt;&gt; or is it just the same old thing just wrapped in a different package? something we need to ask. And for this generation, this new generation that's coming up that when we as we're dedicating ourselves in this church, is this going to be another generation that just has the same packaging on the outside? Or is this generation going to be truly the ones that their hearts are turned back to what the book of Acts taught &gt;&gt; and what Jesus Christ taught? &gt;&gt; Is it truly going to be that way? Is it truly going to be our hearts are turned back to that of Peter and of James and of John where they had such love one for another that everything was in common. If anybody had any need, they they were helped. They weren't they weren't they weren't hating each other and gossiping about each other. They were supporting each other. Our our lives, our spirits, are they going to be turned back to that? Really? I don't see it yet. What's a tabernacle? We call ourselves the tabernacle. What is a tabernacle? It's just a tent. It's just a a dwelling place is what it is. Moses, when he brought the Israelites out of Egypt, God instructed him to build a portable place of worship, a tabernacle, a tent. It wasn't the biggest tent in the world. It wasn't even probably the nicest tent in the world, but it was built according to God's instructions. And when they finished it exactly how how God had laid it out and they built it exactly. He he gave the specific instructions to the prophet of Mo prophet Moses on how to build it. And when they built it, you know what it was? It was just a tent. It was not special. It was a tent. It was a shelter. But then when the spirit of God came down and dwelt in that tabernacle, then it became something very, very special. Otherwise, it was nothing. Exodus 40 verse 34, look what happens when the spirit of God comes down on this tent. Exodus 40 verse 34. Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode therein, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Even the prophet Moses couldn't even come in there. And it because of this spirit of God that was so great in this tent. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward on in all their journeys. But if the cloud were not taken up, then the journey then they journey not till the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all of their journeys. We call this the Tucson Tabernacle. Why is it just the name that we just we just call ourselves or do we really know what the tabernacle in the wilderness represented? It represented the Holy Spirit coming down in a place of dwelling and abiding there and the pillar of fire by night. If this thing moved, they packed up the tent and they followed it wherever it went. They weren't f the tent was following the Holy Spirit and not the other way around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We heard testimonies on Friday night. Paul with a vision and a and a prophetic utterance from someone else. And it came to pass. Esther delivered of alcoholism. Manny delivered of drug abuse and immoral living. James and John asking God for a place to fellowship. Cleano delivered from a demon that was tormenting him. Friends, these aren't stories from another generation. This isn't us telling our kids about how the pillar of fire followed the tabernacle in the wilderness. This is real. This is modern day. &gt;&gt; We're not telling ourselves. We're not telling testimonies about about something else that none of us ever saw. &gt;&gt; These testimonies that we heard, they produced something. They produced a change of heart. &gt;&gt; That was the main thing. &gt;&gt; The Lord does miracles. Yes. But it's that that heart that changed. Turn that heart of the CHILDREN BACK TO something that is great. &gt;&gt; Don't forget the meaning of the whole scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to make a change in our lives. We forget that part. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven Bryant here, he sang the song earlier and and gave the testimony. He wrote me this this morning. I hope it's okay because I'm going to read it anyway. Stephen, I have nice permission. I realize he he said this. I realized that last night he was talking about our service last night. Stephen says this. I realized that last night I was back in the same pews I was as an infant and a child. And now I'm standing here as a grown man. And somehow God loved me enough to chase me down all those roads and made me into something I never thought I wanted to be. &gt;&gt; But there I was praying under such an anointing under such anointing for him to take 100% control. Then something new happened. It was faith to believe that he could take 100%. How many How many here really want him to take a 100%. That's a hard That's a hard That's a hard one to raise your hand on. &gt;&gt; Take 100% because that means you're going to have to give 100%. &gt;&gt; Because God's not going to take anything that you won't give him. Lord, I'll give you my Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; But Tuesday night, you know that's mine. I'll give you my five minute prayer in the morning, but the rest of the time it's mine. &gt;&gt; Jesus, that spirit of Christ, it's a sweet spirit. It's just going to take what you give him and and he'll be grateful for it. He'll take as much as you want to give. But our hearts should be turned back to those ones that we read about in the Bible. Peter and James and John and Philip and Thomas. Mary Magdalene. Talked about her the other night. Mary of Bethany, Martha, all the way back. Rahab, Hannah, David, and Samuel. Moses. turn our hearts back to have that same character, that same faith that they had. That's the meaning of this scripture. We forget the second part. There was a purpose in it. Brother Brandham did a great job. He actually did it himself. He had that spirit. What was that spirit? It was love. &gt;&gt; My aunt Jacqueline's here. one of the few people that actually knew him. Growing up, I didn't hear stories about the miracles. I didn't hear the stories about all the great doctrines. I didn't hear any of the stories about that. You know what I heard? I heard the stories about the man and the love that he had and the the presence that was around him. That's why people loved him. That's why people admired him. He actually did it. His heart was turned back. Now, what about us? &gt;&gt; Is it going to happen within me? &gt;&gt; It's about me. It's about you. &gt;&gt; Am I actually going to be one of those ones &gt;&gt; that really serves Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Am I going to be one of those ones? I talked about Stephen on Sunday morning last week and there's something about the name Stephen and uh it's been brother Ste brother Steve and I have been talking about this. You got Stephen Young in South Africa. You got Stephen Brousone here ministering for us. You got Stephen Bryant here. There's just this these meetings. I think I'm even married to a Stephven. Actually, when we when we talk to French people, that's usually what they call her. [laughter] Oh, Stephen. My French accent isn't so good, is it? It's just been a it's it's been a blessing to me. And I mentioned this man named Stephen in the Bible. This deacon who [snorts] stood for Christ. And you know what they crucified him? You know what they stoned him for? They stoned him because they said he was against the prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; And that was the reason. Oh, you're against Moses. Picked up the stones and killed him. because they said he was against the prophet. &gt;&gt; Listen to what Stephen said just before he died. Preached one of the most amazing sermons. Acts chapter 6 and 7 if you want to go back to it. Acts chapter 7 verse 44. He Steven is talking about the ta the tabernacle in the wilderness. And look what he listen to what he says. our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. So God had given Moses these directions on how to build this tabernacle, which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of the fathers unto the day of David, who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. So David, this king, Moses built the tent and then hundreds of years later, here comes David and they still have a tent. But God was God would come down and he would dwell in that tent for a moment. And David wanted to give God a permanent place to dwell. Not a tent, but a brick andmortar structure. Something that would really something that would weather the storm. Something that wouldn't get old and wouldn't have to be replaced. David had a vision for it, but David couldn't do it. The next verse says, \"But Solomon built him a house.\" Solomon did it, but it was still. That was the temple in Jerusalem. The first temple that Solomon built, it replaced that tabernacle in the wilderness. And Jesus and God, the shikina of glory would come down and dwell within that temple. But it the temple wasn't wasn't real. It was just a building. God didn't live there. He just showed up once in a while. It was never God's desire to live in a church building. We call it the house of the Lord, but it's not really the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the house where the tabernacles, this building in the temple, that's where, that's the house where the tabernacles of the Lord come in. &gt;&gt; The ones that are that dwelling place for God. That is what this tabernacle is. That is what a true church is. But the true tabernacle is the person. &gt;&gt; It's not the building. It never was. Remember the the tent was just a tent. The temple is just a building. But it was the God that came down into the building that made it special. And we we're just people. &gt;&gt; We're just flesh and blood. But it's the God that comes down and dwells within us. That's what makes us special. It's not claiming this or that. It's the real God that dwells within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's poured out upon us. Romans chapter 5 verse 5 says this. Listen to this. And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Modern translations, the modern wording, New King James Version says, \"The love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was who was given to us.\" So he's pouring he pours out that spirit into us. That was the motive of God in the first place. He never the the temple was never important. He wanted to pour his heart out. God wanted to pour his love into us. That was the whole purpose of it. All of the Old Testament, it was just a type. It was it was a prophecy of what was going to come to pass at the day of Pentecost when God no longer came just into the temple. Then he spread himself into the hearts of men and women. that shakina glory. It came down into the temple after Solomon built it and it was in the it was in the tent. But when it came into 120 people in the upper room, that was the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when it was fulfilled. The other was just a symbol. But when it came down in a man, that is was that was the fulfillment of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the real gift. The rest the rest of it was just a package. Ask again, what about today? Did it really happen? Have we really received the Holy Ghost? Are we that tabernacle that God dwells in? Acts chapter 4, what happened was in Acts chapter 2, the Holy Spirit came down and fell upon 120 in the upper room. They spoke with tongues. They went out. They were staggering. They were so touched by the spirit and they they prophesied and they started healing the sick and they started doing these same things that Jesus did. Now Jesus wasn't just a man. Now, he was people everywhere that had his same spirit doing the same thing. They received the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2. But I want you to think about this. You may say, \"I received the Holy Ghost when I was 12 years old.\" And you look back at that time. It's good. But what about today? &gt;&gt; What about Have you received the Holy Spirit lately? &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 2, they received it. Peter and John were there. John Peter was the main spokesperson. Then two parag two chapters later in Acts chapter 4, watch what happens. Same people, Peter and John and all the disciples, same one. Watch what happens. Acts 4:31, it says this. Remember couple who knows how long before they received the Holy Ghost. Now watch this. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness. &gt;&gt; They were filled again. A revival. You ever heard of the word? I've heard it a few times over the past few days. &gt;&gt; And the multitude of them believed that believed. Now listen to this. Watch what it produces. I'm talking about the spirit going back, us going back to that same spirit that they have. Turn our hearts back to these these apostolic fathers, these great ones. Watch this. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. Where's that today? One heart and one soul. Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things in common. The Holy Spirit filled Peter and John and the disciples again. Are we satisfied with just the package that we're in now? Are we satisfied with who we are now? Are we satisfied with an experience from 20, 30, 40 years ago? Or maybe even an experience yesterday? &gt;&gt; I want more today. &gt;&gt; You know what? I ate that good food last night. It was good, but I haven't eaten today. &gt;&gt; And I'm starting to get hungry again. And that's how it is with the Holy Spirit. Lord, I feel just full. I feel so good. Oh, thank you, God. It feels so good. And then tomorrow, Lord, I'm hungry again. &gt;&gt; I need it again &gt;&gt; and again and more and more. [applause] Constant infilling of the Holy Spirit. Remember when they were when when the temple was put there, that Holy Spirit didn't come down in Jerusalem just one time when they dedicated the church. It came again and again and again when that spirit would fill the holy of holies in that room. [sighs] Or are we just satisfied? I read a scripture the other day and it we all know it and when I read it you're going to recognize it. It's in second Peter chapter 2. And it just kind of struck me and I think Lord this scripture is really relevant for even dedicating a church. Second Peter chapter 2 verse 22. The apo the uh the apostle Peter is talking about the people who return to their sins. But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb. The dog is turned to his own vomit again and the s that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. It's a strange thought. I was I've gone over the past three or four years. I've been traveling back and forth to southern Baja Mexico doing a a humanitarian work there. And there's this ranch that that has this big giant pen. It's probably I don't know as big as this whole church. And I always see this same pig in the same spot and it's this big fat s and she, you know, has these big floppy ears and she's always laying in the same spot. She's always laying in in the same mud hole. Every time I come, she never moves. I walk in, I walk walk by her, we drive by her, and there she is. You know, she's laying there. It's like, okay, has she moved in the past six months? And she has all of this area to roam. And I'm sure that she does, but she always comes back to that same mud hole. That's so often with a sinner. We may come out of our sins, but there's something that brings us back to that sin. And he also talks about this dog. As a dog returns to his vomit, I know we probably all have seen that where a dog someone will make it sick and it'll throw up and then it'll leave and then it'll come back and it'll eat it again. It's gross. I know. It's really a nasty thought. But Peter is trying to tie in us and our sins to going back and eating the vomit again. &gt;&gt; We We might come to the altar. We might hate the way that we are and we might just come out right there at the altar and I might change my appearance. I might I might cut a couple of sins out in my life. But am I really the same person inside? Do I still want to lay in that mud? When we're walking through our daily walk, do I find myself in mud again? And Lord, I thought I came out of this. I thought my heart was changed. I thought I am a different vessel. And here I am in the same mud. And it might be resentment of someone. It might be it might be gossip. It it might be pornography. It it could be drinking. It could be any of those things. And you find yourself, Lord, I thought I was different. I thought I had changed. And here I am right back in this pool of mud again. &gt;&gt; Am I that same pig? Lord, I need a change in my life. &gt;&gt; I need I need these these demons that are are bothering me. I need them to go. And then that void that's created, I need that Holy Spirit to replace that. I need a change. That pig will always want to lay in that slop always because it's a pig. But if that nature changes, &gt;&gt; then she becomes something different. And the same with with this dog, you know, you you come and and make a change in your life and then on the inside, is there still pride? Is there still resentment? Is there still sexual immorality? And is there still fear maybe that you're going to get out of your comfort zone? You know, you look down at your feet and you say, \"Lord, here I am in this mud. I I want to change.\" or or you you you go back and and it's like, man, I thought I gave that up and I just ate it again. &gt;&gt; It's a disgusting thing to go back to our sins. &gt;&gt; We've moved past those. And I get it. You go back to the sin and it's like, \"Oh, it's just disgusting. Lord, I did it again.\" But you place it into his hands and you constantly work. And Lord, I don't want to be that that person. I don't want to be that same person I used to be. I don't want to be that that pig in the in the muck. I don't want to be that dog that eats its puke. I want to be something different. The importance of Malachi 4 is to turn our hearts back. That's the part we leave out. &gt;&gt; That's the part that affects me. That's that's the importance of it, but instead we're putting it on some somebody else or something else, but the importance is did it have an effect in my life? The importance of this church, it's not a video. It's not a a a new paint on the walls. It's not stone on the on the pulpit. Is it changing my life? Have I changed? That's the important thing. Everything else is just the wrapping. &gt;&gt; That's what matters with the tabernacle in the wilderness, with the temple. It was just a tent or it was just a building, but God came in there. &gt;&gt; That's the important thing. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Stephen verse number 48, Acts chapter 7. Stephen is saying the same thing. He says, \"How be it, the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me? sayeth the Lord, or what is the the place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all of these things? Back to Romans, he said, God's love has been poured out in our hearts and he did that. He created the heavens and the earth. He separated the light from the darkness. He did these things and he gave us a Bible to read that we might know him better. Amen. &gt;&gt; This Bible at the very beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and then the Holy Spirit steps on the scene and starts forming all of these these things. The Bible wasn't written. People tried to say, \"Oh, well, you know, it's 6,000 years and day one and day two and try to try to figure out this and try to figure out that and then the big bang over here now and that's when uh there was moisture in the in the earth and then that protected the that built the atmosphere and it's not written for that. If God would have wanted to write a a science book, he would have chose a great scientist. &gt;&gt; And neither is it a book of history. &gt;&gt; It's got good history in it. But there's things in the genealogies. It's like, well, what is was it this person or was this person was the ancestor? And you try to put it together. It wasn't written for that. If God would have wanted to write a history book, he would have chose some history professor. It wasn't written for that. This book, this Bible was written as a book of relationship between God the Father and us ourselves. You can't get the other stuff out of it. [applause] Amen. That's when you read this Bible, you see, oh, this is God dealing with us. &gt;&gt; This is this is him wanting a relationship. He built he made the Garden of Eden. Why? so his children could be there. &gt;&gt; That's what it was about. You know, day one, day two, day three. We got all the creation there and and God didn't think it was it was applicable applicable to our lives to explain how it happened. He put it there. But the main thing is that you have a relationship with me. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; God wanted to dwell with man, mankind. He wanted to dwell with women. He wanted to come down and he wanted to fill that that tabernacle in the wilderness. He wanted that fellowship. He wanted to be around people, but they were too sinful. They couldn't get close enough to him. There was no sacrifice there. If they would have got too close, they would have died. That that glory of God is too holy to where a sinful person if it comes in the presence, you couldn't even be on the same mountain or you would have died. But then he sent his son because he wanted to be he wanted to fellowship with us. He wanted that holy spirit to come down and dwell within us. So he sent his son so his son could take those sins and now he can fellowship with us like he did at the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of the book. &gt;&gt; I want a relationship with you. Here it is in the Old Testament. It's laying a foundation. and now I will send my son and he is the propitiation of sins. He takes those sins away and now I have a relationship with you because that's what I've wanted from the beginning. This tabernacle, this tabernacle and the tabernacle in the wilderness was made with human hands. We can come. Daniel and the the um the team can come. This was made with hands. This building was built by people. It doesn't matter. That's not the important thing. The work that that we do, we want to make it as nice as we can, but it's not it's not it's not the building. Don't look at the packaging. The main thing when you celebrate Thanksgiving, don't look at the turkey on the table, you know, and the stuffing and all of that, look at the reason that it's put there. &gt;&gt; When you go to when when Christmas, don't look at all the all the tensil and all the the trees and and the and the gifts. Look at the reason that that we celebrate the birth of the Messiah, &gt;&gt; our savior. That's what it should be about. faith is recorded in this book. The faith of our fathers is recorded right here. God wants to turn our hearts back to this, back to these men and these women, these great warriors of old. That's the purpose of it. And he said that he pours his love into this tabernacle. And Stephen before he died, he said, \"You stiff neck and uncircumcised in your hearts and ears. You do always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so do you.\" Friends, I want a church that's turned back to that original faith of the disciples. [music] I want that spirit that is promised. I want that spirit to to have its way in my life. I want it to be a success in my life. Not just pointing to something, but I want it to be alive in me. &gt;&gt; I want to be a tabernacle of witness. &gt;&gt; I want to be that place where God dwells because he made a way now because of his son Jesus Christ. He made a way for God to dwell within me and within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. That's the point of it. That's the sum of the matter. I want a church that's been turned back to the original faith of the disciples. We'll dedicate this church. You know what? This church has already been dedicated. You know, we don't have to dedicate the church. It's been dedicated before. But I want to dedicate the tabernacles of God that come into this church. &gt;&gt; Can we do that? &gt;&gt; Can we dedicate those individual tabernacles that Lord, I want to be the tabernacle? It's a building. Who cares about the building? I want to be that tabernacle. Lord, the tabernacle is not 2555 nor stone. The tabernacle is right here. &gt;&gt; And I want my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want my heart to turn back. I want my heart to turn back to the same faith that Peter had, that same burden that Paul had. Lord, I want that. I Lord, that's my desire. Can you imagine if it really happened? It's going to happen. Jesus prayed that there would be unity, such unity in the church that he would know that they're his disciples because of not their doctrine. We get so messed up. Not their doctrine, but because they love each other. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's too simple. &gt;&gt; That's meat. &gt;&gt; The other stuff is salad. &gt;&gt; That is meat. &gt;&gt; That is what really means something. That's how you will be identified, &gt;&gt; by your love one for another. And then he goes on to say, \"And Lord, I pray that there they would love each other so much that other people would know that I'm the Messiah because of their love.\" Yeah. [applause and music] That's what we want. And it's not pointing our fingers at anybody else. It's pointing fingers right here. Lord, I want to be that tabernacle. If there's only one in the world, Lord, I want to be that tabernacle. This church dedication, this is not a rededication. This church, as I said, it's already been dedicated to the Lord. That's been done. I want a dedication of myself today. &gt;&gt; If you haven't dedicated your life to the Lord, then today is the best day to do it. And if you have dedicated your life to the Lord, today is the best day to do it. &gt;&gt; Put in put the things that are in the past in the past. All the way all the way back. Sometimes it's like, Lord, I'm standing in the mud again. Lord, it made me sick, but I just ate it again. Made me sick again. That's what I pray that sin would be. That every time we sin, it [music] just makes us sick. Yes, &gt;&gt; I can't stand it, Lord. Oh, I did it again. Here I am. It just makes me sick. Then the Lord says, \"Ah, now I got something to work with &gt;&gt; now. Now you're doing something now. Now you're my son. I can start forming and here I come down into this vessel and fill you with the Holy Ghost and say, Lord, thank you so much. Thank you, dear God, for filling me. I know I am a child of God, but it it leaked out. I need some more. I need more. Lord, fill me again like you filled Peter and John the second time in Acts chapter 4. [music] &gt;&gt; And then the walls shook that the Holy Spirit was so strong the walls of the building shook and they were of one heart and one soul. Can you imagine a tabernacle, a church where everyone is one soul? They love each other so much. That's what I want to dedicate my life to today. Can we do it in one in one accord, one mind? Will you dedicate your tabernacle to God? Let's all stand. With your heads bowed, Jesus wants to fill that tabernacle. That shikina of glory that's written through the whole Bible. It wants to be in that tabernacle of flesh that you are. It wants to dwell there. God wants it. He loves us. He wrote the book so that we would have a relationship with him. Now, please, please dedicate your life to him. Dedicate your tabernacle to him. Daniel, let's let's sing while we're while we're just thinking on these things. All throughout my history, your faithfulness [singing] has walked beside me. The wind storms make way [music] for every [singing] season from [music] where I'm standing. I see [music and singing] the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life and I [music and singing] see promises in fulfillment. All [singing and music] over my life, all over my life. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now with our heads bowed, this is not a rededication of a church. This is a dedication of a tabernacle. Dedicate your life to him, friends, now and promise him, Lord, I am yours and you are mine. Oh dear God. Lord, we thank you for all that you've given us, Lord, you've blessed us beyond measure. But, Father, may that same spirit that you promised, Lord, to turn us back to the faith of our fathers, Lord. May it be manifested in us. that spirit of reconciliation, Lord, may we be reconciled with our father after all of our sins and all that we've done. And then, Lord, may we love one another. Stand for one another, Father. Lord, I dedicate my life aresh to you in the name of your son Jesus Christ. Lord, that I might be used on this earth as a vessel, as a tabernacle, of the Holy Spirit, of the pillar of fire, of the shikina glory. Lord, may it rest within me. May it rest within each person in this building. And dear God, may it be manifested outwardly through [snorts] Lord love as you promised that you would pour the love of God out upon us. Lord, pour it right into our souls. We pray and we dedicate our lives to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [singing] Reme [music] just for fear may [singing] come and feel. [music] You [singing] lead my heart to victory. [music] You are my [singing] strength and you always will be. And I see [singing] the evidence [music] of your goodness. Oh, [singing] all over my life. All over my life. [music and singing] And I see [music and singing] your promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life. You see the cross and see the cross. The empty grave. [singing] The evidence [music] is sinless. All my sins [singing] rolled away because [music] of you. Oh Jesus. See the cross [singing] the empty grave. The [music] evidence is endless. All my sins rolled [singing] away because of you, oh Jesus. Oh, [music] and I see the [music] evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And I see your promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful name [singing] it is. What a beautiful name it is. [music] The [singing] name of Jesus Christ my king. What a beautiful name [singing] it is. [music] Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful [singing] name it [music] is. The name of Jesus.

Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful name it is. The [singing and music] name of Jesus. I want to worship some more. You can be seated if you want to be seated. You can stand if you want to stand. Let's just worship. It's just good, friends. It is just good. Daniel, one more time with the evidence before we we sing. &gt;&gt; I see the evidence [singing and music] of your goodness. All over my life. All over my life. [music] And I [singing] see promises in fulfillment. Oh, all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; There's a beautiful blessing. in the Old Testament. And we're going to hear it, I think, probably sang as beautiful as it's ever been sung. I think maybe the day that it was given. I wonder if it was if it was this beautiful as this blessing that's going to be sang before us now. Remember this is a dedication service. The Lord bless you [singing] and keep you.

Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Anyone in Sunday school can be dismissed now. My troubled soul, key of B flat. We come to worship him this morning. So good to see you here. Happy, ready to sing. Let's sing this song.

Help my unbelief.\" It's something we can all do. Huh. So, there's a couple praise. Sister Ronnie wants to praise the Lord for healing and thank everyone too for praying. And then um sister she wanted to thank sister Angela too for bringing food to the hospital. She said I can't praise him enough. That's really nice. Yeah. Thankful. Pray without ceasing. It says with thanksgiving. So that's nice to be thankful, isn't it? We have one more. Surely more. I want to praise God for healing my brother-in-law of a body filled with cancer.

Let's pray then. Lord God, we thank you that you set it up this way. It's almost unbelievable that you've set it up this way, but we ask you to help our unbelief and help us to trust you. And you're the great physician. I've seen so many wonderful answers to prayer and even been surprised, Lord, with your kindness. And I just ask you to help each one here that we won't waste our time or you're you're in a dimension of no time, but just to make the most of our opportunity to pray to you and believe you and trust you and be thankful. In Jesus Christ's name, we thank you. Amen. [Music] Have your seats. We're just going to sing this chorus as they pass the offering. Hallelujah. Hallelu. [Music] Hallelu. [Music] Hallelu.

Day and night, night and day, let incense arise. The book of Revelation and uh I believe I'll get there today. The book of Revelation says that incense that arises up before the throne of God are the prayers of his saints. And that's as we're singing that that is what we are saying. Lord, let this incense arise day and night and night and day. Let your incense arise. Let it always come up. Let our prayers always come up before you, heavenly father. Lord, let this incense arise this morning. Our prayers, Lord, let them come up before you as the incense would rise from the altar of God. Let it come up before you as a sweet smelling savor before God. Lord, hear our prayers, I pray. be with us this morning as father as I continue talking about this great thing that you have given us this great honor that we have of pray bless our service today I pray in Jesus name amen you can be seated I appreciate as always I really appreciate our worship team they do such a beautiful brother Josiah and the gifts that he has and all the musicians and and just bringing this spirit of worship. It's just it's beautiful. Now singing isn't our only form of worship, but it is definitely a form of worship and that's why we sing is to bring these bring these our our prayers and our love to the Lord Jesus. Brother Arie when he brought the the prayer request to us, he said um he says that he he thanks God that we are that God has made a way for us to do this. And and I think his words were we thank you that you set it up this way. I think brother what brother Arie was saying is he's thankful that we are able to pray one for another and that God has ordained us to pray for each other and to bring these requests up before him. You think that if there was just a need, he would just give it to us. But that's not his way. His way is for us to pray one for another. I'll be talking about that in the sermon today. And it's really it's it's a great honor that we have to do this. Want to welcome our visitors with us. God bless you all. It's good to have you. Brother Phillip Johnson, where are you? There you are. Brother Phillip, stand up. You and your family. God bless you. Welcome. And this is Brother Rome's son. I had him stand because brother Philip and I go way back. Um, we used to fellowship and when we were young, young and single and and we had the youth groups around Tucson and I uh always liked Brother Phillip and his family and I always appreciated you. It's it's good to see you again and I'm really glad that the same thing happened to the top of your head that happened to mine. We haven't seen Last time we saw each other. who had hair. That's good. You make me feel good. Thank you. Yeah. God bless you. I'm sorry to tell a joke at both of our expenses, but it's uh it's good. And uh Brother Wayne mentioned, \"Where are you, Brother Wayne? I I saw you earlier.\" Um there you are. Brother Wayne uh said uh when I saw him in the hallway coming in, he said, 'I appreciate what you said last service. And I said, 'What did I say? And he said, you said, \"Welcome home.\" And I believe that. I believe that this should be a place that you feel is like your home. You feel that there's things that that you may want to fix about your home, but it's it's home. And and we're honored that you would say that. And brother Philip, I hope that you feel the same way that this is a place that loves you. And it's it is a place. It's home. And uh welcome also to any other visitors that we have that I didn't recognize. God God bless you all. It's good to have you. I told Daniel to stay up here because my message today will be what we've been talking about the past few weeks, which is about prayer and which is about communion with God. And I wanted Daniel to share. He he showed me a video of a young lady that he has been a friend to for some time now. And this young lady has her life has just turned into has just done just she's turned into a real blessing. And I wanted Daniel to give just the testimony, give a little bit of a background to this young lady and where she is now and his influence on on her life. Right there. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um, this testimony, it means a lot to me because it it just showed me how powerful God is when we don't think he's doing anything. And it just because in this testimony, I I really didn't do anything. All I did was just be myself. And it it ended up just being a a miracle. But um anyway, so I had this friend I met her when I was around 14 years old and she was she was a cousin to one of my best friends and they're from Quebec, Canada. And um I met her when I was 14 and we became good friends. And um around um she was around 20 years old and she started to stray from the Lord. She started to you know live a worldly life, live a life of sin and uh she was she went to school. She was a nurse surprisingly. I'm friends with more nurses. Um uh and she had just finished nursing school and she was in the worldly standards she was living a good life. She was she just got her dream job in another city. She had a boyfriend who wasn't a Christian, but he had a good job. Um, and she just got an apartment in a city that she was like, \"Oh, it's awesome. It was downtown and it was like her dream place to live.\" But she still felt alone through all those worldly pleasures and everything that she was getting in life. She she felt alone. She felt this void inside her because she she was just living a sinful life. And um so one day there was our friends were getting married and so she came back down to Jeff. I hadn't seen her for I think 3 years at that point and she um she came down and we we met at Starbucks and she was like she's like hey Daniel I'm coming down let's let's go do something. I was like absolutely let's let's go and let's you know hang out and you know just do what we used to do. And so we met at Starbucks and we started talking you know about her life and about everything. And she was telling me, she was like, \"I'm doing this wrong. I'm doing this wrong.\" I'm like, \"That's okay.\" I was like, \"That's okay.\" And she kind of looks at me and she was like, \"No, like like I'm sinning.\" And I was like, I was like, \"That's fine.\" I was like, \"That's just more for God to do for you.\" And she's just And she's just like, she kind of looked at me weird. And we ended up going the whole time. And we just had a good time. And I was just there. And I treated her just like we had always been when we were kids, you know, when we would hang out. I treated her just the same. I didn't treat her any different. And so she when she was on her way home, her and her cousins were talking and she kind of just broke down and she ended up giving her heart to the Lord and she went home and she went and she quit her new job in that new city. She moved her stuff out of her apartment and then she came back home to her parents and then she called me and she said, \"Daniel, I want to let you know I just gave my heart to the Lord.\" And I was just like, \"Oh my goodness.\" It was just it was such a miracle. I was like like like what happened? Like what what crazy miraculous thing happened? She was like nothing. She was like I just felt the love from you and then um two other friends that were there. She was like you guys didn't treat me any different than you used to. She was like all my family, some of my family wouldn't talk to me. She was like it was weird seeing them at the wedding. She was like but you guys I just felt the love of Jesus. And we didn't do anything different. All we did was just treat her the exact same. and treat her like anyone else. And that's the reason she gave her heart to the Lord. And now she's living a Christian life. She's dating a Christian boy. And she's just so happy. The happiness inside of her is just overflowing. It's just it's such a miracle. Amen. [Applause] I get uh when one person when one soul comes to the Lord, entire heavens rejoice. And Daniel was loving to this girl. He prayed for her. And my my subject today is uh about a scripture that has always meant a lot to me when I've prayed and it's always given me faith and that's in Acts chapter nine when the Lord comes to a prophet and he tells this prophet to go to this man named Saul of Tarsus. And his reason for that, God gives a reason. He says because he is praying. And to think that the prayers of this young lady, the prayers of her family and the prayers of my son. To think that these prayers were answered. And not so much that she stopped sinning as Daniel said. Not so much that maybe she would be healed or or would be delivered, but more so that she would have her own relationship with this man, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that will solve everything &gt;&gt; if you can just talk to God yourself. That is what prayer is about. And this morning I'd like to read the testimony of this man called Saul of Tarsus. And he was a very very sinful man. We might not, he might not have been sinful in say the worldly way that we often think of sin, but the religious way that Paul that the Apostle Paul, he ended up being the Apostle Paul, Saul of Tarsus, the religious way was just as sinful. &gt;&gt; And this is what this man Saul of Tarsus was. He was a very, very sinful, evil man. and his sins were coming out through his religious beliefs. So there is the sin that we see on the streets that we we see so often, but then there is also a a sin of meanness and a sin of not caring and a sin of malice. The sins that are mo mainly those are mentioned in the Bible, but those are the ones that we ignore so much for the other sins that are more maybe obvious. But the sins that are mentioned the most are the sins that this man Saul was committing. So let's read his testimony and then see what this the most important thing and all of this thing that we call prayer. I believe that this is this will tell us who we are praying to. And that's my subject this morning is who are we praying to? And this man, this man Ananas, this prophet named Ananas came to this man Saul because he was praying. So Acts chapter 9 verse one, I read the uh King James version. And it says this, \"And Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound into Jerusalem.\" Very important word, the way. And it says that if any found if he found any of this way, he's talking about what Christianity was called back then is the way. And as he journeyed, he came to he came near to Damascus. And suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth. And he heard a voice saying, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\" And he said, \"Who art who art thou, Lord?\" And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.' And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do? And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man, but they led him by the hand and brought him to to into Damascus. So he was blind after this experience. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananas. And to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananas. And he said, \"Behold, I am here, Lord.\" And the Lord said unto him, \"Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prayth.\" Those words that God spoke to Ananas have been such a comfort to me before that whenever I am praying I may not have the answer to my prayers right away as Saul didn't have the answer to his prayers but they went up and God heard the answer the heard the prayers of this evil man Saul heard his prayers and then used another man to come and answer those prayers. We talk about prayer, as we did a couple weeks ago, being our fellowship with God and how God wants us, he wants to be with us. He wants to talk with us more than we want to talk with him. And then last week we heard about the prayer of Jonah and how it turned God turned one of the worst situations that a man has ever been in being in the belly of the whale in the bottom of the ocean and turned it around and make made his testimony like and a type of none other than Jesus Christ's death burial burial and resurrection. How important friends is our prayer? And now we see this man who hated God's people and he's blind and he's laying in bed and he's not eating and he's not drinking and he's been fasting for these three days and he's seeking God and he's praying and God tells his servant Ananas to go to this man because of that reason because he is praying. back to Ananas and he's talking to Ananas, the Lord is and he says that this man Saul has seen in a vision a man named Ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight. Then Ananas answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem, and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him, \"Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.\" So he's saying, \"I'm sending you Ananas because this man is praying and he's already seen a vision that you'll be coming to him.\" It's amazing how God uses other people to bless other ones. You know, as brother Arie prayed at the beginning, he says, you know, Lord, we're thankful that that you set it up this way. You would think that I would just be able to pray and then God would just answer my prayers and God would just give me what I need. But that's not the way he does things. He uses other He uses each other to help us and he and he and he uses one another to to give us what we need. And it's it doesn't make really it doesn't make sense the way we do things. If Daniel needed say needed 20 bucks, I would he would just ask me and I would give it to him. and me being his father, I wouldn't go to my daughter Meline and say, \"Yeah, Daniel needs 20 bucks. Here, Meline, you go give Daniel this this money.\" No, I would give it directly to him. But that's not how God does. God uses others to give gifts to his church because he really he wants us all working together &gt;&gt; in this great economy of God. He has all of us in our positions and he wants us all working together and by doing that we will all be blessed. And here he has this man Ananas working with this man Paul and Paul needs healing. And it may be that we need a new job or it may be that we need salvation or may we maybe need deliverance or whatever it might be. And then God will send someone else to pray for us and to give us these blessings. It's odd how God does things. And maybe next week, that's not what I want to talk about today very much, but maybe next week that that will be our subject. But this man Paul or Saul, his name was changed to Paul. And I might use it interchangeably on accident, but he was Saul of Tarsus. He gave his heart to the Lord. He was called to the Gentiles. And his name Saul was a Jewish name. And as he went to the Gentiles, he took on the name Paul, which was a gentile name, so he would relate better with the Gentiles. So Ananas went his way and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\" Now, it isn't a traditional prayer. He just goes in. He was commissioned. He just goes in and he lays his hands on this man Paul. And then Paul receives his sight. So the prayer here is just to fulfill and that's how it always is. It's just to fulfill what God had already ordained. So when we pray for someone, God has already ordained that they receive what we're praying for. We are just acting in the name of Jesus Christ to do the will of God. And that's what this man Ananas was doing. And he says, \"Go to this man because he's praying.\" And immediately th there fell from Saul's eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized. So, tremendous story and maybe next week I'll get into this. I I want to tell a story about my mother and how the Lord healed her and my brother Adam is going to be coming this week for my grandma's funeral. So, he will be here next Sunday. So, I want to tell that story when Adam is here because Adam witnessed this a tremendous supernatural thing. Stephanie witnessed it. Daniel was there, too. But I'll tell this story about how my mom was healed of cancer through this supernatural thing just as Paul was healed. But then my mom three, four, five years later, whatever it was, died of cancer, even though she was delivered at that time. And she was she was on her deathbed at at the time that this this miracle happened. And then the Lord gave her many more years. And we look at this man Saul and we see that when Ananas came and laid his hands on him, these scales fell off of his eyes. But then he always still struggled with his eyes after that. So we hear so often, it sounds good. You know, you got to be careful about things sounding good. Oh yeah, that sounds right. But praise the Lord, brother. No. When you hear sometimes, well, God, God doesn't do things halfway. He wants to hear you fully. That sounds good, but just make sure what we say lines up with what the Bible says. God is sovereign. He does things his way. &gt;&gt; And this man Paul, he had to have his eyes, so God gave him back his eyes. But he always struggled with that. He he says um one time he says that God has given me a thorn in my flesh. Some people say it was a sickness. Most scholars think that this was because of his eyes. He struggled with his eyes. He couldn't read very well. And he even wrote when he wrote a letter he said you know that this comes from me because the letters are really big &gt;&gt; his he struggled with his eyes after that. So the Lord's willing I will talk about that next week. But the most important thing with this man Ananas coming to him and this most the most important thing about this whole situation with the apostle Paul was not that he received his sight. The most important thing was that he was he spoke to God himself. He spoke to Jesus Christ himself and he had that relationship now between him and God. If we pray for someone and they're healed, praise God. And I believe that God wants us to be healed, but we will get sick again. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord carries, we will eventually die. The same thing if we are delivered say from from nicotine we will struggle with something else and that's how that's that's just how this life is. But if we truly have a relationship with God if we know him then that relationship will always be with us and not just in this life it'll be with us for eternity. That is the true prayer. That is the true meaning behind prayer and that is the ultimate in praying for each other is that we can develop that relationship between us and God. Healing is wonderful. We should pray for healing and God does heal. We've all seen miracles and those miracles will continue. Deliverance is wonderful and we've all seen deliverance. Many of us have been delivered of certain things. These it might be a new job, might be whatever it is. God loves us and he takes care of us. But the main thing when we are praying and you'll see in in Paul's prayer at the end in in Ephesians when we get there the main thing is that we have that relationship with God. That is the main reason be behind prayer. Now Paul has this relationship with God. And when he had received meat he was strengthened. That's King James meat. He's not on the carnivore diet. It's it's food. The modern translation is food. And when you see in the King James it's it says meat it's it's the it's 300 years ago for um for just eating. So so he ate and then Saul certain days was with the disciples were at Damascus. Now watch the change. It's not that he was healed. He was healed and that's the glory. But now Saul of Tarsus is a different person. He had been saved. He had an experience with the Lord Jesus. He was healed and now he knows the greatness of God. And when you truly know the greatness of God, when you truly experience that, the healing or the miracle is minor compared to now what you have. And you'll see I really narrowed it down to two things really happen when you really give your heart to the Lord Jesus and you have that experience with him. Number one, and this is evident in Saul, is that you want to tell everyone about what just happened to you. You want to give your testimony. You want to lead others to the to the same God that you know. You want to share your experience so others will have that same experience. You're excited about it. The Lord just changed me. I met Jesus Christ myself. I want you to know him like I know him. That's why I'm standing here in this pull pit is I have that same desire. I want you to know this Jesus Christ. He's real. I don't want you just to listen to me. I want you to know him. That's the whole purpose behind a church. That's the whole purpose behind Christianity is that we know Christ ourselves. That's the first thing. Once you give your heart to the Lord, it's that you want to tell others. And then second is you want more. &gt;&gt; You're not satisfied with your one-time experience. And that's how the enemy can come in is he can say, \"Oh, well, you had an experience when you were 12 years old. You had an experience when you're 18. You had an experience when you're 25. That's good. But what about today? &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience today? &gt;&gt; Have you had an experience this week? You know, I know you can look back and that's good and you can set that typos back then and you might be able to go back to that like I do when I pray. I can go back to that scripture that says that Ananas came to Saul because he was praying. But I want more every day. I got to have more more because the the the Bible talks about about having our cup filled and or the the lamp filled with oil. My vessel is leaky and it's constantly dripping out and I have to constantly have that that vessel filled with the Holy Spirit. It doesn't just get filled once and stay there. No, that vessel is constantly being filled. And Paul, and you'll you'll see is and I'll get into the scriptures a little bit more. Paul wants more and more and more. And he says, \"I haven't even attained it yet.\" He says, \"But I'm pressing towards this. I want more all the time.\" So that's the two things when you really become a Christian, when you really give your heart to the Lord. And when you are filled with the Holy Ghost, now you want to tell everybody else. And now that desire that you had for the Holy Ghost doesn't stop. It actually becomes more, &gt;&gt; more, more. I need more, Lord. I need more. I need an experience today. I got to I got to have I got to have more. I got to have more of you speaking of the law of Moses. Paul said this. I'm going to read the New Living Translation. I just want you to listen to my voice here. This is in the book of Philippians. It says this. Paul says this. He says, \"I once thought these things were valuable.\" He's speaking of the law of Moses. He says, \"I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.\" This led what Paul is saying. They're not worthless, but they were going towards a goal. And that was not the goal. The goal is now what Paul received. And he says that I I now consider them worthless of because of what Christ has done. Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake, I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage so that I could gain Christ and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law. Rather, I become righteousness. I become righteous through faith in Christ. For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith. I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death, so that one way or the other, I will experience the resurrection from the dead. The translators put an exclamation point there in Philippians. I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. The Apostle Paul speaking, but I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. He says, 'N no, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing, forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God through Christ Jesus is calling us. The King James version of Philippians chapter 3 says this, \"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended it.\" Just what I read. But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. The main thing he is trying to tell us is that we know the author. We have the promises. We have the word. This word goes towards one thing. And Paul said it is going towards that we know him. Hebrews 12:12 says this, \"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" So once we know Christ, then Daniel might need the $20, but the main thing is that he knows his dad. is that he knows the father. And we might need something, friends. And we all need something. All of us. We all have prayers. Lord, help us. Every person in this room has something that God wants them to do for for them. But the main thing is that you know him. The main thing is that you can ask him and then it's up to him how he answers. I might give $20 to my daughter to give to my son. God might use Ananas to come and pray for Paul. It's up to him. But the main thing is that we know Christ as Paul met him on the road to Damascus. The main thing is that we know him. And now Saul of Tarsus had met Jesus Christ. Now watch what happens to his life. And it will happen to us. It'll happen to you if you truly accept Christ too. &gt;&gt; It'll happen to all of us. Number one, we want to tell everybody. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stand in the pulpit and preach, but you need to preach. &gt;&gt; You need to testify. &gt;&gt; And if it really if God really got a hold of you, it is so important. You want to just tell everybody because this joy is overflowing. And friends, there is no sadness in Jesus Christ. There is such hope in him. He loves us and he wants to bless us and we want to tell others about it. And then number two, as I said, we want more and more and more of him. Let's go back to cha Acts chapter 9 verse verse 20. And straightway Paul preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the son of God. This is the man that was just a few just a little while earlier. He was killing trying to kill these people who were of the way, these people who were worshiping Christ. And now here is Paul preaching what all of the other disciples and men and women of God were saying that Jesus is the son of God. That is the mystery of God revealed that this man Jesus Christ fulfilled all of the Old Testament. Book of Leviticus. I used to always just dread when I'd read my Bible cover to cover, I just dread getting to Leviticus because it was all of the offerings and all the sacrifices. And I just didn't understand it until the last time I read my Bible all the way through. I got to Leviticus and I said, \"Lord, please help me understand this. Please help me enjoy it because I always just read it to get through it.\" And from Leviticus 1:1 all the way through the whole book, the Lord showed me that this is all about Jesus. &gt;&gt; This all represents him. And it turned into one of my favorite. Merrily always makes fun of me because I always say, \"Oh, this is my favorite chapter. This is my favorite verse.\" It's what I'm reading. And when I'm in Leviticus, it's my favorite book because I can look at it and see this is Jesus. This this came to pass. &gt;&gt; This was manifested in this man, Jesus Christ. And that's how Paul, he's like, \"Wow, the whole Bible was fulfilled in the son of God, Jesus Christ.\" And that's what that's what it is. And when you truly meet Christ, as Saul of Tarsus did, you realize that you cannot preach anything greater than Christ. There is nothing that greater that we can preach than Jesus. &gt;&gt; We can preach salvation and and it all comes back to Jesus. We can preach healing, but it always come backs to G comes back to Jesus. Everything comes back to this man. I talked about the carnivore diet just now. Um that's the meat. That's the good stuff in the sandwich is Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is He has the nutrients. He has the power. It's all about him. Really, everything everything else is milk. Christ is the main thing. Verse number 21. But all that heard him were amazed and said, \"Is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?\" Isn't this the man that was just against us? But Saul increased more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. English Standard Version says, \"But Saul increased all the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.\" Amen. That's what he was preaching. And that's what all the disciples were preaching and that's what his disciples are preaching today that this man Jesus Christ is everything and the most important thing is that you commune with him. Romans chapter f chapter 15 verse 13. I just wanted to throw this scripture in there because it means so much to me. I'll read the New King James Version. It says this. Now, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. When you truly meet God and when you truly understand who you are praying to, there is such hope in your heart. &gt;&gt; It's not just hope. Lord, Lord, I'm in this situation. I need help. you know he can help you. &gt;&gt; But if you really know him, you know he's always there. &gt;&gt; You know he is just a a a a an infinite fountain of life coming up and knowing God is the very meaning of prayer and you you receive that hope. The Lord could deliver you might pray, \"Lord, deliver my son from drugs. Deliver my daughter from sin. help me find a husband or help me find a wife or whatever it might be. But if you could just if I could pray, I was talking with Daniel yesterday and I was in my den and I was just I was just kind of emotional just reading these scriptures. And I told Daniel, I said, \"Buddy,\" I said, 'You know, I pray for you that the Lord will give you a good wife like I have, that the Lord will give you joy in your life. I pray for you that the Lord will give you a good career, that the Lord will always give you this fellowship with him and that that that that you really prosper in everything. But then I told Daniel, I said, \"But buddy, if I could just pray for one thing in your life,\" and I had my Bible open there. I said, \"Listen to this.\" And I read Ephesians chapter 3 and listen to this. Skipping all my notes. Listen to this. Ephesians chapter 3. Let's go back, brothers. If you go back to verse 14, I'm sorry I gave him 16, but let's go back a little bit. The Apostle Paul. This is the one I was just talking about. This is the one that got struck down on the road to Damascus. This is the one that was persecuting the people. This is the one that was fasting for three days. This is the one that God sent this man, Ananas, to to pray for him, to lay his hands on him, that the scales might come off of his eyes, that he might receive the Holy Spirit, that he might be baptized. This is the one that that happened to years ago. This is the one that is praying this for the Ephesian church. Now, he is the Apostle Paul. He has he has had an experience. Now, he is the main person. He is setting the stage for Christianity until this day that we live in. He wrote most of the New Testament. He set the doctrines forth. This is why we believe that Jesus Christ is God is because of this man Paul. He was a great man. And listen to his prayer for the Ephesian church. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what Paul is asking. Paul had met Jesus Christ. Paul had spoke to him. He had identified himself as God to Paul. Paul has this great experience that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love. I talk about love all the time. Paul is saying that you need to be rooted and grounded not in your doctrines. You need to be rooted and grounded not in anything else. He says you need to be rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; That's what God is. &gt;&gt; Not even in our understanding. We are not rooted and grounded in our understanding. We are rooted and grounded. Paul is praying that we would be rooted and grounded in love. I'll read it again. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. That you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and depth and height. I can't explain these things in a sermon. We can't explain these things to our children. I can't tie the scriptures together and give an understanding of these things. This is beyond healing. This is beyond deliverance. This is beyond anything that we could ever ask for. He's saying that we would understand God. That we would fully understand what it is to love him. That we would fully understand what it is to have hope in Jesus Christ. That we would fully understand what it is for him to love us. And this is what the apostle is praying. This is what I was telling Daniel yesterday. Buddy, if I could have anything for my son, my beloved son, if I could have anything for my daughter, if I could have anything for the ones for you all that I love so dearly, of course I want your healing. Of course I want your happiness. Of course I want the young people to meet a good spouse. Of course I want those things. And those things are very important. But if I could have anything in the world for my loved ones, it would be what Paul is praying. If you could just know the love of Jesus Christ. If you could just get it &gt;&gt; now unto him that is able. No, I'm sorry. Verse number 19. and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; The love of Christ passes all knowledge. And Paul is saying if you could just know this love is beyond everything. It's beyond anything that we could ever ask for. It says, let's go back to and let's read it again. Verse verse number 14, brothers, if you go back there, I just want it to stick. I want you to leave church this morning thinking of this prayer that Paul prayed. And if you could pray this prayer for anyone that you truly love. Of course, we ask for what our immediate needs are, but this is this prayer is just it's everything. It's if we could just understand him. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, &gt;&gt; that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man. he could come inside of us that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints. So it's he's saying that Paul's saying that I want everybody to have this. Not just you Ephesians, not just you Tucson tabernacle, not just my son, not just my wife, not just my daughter, but he Paul is saying I want all of everyone to have this. all of the the saints. I want everyone to have this understanding that that he would grant you that you may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end. Amen. Let me read that again again. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, this Apostle Paul who was an important man and he knew because he had that experience with God and even he as I've read before even he said I haven't attained it yet. In another place he said I die I die daily. I want more. I want more. I got I got to have more Lord. I I want to and here's Paul and he's telling everybody about it. And then Paul, he lets us see a little bit of himself and he's like, \"You know what? I don't have it yet, but I want more.\" And then when he gets it and he's rejoices, the next day he's like, \"I don't have it yet. I want more.\" &gt;&gt; And then the Lord gives it to him. And then the next day he's like, \"You know what? I don't have it yet. I want to keep going. I want to keep going. I want to keep getting closer to God.\" And then if you would just understand, and he's saying all my little children, he's saying all of my friends and all of everybody, if you could just understand the love of God, if you could just understand how big it is, the dimensions of this this love of God, then believe God's work would be completed in your life. &gt;&gt; And that's with us, friends. That's what prayer is. Prayer is that communion and the musicians can come in closing. Prayer is that communion with God and how much we love him. And if we could just understand the meaning of his love for us, all of the prayers, all of our little needs that we have, they're all tiny. I've given my testimony before. I was just struggling in life a few years ago. And I went up in the mountains and I had all of these things going in my mind about all of these religious differences and all of these questions that I had going on and and I just I was like, Lord, I just need your help. I need to know what you want me to do. Where do you want me? What what what can I do? Where do you want my children? How, Lord? I just I need some help. And I looked up in the sky and I see all of these stars. There's no moon. The the the night was perfectly clear. And I looked up there and I saw the Milky Way and I saw all the different there's reds and blues and I looked at it like, \"Oh god.\" And I felt really small. I felt such a a tiny worthless person. And I looked and the stars, it wasn't just right there. It went all the way to the ground. It's like, \"Oh, God.\" Who am I? I said, \"Every one of those is probably bigger than the rock I'm standing on right now, and I have a worry. And I worry about things, and you created every one of them.\" If I could just know, friends, if we could just know God, if we could just realize how much he loves us, if we could just realize how important we are to him, if we could just realize that, then the prayers will be answered. Yes. But that's not the important thing. when we pray for one another. Lord, give this person, give brother Jonathan the understanding of how much God loves him and how great God is. Lord, give each one, as Paul prayed, he says, not just for you, but for all of the saints that you would just understand this love of God. If we could just do what Paul said, if we could just pray that way, pray that way as a church. And if you have a need, ask him. He'll give it. But the main thing, pray that this person would know God. And then then you don't have to worry. You can pray directly to God. And then that prayer is not dependent on your pastor or priest or mom or dad or anyone else. That prayer is between you and the almighty. And you say, \"Lord, I know you love me. I know you're hearing. And you may you may bring somebody else to me. You may let it fall out of the sky. Whatever it is, Lord, I know that you're hearing me. I have put up my prayer as this incense came up before you. I got to read it in closing. I'm over time, but let me just read this. Let's all stand. [Music] Oh, beautiful. Listen to the to the one that we are praying to. Revelation chapter 5 verse 8. Now when he had taken the scroll, the book, the four beasts, the four living creatures, I'll read the New King James version. We're similar. And the 20 and four elders fell down before the land. These are the most powerful people. These 24 elders and these four beasts, these four living creatures, these are ones with great authority and with great power. And they fell down before the Lamb. The same one that we pray to, the same one that loves us. They fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp [Music] and golden vials, golden bowls, as I mentioned earlier, full of odors, full of incense. which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, said, \"You are worthy to take the book and to open the seals. For you were slain and have redeemed us to God by your blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God, and we shall reign on earth.\" Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, the living creatures and the elders. And the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands and thousands. Like we talked about the other night, a hundred million angels circling around the throne and they're all singing, \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings in every creature. which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, \"Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.\" Then the four living creatures said, \"Amen.\" And the 20 and four elders fell down and worshiped him who lives forever and ever. And they even took off their crowns and they even cast him at his feet. And this is the one that we are praying to. This is the one that Paul said, \"I just wish that you had a relationship with him. I just wish that you knew how big his love is for you. I could go on and on, friends. Let's sing. Brother Josiah, [Music] my God is awesome. Verse one. My God is awome. He can move mountains, keep me in the valley, hide me from the rain. My God is awome. Heals me when I'm broken. Strength where I'm weaken forever he will. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again. My God is awesome. Sing it to him. &gt;&gt; My God is awome. He can move mountains. Keep me in the valley. Hide me from the rain. My God is awome. Heals me when I walk in. strength where I will be forever he will reign. Let's sing it in the chorus. My God is awome. Yes. Oh, awesome. Awesome. [Music] He's awome. Oh my God. He's awesome. Awome, [Music] awesome, awesome. Verse two, my God is awome. Savior of the whole world, giver of salvation. By his stripes, I'm healed. Oh my God is awesome. Today I am forgi. His grace is why I'm living. Praise his holy name. [Music] [Applause] Oh, he's awome. Yes, he's awome. Oh, awome. Awome. My God is awome. [Music] Awome. Awesome. You are. Let's sing verse two again. My God is awesome. Savior of the whole world. Giver of salvation. [Music] By his stripes I am healed. Do you believe that this morning? My God is awome. Today I am forgi. His grace is why I live. Praise his holy name. My God is awome. Awome. [Music] Awome. Awome. My God is awesome. Awome. Awesome. Oh, he's mighty. Oh, he's mighty. He's mighty. He's mighty. He's mighty. He's mighty. He's awome. Oh yes. He's awome. He's great. He's great. Worship him. He's great. Yes, he's great. Hallelujah. He's great. He's awome. Awesome. He's holy. Sing. He's holy. He's holy. He's holy. He's holy. He's holy. He's awome. Oh, awome. Oh my God is awome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. He is awesome. Awome. Awesome. My God is awome. &gt;&gt; Is he awesome? &gt;&gt; He's great. He's wonderful. He is so good. Can you imagine if we could just know the height and the depth and the the breadth and and everything about his love? Can you imagine if we could just know that? How great would our faith be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How just Lord, I have a need. I know you know me. I know you love me. I have a need. Here's my need. Lord, my sister, she has a need. I know you love her. Here's her need, Lord. I place it into your hands in the name of your son, Jesus Christ. Can you imagine that faith, that love? If we could just understand that love of as Paul prayed, then our faith would grow and it would just bubble over. Let's bow our heads. Before the throne, there was a sea of glass like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in the front and the back. The first living creature was like a lion, and the second was like a calf. The third had the face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. And the four creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying, \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.\" Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders fall down before him who sits on the throne. And they worship him who lives forever and ever. And they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, \"You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they exist and were created. Lord God, Lord, just to think all that is around your throne right now and these these great beings, Lord, that we might not understand, but they are worshiping you. And Lord, to think that we are sons and daughters, [Music] Lord, to think that you love us and to think that you care, Father. with all of that's going on in heaven right now and to think that you care. You care about me. You care about every person in this room. Lord, you love us and you spoke through your apostle and he prayed that we might understand your love. Lord, give us more understanding. Give us more revelation of you. Father, we pray. Lord, help us through the day. Help us through this life. Father, may your blessings, Lord, rest upon those that are in this room and upon those that are streaming in to this service. May the love of Jesus Christ become more real. Lord, we pray. in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Tim, it's a song called the revelation song. First line is worthy is the lamb who was slain. Yes. There we go. Worthy is the lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is he. Sing a new song. him who sits on heaven's mercy seal magic. Sing that again. Worthy is the lamb. &gt;&gt; Think about him there. &gt;&gt; Worthy is the lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is he. Oh dear God, we worship you. Sing a new song [Music] to him who sits on heaven's mercy se. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.

Ah, he's worth our adoration. Oh, and just think the one that we are praying to is the one that really loves us. And Paul was praying, I just wish you could understand his love. So friends, let's continue on in prayer. Tonight, come ready to worship. Tonight at 5:00, we're going to have uh we're going to have some song specials. And uh before we get before we get started tonight, I will answer asked the church to bring some questions in. And we've had some very good questions. One question I think is pertinent to our church and I think it's a very very important question that we understand and I will be answering that question tonight. It's when Jesus says I came to divide. I came to separate. What does that mean? Well, I always talk about unity. I always talk about love. But then he said, \"And yet I come to divide And I think it would be very very good for us all to hear. I'll just take about 10 minutes or so on that question and then we'll just sing and we'll worship and we'll just have a good time. So come tonight. It'll be a good service. God bless you brothers and sisters. As we leave, please I I know that we're going to be praying. There's going to be a lot of people praying. So as you leave, pre please exit the sanctuary quietly in respect of those that who would like to stay and pray. And then I hope to see you out in the fellowship hall, brother Phillip. So good to see you, bro. I hope to hope to see you out there. It's good to see all of you. God bless you all. And you're dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy.

Haven't seen you in a little while. Good to see you. God bless you. [applause] I got my haircut and uh everybody laughs when I talk about anything on my hair. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, [laughter] right. Uh it feels good. It feels good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Um I wanted to continue on a little bit with the sermon this morning. And I mentioned um about social media and I mentioned about saying things on social media and then sharing those things and even commenting on those things on YouTube. And I I mentioned this one pastor was I I heard him commenting about some things that were being said um about um just about the pastor of the Bram Tabernacle, Joseph Brandom, and uh calling him names. And you know, you may not agree and we may not agree, but what in the world are we doing insulting each other on either side? That is nothing but childish. &gt;&gt; And yet we lift ourselves up to be the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; And we say things on both sides that are demeaning and really just ridiculous. And friends, I say that we never we should never insult each other. And sometimes it there is place for rebuke. Paul publicly rebuked certain people. You can still read it in your Bible where Paul called out people by name. There's nothing wrong with that. But when we call when we insult or when we call names or when we say someone has an antichrist spirit, even if it's like I said this morning, even if it's the pope, come on. Don't do it. That is lowering ourselves to a place that is beneath us. So friends, I don't think that we should ever do that. Never. I think we should uplift uplift people. There is a place for correction. I mean, I brought a lot of correction this morning about how we need to be careful in sharing posts and saying things. I said that and and I I mean it. So there is a place for correction. And there's a place for correcting error, but there is no place for insults. Jesus said, \"Call no man Raqqa.\" The word raqa, I've heard a different a few different translations for it, but it's an insult. And Jesus said, \"Don't do it or you're in danger of hell, really.\" So, we should be careful. Social media is a it's a scary thing. Uh, Sister Andreana shared with me a a post that uh has happened over the is it the past few weeks, past couple weeks? P started Friday night and it was so it was shared Friday night and it's Olivia, your children's school district and uh it's it started in a small Facebook community. If uh um Abby, could you put that picture up there? This picture right here. And what it is is um it's some some teachers and they have this shirt on that's obviously meant to look like blood stain on the left side of their shirt. And the first thing that we think of is what many education related professions are taking a stand against this man Charlie Kirk. He was shot on the left side. He bled out on the left side. And here we have a bunch of teachers up there with a shirt that has blood poured down on the left side and it says problem solved. Wow. &gt;&gt; Absolutely horrible. Horrible. Am I right? And this starts being shared and it started in a small Facebook community and then it went viral on Tik Tok, went viral on YouTube, went viral on Instagram, different social media platforms. If you go to the next picture, already and quickly rebuked by even the Arizona House of Representatives. They write a letter rebuking what this was, saying, \"We do not stand for this and telling the people basically that these people making fun of the death of Charlie Kirk is an absolute, my words, an apostasy.\" However, however, go back to the previous picture. The picture of that one. Let me read what was said to sister Andreana. Dear Veil, parents and families, remember this is this is ten, thousand th thousands and thousands tens of thousands of of shares and and comments about this death threats to the school district for them making this stand. Here's a letter Sister Andrea re received when when did you receive it? Yesterday. Dear Veil parents and families, we're writing you to inform you about a situation that has been circulating on social media involving members of Sienna High School math department. A photo showing teachers wearing shirts that say problem solved has caused confusion and concern. We want to clarify that these shirts were part of a math themed Halloween costume meant to represent solving tough math math problems. The shirts were never intended to target any person, event, or political issue. Unfortunately, the image is being shared online with false claims that they were intended as a statement of recent events in our country, referring to Charlie Kirk. This is unequivocally untrue. The shirts were purchased online and were also worn last year as part of the same math themed costume long before the recent events. For anyone questioning the validity of those shirts were questioning questioning the validity that these shirts were worn last year, I'm happy to provide you with a with a photo. We understand how this image could be misunderstood and taken out of context, especially by people who are not associated with the teachers or school. We are truly sorry for the hurt or upset it is it has caused it has caused. The teachers involved care deeply about their students and community. Many have served Veil Veil family for years and many of them and all of them are committed to our children and none of them would and then it cuts off but none of them would do anything like this. Do you see taking a a picture like this? I mean, it's Halloween, so it's like I mean, it's a bit ill- advised as far as having a bloody shirt, but it was referring to a math problem. Problem solved. And it's a Halloween costume, so they have blood. Last year, people saw this and they made the jump to saying that they're making fun of Charlie Kirk. Death threats. I mean, this right here, this post, uh, at the bottom of that one, I Yeah, right at the top, it says, \"Fire them all.\" Taken out of context and misconstrued. Do you see how powerful our words are? It could ruin these people's lives. And that's um that's the dangers right there. So I I wanted to wanted to continue on with that. I wanted to mention that. Thank you. You can take it down. Not the best choice in shirts, you know, but certainly not didn't have the wrong intentions there. Um, I wanted to I want to talk about tithing and I want to talk about a one question that I received and this one will be a short answer and uh this one I just got um a few days ago. It says why don't we stand for the word of God? I assume that the question means why don't we um when I am ministering I probably about 70% of the time I will pray and then have the congregation seated. The reason I do that is because it's just my style of ministry is I want to greet the people that are here and I want to say a few words. And my ministry is a whole lot of reading the Bible. So, I'm not going to have you stand through my whole sermon. It just it wouldn't it wouldn't work. Um many churches have the tradition of the pastor taking the pulpit and then remain standing and reading a scripture and then going into the sermon which is a great tradition. I think it's very respectful in standing for the word. I I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I can there's there's places in the Bible like in I think it's Ezra where when Ezra opened up the book of Moses all the people stood &gt;&gt; for the in respect of the word and I think it's very very it's very respectful thing to do but then there's other places in the Bible when they sat so it's with and then I think with a message mentality many People may remember the quote that brother Brandham said, \"We stand for the flag being raised. We stand for other things. We can stand for the word.\" However, very rarely did Brother Brandham have people stand for reading the Bible. And I'd say, I just did a quick search. Maybe 10% of the time, maybe he did that. Most of the time he did it like I do it. He prayed and then had them seated and then he talked for a little while before he got into his sermon and didn't have them stand again. So, um, and I think we have to be careful with tradition. If we get too involved in tradition, even if it's a good tradition, in standing in reverence and and and doing um doing the same thing over and over, there is nothing wrong with me taking the platform, praying, opening my Bible, and reading a scripture and then saying, uh, be seated. Nothing wrong at all with it. However, if we do that every time and you know kids, the people grow up in this church and you go to another church that doesn't do that. It's human nature because it's different. You're going to think it's wrong just because that's the that's your tradition. That's the way you've done it. And I think we have to be careful in doing that. Just because we do it over and over does not make it right. It just is what we do. It's just a tradition. It doesn't make it wrong. But we have to be careful in that mindset of thinking that because I grew up a certain way or like I said this morning about just because we hear something over and over again, it makes it to where we think that that's what's what's the right way in our minds and it might not be the right way. With me, it's and it's just it's my personality. It's the way that I am. I don't like to do the same thing over and over again. I like change and and I see everybody's faces. It's like, hey, we're going to start doing a construction project over here. Like, oh, what is he going to do next? Messing up everything again. [laughter] It's just friends, change is part of it. And I know that most people are not comfortable with change. I understand that. But sometimes we have to change to grow in the Lord. Okay. So, I wanted to uh so why don't we stand for the word of God? Um it's just not the way I do it. I do it sometimes. Um but it's just not the way I minister. It is the way brother Lyall ministers. He usually does that. Um Brother Null did that the other night and I like it. It's good. But it's not a must. We don't have to do it that way. Okay. So, that's that's uh my answer to that question. So, now tithing. Uh there's three things. I'm going to go through a bunch of scriptures. There's three things that uh by the way um for the visitors, I've been going through uh the um some questions that the congregation asks. And um one of the questions that I've received multiple um notes on is how do we tithe? What is the proper way to tithe? And as I read these scriptures, as always, I want to get every all my answers from the Bible. As I read these scriptures, I want you to remember three things. The first thing is God is first. That goes for tithing and that goes for every aspect of our lives. God is first. The second is tithing is not a business contract with God. You don't tithe so you can receive. All right? You you don't tithe as in prosperity gospel that you can become rich. &gt;&gt; You laugh. That's a very very common thing. Brother Joe says you're sure. I'm going to look how much and see how much you tie. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding. By the way, I have no I have no idea how much anyone does. [laughter] I'm not privy to that information, nor do I want to be. There's there is one time that I will ask if someone tithes, and that is if there's a problem in the church and someone needs help, I will ask the trustees, does this person pay tithe? I don't care how much but if they do then I I feel like the church they are part of the church and the church has more responsibility for them as I said I could care I don't know how much anyone does and I don't know who does the only time I will ask is in that certain situation um so so the first thing is God is first the second thing is you don't tithe so you can receive listen Jesus Christ died on the cross and he gave you something that you could never repay. Tithing is just honoring his word to provide a place for uh to serve God here in this church. With that said, that there there are blessings with tithing. And then tithing, the third thing is tithing is an honor and it should be something that we want to do. &gt;&gt; All right. So the the the first thing as I was putting this together this afternoon, God is first. Tithing is not a business contract with God. And tithing is an honor and it's something that we should want to do. First, let's define tithing. We we use that word so often u but it has a very um it has a very specific meaning. There are places in the Bible where uh that where portion was given to God was 10%. There's other places in the Bible where that portion was 20%. That I found. And then there's one place that I found that it seems that that portion was 30%. However, the definition of tithing is 10%. Is a tenth. That's what the word means. All right, let's go to Genesis. I'm sorry I didn't give you any scripture verses. There's a lot of them. So, just Is it you, Abby? Just try to keep up. Genesis chapter 14, verse 19. I'm going to read the New King James Version. Then Melzdc Genesis 14:19 Then Melzdc king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was the priest of the most high and he blessed them and said, \"Blessed be Abram of God most high, possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be God most high who has delivered your enemies into your hands.\" Now Abraham is coming from the the slaughter of the kings and he he had he had taken the bounty and he gave him a tithe of all is the next verse. Uh verse number 20. And he gave them tithes of all is what the King James says. Many translations I'd say about half of them say one10enth of all. Both translations are correct. The word tithing simply means a tenth. All right? So when you say that I tithe 20%, no tithing is 10%. So you tithe 10% and then you give another 10% extra. But the very word tithing means 10 means one/tenth. And the uh one of the questions that probably the most common question received that I've received over the years on tithing is do I do I pay on gross or net as far as my income? And [sighs] basically, do I pay after my taxes have been taken out or before? I always lean towards paying on the gross because I think that we put God's God first. But really, I always want to make those type of things up to the individual. You know, your own personal situation. You know what you're capable of doing and what you're not capable of doing. But as a minister, I would encourage I encourage you to study it, but it looks very much to me like the gross number is the proper tithing number. But again, I I leave that to you and to for you to pray about it and you to make your decision on that. God first. All right, that's our first. We want to put God first. Let's go to Malachi 3:8. You know, it's really neat. We talked about divorce and we went into the book of Malachi and it really gave us our answer. And now we're going to go to tithing and it's going to give us our answer again. Do you remember the book of Malachi? It's a really really interesting book and it's a dialogue between God and man. And what was happening were was the people of Israel, they were putting God last. So maybe in their tithing, they were saying that, \"Oh, I have uh it takes me $50,000 a year to live. I make $52,000. So, I will uh let's see, we have $2,000 extra. We'll pay tithing on that because that's what I have extra. Or, and this was specifically mentioned, they have a flock of sheep and they say, \"Okay, well, these uh I I see this sheep over here. It's kind of deformed. It's not a very good-looking one. I couldn't sell this one for very much at the market. I'm gonna take that lamb and I'm going to give that one to God because I can spare that one. And the book of Malachi is just back and forth with this dialogue and they're saying, \"Well, how have we cheated you? How have we done these things?\" And he's pointing out that, \"Hey, you listen, you're giving me the worst. You should be giving God the best.\" So Malachi chapter 3 verse number eight it says this will a man rob God here's the dialogue yet you have robbed me but you say in what way have we robbed you in tithes and offerings two things remember tithing is 10% offering is also there you are cursed with the curse, for you have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Now, into the storehouse, friends, we when you bring tithes in and when you pay your tithes here to the church, it comes in into um the fund that pays for everything. It pays for if there's renovations that need to be done. It It pays for the electricity. It It pays for any type of rent. It It pays for the instrument in instruments. It pays for everything that we do. All of that doesn't just come out of thin air. It comes from us giving. And that's how a church functions. And that's why it says here, \"Bring these tiths that that there may be food in my house.\" It's saying that support the church with your tithes so then that church can in turn support you and support others. And try me now on this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessings that there will not be room enough to receive it. Now, I want to stop there for a moment. This is not, as I said, this isn't a deal with God. You don't pay tithe so you can get rich. Prosperity gospel says if you give, if somebody will give a $100, you'll get $1,000 with a certain return. If somebody gives a,000, it'll be 10,000 and all of that. That's notice he's not talking about, he doesn't say money. He says you're bringing your tithes in, but he says that you are going to receive blessings from this. And I'll get to that in a little bit later. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, so that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, nor shall the vine, nor shall the vine to bear fruit for you in the field, says the Lord of Hosts. and all nations will call you blessed for you will be a delight land says the Lord of hosts sayaeth the Lord of hosts. So he's saying that you're going to be blessed. God's saying to put him first and he always says this. This isn't just in tithing. The scripture isn't just about just giving tithes. The scriptur is about everything in our lives. If we will put God's first, God first in our decisions, &gt;&gt; we'll be blessed by it. &gt;&gt; Last week, we talked about Malachi and how God listens to our conversations with our wives in our private rooms. Put God first in your relationships and he'll bless you. Put God first in your job and he will bless you. Put God first in your tithing and he will open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it. All right? He might not be talking about money, but put God first in your tithing and you your life will be better. All right? I mentioned about working out your finances. Don't work out your finances and say, \"Okay, we have this much to give to the church.\" All right? Maybe with offerings you do that, but with tithing, put him first. &gt;&gt; All right? Take that out first. Genesis chapter 28 verse 20. Let's read this. This is really good. This is Jacob. And he had this vision. Then Jacob rose early in the morning. And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put at his head and set it set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethl. And he called the name of that place Bethl. But the name of that city had become had had been loosed previously. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, 'If God will be with me and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that I come back to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God.\" Now, Jacob isn't making a deal with God right here. He's saying, \"If God will give me a job to support myself, then I'll be able to return it.\" Then then the Lord shall be my God. And this stone which I have set which have set as a pillar shall be God's house shall be God's house. And all and of all that you give me I will surely give a tenth to you. Very very important thing says here and of all that thou shalt give me. So Jacob is saying that everything that I have, my job, my money, my donkeys, everything that I have, you gave me. It was yours in the first place and you gave it to me. And everything that I have that you gave me, now I will give a tenth to you. So basically paying tithes, paying a tenth on everything that God has given. Notice that the the vow he's not making a deal with God. He's saying that like you young people when you get a job, Justin, when when you when you get a career and you get set, you say, \"Lord, if you give me a job, I'll pay my tithes. But if you don't have a job, you can't pay your tithe because you don't have any money coming in. All right? This isn't like a um some sort of a deal where if you give me more, I I'll I'll um if I give more, then I'll get more. And then one of the questions that we often get is that tithing is not mentioned in the New Testament. So therefore, we shouldn't tithe. And that that question has come quite a bit or you should give. But tithing is not necessarily ne that not necessary. And really some things don't need to be said. Some things Jesus didn't have to say because it's said so much in the Old Testament and tithing is all through the Old Testament and we should know that we're supposed to do this. Just common sense tells us that we're supposed to. But with tithing, it actually is in the New Testament. And I'll give you a place. Matthew chapter 23:23. Now listen to this. Matthew 23:23. This is for the people that say that tithing is not in the New Testament. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For Jesus was straight. These were selfrighteous people. And and he's like, \"Listen, you guys are hypocrites.\" And I was talking with somebody the other day about how Jesus, he was he was very kind and he loved the self-righteous people. He loved them just as much as he did the the woman that washed his feet with her hair. He loved them all. And he loved these proud, egotistical, self-righteous people. He loved them. And it looks like the way the only way that he could get through them is to really hit them and say, \"Listen, you think you're all that, but you're a hypocrite. Wo you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites.\" He's trying to lead them to the Lord here. He's trying to lead him to himself. For you pay tithe of mint and annis and coming and cumin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith. All right, here's the key. These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone. So he's saying you're paying tithe. You should have done that. So he's agreeing with paying tithe, but he's saying, \"But you're leaving the other stuff undone, the the bigger, more important things. You're leaving that undone, and you're just going through the rituals. So let's let's get now let's go to the prosperity gospel.\" And there are blessings associated with giving, just as there's blessings associated with prayer, blessings associated with going to church, blessings associated with repentance. But there is nothing that we can do. There's nothing that we can bring to the table to barter barter with God. John 3:16 says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but shall have life, everlasting life, eternal life.\" There's no, we could never pay for that. We could never enter an agreement enter into an agreement with God saying that well if I give this then you'll give this listen he gave everything and we have nothing to give. So, you hear pastors, you hear preachers, and I've heard them over the years calling on the people. He said, \"The Lord,\" many of they've said, \"The Lord is is telling me that somebody is supposed to give a $1,000 or or brother, if you give $1,000 and God's going to reward your business, or he's going to double the size of your income next year.\" That's not right. &gt;&gt; When you give tithing or a gift, then you no longer have that gift. you no longer have that tithing. It was given as a sacrifice to the Lord, not as a business deal with God, not to not to promote yourself or prosper yourself. It's got to be a sacrifice. It's got to be something that hurts a little bit. It's got to be something that like in Malachi, don't give the lamb that's not worth anything. Give him your very best lamb. And that's that's with this ting. And I've seen the mistake over and over through the years. And even I've had family members say that, you know, I want to be rich or I want to prosper. So they'll give everything that they have to the church with the expectation that they're going to be even more have even more later on. Or they they'll they'll sell their house and they'll give the the the money to the church. While that might show a lot of faith, it doesn't show any wisdom. Now, you don't have a house and you've given all your wealth away for really for personal gain because you think you're going to get more. It's like buying a lottery ticket. That's not right. But I've seen people I have seen people do this make these foolish decisions in giving everything that they have because oh maybe 1977 is coming selling all that they have and preparing for that like I said has a lot of faith but no wisdom or that uh they might have some financial trouble. So, I think that I'm just going to give everything that I have and then the Lord will get me out of that financial trouble. The Lord didn't he did not require you to give everything. He requires you to give 10%. And offerings on top of that. So, when you give to God really, you no longer have what you gave or it wouldn't be a gift. It wouldn't be a sacrifice. And friends, for those who haven't paid tithe in years or or never have paid tithe and are just coming to church and you can't make ends meet now, start giving now. That would be my best advice is you say, \"Well, I've never done this and and I don't have the money.\" Start with something. Start giving. G give what you can. Start today. really work your way up to 10% if you have to, but it's better than not doing anything. So try and then instead of making tithing your last priority, now make it your first priority. Proverbs 3:9 says this, \"Honor the Lord with your possessions and with the first fruits of all your increase. So, your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine. The key word there is um the uh barn shall be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with with new wine. Go to verse nine. Could you go to the previous verse? Yeah, there we go. Honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase. The first fruits. You know what the first fruits are? It's the first things that come ripe in your crops. So you take the first that you have and you give that to God. Right there it says honor him with the first verse. Go first. Put him first. Take what you have first and ma and make make that what you give make that your offering to the Lord your tithing to the Lord initially and then he'll bless you. He promised don't worry about it. How many I mean especially the older folks you know that you've paid your tithes all these years and you've always had what you needed. &gt;&gt; Am I right? You have the Lord's always provided. We have done all our small part and he does his big part. &gt;&gt; Now in closing the last part, it's a blessing to pay tithes. And really it should be something that you want to do. Let's go to 2 Chronicles 31:4. 2 Chronicles 31 verse4. Again, I'm reading the New King James version. We have the Old King James up there. 2 Chronicles 31:4 says this. Moreover, he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support for the priests and the Levites that they might devote themselves to the law of the Lord. As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first fruits of grain and wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. Tithe is 10% of everything. And the children of Israel and Judah who dwelt in the cities of Judah brought the tithe of the oxen and sheep also the tithe of the holy things which were consecrated to the to the Lord their God. They laid in heaps. So the people gave willingly here and it was a blessing to give. So much so that that really that many times throughout the Bible, one of them I believe was with this priest named Jehoida. They needed money to renovate the church, to renovate the temple. So he took a box and he bored a hole in it and put it in the back. And he said, \"That's going to be used for the renovation of the church.\" And the people gave freely so much so that he was constantly dumping the money out of it and putting it back. And the people wanted to give. And that was the spirit of the people. They it was an honor for them to give. They gave. They gave freely. In Matthew chapter 25 or chapter 5, we went through this either last week or the week before. Matthew Matthew chapter 5 verse 23. Listen to this. Jesus is says this. Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there and there remember that your brother has something against you that your brother hath ought against thee, leave your gift there before the altar. Right? He's talking about bringing a gift into the church in giving. Leave your gift there before the altar and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift. So people wanted to give to the church. They thought it was an honor to give, but Jesus forbade it until they made things right with a person that they had offended. It also shows this scripture, brother null, shows that tithing is holy. &gt;&gt; That Jesus is saying don't even give your tithing if you have if someone has ought against you. It shows how holy and important this honor of giving is. I'll close with this. 2 Corinthians 96. The Apostle Paul speaking, he says this, \"But this say I.\" 2 Corinthians 9:6. Thank you. But this say I. He who sws sparingly will also reap sparingly. And he who sws bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart. Very important. That's why a pastor should never get up and try to pull on the people for money. Shouldn't do it. It's not right. Let each one give as he feels to give. Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudging grudgingly or of necessity. Again, not right for the pastor to get up there and say, \"You've got to pay your tithe. I'm checking the ledger.\" No. You present the word to the people and now say, as I as I love to say, it's like, I read it here. Now you take it and apply it to your life &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit leads you. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity. For God loves a cheerful giver. And it is it is an honor to be able to give. It's an honor to be able to pay tithes. It's an honor to be able to give an offering on top of our tithes. And one other thing that I would like to address is with our tithes, you don't have control over your tithing. All right? An offering. You might you might come to me and say, \"Uh, pastor, I want to sponsor a food program. I want to sponsor the food program next week or something like that.\" Fine. That's an offering. But when you pay tithing, you don't have control over it. you give it and then you you trust in the leadership of the church and the trustees and you trust in me to spend it in the right way. So I wanted to tell the story quickly about this boy that gave his lunch to Jesus when they didn't have food. He had this lunch. He had some fish and some some crackers and maybe as a bag and he offered this offering. You'll notice he didn't have he had to give it up. He took it and he had to give it to the disciples and say here you take it. And then the disciples brought it to Jesus and it was multiplied. But the key with that story is he had to give it up. It wasn't him that multiplied it. He was the one that provided it, but then the disciples took it and then God gave the increase to it. So again, you're tithing, you're offering, sure, you can direct that. No problem. But you're tithing. No, that comes in to the storehouse and it goes really as the Lord leads there. We together.\n"}, {"id": "2024-02-29 - The Book of Judges Pt 1 Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans.txt", "text": "################################################################################\nSTART OF

was reading it again this this afternoon or evening before we stepped in and look what Paul says here and what we're going to be hearing in the book of of Judges here for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world I was reading through the first few chapters of the Book of Judges again and and God you know with Moses is with them and all you know they're serving the lord they have a someone to kind of look to and and and and follow his footsteps but after Moses passes away and we begin to see how they turn their back on God and God says because you've done that he says now I'm going to give you over to them and then they would come back running to God and say we did wrong and his great mercy and his grace reached out to them and then they would turn his back on him and they would run but Paul tells us deny those things and live Godly you know and let Christ live in you and I I just thought that was a good scripture to go with with what we'll be hearing today so we do have some requests I'm going to ask brother Ed if he'll he'll come up in and open in prayer and take the request brother Ed says that their son Nate Cen has an urgent unspoken request for a young man so Lord knows who that is and then sister Martha said prayer for Dan Miller a friend from rapidly spreading cancer so Lord knows who this is Sister Mercy somano had mentioned to my wife that that she's been having a lot of pain in her arm so we'll remember remember her also and continue to remember Sister Sarah codner as she was had gone in possibly think she might have pneumonia but they found strep if I understand and they're still waiting on some results from the test so let's believe if you'll stand with me and brother Ed if you'll open in prayer and take these requests and it's it's good to have brother Ed here on a Wednesday night in case you know this is the same brother Ed that's here on Sunday morning work is done for a while so he gets to stay home I'm blessed to be able to be back home and be here at church so let's pray gracious

it's always a blessing for someone to join us and bring another lick of fire you know the the more licks of fire that you get the the bigger that the fire is so God bless you brother welcome and we appreciate you coming I um made a couple announce ments this morning I'd like to reiterate those that uh we have our communion service this Sunday and as always it's something very very important take this very very seriously the Bible says that a man should again examine himself that's what we should be doing this week in PR preparation for Sunday night when we take the Lord's body and his blood doing in in remembrance of of him um and then I also mentioned that this Friday there's a youth service at brother osario church he um their church is down by the airport please attend I think it'll be a blessing to you brother asario has been so supportive of us here um appreciate when we get the youth together that uh brother Isaac brother sario son is and all the crew has always come so we we really appreciate them and I want to show our support to u to them for this this Friday's youth service and then I also mentioned at the end of this month um we all got together and we packed a bunch of boxes and got everything ready I want to put those boxes on the road I want to get those to brother Caleb Perez's church over in Los Cruses so I would like to make a trip especially with the youth but everyone's welcome later on the last weekend of this month we'll go on a Saturday and uh we'll we'll stay overnight I'm sure brother Caleb will have some um Gatherings for us on Saturday evening and then on Sunday we'll go to church and then come back Sunday evening I don't know if I'm going to go yet or not I scheduled brother Ryan long good friend and a brother I have a lot of confidence in he'll be ministering that Sunday morning here so um think about those things I know that there it's a blessing friends anytime that we can get together sister hope that song I think that song is is my life that I can't even walk without him holding my hand I think of how much he has done for me and how I thought that maybe I could do something and how many times I've failed in my life but he just reached down that hand and picked me up and just walked me around and and I I want to stay completely depend dependent on him thank you for that song and I also appreciate brother Aaron giving thanks to to the Lord for work I've heard brother Aaron give thanks to the Lord for giving him some time off and brother Aaron it's also good to thank the Lord for when he gives us work you know we take it for granted and we should always give the Lord thanks for what he does for us a good job is something that is is precious and I I appreciate that brother Aon I appreciate given thanks at all for all things and all the time we should always praise the Lord and never complain friends there should never be a complaint coming out of our mouths um for the Book of Judges I I won't get through it today I'll get through the the first part of it and then uh we will um pick it up on um on the next Bible study that we have in the coming weeks sister Bonnie Marriott as I was leaving church on Sunday I don't know if she knew she they don't come usually on Wednesday night but I don't know if she knew that judges was going to be my sermon on Wednesday but as I was leaving church or as she was leaving at church church on Sunday morning I shook her hand and she grabbed my hand and and she pulled it to me and she said these words something on the order of I think this whole thing has become the Book of Judges and I knew what she meant and she was talking about how that we just fall into sin so easily and I think about this Book of Judges and boy it's a depressing book and it's been bothering me all week last night I woke up and I was repenting I was just feeling bad for everything that Israel had done in this book and and all the mistakes that they had made and just setting the Lord aside and I was as I was laying in bed this morning I was thinking about all the failures of Israel and then the thought came to my mind that how similar we are to these Israelites and what happened to them you know of all the books in the Old Testament I think the Book of Judges is the most applicable to not only our society that we live in but also in in the churches and the in the circles that we Fellowship in I look at look at how things have gone and and This Book of Judges it's just this continuing cycle of of the people a a man of God will come in and then God will bless Israel because the people will serve the Lord and then that man of God will be taken off the scene and then the people fall into sin and they do exactly what that man of God taught against and then they'll get themselves into this big mess and then they'll cry out to the Lord and then the Lord will send them another servant of the Lord and then they'll start living better and just over and over and over again and I I was laying in bed this morning I was thinking Lord how much have we done that how much has has the people that claim to believe that this man came back in the 1950s and 60s a great man by the name of William brandom and changed just changed really the whole religious landscape changed the world brought a message that people could see that God was alive alive and God he he was actually was a living breathing God that did things and wasn't a god of 2,000 years ago and how people would come through the prayer lines and and they would be healed and probably all of us know or have met people that have been healed and then God sends this man and he has a message behind it and that message friends I say it a lot but that message is not what we hear today in our churches it makes it just Grieves me so much and in reading this This Book of Judges I think Lord that's us we have fallen right back into the sin that this man tried to pull us out of and when I say the sin what did brother brandom preach almost every sermon that he preached the Lord Jesus and come out of those denominations we just listen to a Christmas message and he preached about denominations he preached against the sectarian form of worship where we draw a circle around ourselves and we say that we are better than someone else and brother brandham came and he hit that thing and he said this is false Doctrine come out of the Methodist and come out of the Baptist and come out of these things and he also said that there are three kinds of Believers in every in every Church saying very much that these methodists and Baptists and all and and all of these denominates they are believers there we ignore that part of what he said and we separate ourselves and draw a circle and I see that brother brandham hid it and then when he passed away what did we do we did exactly what he taught us against we formed this denomination or this cult called the message he did not preach that his message was Jesus Christ and him crucified and his message was come out of that he even called it the mark of the beast why why would he hit that so hard and and make a statement so strong as that it's because the people are believing because they're part of a religious system or they are part of a church or a part of the Catholic denomination the the Methodist or the Baptist or the message or whatever it is they think that that's going to save them they think that they're going to get to heaven because of this and it dest destroys the word of God and it destroys Jesus Christ in the person and what they do is they don't seek the Holy Spirit what they do is they seek a church and then they lift up this man of God whether it be Joshua Moses one of the judges they lift up this man of God as their champion and it makes it to where they don't have to receive this Holy Spirit and then the churches the min history lifts it up so much and says how great we are and doesn't push saying that you must receive the holy spirit that you must have that personal relationship with Christ that you must know him let me tell you if we don't know him I'm talking about me if I don't know Jesus Christ William brandom was a failure in my life because I can't get on I can't get into heaven on him or his message I have to get into heaven on a Jesus Christ and him crucified and that I know him and that I have received his Spirit into my life and it makes me friends it makes me so it just it's just got me so upset thinking that we have created as I said on Sunday we have created this image of what we think God should be and then this is how we're going to get saved and this is how our church should be and it's false it's in our minds and we have done exactly what I'm going to read about in This Book of Judges so as I'm reading this this isn't this isn't 3,000 years ago this is true today and I really believe more than any other book in the New Testament the Book of Judges The Book of Malachi is very similar too but the Book of Judges and how we immediately leave the gospel when that man leaves and we fall right back into idolatry or right back into denominations or right back into what it is exactly what he said to come out of I was was thinking about that today and I'm I'm studying and it's getting me all worked up and and there I am in my chair and and praying like Lord and then I start I get a text from somebody I haven't talked to in a year or two and he tells me he says brother he says uh I just wanted to say Happy New Year um yeah I got kicked out of my church Message Church Minister because he was preaching that no we don't we have to we have to have Jesus Christ and being the bride or whatever it is is not because of a man it's because of Christ and he started he was teaching almost the a very similar thing saying that these Pharisees and Sadducees had an image in their in their minds of how a a Believer should be and that's exactly what so-called message churches do today is they have this image and it's all about the man and not about Jesus and they said basically you can't preach it here anymore and that's what we've become we've become exactly what brother brandom said come out of that makes me it breaks it breaks my heart that people get so caught up they W even friends they wouldn't even go to church going to church is wrong remember I talked about the Sadducees thank God again that we went through the book of Acts the Sadducees right there they were too good they wouldn't even believe any of the other prophets they only had one Prophet his name was Moses that arrogant spirit and sinful people sinful I'm I'm not talking about drinking and smoking on the weekends which is sinful talking about worse than that I'm talking about self-righteous judgmental egotistical rotten Sinners we think we always think of a sinner we think of the the prostitute walking down the street or the homeless guy sitting on the corner smoking meth or whatever he's doing who is the worst center is it him or is it the sadducee they're both dirty in the sight of the Lord but one is willing to repent the other one's not I was thinking about that and I was thinking about all these different groups that we've gone into and how we draw our circles and we cut everybody else out oh but we draw our Circle bigger no we don't that is so ridiculous people that would say that we really don't we will draw our circle around somebody that believes at least mostly like me but somebody that doesn't man we'll cut them out Jesus or no Jesus it's sad but it's the truth it should be Jesus Christ and him alone and that is what brother Brandon preached the other day I was talking to somebody we were going through the the table the message search program I said do this I said go in there pick any tape any date any page any paragraph and what's it going to be talking about so we did it we did it like 10 times almost every time he was talking about the Lord Jesus try it it's awesome that was his everything but instead we go off and we don't listen to what he said I was thinking about that today and I was I was texting back and forth from this with his brother and I was uh updating the website and uh working on on YouTube and putting some links in there and uh a sermon popped up of uh brother Perry green and uh looked at it and uh I was like I wonder so I I scrubbed forward and I turned it on there's brother green talking about all the different denominations within the message and he was talking about the seven Thunders and he says they don't know if that's been revealed or not he was talking about the same thing like hey they're just this is just a division between all of us I uh let me let me read to you a quote from brother brandom and he's talking about I think he's talking about Gideon one of the judges brother BR preached this sermon if God be with us then where all the Miracles and it's about Gideon that's what Gideon said Gideon's like if God be with us and he saw all the sin in Israel and everybody's talking about how great they are and we've got the message and we've got all this and Joshua and Moses and everything but Gideon says well where are all the Miracles then he said brother bam said this few years before this talking about Gideon had been the prophetess Deborah and baric and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do and it was exactly right baric the great warrior and how they made a song of the triumph over the enemy but as soon as they got out of the twist right straight back into the rut they went again if that isn't the picture of the church today just as soon as it gets out of one twist right into another one it goes but the time but time had come for action and that's the same now the time has come for Action the time had come when playing when playing church had come to a halt with God there's no more playing church we must get down to business and I trust that same God will place this upon the heart of the people tonight that it's time for a halt of playing Church playing religious playing righteous and now it's time for Action as I was speaking this morning upon the subject of what the new birth was and how we come to it surely that still sinks in your heart now the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth you cannot act with Faith until first you know what you're doing you've got to first know what you are doing before you can have faith to do it then on that same tape brother Ram's closing and he says this oh God let us see a coming year this is a New Year's Eve message let us see a coming year till our hearts will not be satisfied with a church denomination or Creed with a handshake or so-called religion let us not be satisfied till we feel the miracle working power in God in our own Hearts taking the world out and forming Christ now not tonight and tomorrow start doing something else but grow in him up to his stature we grow up to him until we meet him that was his message brother Lyall that's what he preached he preached Jesus Christ knowing him growing in him find a sermon that he didn't preach that and we claim to believe him with all of our differences and sectarianism and all of our denominational ways we claim to believe the man that preached that every service and that's what judges is the Book of Judges shows that the people got their eyes off of God and their eyes on the world Joshua's final statements you know this one he says choose this day whom you will serve as for me in my house will serve the Lord and Israel when he said that Israel responded saying we want to do the same thing we want to serve the Lord too friends the world isn't just influencers on Tik Tock teaching our young people to sin and to look and act like the world but it also shows in This Book of Judges that it is a religious spirit it's worshiping Gods worshiping gods that were not Jehovah worshiping an image created in their mind and that image isn't real those Gods weren't real it's the same thing with us sometimes we make up something and we think that this is how religion is so I'll do this and I'll pray this way and all of that it's not real you got to know Jesus talk to him about it and then when you have that relationship then some then God will start moving sin followed these the worship of these these other gods and that's exactly why Joshua told the people to drive out these Canaanites from the land the promised land over Jordan brother brother Lyle just finished with the Book of Joshua they came over the the river into the promised land that God had promised way back all the way to Abraham they come over into this promised land and then God says now start driving them out start pushing them out remember they go to Jericho and they find Rahab and and then they go to I believe it was Ai and then they go on and on and on and on and they start driving these inhabitants of the land away and the Canaanites as is going to be referred to in this book the that's just a general statement for the people that live there that's the hites and the moabites and the jebusites and and all the land all the IES that lived out in the land and God knew that these people were going to influence them the Book of Judges it lasts about 400 years I I read a lot of different commentaries on it anywhere from 300 to 500 years but it looks like it was about 4 400 years that that this book covers and the same thing happens over and over in these entire 400 years and you can just pick wherever you want to open the Bible in that book and it'll be saying the same thing Israel does evil in the eyes of the Lord the people are given into the hands of their enemies they cry out to God for mercy God raises up a leader the spirit of God comes upon that leader the leader defeats the enemy and then peace is restored as long as that leader lives and then the cycle repeats itself over and over again with each judge the word judge it doesn't mean that it's like a judge in a courtroom who uh like deciding different cases and interpreting the law the judge for the most part these are military leaders who rise up and conquer the enemy now this is as you read it on your own you'll see a couple times it says because there was no king in Israel Israel had never had a king before judges so you it goes judges is from Joshua it ends at uh josua begins Josh judges begins at Joshua and goes all the way to King about King Saul so this and King Saul was the very first king of Israel so judge judges spans that time again from Joshua all the way to King Saul the author I don't really know who wrote judges a lot of people think that it was the prophet Samuel because Samuel was there when when Saul was there and he would have been The Logical choice to have written this um Narrative of all these years but they really don't know who the author was the 12 judges mentioned in the book annel ahud shamgar Deborah Gideon toah J jeepa izan Elon abdden and the last one is Samson some other people say that actually um Samuel was the last judge but in the Book of Judges it ends at Samson some of them some of these judges like like shamgar they only have one or two sentences about them and then others like Gideon and Samson have a whole lot written about them um as I said the the author they don't know who really wrote that um chapters one and two in the Book of Judges they speak about Conquest God's still with the children of Israel in the first part of Judges it's because Joshua was fresh in their minds but the L mentioned this when he taught on the Book of Joshua that Joshua and those Elders that knew Joshua they kept serving the lord but it was when they passed away that Israel began to fall chapters 3- 16 talks about how the israels fall into sin and compromise with the world that surrounds them and then really chapters 17- 21 closing of the book are just very strange we talk about some very very odd stories and it looks like everything is just in pure chaos in Israel at that time very sinful sinful time that was going on and you'll see that this Book of Judges more than any other it is very graphic I mean violence and a lot of n nasty stuff going on um I'll try to give the uh I'll water it down a little bit but it's it's rough This Book of Judges is a it's a tough book to read the book opens with successes with the tribes settling into their inherited land remember Joshua divided up all the tribes um and and they they came to their land and as I said they were successful they were driving out these inhabitants um so then the judges really show this book shows how important good leadership is it shows that when you don't have good leadership that the children of Israel immediately went into sin and it's it's both it's leadership on the government level it's leadership in the church's level and it's leadership right in home and all of us can see all of us know people that their families have just really had trouble and a lot of times it's because of poor leadership at home we see our we see in our country right now we see the sin just being invited into our country and we see everything fails because of it and it's not just the morality that people we see the economy failing we see all kinds of big problems associated with it but we see poor leadership within within our country with all the way at at the top Judges chapter 1 we'll get into the into the text now judges 1 verse one now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them and the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land into his hand now I know it's it seems very simple but notice they asked the Lord very very important they went to the Lord first they did what Joshua did they did what Moses did they did what these Elders did that had set this example is exactly what they did and they continued winning battles here in the Book of Judges but they made a big mistake as they were going out out God had instructed them to completely drive out the inhabitants of the land but they didn't completely do it and the problem was that Joshua had died and then the degradation of Israel began and as I said before it's because they didn't have that relationship with the Lord that they should have had and today what I was saying earlier is is if you right relying on the righteousness of brother brandom or your pastor your parents or anyone else rather than you receiving the Holy Spirit then the same thing is going to happen to you as happened in This Book of Judges that I'm about to read so let's go uh let's skip to verse 21 now watch this and it may seem kind of boring in reading this but it is super important to lay a foundation to the Book of Judges and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem under this day so those Canaanites were an influence and we like to think often we like to think that we are going to influence everybody else but in this case it was them that influenced God's people and the house of Joseph they also went up against bethl and the Lord was with them and the house of Joseph sent sent a describe sent to describe bethl now the name of the city before was L and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him show us we pray thee the entrance into the City and we will show thee mercy and when he showed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with at the edge of the sword now they again they won another battle but watch this but they let go the man and all his family and the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name thereof lse which is the name thereof unto this day neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor tanac and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of IAM and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land it's important to the author here to tell us this and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out right here they could have driven them out but because they demanded that they would pay taxes sounds sounds like a good idea huh well we'll just we don't have the money so we'll let these people stay here because they have some money and we'll just demand that they pay tribute to us it sounds good and you think how could God want us to drive out these people this is their home how could God want us to drive them out of their home it was God's land no matter how much anybody says anything this was God's land he could give it to whoever he wanted and he gave it to the sons and the daughters of Abraham neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in gizer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer among them neither did zebul drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of noo but the Canaanites dwell among them and became tributaries neither did did Asher Drive outs drive out the inhabitants of acho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of Hal alab nor of um aib nor of helba nor of AIC nor of reob sorry I can I can't pronounce the names but you know what I'm saying you can read them for the L I should have had you just pronounce them but but the asheritah ites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out neither did Neftali drive out the inhabitants of Beth shamesh nor the inhabitants of bethan but he dwelt in the among the Canaanites I feel like when I'm talking I feel like I have a lift but I'm saying that it's hard to say nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth bees became Tri in um that that in Beth bethan became tributes unto them and the amorites forced the children of Dan I can say that one into the the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down into the into the valley so what did this Disobedience to God result in it made sense to the Israelites to do what they did but still God's word was God's word and he told them to drive them out chapter 2 verse one says this and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to boim and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers and said I will never break my commandment my Covenant with you and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this don't make a deal with them don't jump in with them don't partake of their sins do what I told you and drive them out but you didn't do that let's skip to verse 13 and what did it result in and they forsook the Lord and serve Baal and asero now this Baal and asteroth these are the gods of the inhabitants of Canaan and I want to point out again that this is still worship they thought that they were doing right they're not going to do something they don't think is right so they're still worshiping it's still religion even though it might seem like Idol idolatry to you and me to them it was real and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of the spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies enemies whether soever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord had said and as the Lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken under their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did not so and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them remember what I said at the beginning we came out of the denominations and I truly feel like we have made a worse denomination and become more sectarian and more judgmental and more um elitist than the ones that came out and it came to pass I believe that's true I really do that we have slipped into the same thing that our grandparents came out of and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice I also will not henceforth drive out anymore before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may Pro prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua now chapters 3- 16 are stories about the growing corruption that is now in Israel and it just gets worse and worse and worse there's six main judges I said that there were 12 before but there's six main ones annel ahud Debra and Gideon jeepa and Samson this anneal we'll start with him and then I'll probably get through one more before we close but this anneal he was either a nephew of a brother sometimes it's hard to hard to understand in the Bible whether it's a what kind of relation it is but he was either a nephew of or a brother of Caleb and Israel's first judge after the spirit of the Lord came on him AEL freed the Israelites from this king kushen ratham who ruled over the region of Aram and part of Mesopotamia this man had oppressed the Israelites for eight years and after off and afterwards annel overpowered the forces and the Jews enjoyed peace for 40 years until AEL died so what happened was so these Israelites they got into their land and they didn't drive out these people that they should have driven out and then the oppressors they start to get more powerful these Canaanites and what they do is they come in and they take from the Israelites they take their food they take their gold and they oppress them it's the same as if you've studied some of the history of this part of the country the Apaches they would be up in the mountains and they would come down and they would raid the other Native Americans and take what they've done and that was part of the living that they would that they would make I'm not trying to take a side between any of these different tribes but that's history that's that's these raiding tribes would come in and take what these farmer tribes would have and that's that's the way it is a bit of a symbiotic relationship I guess that they would take and that's what was happening here is these Canaanites would come in and they would take from the Israelites God would raise up a judge to fight against them and he raised up this anneal to fight against these Canaanites and then for 40 years until annol died and then they started falling back into sin ahud is the second let's read uh 312 here and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord strengthened Egan the king of Moab against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord and He gathered unto him the children of Ammon and amalec and went and smote Israel and possessed the city of the of palm trees so the children of Israel served eglan the king of Moab 18 years years so God raises up this judge this man named ahud now eglan as I said was the king of Moab so this man ahood hope I don't get them mixed up mixed up Egan was the king I'll say the king and then ahud so ahud he raises up the spirit of the Lord comes on him and then what does he do he makes the sword it was 18 inches long you know how I know it was 18 inches long the Bible says it was 18 inches long it was a cubit and it had two edges and he makes it to where it will fit under his under his outside clothes on his right leg you know why he put it on his right leg because he was left-handed so he could go over here here and pull it out really easy you know how I know he was left-handed the Bible says he was left-handed it's really neat the detail that that is in This Book of Judges so he builds this knife he puts it in here and so he can he can pull it out when he needs it and then he goes and all of the people of Israel they give him the tribute money to bring to this King so ahud takes all the money I doubt very seriously that the children of Israel knew what he was going to do he takes all the money and he brings it and he gets an audience with this King so he takes it up there and and they're in the king's chamber and all of the guards and stuff are around and all the servants and um ahud says to Egon he says uh he says he looks at me he says hey I have a I have a private message for you has all this money so the king's like you have a private message for me he's like yeah yeah I got I have a private something I want to just tell you so he looks at all of his servants he say okay leave everybody leave everybody get out of my chamber all the guards leave all of the servants leave they go out and he's like shut the door shut the door they shut the door and ahood says I have a message from God for you and he says really and it has it gets his attention and then aood pulls out this dagger that he had made now Egan was a very fat man you know how I know he was a very fat man the Bible says he was a very fat man he pulls out this dagger and he uses it so uses it he sticks him with it and he goes in so far he can't get it out so then this this egin this guy is mortally wounded he dies so ahud he uses this chance he's like okay the king's here dying so he takes off he gets out of there and then what about the servants the servants are still outside and they're like man what is taking the king so long and they're too afraid to go in and check on the king and all the time that they're they're one wondering do we do we go in there do we not he's he's in there what's he doing in there the hero is escaping and running away so then they finally figure out the big king is dead and uh after that the Israelites attack this Moab and they overpower and they win the battle and again we had peace in Israel so that's the second judge I have I have time to go for at least one more so then the third judge is this guy named shamgar there's only like one sentence about him and in the whole Bible and it says that he took this Ox go and he killed like 600 Philistines you know what an ox codat is an ox is it's it's a it's a like a spear that has kind of a point on it that they can poke the oxes or has some sort of a tip on it and they can get them to go where they want them to go so this man shamgar takes that and kills all of of these Philistines and judges Israel one like one scripture about this but this shamgar was a uh he was a very special person he was a special person to me and probably to you because brother branam mentioned him in 16 different sermons that he preached one scripture about this man shamgar but brother brandom mentioned him 16 different in 16 different sermons and many many different times brother Bram says this about shamgar he says shamgar looked at him and thought Oh here he goes again he stood there and he thought well look down at his poor little wife her little sunken face and maybe his children remember I I said how these Canaanites would do they would take the all the food and stuff from the Israelites their little sleeves are ragged their clothes were gone his poor wife was starved to death what will the winner be this time there it is now all the year after year they've come and they they are here coming again and I'm just we just are about to Star we just about starved last year now they'll take what I got now what will I do just what gleanings I can get from the field he stood there he thought here here they come closer and closer Trump Trump trump these Philistines after a while There Was You don't believe in getting angry then let the righteous IND indignation arise he began to feel it coming upon him he said here I am a Jew I'm circumcised I've got a right for this land belongs to us and I tell you he wasn't a warrior he couldn't wait till he learned how to fight he was a farmer he wasn't a fighter but he knew that he had the promise of God was with him and he was circumcised And if every man here tonight would realize that the things you got Divine health and everything else God gave it to you at Calvary every born again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a right for every Redemptive blessing let the devil rob you out of none of it shamgar didn't have no sword he didn't know nothing about it if he had one he didn't have a shield but if he had a shield he wouldn't know how to use it but he reached up and got an ox go that's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it and they beat the ox to the Corral with it he jumped out of that window out of the middle of the road against 600 armed Philistines and killed every one of them hallelujah what was it the Holy Spirit Come on him Hallelujah and then there was a need there was an emergency something had to be done and he couldn't wait till he got an education learn how to fight and be a warrior and trained up he had to take what was in his hand and go and do something with it and that was shamgar that judge the next one I have time for one more the next one was it's always been odd to me growing up was a woman the Bible says that she was a prophetess her name was Deborah now Deborah obviously had a gift she was born both a propheus and and she was made a judge which is she had she had leadership qualities in her and after the death of ahud again the Israelites did did evil in the sight of the Lord so God handed them over to jabin the king of Canaan with his Commander this man named cicer and an army of Chariots and they oppressed Israel for 20 years and and then Israel finally cried to the Lord for help so Deborah the prophet is she's she is encouraging the people she needs help is what she needs so she goes to this Warrior named baric and she asks him she says baric I want you to go up she she gives a prophecy and she says I want you to go up and fight this man CIS baric didn't maybe have the confidence that he should have had so he asks Deborah he says I won't go up unless you go with me now remember the separation of the Sexes here A man is called to be a man and a woman's called to be a woman Deborah even later on she says I was a mother in Israel when she sings this this Victory song well baric says I'm not going to go unless you go with me she says okay and then she prophesies remember she has the gift of of Prophecy upon her she says if I go then God is not going to give you this Victory he's going to give it to a woman wow so then they go so as I was reading this I was like oh it's going to be her she's going to win it so they go and they go to battle and baric beats this General cic and all of his chariots and everything else but ciser escapes and he goes around and he's in hiding so cisar comes to this woman named does anybody know the story what's her name jail right cisterra comes to this woman named jail and he says I'm really thirsty and you I'm running and I need some help and Jail's like sure I can help you here's some warm nice warm milk maybe it'll put you to sleep so CIS takes he takes the milk and oh thank you so much and he says here Hide me so he takes the milk and he drinks and he's so tired and he goes into the tent and he hides under the blanket and jail the little lady remember the prophecy of Deborah the little lady she goes remember he's in a tent you know what you hold down tents with you know the the the ropes that come down and there's a steak in the ground right you got it Kenneth and and you tighten that up and anyways she picked one of those Stakes as a sharp point on the end and she took the hammer he's sleeping after he took drank that nice warm milk that jail gave him she's laying down she takes the tent steak can I say it brother Jordan take takes the tent Stak gently lays it on the side of his head and he's asleep pow drove the stake right through the guy into the ground and killed him the prophecy of Deborah right there came to pass in that he gave God gave the cing God gave this General into the hands of a woman and then so Deborah she was that she was that judge but baric was the one that he took 10,000 soldiers and he's just slaughtered cis's Army and then after that there was peace another 40 years and uh if the musicians could come and we'll close and we'll pick this up at a later date we'll get to Gideon and we'll get to these other ones that also did these great things for the Lord that God chose these people p pulled them out of this sinful nation and really they delivered Israel these judges so in review we know that brother ly he preached on Joshua we know that God blessed all of Israel when they came over they drove out the inhabitants they they then Joshua died and then they stopped driving out all of them they were influenced by these worldly people they took on their worldly ways they took on their sinful ways God pulled his hand from them they fell into bondage they fell into sin they they they were oppressed then God would raise up a judge deliver them and then the cycle would repeat over and over again and that's the Book of Judges as I said it's it's um kind of a depressing book when you read it because it's just failure after failure it's great victories by these judges but then it's um it's really tough that we see that Israel had fallen so many times let's let's stand and friends when I'm talking about this I really do I mean it that these book these things aren't recorded in this Bible if we're not to apply them to our own lives and I feel that we shouldn't make the same mistakes that were made we don't have the excuses necessarily that they have because we can read about their mistakes God bless you brother [Music] Aon oh life is EAS when you're up on a mountain and you've got peace of like you've never know but things when you're down in the [Applause] valley don't use Fai child you're never alone for the God on the mountain is still God in the Val when things go [Music] wrong

forward and they held up your word and here we are way down throughout the years in the year 2024 and there's still that same element of sin Among Us amen but yet there's some of us still father where

understand wonderful stories very very interesting stories please go back and read it for yourselves tremendous book and as I said interesting and and how God would use these different these different Warriors and heroes to save the people even though they forsook him every time and I'd like to say how many times have I forsaken the Lord and yet that longsuffering of God he's always welcomed me back with open arms just as he did these children of Israel I appreciate his patience with with all of these people in the book and especially with all of us so friends as we go forward and we think about this Book of Judges just remember that it's human nature to fall right back into the sin that we've come out of let's not do it let's put Christ first let's do what the prophet said continue to move on with our lives and get closer to our lord Jesus again please pray and and prepare for communion service this Sunday it's a very very important thing we never want to come and stand at this altar unworthily we want to make sure that we've done everything that we can to be right with the Lord right with each other and then we place the rest in the Loving Hands of our Lord Jesus who is longsuffering can and delivers us from our sins God bless you all brothers and sisters you're dismissed so let me walk with you Jesus don't ever leave me alone for without you I could never no never

And I'm I'm glad that I didn't know he was going to, but I'm glad that Josiah sang that song because I want to talk about uh having courage in in our life. First, Bruce, good to see you, man. I I met this guy outside. He rode up on his bike and and um saw he was in a suit. I said said, \"Brother, you look sharp.\" And he says, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Um, coming to church.\" He says, \"Uh, I want to see what this new pastor's all about.\" [Laughter] I said, \"Well, you're talking to him.\" He's like, \"Oh, okay. It's good to have you, bro. Good to have you in in church.\" Brother David Savalo, where are you and family in the back? Welcome, pastor from San Diego. God bless you. Welcome. It's good to have you. See your wife and your son there. Sister, brother, welcome. God bless you. It's good to good to have you in church with us. Uh uh Seven Peterson, where are you? You brought a friend Micah.

And then if I missed you and you're a visitor, welcome. We we appreciate having you. Uh, I got a video this morning from from Sister Lonnie and uh, no wonder you didn't stand up. You're tired. Klehano was out there with his new leg running uh, running miles this morning. Is the first time? &gt;&gt; Good job, man. Praise God, brother. It's It's The Lord has blessed you. He's blessed your family, Brother Lion. You and your family. Good to have you back. I just thank the world of you all. And there's Kanani. Wow. Welcome. God bless you. Good to see you. Oh, man. It's like got all of our people here. It feels It feels really really good. Let's let's open our Bibles. And I sent out a text last night that we're going to stay in. Obviously, we're going to stay in this sermon on the mount. And let's start with where we left off with last Sunday. Matthew chapter 5 verse 10. And I want to say a few more words about these scriptures. I talked a little bit about it last week and then we'll move on. Matthew chapter 5 verse 10 it reads like like this. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil false against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your re reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Amen. Now friends, Josiah singing that song and us singing it and I believe the Lord was pleased with it. There's a time in our lives for us to make a stand for what's right. You know, a Christian doesn't have to be beaten down all the time. And a Christian doesn't have to to just roll over all the time and just not go to the controversial issues. You know, sometimes Christians do go to the controversial issues. And I know it makes us uncomfortable sometime. I know that sometime you You might be thinking in your chair, \"Oh, why is a pastor talking about that? It makes me nervous. You know, what's everybody else thinking?\" But there's a time to make a stand. There's a time to stand up for what you know is right. &gt;&gt; There are people throughout history who have stood for what is right &gt;&gt; and they have suffered for it. And if we truly make a stand, then we can expect that we are going to suffer for what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus says right here, he says, \"You are blessed when you suffer persecution for for they persecuted the prophets that were before you. You're not the only one that is ever that has suffered for doing what's right.\" Way back, right at the very beginning of the Bible, Abel, Adam's son, he was hated by his brother Cain. He was hated because he sacrificed to God in a different way that Cain sacrificed. And God honored Abel sacrifice more than he did Cain. And Cain that jealousy rose up in him if he would have just been humble and said, \"You know what? Abel's right. I'm going to change.\" But instead, he he would not humble himself and he murdered his brother because of jealousy. Abel died because he desired to serve God and he did what was right. The prophet Isaiah Isaiah was hated by his own people because Isaiah said that I saw God on the throne. Made him jealous. They said, \"You can't see God. The word teaches us that no man can see God.\" Isaiah said, \"But I saw him on the throne.\" You know what they did to him? They sought him in half. Killed him for it. The prophet Daniel, he was so hated by the people of Babylon that they tricked the king into sentencing him to death. Why? Because he stood for what he believed. Because he prayed. He prayed three times a day. And they were jealous of him. They hated him. He lived a good life. He was successful. He did everything that Daniel did. He did well and people hated him for it and they tricked the king to sentencing him to death to be eaten by lions. Now the Lord delivered him from it. Mori and the Jews. He was hated in the time of King Ahazerus hated so much that they that the people of the kingdom, they developed this this scheme because the Jews were so hated because they set God first above everything else. And the the hatred of them spread and spread till they tricked the king into to sentencing all of them to death by hanging. But there was a lady that made a stand for what was right. She risked her life. She was fine. She wouldn't have been killed. But she risked her life for what was right. This Queen Esther and made a stand and she saved her people. Zachchariah the prophet. Again, another one. He made a stand and he was stoned by those that didn't agree with his way of worship. They hated Zachchariah because he didn't agree with them. He stood up against them. John the Baptist, same thing. He stood against the sins of the king. He made a stand saying that this immorality is wrong. And he was hated. Hated for it. So much so that he was sentenced to death. The king was tricked into it, but he was sentenced to death and had his head cut off. The Apostle Paul, same thing. Stephen, Stephen, the the uh the deacon and the apostle, he was killed because he was vocal in what he believed and hated it. It brings it right back to the words Jesus said. You're going to be hated for this. But there are people that are willing to make a stand. And thank God for those people. Jesus Christ himself died on the cross with the mobs hating him and making fun of him when he was up there nailed to the to the the wooden cross and people making fun of him saying, \"Why don't you come down from there? Friends, we see that same spirit today. See it very, very plainly. I want to read I want you to I'm going to read the New Living Translation of this and I just want you to just it's it's a the New Living Translation is more of a story and I want you to listen to this and think about if this is going on today. John chapter 18 says this. Now just listen. Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders along with the people and he announced his verdict. You brought this man to me accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and I find him innocent. Pilate speaking of Jesus. I find him innocent. Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us. Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty. So I will have him flogged and then I will release him. Listen to this. Then a mighty roar arose from the crowd. And with one voice they shouted, \"Kill him and release Barabus to us.\" Barabus was in prison for taking part in an insurrection in Jerusalem against the government and for murder. Pilate argued with him because he wanted to release Jesus, but they kept shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" For the third time, he demanded, \"Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So, I will have him flogged, and then I will release him.\" But the mobs shouted louder and louder demanding that Jesus be crucified and their voices prevailed. So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded as they had requested. He released Barabus, the man in prison for insurrection and murder. But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished. I believe a large portion of our c of our country right now would celebrate the blood of Jesus Christ and cry out for releasing a criminal in hisstead. I saw a few of these things s circulating recently and I want to read some of them. Some of you who went up to Charlie Kirk's funeral. with quite a few people did. I want to say a few more words. I said a few words last week. I want to say a few words more words this week. And let me let me ask you as I'm reading these things, think about what they would do to Jesus if he was on trial and what they would do to bring a criminal out instead of him. &gt;&gt; Saw this man. He was hysterically laughing on uh one of the platforms, hysterically laughing at at Charlie Kirk's assassination, making fun of his death. And at the end of the video, he said, \"But seriously, Charlie, but seriously, Charlie Kirk, shots and prayers. Thoughts and prayers.\" You know, everybody says thoughts and prayers. He was making fun of a bullet killing this man and he says but seriously shots and prayers to you making fun another one and when I say and these people cannot talk without cussing so obviously I'm not going to read the bad words so I will say expletative when when it was so hard to find something that you could understand without the cussing. Another person says this, \"Charlie Kirk just got put down like an expletative dog in Utah. I could not be happier. I will never, never, never feel bad when bad people get what they exploive deserve.\" Who would they have chosen on that day? man playing a guitar across the across the street from a Charlie Kirk vigil was singing this. I don't want your salvation. I want you to expletive die. This is this is today friends. This is last week. This isn't 2000 years ago. Elon M congresswoman from Minnesota says this. Charlie Kirk was do Dr. Frankenstein and his monster shot him through the neck. Then she said, \"Any legacy he has left behind should be in the dust bin of history and we should move on and forget the hate that he spewed every single day.\" Imagine what they would have said about Jesus when they said, \"Don't you remember him turning over the tables in the temple?\" Imagine what they would have said to that. Do you not do we not see the same spirit that's here today? Political analyst for MSNBC, this guy Matthew Dodd says this. And to think that this and to and I think that that I think that is the environment we are in. You can't stop with these sorts of awful things you have and then say these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place. saying the so-called awful words of Charlie Kirk justified his murder. Then he said hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which then lead to hateful actions. Justifying the media on the day of Jesus just they they justified killing killing Jesus because saying that he was starting an insurrection. justified it. They just they then they they had rumors of that day. The media of that day said, \"Oh, yeah, and by the way, Jesus came from an affair that his mother had with a Roman soldier. She wasn't a virgin. She had an affair with some gentile man.\" That is what the media was saying back then. And that is what was producing this hatred and fueling this hatred at that time. This judge, Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Ted Barry was mocking Charlie Kirk and he said when he said, you know, when we say rest in peace, he says, Charlie Kirk, rest in hatred and division. This is a judge in Cincinnati, a leader. Yeah. Rest in hatred, Charlie. I got so many more here. One more. Drew Harrison. Let's Let's skip that one. Let's go to Yeah, this one person says, \"Thoughts and prayers, you Nazi expletive. I hope the bullet's okay after touching Charlie Kirk.\" Boy, I know it makes you feel uncomfortable. Sorry. It's time to be uncomfortable. It's part of it. This is the world we live in. This is the hatred that is around us. Drew Harrison, a video game designer, was fired after sharing a social media post that he said, \"I hope the shooter's name is Mario.\" This is one of the ones that work on uh the what are they called? The Mario Brothers. I hope the shooter's name is Mario. So that Luigi knows his bro got his back. He's referencing the Mario Brothers video game while associating ch Charlie Kirk's killer with Luigi Manjonei who's a kills of who's accused of killing Brian Thompson the CEO of United Healthcare shooting him in the back you know go you know and glorifying murder and these same people and I have I have more quotes from ministers on here and and making fun of this Charlie Kirk murder. And these are the same people. These are the same people that are deifying someone like George Floyd, who of course he shouldn't have died, but deifying this man, lifting him up, setting him up as an example, and making fun of this man, Charlie Kirk. What is wrong with our society? It's the same spirit that was there when Jesus Christ was crucified. You know what the big big difference between George Floyd and Charlie Kirk was? Now, I know Floyd was a career criminal. He was a drug addict. He was being arrested for breaking the law when all this happened aside from the obvious. And he and I and and he shouldn't have been killed. And it was a tragic situation. But what is do you know what the big difference between the two is? The big difference is no one separ celebrated the death of George Floyd. and they shouldn't have. It was tragic. Yes, he was a criminal and and he was rightfully being arrested, but it was a tragic outcome. No, but no one celebrated him dying. But why are they celebrating this man of God, Charlie Kirk? Why are they making fun of him? Why are they celebrating his death? For the same reason that they they celebrated Jesus Christ being nailed to the cross. It's the same spirit that we are living in today. As I said, I know it's uncomfortable, but given the choice, you can look at society today and given the choice between Jesus and Barabus, who would they have chosen? Many. Who would many people choose today? Jesus or Barabus? It's the time we're living in. I want you to listen. Look at the context in the Bible. Let's go to second Timothy chapter 3 verse one. This know also. 2 Timothy 3:1. This know also that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers from God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away. Now you want to bring this right down home. Let me read another translation. Let me read the New Living Translation of that. Now just sit back and just listen. See if you can't look around and see this. You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. They will be unloving and unforgiving. They will slander and others. They will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. They will act religious but they will reject the power that could make that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that. Wow. Let me tell you friends, the word of God is beautiful and the word of God is just as true today as it ever has been. But it is uncomfortable. these things that are being said that I'm reading right here. These aren't ne these aren't my words. I'm reading what everybody else says about this. And these things, it's like, whoa. Wow. I can see how they would hate Jesus. I could see how the crowds would get riled up and say, \"Send us out Barabbus.\" I can see how those things would happen. And I believe they would happen today. Let's read Matthew 5:10 again before we go on to the next. Let me tell you, Isaiah said when the enemy comes in like a flood that the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him. &gt;&gt; That's the good part. And we get to be part of that. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5 verse 10. Again, let's read it again. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Now, what is the standard that God is going to rise up against this? As I said in Isaiah, whenever the enemy comes up, hey, God's going to rise up an army against him. Don't worry. And today, that army is not with flesh and blood. It's not it's not a some sort of insurrection or anything like that. Now, that army is through holy living and a good life before God and living right and loving each other. That is it. that will conquer. That is what will will conquer and that I promise you. Now listen to what Jesus says and he's looking out across the audience here and he says in verse 13 he says you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted? It is hence then it is then forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot. So really salt is such an important part of life and especially back when Jesus was here. First salt's essential to life. It's part of life. You have to have salt in your system for everything to work right. And then also salt was used as a preservative back then. Whether it be fish or whether it be meat or or what whatever it was. They could preserve their food and make it last longer. But I think what Jesus is talking about here in this case, Jesus is referring to the flavor of salt in our food. We put salt in our food to make it taste good. But notice how seasoning, the seasoning of salt works. When you put the right amount of salt in your food, it tastes good. Stephanie makes potatoes and it's like some people like salty or some people like less salty. She just started looking around like, \"Oh great, what's he gonna say?\" Sorry, sweetheart. I can pick on you because you're stuck with me. They're not. You are. You kind of are. Um, but when you salt the potatoes, it's like if you just make mashed potatoes with no salt, have you ever had them? They're terrible. It's like, oh man, this is gross. This is This doesn't taste like anything. But then if you put too much salt in it, then all you taste is the salt. But if you put the right amount of salt in your potatoes, it tastes like potatoes and they're really good. It's not you're not tasting the salt, you're tasting the food. And that's what that's what salt does. He's saying that you are the salt of the earth. So what you're doing, what we are doing is we are taking God's word and we are the salt that makes it taste good. It's not the nutrients. We're not the nutrients. We're not the meat. Jesus is saying, \"You are the salt.\" And make it taste good. When someone looks at us, they should be like, \"Oh, I love the word. I love the way that tastes. I love the way that feels. It It feels really, really good. But if you lose, friends, if we lose that saltiness, if we lose that love, if we lose that passion for the word, then we've lost our love and we're not doing any good. The salt, it's either doesn't taste right or we ruin it or whatever. like like Josiah leading songs, Daniel leading leading songs. The worship leaders, they need to be into the worship. They need to let they need to season the worship with their salt to make it good. It's not about them. If you put too much salt in there, then it becomes about the worship leader and it's not good. It's like, how'd you like the worship service? I was a little too salty. It was a little too much about the guy and not so much about the Lord. The same thing with the preacher. He's up there and it's you might leave after the sermon and you say, \"How how was the sermon?\" It's like, \"Well, you know, it was kind of bland. You know, he wasn't really into it. I could tell he didn't really believe it or it was, man, too salty. That guy was all about himself. He was just talking about himself in there.\" And it wasn't about the food that we're trying to get across. The salt just enhances the flavor. The salt is not the flavor. And that's how we should be with with a pastor of a church. You should say, \"Well, you know, he he loves the people. He he he he's cares about me. He cares about my family. He cares about what's going on.\" But if you have somebody up there that doesn't that doesn't care, there's no saltiness there. But then if you have a pastor and you can get used to it that's constantly dumping the salt in. It's all about him and you don't even taste the food. You don't taste the word. We, me, you, all of us, we sprinkle that seasoning in there for it to taste good. And that is what Jesus is saying here. He's he's saying when you're a witness to your friend, do you care about their well-being? Do you care about their life? Do you care about their the things that are going on outside of church, outside of religion? When you want when you care for somebody, when you're trying to get them to come to the Lord, are you caring about their life? Are you caring about their job? Are you caring about the problems that they're having? Are you putting some of that salt in there of the word, salt of the Holy Spirit? You put it in there and oh, it makes it feel good because you feel that love. Otherwise, you give them a track and say, \"Oh, yeah. Read this scripture and that scripture and and go ahead. There's no salt. There's no flavoring. You need to put you need to put that in there.\" But if you put too much salt, then the people kind of get used to it and then they're all about the salt and not about the food. Need to be careful. you take I can take I stole the salt from the kitchen. I'll bring it back. Um but I can I can say, \"Brother Joe, have some have some salt, man. Here, put it in the teaspoon.\" Yeah. You want some? No, that's gross. I don't want that. Here's a teaspoon of salt. Joe, have it. No, I don't want that. But I'll take those. Yeah, but you take you take the same amount of salt and you just eat the salt plain. It's it's not good. There's no nutrients there. There's not much in here either. But you you you know what I'm saying? Go back to Stephanie's potatoes. They're much better with salt in the seasoning. And that's what we are. We bring the savor of the word. And that's what Jesus is saying. You bring the save of the savor of the word to other people through your life, through your love. And he's saying that you are the seasoning. You are what makes it taste good. Don't lose your flavor. The whole meal is depending on it. You are the salt of the earth. Jesus doesn't say he is. He says that you are such a beautiful it's a beautiful concept that the this what Jesus said that this is what it's not the flavor it's not the food. It's not the nutrients but we make it taste good. We represent it well. And that's all of us in our church friends. When people come in, when people visit, when you are visiting other people, not to get them into church, but to salt the Holy Spirit a little bit, to salt the word of God and make it to where, oh, I love that. I love it. It's just so good when we have a Bible study or whatever it might be. Oh, it just feels so good to read the B. I love it when this sister or this brother, I love it when they read the Bible because you can see it really comes out through them. It's because they love it. is because they are seasoning that word with love and they're not changing the word. It's the word that's beautiful. It's the word that has the nutrients. It's the word that's everything. They're just putting a little salt on it and making it making it palatable. Making it taste good. Psalm 34, we sing it often. Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is he who hides in him. Taste and see. Taste this. Come and taste it. It's good. It's it's loving and it this is all part of we are part of this great this great plan of God. Verse number 14. You are the light of the world. A city is set on a hill cannot be hid. So Jesus goes from the salt. He says you are the salt of the world. Don't lose your savor. You know you are not the nutrients. I'm the nutrients. You're just making it taste good. And then he says, \"You are the light of the world.\" But Jesus also said, \"He's the light.\" But now he says, \"You are the light. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on on a hill cannot be hid.\" The love of God shining from you, friends. Then nothing can hide it. You turn on a light in a dark room, that light is going to spread. That light is going to be what you see. The world should be looking at us, should be pointing up at that city on the hill. But if you notice a city on a hill, it's not one light. That's the best part about a city. When you're when you're driving into a to a city in the dark or or when you're hiking and you look at and you see the city down in the valley, you see that it's not one light. You see the whole city, but as you look close, it's a It's a million different lights and they all create one big beautiful light and it's different colors and different shapes and different sizes and it makes this beautiful light up on a hill and Jesus is saying that cannot be hid. Look at that. The world should be looking at you this city on the hill and each one of us has a light to shine forth. If you had just one light it wouldn't do much. You wouldn't even hardly see it. But man, you put a whole bunch of lights together, it is so beautiful. And he's saying here, he's saying, you're the light of the world and you're a city that's set on a hill and it cannot be hid. I want to read the lyrics to a song that um when I read this scripture, it uh it it really struck me. It brought my mind back to this song by casting crowns. And uh I don't think we've ever it's not really a congregational song, but it says this name of it is city on the hill. Listen to this. Do you hear of a city on the hill? said one man, said one old man to the other. It once shined bright and it would be shining still, but they all started turning on each other. You see, the poets thought the dancers were shallow, and the soldiers thought the poets were weak, and the elders saw the young ones as foolish, and the rich men never heard the poor man speak. But one by one they ran away with their with their madeup minds to leave it all behind. And the light began to fade in the city on the hill. Each one thought that they knew better. But they were different by design. Instead of standing strong together, they let their differences divide. And one by one they ran away with their madeup minds to leave it all behind. And the light began to fade in this city on the hill. And the world is searching still. But it was the rhythm of the dancers that gave the poets life. It was the spirit of the poets that gave the soldiers strength to fight. That song that Josiah that sang at the beginning, the battle hymn of the republic, it gave those soldiers strength. It gave them courage to go and fight the battle. But it wasn't the one that wrote the song that was fighting the battle. It was the rhythm of the dancers that gave the poets life. It was the spirit of the poets that gave the soldiers strength to fight. It was the fire of the young ones. It was the wisdom of the old. It was the story of the poor man that needed to be told. But one by one will will we run away with our madeup minds to leave it all behind as the light begins to fade in the city on the hill. And that's that city, friends. That's that city Jesus wanted to have. It's a city where there's all different colors, different shapes, different sizes, different brightnesses, different a different people. The the enemy wants us all to be the same. He wants us all to look the same, to act the same. He wants us all to stand at attention whenever the the politics say to do this or do that. But God wants diversity. God wants different people. He wants people that will stand up in their own way for what they believe like Stephen did. Stephen had a different calling than Abel had. Moses had a different calling than Abraham had. Esther had a different calling than the Apostle Paul. But they are all lights up on the hill shining. And each one of us has a different calling. But we are all lights up on the hill. And Jesus says, \"Let those lights shine.\" Let's continue on. Listen to this verse. Where we at? Verse 15. And we'll close with this. The worship team can can come. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father, which is in heaven. How beautiful is that? Let your light shine. Neither does a ma man light a candle and put it on a under a bushel, but he puts it on a candlestick so it can light up the whole house. And what's it lit lit up for? It's lit up for everybody else that everyone may see these good works and glorify not you, not me, but glorify your father which is in heaven. Let the salt, don't let the salt overwhelm the potatoes, but salt it just enough so you can taste that. So you can taste and see, so you can feel that presence of God because everyone is just bringing their own light into the into this building or bringing on their own light out into the world. This light of love and they are standing up. They are not weak Christians. They are strong Christians that know when to stand up and say, \"No, I will not bow to that. I won't do it. I will still treat you in love. I will still love everyone. I will still keep my testimony. I won't lose my temper. I won't do I won't I won't spread a rumor. I won't fight with my mouth. But I will fight with my life. I will live this life as a Christian. And I will be that light. And now you can look to me because I am sweetening up the word. I'm making it to where here I am that light. Jesus says, \"You are the light. I want to be that light. I want to be that light that lights up the room. I want to be one of those lights in that city of God that people can look to and see and and and want and just just admire it because it's God. You may look at God. God's the big He's the whole city. And he's proud. He's like, \"These are all my little lights. These are all my little people.\" And each one of them has a little light. And not any light is more important than the other. We need all of those lights to light up this mountain. Now, if we are the light of the world, we let that light shine before the world. Let me read that 2 Timothy 3:1 again. This is the light that this is where we live, friends. Second Timothy 3:1 says this, \"Know also, know this also that in the last days, perilous time shall come.\" We're there. I think we've proven we are there. In the last days, perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, and despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof from such turn away. But God has raised up a standard against that. Bible says we don't fight anymore with flesh and blood, but God has raised up a standard. He's put lights up on the hill. He has he has taken salt and put it into the the soup, put it into the potatoes to make it taste good. He has made us friends. He told us you are the salt of the world. We are the ones that make this Bible make it taste good. Because you know why the whole thing is because this Bible is living in me. This Bible is living in you. It's become alive in us. And it's not just a book anymore. It's a living breathing document that is bringing itself that is showing itself in my life and in your life. That's what Jesus is saying here in the opening parts of this sermon on the mount. I mean he said he prophesied he says basically they're going to kill me they're going to hate me and they're going to hate you. They're going to kill you but you'll be blessed for it. Because why? Because you're the salt of the earth. You are a city on the hill. You are a light, the light of the world. That's who you are, my son, my daughter. That's who you are. Now you go out and light up this world. Put the salt in the soup. You go out and light that candle. Take your place in that city on the hill. That is what it is. We'll move on. We'll continue on on this this sermon on the mount. Friends, it gets better. Oh, man. It's so beautiful. It's good. [Applause] I just I just want to put a little salt on it because it's the best food you could ever eat. Oh man, it is so good. Just open it up and you read it and then talk with each other and then you be that you be that light. You be that salt of the earth. Amen. You feel good? Let me tell you friends, you are the salt of the earth. You're a blessing. You're a blessing to me. I can see what what you all do for other people. I can see the love that you have. I know that Jesus, I believe he always wanted a church that would be identified, not because of how the pastor preaches the word, not because of the way that the congregation dresses, not because of the building, not because any of that. I think Jesus really wanted a congregation that could be identified by their love that they have one for another. And I think we have a good start. I just I'm so I feel good to be part of this. What's going on here? Do we have I know that we all want to be that salt. Do we want to sprinkle a little a little bit more? Is anyone Does anyone want to be baptized this morning? Eva, God bless you, sweet. This little this little girl, she is such a blessing to me. She writes me these little she She's a wonderfully talented artist and she draws little pictures of what I'm speaking of and then she'll give them to me after service and I can tell if I got a little bit too salty or I didn't have enough salt because one time she's she gave me a picture and you know a lot of times it's it's just you know the the the donkey that carried Mary or it's something like that that I'm preaching on. The other day she gave me one that said, um, I forgot the guy's name, but it was something the Mexican potato. I was like, well, I tried. I might have missed the mark on that one, but she's just a blessing. Sister Ava, God bless you. Appreciate your testimony. Anyone else that wants to be baptized, if you want to be baptized, go back and uh and see the um ushers back there and they will bring you up to the baptismal. Friends, it is not always the Christian's role to be quiet. It is not always the Christian's role to just give whatever anybody wants. There is a time and a place for that. But there is also a time and a place to stand up and preach the word and stand for what the word says. There is that time and I believe we are seeing today that evilness that was in the world. And it's the same evilness that crucified Jesus and laughed at him on the cross. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] Let's put verse one up there. Brother Jeremy, &gt;&gt; I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant's throne. They were told that he would spare their lives if they would reounce the name of Christ. But one by one they chose to die. The son of God they would not deny like a great angelic choir sings. I can almost hear their voicees ring. I pledge alance to the land. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alence to the lamb. Now the years. Now the years have come and the years have gone and the cause of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost, to reject this world, to embrace the cross. And one by one, let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life. Till the trumpet sounds on that final day. Let us humbly stand. Oh, and boldly say, I pledge alance to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce to the to the lamb of God to the lamb of God who bore my pain, who took my place, who bore my shame. I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alence to the lamb. Let's sing it with just our voices. I pledge alce to the lamb with all my strength. With all I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce to the lamb. I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce to the lamb. Sing again. I will seek to honor. I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce to the lamb. Amen. [Applause] Key of D. My chains are gone. My chains are gone. I've been set free. [Music] My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood, his mercy reigns [Music] unending love. Amazing grace. Sing that first verse. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my s Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. Unending love. Amazing grace. Praise the Lord. young lady who I believe is a good example of a Christian to her friends and to all of us that are around.

She also helps out in the back and um she's just a she's a special special young lady. She's come here to be baptized.

You just you just let your light shine. Amen. Ava, you sure about this? I believe I believe you're ready. She talked with um talked with the family the other night. She has a wonderful testimony.

Thank you that I am placed in this body of believers and that I can be part with them and that I can make help make your word just taste good to the world. Doesn't it feel good friends? We are that Jesus said, not me saying Jesus said that we are the salt of the earth. Wow. And he says we're the light. And he says, \"Don't hide that light. Let it shine. Let it shine forth to all men.\" Amen. Remember, no service tonight. I'm going to ask my friend, Brother Lionel, to close in prayer. Greetings to y'all and God bless. Did y'all hear anything good this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know, I I've been away for a while, me and uh me and my wife when we were out working the fires and stuff, and it's just a blessing to be able to come back this morning, get to see y'all, and to be able to be able to hear these words that we heard this morning. And uh I think that uh there's many places in the world where people are gathered this Sunday, but to look at you all and to realize that we are the ones right here this morning that God gave to each other. &gt;&gt; This is our family. &gt;&gt; We're part of a kingdom, &gt;&gt; an eternal kingdom that's made up of people everywhere. But this here is our family here. &gt;&gt; You're mine and I'm yours. It's just a blessing to be able to be here this morning and to know each one of you. Um, I just want to say a few words. Uh, in this world that we live in, we deal with a bunch of evil and we hear a bunch of things in the news and certain things that happen. You know, the whole thing with Charlie Kirk and everything and we hear all this negative stuff. But as the pastor Dan mentioned this morning, he seen a video. And on that video, it was a boy right here in the city of Tucson who was missing a leg. He had a prosthetic leg fitted to him. And this morning, he went down into downtown Tucson to run a race with the other people. the other people of Tucson that gathered for the race. Now, in that video that I seen, it renewed my faith in humanity in this day of evil because as he was running the race and he was hobbling and he was hopping and he was trying to make it to the finish line, There were some people who were the salt of the earth this morning. [Music] There were some people who let their light shine for just a moment in the darkness. Those people were the good people of this city, Tucson, Arizona. who ran behind the boy and didn't surpass him so they could win the race. They ran behind him to cheer him on, to get him to the finish line. That was a beautiful thing. And I thought, well, there's a message in that. There's a message in that for us because we are the salt of the earth for each other. each one of us the light God placed in us his light for each other. And as a brother was talking, I was thinking about that. And let me ask you a question. If the chariots of fire landed in front of this church this morning and they said, \"Here we are. Chariots here to pick us up to take us to the other side.\" I wouldn't trample over brother Manny to get to that chariot or brother Heath or brother Daniel. I'd grab you guys and say, \"Let's go, man. The chariots are out there waiting for us, man. They're here.\" As we went out this church, some might fall with a broken ankle or back or something. There wouldn't be one person left in this church. Wouldn't we gather each other and say, \"Let's go. &gt;&gt; We're here. Let's make it to the end.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's gather each other and go. That's the salt of the earth. That's the light. It's in us. Let's take it take it with us this week. Let's take it with us and let it let's do as they did in downtown Tucson. Let's season the path for somebody else through God's word. Let's let God's light shine through us for somebody. Let's let it happen through him, through his word, through his blood, through his mercy. Amen. Let's take it before him this morning in prayer. [Music] Father, as we come before you this morning, I ask you to bless this group of people here, Father, and those that are watching on through the video. Father, I ask you that your salt, the seasoning of your word, and your grace and mercy follow with us through this week, and that you be the light that shines through us, Father. For we know that you come down in earthly flesh and you didn't die for yourself. You died for us because you wanted us to be on that side with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could have took the kingdom for yourself, but you seemed that you wanted us to be there with you. There was no kingdom going to be a kingdom without us, Father. And we thank you for that. We thank you, Father. Father, we ask you that your spirit goes with us. &gt;&gt; I ask you to bless everybody that's here today, Father. Let them be strong this week. Let them have the hearts of lions this week. &gt;&gt; Let them rise up, Father. Let them say, \"We're not going to make it to the finish line by ourselves. We're going to bring our neighbors with us, our friends, our families, the city of Tucson. We're going to bring them with us to the finish line. Father, for there's a crossing of the old river Jordan. somewhere, Father. But there's a promised land somewhere, Father. And when we get there, we don't want to get there by ourselves. &gt;&gt; We want to bring everybody with us, Father. &gt;&gt; Let it be so. Let us gather. Father, let us take each other and carry each other to the finish line. &gt;&gt; Let it be the salt. Father, when we salt something to season it, it isn't just for ourselves. It's for our friends, for our neighbors, for our family. Father, when we light the path, it isn't for ourselves. It's so that somebody else don't stumble. Let your light be in us, Father. Your season be in us, Father. Let us forgive and let us love. Let us go on. Let us be strong this morning. Let us look at each other and say, \"Here's the ones that were given to to me to us. Let us be there for each other. Father, we ask it in your precious name. In the name full of mercy and grace this morning, in the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God.\" &gt;&gt; Amen means so be it. Thank you, Father. [Applause] I'm gonna I'm gonna quote a great I'm going to quote a great man. He said, \"Let's make heaven crowded.\" So, let's make heaven crowded this week. Amen. Brother Josiah, one more. Just before we go, let's sing Winds of Faith. There are two roads you can take. Take this with you this week. There are two roads you may take, [Music] one by side and one by faith. Take the word of God or what you see, what you believe [Music] is what will be.

the coming of the Lord and he had talked about what had happened in the Garden of Eden and the separation and he said could you imagine Adam and Eve the very next day after they were cast out waiting in the cool of the evening for him to come by and he didn't come by that day and it really got me to thinking sometimes I say Lord just get me out of here I'm tired of this world I don't want the pain

other brother spoke and I said Lord let let my desire be to desire you and everything else will be taken care of but if we get that turned around we just want out to hear because we don't deal with this but it should be something where I was talking to brother Daniel about it and it's it's kind of like the young man and the young lady that were dating and he was telling her how much he would climb over the mountains to go see her and and and take cross the meanest River and they gave her all these thing that she said well come on over and he goes I can't it's raining you know and the Lord says come on come on up closer with me and we say Lord I've got this to do still and Lord I've got that to do but no I I just want to want to go home and be with him amen when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will [Music] be sing the wonderous love of Jesus Jesus sing his mercy and his gra in the Manion bright and blessing he'll prepare for us a place and when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory while we walk the paway clouds will over spread the but when traveling days are are over not a shadow not a SK and when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will when we all see Jes will sing and shout the victory let us then be true and faithful trting every day just one glimpse of him will the tongs of life prare and when we all get to heav what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus will sing and go onward to the prist before soon [Applause] will be home soon those Eary Gates will we shall Tre the streets of gold and when we all to have what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus we will sing the victory amen amen it's not going to it's not going to be how I overcame but it's just thanking him for being the Overcomer in US amen so didn't have any prayer requests but remember dad um it's been uh quite a struggle and I I know he's listening and he he knows but the doctors told my brother 6 months the longest but maybe two two or three months he's rapidly he just he has no energy no strength no not hungry and and so forth and a lot of pain but he told me yesterday he said I just want to go and I said it's okay you can go amen we'll take care of Mom everything will be all right amen but we'll have another one up there cross one his day to shake your hand say I made it but spent the night with him on Sunday and he was just just not feeling well and every 15 20 minutes calling out you know and I said you know I think we do that to our Heavenly Father quite often father but he'd not just sleep he' never Slumbers so I was I was just asking the Lord I said you know our days are numbered maybe it's it's his time just remind him and I would say to all of us of your goodness Lord of your grace of your blessings what you've done rather than the focus of what you're going through by saying Lord you've been good to me you've been my strength you've been my help and I have something to thank you for so it's it's a it's a hard time but time goes on we all go through it but there's something inside of us that knows that on the other side it will be worth it all amen so brother Daniel if you take the go too appreciate brother Aaron these our brother G's gone he's an old man and there'll be a day if the Lord carries that he will cross over to the other side and his brother Aaron was just talking this scripture came to mind it's 1 Thessalonians chap 4:1 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with with the Lord and then the next verse says wherefore Comfort one another with these words those are comforting words we have a great promise to look forward to brother Michael's good to see you my friend good friend Michael walters's here um believe a man that loves the Lord with all of his heart I do too my brother and I just I want I want to serve him I want to do what's right and the whole world can go away but Lord let me just be in your will for um this week okay uh for the Youth we'll have an upper room um Upper Room will be open on Friday night and I will post that on the website next weekend brother Jeremy sister Angela or um organizing volleyball at cortero Park and I will also post that on the website I'm sorry and behind it should have already been up there um and then this Sunday a Sunday night I want to have a special service with some of our elders in our church and I want to pass the microphone around like I do sometimes I want to give it to them and say tell us something that stands out in your life that was either a success and you would want to pass that wisdom on to someone else or a failure that you could say don't do this this is where I failed in my life don't do that I think we have tremendous wisdom in our church and it's in our elders not only should our elders be respected and I believe that we do respect respect them but they should also be listened to they should be revered with this great wisdom that they have I was telling somebody today that to get 20 years of experience brother Dan it takes 20 years you don't just come into this world with all the wisdom that you do have when you leave this world so I I want to take advantage of our elders that we have and I want to hear what they have to say so especially I want everybody to come on Sunday night and enjoy that service um one thing I don't know if they told anybody they told me the day before they were leaving but brother Tim Cruz and Brother David Fritz went to the Philippines and um I texted them and uh they haven't got back with me I don't know if they're back home or if they're um they're still there but let's keep those two brothers in time you travel overseas you always have to be careful let's all stand brothers and sisters we have an honor tonight the Bible teaches us our lord Jesus said he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in their midst so it's very important for us to whatever we do in word or deed to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus We Gather here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and we know that if we are gathered in his name and he is here then he knows the very secrets and thoughts of our hearts he can read right down the Bible says all the way way to the marrow of the bone so before we bow our heads does anyone have a request that you have on your heart that you would like to make known to the Lord with an uplifted hand that hand being lifted don't just do it because that's what we do sometimes there is a request below that hand so have that request on your heart as we bow our heads [Music] our heavenly father almighty [Music] God you are the one Lord that was here when you created the heavens and the Earth Lord you were the one that did M many mighty works all the way up into this time and Lord you are the one that's here with us tonight as you promised and Lord you saw the hands of that were raised I pray that you would look into that heart and see the request that was behind that hand see the request Lord that is upon every heart that's here tonight pray for our friends Brothers brother Tim and Brother David as they travel father I pray that your Mighty hand would be upon them keep them safe Lord and may they be a witness that God is alive Christ is risen from the dead that he is the same yesterday today and forever Lord we place these requests before you in the name of Jesus Christ we also invite your presence to be here with us tonight as our brother ministers father as he opens the word Lord would you teach us out of this word and let us be able to apply this word to our lives that we might be better Christians when we leave this building tonight Grant it Lord and let us tell you that we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the

that day amen I trust each of us is looking for that day and if you're not then I hope by the time you leave here tonight you'll be in anticipation amen of that day see if I can remember how to do do this okay Ah that's what I was looking for the Book of Proverbs it may come as no surprise to you but this is May 15th on May 14th 1948 exactly 76 years ago the Modern Nation of Israel came into being as a British mandate expired and the rule of Israel was turned over to the provisional government headed by David benion that's a picture of them announcing their Declaration of Independence only 11 minutes after that Declaration of Independence that evening in Tel Aviv President Harry EST Truman formally recognized the new state of Israel a Palestinian state was also declared by the United Nations effec of that same date but the Palestinian people and the surrounding Arab governments rejected that statehood Civil War had been raging in mandatory Palestine since November 29th of 1947 following the UN vote to partition Palestine into two states on the morning of May 15th 1948 76 years years ago today a pan Arab Army invaded comprised of the armies of Lebanon Syria Iraq trans Jordan and Egypt with contingents from Saudi Arabia and Yemen their stated purpose to drive the Jews into the sea the War lasted 10 months officially ending not with a treaty but with a series of armistice agreements signed from February 24th through July 20 of 1949 the area now called the West Bank was annexed by trans Jordan which then changed its name to Jordan the territory now called the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt there was no thought of an independent Palestinian state it was a grab for territory there was no push for a two-state solution there was only a cry for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of Arab of mlim rule over the entire area the invading armies encouraged the Arab residents of the territory that was to be Israel to flee they could return and enjoy The Spoils of Victory once the Jewish people were destroyed pushed into the sea thus the youngest Palestinian refugee today would be 76 years old any younger ones up to age 57 were born in territories controlled by Jordan and Egypt until 1967 for nearly 20 years this proposed two-state solution was thwarted by Israel's Arab neighbors it wasn't until Jordan lost the West Bank and Egypt lost the Sinai including the Gaza Strip in The Six Day War of June 1967 that the Arab Nations started calling for a Palestinian State as part of a two-state solution to the refugee problem that they had helped create after the 1967 war Israel inherited the so-called refugee camps the Arab Nations declared war and encouraged people to become refugees have never taken responsibility for their actions and seem to have the World At Large convinced it's all Israel's problem and certainly Israel's fault now more than ever we need to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem the Bible tells us they shall prosper that love thee well enough modern history that's not what you were expecting tonight our Bible study our overview is the book of Proverbs let's begin tonight's study of this book with prayer Lord Jesus we're gathered here together in your name amongst your people Lord our hearts are are burdened our hearts are heavy with what we see going on the suffering Lord the pain Lord the misunderstanding Lord the hatred Lord the the weaponization of all of these things Lord that we see coming to a head Lord is it another sign of the times is it just man's inhumanity to man Lord above all we need you in this hour and we pray Lord for the leadership lord of the nation of Israel Lord that you would give them wisdom Insight courage strength Lord that they not follow their own heart but that they follow you Lord and that you would reveal yourself to them in this hour Lord we commit this study tonight lord it's been such a struggle but Lord we believe you're here we trust you to be here and Lord we have confidence that you're here because you have said so forgive me Lord where I have fallen short and Lord prevent me from saying anything that would cause anyone to stumble but Lord we just want to be drawn closer to yourself and to one another we thank you for this honor and this privilege to be here tonight in Jesus precious name amen well in a complete departure from my Norm let's read our opening scriptures from Proverbs Chapter 1 the opening verses are an introduction and describe the reason for the collection of these sayings or Proverbs Proverbs 1:1 the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel their purpose is to know to gain wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding insight to receive the instruction of wisdom Justice judgment Equity that means Integrity to give subtlety Prudence caution to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion a w a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels that means acquire the ability to provide wise counsel to others to understand a proverb in the interpretation the the words of the wise and their dark sayings seeming riddles and the next verse concludes the introduction and reason for the book the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction please be seated we see that the focus of this book is wisdom as well as knowledge you might think of wisdom as knowing when and how to apply knowledge to a given situation guiding principles on how to live one's life practical downto Earth advice such as soft answer turns away anger not esoteric Concepts like how many angels can fit on the head of a pin you may recall from last week that the books of job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes and song of songs are grouped together in our Bibles and classified as wisdom or poetry before we dig into this Book of Proverbs let's step back a bit and take a look look at the Bible itself and in particular the collection of books that we refer to as the Old Testament while we were taking our study of the Bible in the form of an overview of each book in Order there's also the topic of the Bible itself the collection of books in this small Library which we call the Bible contains how and why are the various books arranged as they are in this collection in our Christian Bible the order of the books is quite different than in the Hebrew Bible known as the tanak if we think of each book as a tree the Bible represents the forest let's take a look at the forest for a few minutes we saw that the books from Genesis through job were narratives stories of people and events some were short like Ruth or Esther with a clear central figure whose life conveyed an important lesson others are much longer like genesis with a number of vignettes of people whose stories form a basis for our faith others like Exodus telling a much longer story of events not around not just a central figure like Moses but also of the people he was leading all the while God revealing himself through their lives their experiences their prophecies we caught glimpses of the character of God the character which God sought and in those glimpses we saw part of the character of God himself Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of songs are very different than the previous books they're not narratives of a history or focus on a central named figure brother Daniel did a masterful job last week giving us an overview of Psalm its breakdown and its theme worship I mentioned that in our Christian Bible the books of job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of Psalms are grouped and classified as wisdom or typically called poetry well there are there are 39 books in our Old Testament the first five sometimes called the law are the Books of Moses also called The pentat Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Genesis tells from creation through the life of Joseph and sets the stage for everything that follows both Old and New Testaments the other four are centered around Moses and the events during his life with remarkable and unique displays of the supernatural power of God working on behalf of his people the next 12 are classified as history telling the story of the descendants of Israel from the death of Moses around 1406 BC through the return from captivity around 450 BC a period of nearly 1,000 years Joshua Judges Ruth 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Kings first and second chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther the next group are the books of poetry job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes Song of Songs or sometimes called Song of Solomon there's five books there that's followed by the prophets it's broken down into two sections the Major Prophets which are considered Major Prophets because they left a significant number of written prophecies Isaiah Jeremiah the Lamentations of Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel these are approximately in chronological order and lastly the Minor Prophets the last 12 books these are short focused again arranged in approximate chronological order Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah Mah nakum habak zani hegi Zakaria Malachi we're generally familiar with this arrangement in Sunday school that children are usually taught the names and Orders of these books our current series of Wednesday night bible studies is for the purpose of seeing what each book is about one of our goals is that you then take the time to read through each book and get not only a better grasp of its contents but allow the Lord to have the opportunity to speak to you through the text he texted us this is a love letter yes amen this is a love letter read it amen and and if you feel down go back to a part that really cheered you up and read it again it's a love letter it's from a living God to living people and we're living people because he gave us his life it's not about teaching it's about relationship in the Hebrew Bible the structure is quite different it has all the content of the Old Testament but it's comprised of only 24 books organized in three sections the Hebrew Bible is commonly called the Tanakh it's taken from the first letters of the Hebrew words for those three sections the T for Torah the five books of Moses the the laws we sometimes think of it the neim which means prophets which is the middle section and the final section the Kim which means writings Torah neim Kim the law the prophets and the writings those are the names of the three sections but let's let's take a closer look at this the first section is known as the Torah we often State this as the law but it's more generally means instruction or teaching these are the same five books attributed to Moses and in the same order as in our Old Testament though with radically different names for example what we call the Book of Numbers in Hebrew is called the midal which literally means in the desert put another way while we put titles on the books these Scrolls didn't have titles so they're referred to by something from the very first uh sentence are the very first words what we call Genesis they call bashit which means means in the beginning uh Exodus is called shamot because it starts out with a list of names shamot is Hebrew plural for names talked about Deuteronomy is called theim which means things things okay let's move on let let's go to the let's go to nevim the prophets it's divided typically into two parts what they call the earlier prophets uh Joshua Judges Samuel Kings recall that a prophet is one to whom the word of the Lord comes in these books we read of various prophets such as Nathan Elijah Deborah Samuel these are prophets who left us no written record of their prophecies we usually think of these books as history but they're considered and classified as prophets in the Hebrew Bible notice that Samuel and kings are one book not split into two parts they had pretty good siiz Scrolls I think then we get to the later or the latter prophets the second part these are also thought of as the writing prophets there are three major prophets those who wrote a lot Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel and then the 12 that we think of of his Minor Prophets from Obadiah Amos Hosea through Malachi they didn't write so much and all 12 of them were contained in a single scroll and simply referred to often as the 12 which helps condense the number of books right notice that this while they're in the same order that we have they're not in the same place we end our Old Testament with the 12 Minor Prophets and the Hebrew Bible they're in the middle they're grouped with the prophets they don't end in Malachi the third and final part of the Tanakh contains the Kim the writings this collection of Scrolls is informally divided into three parts the first part is sometimes referred to as poetry but more often called wisdom now there's a there's a little bit of a play on words on letters here the things that uh rabbis really enjoy playing with and I thought maybe we'd play with it a little bit tonight ourself we have job here who really is shattering stereotypes if you're a good guy and do the right stuff nothing bad's ever going to happen to you wrong Psalms is about worship Proverbs is about wisdom well let's take just a little look at something here what my grandkids would call fun facts the first letters of the book of what we call job and Hebrew is EOB and it's represented by that funny thing that looks like an X that's a Hebrew letter Ola that's the very first letter in the alphabet if if you think in terms of Greek I'm sure you all think in terms of Greek right then that would be Alpha right okay the very first letter proverbs in Hebrew is mish and the letter meem is in the middle of the alphabet it's 22 letters so it can't be the you know the 10 and a half letter or something or the 11 and a half it's about the 13th but it's in the middle and Psalms to helim the letter Tav is the very last letter of the Hebrew alphabet think Alpha and Omega does that remind you of someone well these letters together spell the Hebrew word AMT so what brother L okay well let's take a look at that AMT is a Hebrew word for truth or wisdom and this word covers the whole Hebrew alphabet beginning to end alpha and omega as I said who did Jesus say he was Alpha and Omega he also said that he was the truth the Amit amen well one of my co-workers when I lived in Israel a half a century ago and worked at L which is the airline and Excuse me while I unpack my bag and baggage that I probably should have done earlier but but I didn't because I'm an old guy and sometimes I forget I I had a friend there and he told me something that that the rabbis said the word for truth or a Met if if you cut out these letters and and stand them up you'd find if I can do this the right way that they're stable they stand up they're strong they have a foundation okay for those of you that insist on sitting in the back if you can't see these very clearly remember binoculars opera glasses or sit closer okay but my my friend told me something else about this he said you know L he said the Hebrew word for lie or falsehood is shaker like many or most Hebrew words it's root consists of three letters in this case Shin K from these letters are all grouped at the very end of the Hebrew alphabet letters 19 through 21 of 22 unlike truth these letters have a narrow base if you cut them out and try to stand them up I I I can't do it they they don't stand up they're unstable they have to be supported you got to keep propping them up a li is unstable but then there's the truth Jesus is the truth the way and the life okay that little bit of stuff fun facts that was all free let's get back to the Tanakh the the next group of scrolls are called the megalot and that simply means Scrolls it's Hebrew word and these are the song of songs or Song of Solomon Ruth you notice is not placed historically but is placed here Lamentations Ecclesiastes and Esther these five scrolls are read each year During certain festivals or or observances Song of Songs is read on the Sabbath that occurs during the week of Passover it's interpreted as an allegorical expression of God's love for his people demonstrated by the Passover and by The Exodus this year it happened to be April 27 Ruth which we just covered recently is read on Shavuot anybody remember what Shavuot is those of you that speak Hebrew don't raise your hand oh then nobody's raising their hand okay well shev wot is the Feast of Weeks what do we call it Pentecost yes Harvest Time and that's a setting for the book for us the Redemption of a gentile bride maybe we should read it on Pentecost too it occurs on June 13 this year in Judaism but on the Christian calendar Pentecost is May 19th this Sunday lamentation very sad book wailing over the destruction of Jerusalem this is read on a on a day that's observed it's not a holiday it's not a day of Celebration it is a day of observance tesab AV means the ninth day of the month of a on the Hebrew calendar this is the date that in Jewish tradition and I believe historically as well that the first temple was destroyed in 586 BC it's also the the date the ninth day of the Hebrew month of a that the second temple was destroyed in 70 AD there's other disasters that have happened to the Jewish people over the years that seem to occur on this very same date in the Jewish calendar Lamentations is Jeremiah's lament over the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple under the Babylonians it falls on August 13 this year Ecclesiastes has read on the Sabbath of the week of sucot Tabernacles a reminder of the transitory and permanent nature of life just as the Tabernacles or booths or temporary structures and reminders of the years of wandering following The Exodus this year October 19th Esther is read on purm this book established the holidays we read two weeks ago it was on March 24th of this year the final three books are Daniel Ezra Ezra Nehemiah which is one book or scroll and Chronicles also one book these books are are called post exilic they mean after the Exile after the destruction uh after the people were scattered there their views are histories Daniel while certainly containing prophecies was written entirely in Exile in the section of the prophets the nebim were all written in the land of of promise even if they were post Exile Jewish tradition because I know most of you going to say wait a minute Ezekiel kind of starts out and says that he was by this Brook in Babylon Jewish tradition asserts that Ezekiel started his life as a prophet in Judah before the Exile while Daniel did not so we end while we end the Old Testament with Malachi a promise of a returning Elijah lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the Hebrew chanak ends with 2 Chronicles for us second Chronicles 36:23 thus saith Cyrus King of Persia think he might be a type of Christ in this verse all the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God Of Heaven given me all power is given unto me in heaven and earth is what Jesus said and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people the Lord is God be with him let him go up I just mentioned Pentecost is this Sunday what happened at Pentecost um hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem isn't that what we're supposed to be the temple of God the Holy Spirit came down the infilling it's just such a beautiful type and parallel so it ends on a note of Hope and restoration for the Jewish people and for us symbolic of the life of a Christian is a living Temple or house of the Lord well I'll end this rather lengthy sidebar about the structure of the Old Testament and to knock with two verses from the New Testament Gospel of Luke Jesus was familiar with the three-part structure and Order of the Tanakh in fact he referred to it when speaking with his followers gathered just before his Ascension let's read Luke 24:44 Jesus said unto them recall he's he's he's with uh his disciples this group of people and and he's asked for fish and a honeycomb and and he's eating and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses tah and in the prophets Nim and in the Psalms Kim writings concerning me he wasn't just referring to a couple of things well Psalms he was referring to that part of the structure that's the lead book in that part of the structure then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures when you read Luke 24 in the past I suspect you thought Jesus was referring to just a few books of the Old Testament but he was speaking of the entire Corpus of the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament and we know that to be true we see see Jesus Christ in every verse and kind of another little fun fact here Jesus was ever the teacher he was eating with him at this time Luke tells us he was eating fish and honeycomb now do you think he was kind of that's greasy oops honey from that honey you think he was standing up or do you think that he was probably seated at a table probably with the dish that to catch all the drippings while he was speaking whenever Jesus sits he's usually teaching not always and not only but The Sermon on the Mount sitting in a boat on the shore of the lake in the synagogue at Nazareth when he spoke about this day the scriptures fulfilled in your ears it says he read the scripture then he sat down all eyes were on him and he taught okay enough about structure let's get back to our topic ate you may be asking yourself self self Book of Proverbs what is a proverb glad you asked the American Heritage dictionary defines a proverb as a short piy saying and frequent and widespread use it expresses the basic truth or practical precept an old and common saying a phrase which is often repeated especially a sentence which briefly and forcibly expresses some practical truth or the result of experience and observation a maxim a saw an adage a striking or paradoxical assertion an obscure saying an enigma a parable as we'll see the Book of Proverbs is largely a collection of such short pithy sayings the Proverbs are presented using Hebrew parallelism to communicate its principles of wisdom it's very similar to the Psalms part of the reason it's called poetry as brother Daniel explained last week turns out there three basic kinds of parallelism employed repetition contrast completion we'll use examples of these in repetition or synonymous parallelism the second line of the proverb repeats the principle of the first line with different words a couple of examples Proverbs 1:2 to know wisdom and instruction to perceive to know the words of understanding wisdom and instruction it's saying the same thing using different words it's synonyms wisdom of course is not the same as knowledge wisdom is applying knowledge by means of understanding not just the facts but also the context in which you apply them Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth Before Destruction a hoty spirit before a fall again it's the same thing pride and a hotty Spirit are synonyms destruction and fall are synonyms making the same statement different words and this is advice and a warning Jesus talked about this humility that's that's what's going on here in contrasting or antithetical parallelism the second line States a principle by using a contrasting statement for example Proverbs 101 the Proverbs of Sol a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother wise and foolish are contrasted glad heaviness are contrasted father mother are contrasted lastly in completing or synthetic parallelism the second line completes the broad thought of the First with this specific Truth For example Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath made all things for himself then we come to down to focus and example yay even the wicked for the day of evil like Psalms The Book of Proverbs is broken into four sections the introduction is Proverbs 1: 1 through 7 it was our opening set of verses the emphasis is the beginning of wisdom a key verse of that is 17 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge fools despise with wisdom and instruction the next section is us to refer to is the invitation inviting the people of wisdom it's Proverbs 1 18-918 a key verse here is usually stated as Proverbs 35 through6 for me personally this is the heart of the entire book trust in the Lord with all thine heart how much how much of your heart should be dedicated to trusting the Lord and lean not unto thine own understanding contrast trust him or trust yourself in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct make straight thy paths you do the first three he'll do the fourth sounds easy but it's often not so easy the third section is often called the principles of wisdom Proverbs chapters 10- 29 a key verse here is perhaps uh 1412 there's a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death the last section chapters 30 and 31 emphasizing the practice of wisdom Chapter 30 is attributed to a person named agur and 31 to a King named Lemuel a key verse here is often considered to be Chapter 30 verse 4 who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the Earth wow sounds like Paul sounds like job what is his name what is his son's name if you can tell Christian theologians will often point to this as for telling the Messiah as the son Jewish theologians will tell you that it refers to Israel Exodus 4:22 says Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus saith the Lord Israel is my son even my firstborn Proverbs isn't about prophecy it's about how to live it's practical we read verses from chapter 31 about the attributes of a virtuous woman in our opening for the Book of Esther the first 29 chapters of Proverbs are attributed to Solomon they represent but a small fraction of the Proverbs he is reported to have collected spoken or written and first First Kings we read this about his Proverbs First Kings 4:29 God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largess of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore and Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East Country all the wisdom of Egypt he was wiser than all men than Ethan the ezrahite and hman and and chalal and Darda the sons of Mah who are those guys their names we don't recognize but they were apparently known for their wisdom in those days some 3,000 years ago and Solomon's Fame was in all nations roundabout and he spake 3,000 Proverbs 3,000 these 29 chapters only have 851 verses and not every one of them is a Proverbs so we have less than a quarter maybe only just a few percent of the proverbs that Solomon spoke and not only that somehow I deleted the next part of the line his songs were a th5 and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon unto the hsip that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and a fowl and creeping things and Fishes the lessons of nature of the world around us that the Lord created not just to express his variety but to teach us lessons about life not only the Majestic but the tiny a couple of years ago we spoke here one evening about the ant and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon from all Kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom Solomon we just learned spoke many Proverbs he didn't necessarily originate all of them he didn't necessarily write them down or even had them placed in a written collection for example more than 200 years after Solomon's death we read in Proverbs 251 these are also Proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out transcribed compiled collected that was more than 200 years after Solomon passed away and that comprises the last five chapters that are attributed to Solomon Solomon is also credited with composing two of the Psalms two the books of the Bible Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs these will be the subjects of upcoming overviews of the books comprising the Bible we could spend the rest of the evening looking at some of the various Proverbs and you probably expect me to do just that Proverbs that tell how to deescalate tense situations or how to live a fruitful life what things to value in life how to conduct business how to control temper what happens if there's no vision and so on sorry to disappoint but I really want you to read this book at home during devotions meditation family discussion and conversation set time aside unlike much of the Bible these are mostly short mini lessons they contain succinct practical advice on life and how to live use the ESV or the NIV or some other translation if the King James English trips you up a little bit make time I'm busy brother Lyall I've got this and I've got that going on yeah i' I I know about busy Sunday night probably something about busy might come up David wrote in the Psalms 11 19 wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way how how can a young person stay pure by taking heed thereto by guarding his way according to what Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee let me not Wander from thy Commandments and now a key how do I keep from wandering how do I guard my way Thy word have I hid in my heart why that I might not sin against thee wisdom application of knowledge of his word blessed art thou oh Lord teach me thy statute it's with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimony as much as in all riches I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways set aside time read listen meditate pray I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word we must not just learn and recite and quote we need to apply to live I presented an overview of the Old Testament the Tanakh The Book of Proverbs please read it let the Lord speak to you you don't need to hear my thoughts on it what lessons can we take home from Proverbs brother L you only read a few Proverbs read them at home amen read them at home did I say that read them at home we still have a little time this evening I want to emphasize the role of wisdom of applying our knowledge of the Lord in and to our lives brother Daniel I might be slipping into preacher of meddling here stop me at any time there's a couple of flashing red lights that I that I see first a personal note in 1968 I graduated from Flowing Wells High School here in Tucson there was a competition that year to see who would speak at commencement it wasn't going to be the person with the highest grade point average the valid Victorian I I prayed about this I submitted a speech for evaluation I came in second in a field of about 20 submissions but somehow the people that printed the program oops and I was the lead speaker that evening I don't have a copy of the speech but I remember a couple of lines from it that I think apply to this evening's Bible study I said knowledge without wisdom is like religion without god wow today we are asked to to live with the curse of both tonight nearly 60 years later I think it's still true we need wisdom we must apply the knowledge that we have of God and his word in our lives not just quote it or debate it or explain it as brother Daniel said recently we need to have rivers of living water coming from us to help others if it's just for our own edification it's of little value it's not the example that we have from Joseph or Moses or Jesus or the apostles or brother bradam another flashing red light if you will is a sometimes preoccupation with what we often call The Rapture brother Daniel we didn't collude on this this evening but he read that scripture Paul wrote to the Corinthians to fight a doctrine that was being spread about the soon return of Jesus people were being taught that they had to be alive when Jesus came or they'd go to hell if you died you were doomed Paul says we're not as those without hope that's why they were as those without hope because they were told oh your dad died gosh I'm sorry he's going to hell he's not alive when Jesus comes so he was fighting that Doctrine so we rod and assured them that if they were alive at that moment as he himself expected to be he said then we which are alive they'd be transformed and so were we if we're alive at that time but if they died not to worry because the dead in Christ will rise first if you're his you won't miss it you can't miss it if you're his period so don't fret about it don't worry about it don't try to figure out when it will be or how it will take place it's yours if you're his a third final flashing real light that I think we can so often get sidetracked about when he is coming that we may forget why we are here faith in Christ isn't a fire insurance policy or a quick escape from our problems we should our life isn't only about studying the Bible or listening to recordings of sermons from years past we should do these things but never forget we're to live each day for him consider what Jesus had to say Luke 6 why call ye me Lord Lord and you don't do the things that I say Amen whosoever Number One Cometh to me and two heareth my sayings and three do doth them I will show you whom he is like he's like a man which built a house he dig deep he laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the scam beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which when the stream did beat vehemently immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great in Sunday school we used to sing the wise man built his house upon a rock the rains came down and the floods came up right James summed this up in a proverb likee statement he said but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only why because if you don't do he says you are deceiving your own selves we used to sing a song about ready to leave I think maybe we need to change that to ready to live these Proverbs are words to apply to help us live in a way that's God pleasing we just read that Jesus said you can't say he is Lord if you don't do not just know or hear or claim to have a revelation but do what he says my daughter-in-law Siobhan shared a short video clip with me some years ago from a minister named Francis Chan some of you may have seen this I wasn't confident that I could embed it in my slide so I'll retell it now that I've acknowledged the source so I'm not plagiarizing this came from Francis Chan okay imagine imagine I'm 30 years younger I have hair a smaller belly yeah a real stretch of your imagination and I have children and they're teens I peek into my son's bedroom it's a real mess I tell him go clean your room he comes to me a few hours later big smile on his face and he says and great expectation dad I memorized what you said to me you said Lyle one one go clean your room I'm not going to respond wow son good job that's what I wanted it's not going to cut it he can't come to me and say Dad I learned to say go clean your room in Greek and Hebrew and in Spanish or dad my friends and I are going to gather every week and study and imagine what it would look like if I were to clean my room or listen I've set this to music I've added some verses in the chorus and the title is go clean your room would I accept these would you of course not there's no mystery here it's plain and simple black and white just go clean the room so why should we expect God to accept it from us to talk and sing and recite but not do the musicians would please come we've just read where Jesus said how can you call me Lord and not do what I say in Matthew's gospel we read not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but the one who will enter in is he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so we need to learn and to apply to turn knowledge into wisdom put it into practice and we know it it doesn't stop there that that's part one Jesus continues many will say to me in that day Lord Lord we prophesied in your name in your name we've cast out devils in your name we've done many wonderful Works Lord look we are doers I will profess to them here comes part two I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in addition to doing what he says we must have that relation a ship with him such that he knows us otherwise this book we call the Bible is just philosophy and its practices simply religion know listen apply from the heart brother Aaron Brother Daniel bless brother I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never how love the Lord I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never love the Lord amen as always I appreciate brother ly and his wisdom and how he puts these together I appreciate the variety too brother ly and I approach things in different ways but we both love to study the word and I think it gives us a good variety as far as a congregation brother ly said this and this is a proverb I believe was that your commencement ceremony that you erroneously got to give the first one but this is wisdom I believe is the Lord's will knowledge without wisdom is like religion without God very profound statement as with all of these Proverbs brother Lyall also said tonight he said that instead of reading these Proverbs he said get together with your family and you read them and you discuss them the way that the Proverbs are written you don't have to read a whole chapter to know what's going on many times you just have to read one or two verses and that's the way that they're written that we can go in and pull the wisdom out of these Proverbs the Psalms is the same way that that it's written that you can just go into Psalms you can jump anywhere into the book and then you can pull that wisdom and worship out of the Psalms and it's the same with the Proverbs you can go and you can pull it right out of this book and then you can have an hourlong discussion with your family I just opened it up I had it underlined in in the Proverbs it says this it says a fool utth all his mind but a wise man keepeth keepeth it until afterwards I was thinking that's a a good discussion to have as a family it's good for Dad or Mom to get the kids around and say now look at this read this always be careful what you say and always be careful how you act still say what you're going to say but you can wait until the end you we could have a great discussion about about these this wisdom that's in the Proverbs and as brother Lyall said I encourage you to do it sit down with your husband with your wife with your kids with your friend with whoever it is if you if you know somebody that's that's in another part of the country and you want to fellowship with them open this book and anywhere it says right here where there is no vision the people perish but he he that keepeth the law is happy and I'm just looking everywhere in here iron sharpens iron so a man so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend that's this book so take brother ly's advice study this talk about it pick one out talk about it with your family enjoy it it's what it's for and then apply it to your life will you do it I think it would be good for us to do it I think it'd be good for families to do it let's all stand there it would be like driving down the the road and there's a speed limit and you obey it and everybody's zipping around you and angry at you until the police pulls them over but you youve kept your place where you should be amen [Music] amen till we see chist it will be worth it all when we see Jesus life trials will seem so small when we see chist one glimpse of his dear face all Sorrows will R so bravely run the race till we see Christ [Music] it will be worth it all when we see Jesus LIF STS

you as brother ly said this book it was printed to be read and enjoyed and placed first in your life so please go into this book I like the way that brother Lyall did that he said no I'm not going to read all through this he says you do it I think you said it three times you do it you do it you do it and I got I got the hint I I believe it was really good but I thank you let's pray dear heavenly father we come to you tonight Lord and we just want to thank you for this time we've had tonight and Lord just pray that you'll help us to put the time aside and not be so busy and Lord just just give

Brother Jordan, could you take these prayer requests to the Lord for us? Um, we have, uh, Sister Amelia went to ER with stomach pain, so let's keep her in prayer for that. Um, and brother Dan mentioned there's a major storm about to hit Jeffersonville and they could get up to 12 ines in the next couple of days. So, and he said he's they've got a lot of family there. And, uh, we've also got some friends in Arkansas that they're cancelling service tonight. So, I don't know if it's the same storm, but let's keep all those people in prayer that are in the path of that storm. And then, um, Brother David Manasi, God bless you, saints. I'm requesting prayer requests for journey traveling mercies to Gree, Athens, Greece at the end of next month. My institution is sending us for an overseas assignment. Thank you, brother David. [Music] Let's pray this evening. Heavenly Father, we come to you and thank you for all that you've done for us, Lord. Your many blessings in our lives, Lord. You've brought us to service here tonight, Lord, with a desire to serve you and to worship you, Lord, and to just draw closer to you, Lord. And so we humbly ask if you would honor our desire, Lord, and just draw closer to us, Lord. Lord, forgive us of our sins and our iniquities, Lord. The things where we've fallen short, Lord, and our weaknesses, Lord, just strengthen us, Lord. Lord, where the feeble hands hang low, Lord, would you just raise them up, Lord? Where the ones that are sick and hurting, Lord, will you just heal them, Lord? Lord, there's many needs that have been mentioned over the last few weeks, Lord, that we know of, Lord, that are still there, Lord, and the ones mentioned tonight. Be with Brother David and traveling mercies, Lord, as he goes, Lord. And may he be a witness and a light, Lord, wherever he goes, Lord.

She's she's a blessing to all of us being here and uh just keep her in your thoughts. We prayed, we brought her before the Lord, but keep her in your thoughts and if the Lord lay it on your heart, ask the Lord to take care of her. And then um brother Michael mentioned that this is a pretty serious storm that's hitting the Midwest right now. Tornadoes and um they're expecting some pretty rough weather. Sister Hope mentioned it to me earlier and my brother I talked to my brother Adam on the phone a couple hours ago and yeah, this is these are big storms. 12 inches. We don't get that in three years here and they're expecting it in a day. So yeah, there could have some flooding. Uh, just just remember our friends and family that are in the Midwest in Indiana, Arkansas, in that area. Zeke and Zach, two guys that look alike there. They're related. It's Zach is Zeke's brother. Zach's been Zeke's been so journeying with us for the past few months. We're so thankful for him. He's he's a good kid. loves the Lord and uh we're gonna miss you, brother, and uh want you to come back soon. God God bless you. Give Give him a hand. Brother Daniel, Sister Ruby, bless you. Welcome. I think I see any more visitors um tonight. So, brother Lyall has been ministering on the life of King David. There's a character that's one of the main points and one of the main factors in in David's kingdom. And that is this King Saul. And I thought it would be good for us to learn a lot a little bit about this man Saul. And I think that would complement brother Lyall and his uh lessons on David. I I think it would be really good for us to know who this man is and where he came from and come of some of the highlights in his life. He um he's a perfect example of how a power corrupts. You take a very good man, a very good woman and give power and it can ruin somebody. to lay a foundation. Um, let's just give a little history of the world here. So, Adam and Eve, about 2,000 years since Adam and Eve sinned and were kicked out of the Garden of Eden, came this man named Abraham. And God promised Abraham that he would be that he would give him many, many, many offspring. And he said that he was going to give him this promised land beyond the Jordan River. And Abraham had a son named Isaac. Isaac had a son named Jacob. And Jacob had 12 sons. And of those 12 sons, those are the children. Jacob's name was changed to Israel. And so when we hear the children of Israel, we're talking about the children of Jacob. And Jacob had a son named Joseph. Joseph as brother Lyall talked the past few months on this life of Joseph. Joseph was exiled into Egypt and eventually Joseph brought his family, his 11 brothers and his father Jacob into Egypt where they stayed there for about 400 years. And there rose up a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph. And he started being really hard on these what are called Hebrews. And God sent a deliverer named Moses to bring them out of this land Egypt, land of Egypt and towards this promised land that God had promised their fathers Abraham. So Moses gets them right up to the point. They're in the wilderness for 40 years. Moses gets them right to the crossing over and then Moses dies and this man named Joshua, Moses's general, he brings them over into this land that was promised to them. They fought the inhabitants of the land. We call him Canaanites. And Mo or Joshua, of course, he eventually dies. And it leads into the time of the judges. If you remember our Bible studies way back last year where we went through each book of the Bible. And this is the time of the judges. The judges basically they were these great men that God would raise up. The children of Israel would sin. They would get into trouble. God would raise up a leader called a judge and deliver them. the people would repent. And this cycle keeps repeating over and over until we get to the last judge who was this man named Samuel, a prophet of God. Very, very powerful man. Samuel was, as I said, he not only was he a judge, but he was a real man of God. and he led Israel for for many years. And and Samuel starts to get old. And Samuel's sons, which would have should have taken his place, were sinners. They weren't good men. And the people were watching this. Samuel had led the people of Israel into battle and won. One specific battle was the Philistines who are the nemesis of Israel for for a long time. The Philistines attacked Israel. Israel was not on a united front. The Philistines just roll through and conquer Israel. So, Israel gathers themselves together. They say, \"We just got beat by these Philistines. Let's go down and get the ark of the covenant.\" Because when that ark goes forward, goes in front of us, we never lose. remember Joshua. So they went down and they got this ark and they went forth into battle and they lost again and the Philistines ends up end up taking the ark. It was a bad deal for the Philistines because the ark was just turned out to be a curse to them. And they end up giving this ark back to Israel. And then there is another battle and Samuel leads the Israelites into battle and wins. But Samuel's getting old and he doesn't have a successor. And remember the cycle of life which is sin, fail, deliverer, repent. Well, the people in Samuel's time, they really didn't want to live that godly life that they should have lived. And they look at Samuel, they say, 'Well, this man's our champion. And if he dies, we see his sons who are are just creeps. So, we can't count on them. They're dishonest. So, what are we going to do? And they see the world. And they see how these Philistines had attacked them and how organized they were. And they had these armies. And the the king of the Philistines would gather the armies together and they would all work in unity. and attack Israel and they'd win every time because Israel couldn't defend themselves because they were not united. So the people of Israel, they tell Samuel, \"Hey, we want a king. We want someone who can lead us into battle because they see all of the world there.\" And that's how everybody else did it. So they say, \"Why can't we do it?\" But they ignored the fact that God always fought their battles for them. if they were living their lives sincerely to God. They didn't really want to do that. They wanted someone to lead them in the battle. They wanted someone to be their king. So eventually this man Saul is chosen and he came from an affluent family. he um would make would just make a perfect king. And if you look at the nature between this man Saul and who brother Lyall is talking about this man David, you see a very very different nature between the two. Saul was as I said was born into an affluent family. His dad was well respected. He was the bestlooking guy of his family. And not only that, but he was the best looking guy in the entire country. He was taller and built better than anyone else. And he was articulate. He had everything going for him. This man named Saul. But to be really to be a true success, you have to go through trials. You have to suffer. You have to work hard. You have to know what it is to to have money and food on the table. And then you also know you have to know how it is not to have food on the table. And you have to know how it is really to struggle. And we look at successes in people that that we see as success. Most of these people had to go through hard times. And this man Saul really didn't have to go through any hard times. So he was about a he was at a bit of a disadvantage in becoming king when you compare him to this man David who suffered greatly before he ever became king. And I look at some of these today some of like the the YouTube stars and the the Tik Tok stars and and it used to be when we were younger, brother Michael, it was the movie stars and the athletes and all that. now this this thing called YouTube and all that and and they're the the rich and and famous and people this generation as our generation was too they don't want to work to be successful. They want it to be handed to them. And it always ends it almost always ends in a bad way. First of all, someone that wants to succeed in life and wants to be a successful, wants to be rich, wants to be all of these things and is not willing to make to build a foundation and and to go through the hard work, that person is is not they're not going to be rich in the in the first place. But if they are, then they automatically will fail. I was reading in the um USA Today article, an article this morning about um people who won the lottery. Most people who win the lottery end up in debt. Sounds strange. Oh, not me. I wouldn't. Well, most do. Maybe you wouldn't, but you probably would because most people do. You think, well, if I had won a hund00 million, I would put away this and put in my Roth IRA here and this. Most people end up losing it all. And many have said that they wish that they had never won that mcurse to them. If Saul, we know the story now because we have our Bible, but if Saul would speak after, if he would come here today and speak to this church, he would probably say, \"I wish I would have never become king. I lost my dignity. I lost my self-respect. I lost my family. They were killed in battle. I lost my character. I turned into a raving narcissist. I lost my religion. I did those things which were forbidden to do. I offered a sacrifice when only the priests were to sacrifice. I murdered. I even consulted a witch, a demonpossessed woman, because God had forsaken me. I was miserable my whole life. This is the greatest man in the whole world at the time. I was miserable my my whole life. I was full of hate. I was paranoid. I thought everyone was out to get me. I didn't trust anyone. Anytime someone would challenge me, I would destroy them. My own son, who was heir to my throne, preferred his friend over me to be king. So if Saul could say that, if Saul could speak today, that's probably what he would say. He'd probably say, \"And most of all, God turned his back on my reign.\" That's Saul. He reigned for 40 years. But God chose another king only after a couple years. Only after a couple years into his reign. He look he's right now. We look at him as a a mentally ill tyrant who is obsessed with killing his most loyal servant. His son's best friend, a man after God's own heart. This young man who was anointed king. As I said, only after a couple years of Saul's reign, this young man named David, who brother Lyall was talking about, he hated him. He is a perfect example of how power can corrupt a very, very good man. I want to pause for a minute as I was studying this over the past couple days. Brother Aaron and I were talking about um in the back here we were talking about some ministers who thank goodness that they didn't get the power but some did get power and they turn into very corrupt very immoral people. We see them on the news and you know the news is always quick to point out how bad these preachers of the so-called gospel are. And you see and it's because they rose to power. They they got a lot of popularity. They got arrogant and then they got filled with pride and pride was their downfall. I want to tell you just quickly. I know it's maybe off the subject of of Saul, but there's somebody that all of us know of that gets a whole lot of criticism, and that's brother William Brana. He was an intelligent, gifted man. He had he was gifted with spiritual discernment. And if if you have listened to the tapes, if you have listened to the ends of those sermons and those prayer lines, you see that cannot be faked. I heard one guy say, he says, \"Oh, well, he used to read the phone book before he'd go to a city and have a meeting. You think we're idiots? Seriously, you think we're crazy?\" And and just they would put him down and put him down. But this man, William Brandham, he came from the lowest of the low. He came from a sinner family and and very very a difficult f a difficult life. I interviewed a lady and and a man, a brother and sister. Their last name was Weber. If you listen to the tapes, Brother Jeremy, you're a tape listener. The lady when brother Brandham tried to take up the offering and she opened up her little coin purse, that was sister Weber. That was this their grandmother. And they both knew brother Brandham and they both grew up in the depression. And the lady, she wasn't a fan of uh the uh the message as we call it. And she told me, she said, \"Those Brandhams,\" she says, \"we were all poor.\" Because we grew up in in the depression. She said, \"But those Brandoms, they were the poorest of the poor. They didn't have anything.\" He, she said, they didn't have shoes. They would come to school. She was in the same grade, I think, as as Brother Brandham's um may have been her one of his brothers or his sister, but she said none of the Brandhams ever had shoes. They didn't have clothes. We know the story from from his life story. He didn't have a shirt and he had to wear a jacket in in uh in the um in the school room. He was he came through it. He suffered and that suffering built his character and he surrounded himself not like this man Saul who when he came to power it ruined him. The greater this man William Brandom got the more humble he became. the sweeter he became. His friends with people like my grandfather, his closest friends, Bankswood and Welch Evans, they were nobodyies. My grandfather was a was he owned a mechanic shop. Bankswood was just a a carpenter. Neither of them were educated. Neither of them were really anything in society. Neither of them had money. Yet, this is who he wanted to spend his time with. You know, they I'm sure they paid ti, but it wasn't much. Yet, this is who Brother Brandham surrounded himself with. They were out to eat one time, my my grandpa, Brother Woods, and Brother Brandham, and they sat down at the table. And they ordered off the menu. And Brother Woods, he uh he looked over at another table and he said, \"What's what's that guy over there having?\" Um what is that? And they said, \"Well, that's the whatever.\" And he says, \"I'll have that.\" And then Brother Woods got up and went to the restroom. And Brother Ram tells my grandpa, he says, \"Do you see how Brother Woods ordered?\" He said, \"He can't read. This is his best friend.\" And you see how this the greater really that brother Brandham got, the more you saw this good character come out. And in contrast, the worse this man Saul became. I was I used to do an article. I wrote an article for um our magazine when I was in Jeffersonville and I used to ride my bike around Jeffersonville and talk to old people sitting on on their porches and it was a lot of them. They that's what they do back there. And I would walk up and say, \"I'm doing a research project on this man named William Brandom.\" And and they would uh most of them, it's funny that a lot of them, I'd say most of the ones that I talked to were born there and raised raised there. And almost all of them knew Brother Brandon personally. Never once, not one time. And there was between 50 and a hundred of them. might say, \"Did I ever hear a negative word?\" It was all positive. Not one. Now, pretty much all of them had plenty negative words to say about message believers. I mean it. There was a lot of negative about that, but never about that man. And you see that character, it just it it came out. And it's hard it's hard not to love him. It was hard hard to criticize him. They all everyone that talked to him thought he was their best friend. Oh yeah, he used to come by. He dropped off dropped off uh this meat or that meat and he'd go hunting and and you know they had different ted the barber told me a testimony one time he had brother came back like five squirrels and he said every one of those was shot right through the eye and he told me the story about the squirrels and and how good of a shot he was. They thought he was great. But then you see power in someone else if they don't have the character will destroy them. And that's what happened with this man named Saul. They end up hating anyone who disagrees with them. We see it in the pulpit many times. They attack people in their own congregations, the ones they're supposed to serve. And you see that spirit start to form in Saul. You'll see it as we start to get through our lesson. And and I I don't know how far I'll get today, but we'll continue it on. You'll see that that spirit of arrogance and pride start to raise up in this man, Saul, and the hatred. But he started very very good. So as I said earlier in my my short history, the Israelites had lost a battle with the Philistines and Samuel, they'd lost a couple battles and then Samuel leads them to victory. And they remembered how organized these Philistines were. And the Israelites, they were 12 separate tribes and they didn't even work together really. Sometimes they fought amongst themselves. They were not a united front. If they were united, they could form be a formidable um force. But they weren't. But what they what they didn't do, they didn't remember that every time they needed something, God would part the Red Sea for them. God would bring down the walls of Jericho for them. But they didn't remember that. What they wanted was they wanted to they wanted security and safety without trusting in God. And that's the foundation of how this man Saul came to be. Now Samuel was old. His boys were not moral. So the people asked a very good question, one that we would probably ask. They said, \"What are we going to do when the prophet dies?\" 1st Samuel chapter 8. Let's start with verse number five. And they said unto him, \"Behold, thou are old, thy sons. Walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.\" But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, \"Give us a king to judge us.\" And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And Samuel said, and the Lord said unto Samuel, hearken unto the voice of the people, and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them, according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and have served other gods, so do they also. also unto thee. The way was for the Israelites, the right way was for the Israelites to stop sinning, to seek God, and then trust in God. Now therefore, hearken unto their voice. How be it, yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. So God's telling them to re God's telling Samuel to resist them, but go ahead with what they say and prophesy of what's coming. And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said, \"This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you. He will take your sons and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and for his horsemen. And some shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captain over thousands, and captain over 50s, and will set them to ear set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your and your olive yards even to the best of them and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. And he will take your man's servants and your maidervants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work. And he will take a tenth of your sheep. And you shall be his servants. And you shall cry out in that day because of your king which you have chosen which ye shall have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you in that day. Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they say, \"Nay,\" they said, \"Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we may also that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.\" And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, \"Hearken unto their voice, listen to them, and make them a king.\" And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, \"Go ye every man unto a city.\" So go away. Now watch what God gives the people of Israel. They wanted a king that they could be proud of. They wanted a king that would be intimidating to their enemies. They wanted they they didn't want what they didn't want to do is they didn't want to trust God. They didn't want to stop their sinning, but they wanted someone to take the place of their personal walk with God. I'll say it again. They wanted a man to take the place of their personal walk with God. And then God gives them exactly what they desired. 1st Samuel chapter nine. And there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abel, the son of Zeror, the son of Beckarath, the son of Apha, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. So we see that Kish was respected. He was probably rich. And it would make sense that the king would come from him. And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice young man and goodly. Goodly means handsome in the King James version. And there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he. So he was the handsomest of all of them. From his shoulders and upward, he was higher than any of the people. So, he was tall, dark, and handsome, and like a foot taller than everybody else. So, what happened is this good-looking guy, this good-looking young man, Saul, who was born to this fairly wealthy family, um, affluent family, his dad's donkeys got away. So, dad Kish says, \"Saul, go find my donkeys. Take a servant and go find the donkeys.\" So Saul takes a servant and they're looking around and they go here and they go there and they go all over the country and they they can't find these donkeys and the food's run out and and Saul's like, \"Man,\" he tells his servant, he says, \"We better go back because dad's going to be more worried about us than he is going to be about these donkeys.\" So the servant says, he says, \"Hey Saul,\" he says, \"Um, you see that city down there?\" He said, ' There's a man of God down there, a seer. He said, \"Let's go ask him where your dad's donkeys are.\" And and Saul says, \"Well, I don't have any any more food. We don't I don't have any money with me. Um, you know, we'd have to give him an offering. what what what should we do? And the servant says, \"No, no.\" He says, \"I got I got some money.\" He said, \"Let's just go down there and then we'll give him this as an offering and then you'll see he'll tell us where the where the donkeys are and let's uh we're in right now. We're in um 1st Samuel 9. Let me read kind of a a neat addition. Uh 1st Samuel 9:9. This this will um kind of solidify some things. Before time in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, this is just interjected in the text. Before time in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, come and let us go to the seer, for he that is now called a prophet was before time called a seer. I love that part because the author of 1 Samuel is saying, \"Okay, they're going to be saying seers.\" He's they're very accurate in what they wrote down. They're going to be calling these these men seers, but now we call them prophets. So, basically, they're the same thing. Verse number 15, let's let's go there. Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, \"Tomorrow, about this time, I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is, come unto me.\" And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, \"Behold the man whom I spake to thee of, this same shall reign over my people.\" What a moment. Right there, the prophet Samuel realizes that this is going to be the first king of Israel. And Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said, \"Tell me where is the seer's h where where the sear's tell me where the seer's house is.\" And Samuel answered Saul and said, \"I am the seer. Go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.\" So he's showing the gift of a prophet right here. Samuel's saying that I will tell you what's in your heart. That discernment gift will come out in Sam Samuel and you don't even need need to speak it. Saul, it's a mark of a prophet. And this is prophecy. If a man can tell the secrets of the heart and not be wrong, not just be right most of the time, many of us can do that, but not be wrong, be right every time, then that is the mark of a prophet. And this Samuel is a true prophet of God. And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, Samuel's like, \"Wait a minute. I didn't tell you about the donkeys. But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them. Don't worry about them, for they are found.\" And on whom is all, now listen to this, and on whom is all the desire of Israel. Remember I was t saying before that Israel was saying we want a king. We want a king. And that was buzzing all over the country all over the 12 tribes. We want this and on whom is all the desire of Israel. Is it not on you and on thy father's house and on all thy father's house? And Saul answered and said, \"Am I not a Benjamite, the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family, the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Wherefore then speakest thou to me?\" Look at the humility in Saul, a humble man, definitely not the man that he would become. And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them to sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about 30 persons. So about 30 important people were at this feast. And Samuel put Saul and his servant in the most important spots. So he set Saul like at the head of the table where the where the guy that's in charge sits. And Samuel said to the cook, \"Bring the portion which I gave thee of which I said to thee, set it by thee.\" And the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, \"Behold, that which is left, set it before thee, and eat. For unto this time hath it be been kept for thee since I said, and I have invited the people.\" So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house, and they arose early. And it came to pass about the spring of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, \"Get up that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out, both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\" And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, \"Bid the servant to pass on before us.\" And he passed on. But stand thou still a while that I might show thee the word of God. So here is Samuel the prophet talking with this young man Saul. Let the servant go ahead because I want to talk to you privately. Chapter 10 verse one. Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poued on poured it on his head and kissed him and said, \"Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?\" Now Samuel prophesies a few things that are going to happen right after Saul leaves him. So Saul knows that this is coming from God. And imagine if something like that just happened to you or me, it would be in our minds. would be like, \"No, that can't be true. That can't be true.\" But if the prophet tells us this is going to happen and this is going to happen and then this is going to happen, it would give you faith to say that this man, what he said is really true. And that's what happened with Saul. He left Samuel and the things that Samuel prophesied to come to pass just on his road happened. This is what happens to Saul. When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel supplicer in the border of Benjamin at Zalsa, and they will say unto thee, the asses which thou wentest to seek are found. And lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses and and sorrowed for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? So Saul was right. Dad was worrying about him more than he was worrying about the donkeys. Then shalt thou go forward from hence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Taber, and there shall meet thee three men going up to Beth going up to God to Bethl. Look at the precision in the prophet. Three men going up to God to Bethl. One carrying three kids, not like kids, goats. Not like little kid, you know, human beings, goats, and car and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine. And they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands. After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines were ruling. And it shall come to pass when thou art come to the to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with sultry and tab and tabet and pipe and harp before them and they shall prophesy. So these are gifted men. These are religious men. These are ministers. and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. And let it be when these signs are come to thee, that thou do as occasion that thou do as occasion serve thee, for God is with thee. For thou and thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal, and behold, I will come down unto thee to offer a burnt offering, and to sacrifice, sacrifices a peace offering. Seven days shalt thou tar till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.\" And it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart. And those signs came to pass that day. So the prophecies came to pass. And listen to this. And when they came hither to the hill, behold, the company of prophets met him, and the spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. We've heard that David and Saul were numbered among the prophets. It's this story right here. And when they came to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him, and the spirit of God came upon him, and he saw prophesied among them. And it came to pass when all that knew him before time saw saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets. Then the people said one to another, what is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? And one and one of the same place answered and said, but who is their father? Therefore, it came it became a proverb, Saul is among the prophets. Became a saying. People started saying this. And when he had made an end to prophesying, he came to the high place place. And Saul's uncle said unto him, now remember Samuel the prophet had just told him that you are going to be king of Israel, first one. And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, where where have you been? And he and and he said to seek the asses. And when we saw that they were nowhere, we came to Samuel. So we were looking for the donkeys and we couldn't find them. So we went to the man of God. We went to the prophet. And Saul's uncle said, \"Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.\" And Saul said unto his uncle. He plainly he told us plainly that the asses were found, but the matter of the kingdom where of Samuel spoke, he told him not. Look at the humility of Saul. He didn't tell his uncle or servant or anyone that he was going to be the king of Israel. You would think that he would be telling everybody, but do you see the character in the young man Saul? He was a good character, a humble character. Now, back to the prophet Samuel after he had secretly anointed Saul, the king of Israel. Verse number 17. And Samuel called the people together unto unto the Lord at Mispa. And he said unto the children of Israel, thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms, and all of them that oppress you. Remember the book of Joshua, book of Exodus. Don't you remember? I am the one that did all of this for you. And you have said, and you have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and all your tribulations, and you have g you have said unto him, \"Nay, but set a king over us.\" Now therefore, present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands. So Samuel cast lots, which is like the Uram Thumbman back then. He wanted to show the people that God chose this king, not me. Skip to verse 24. And Samuel said to all the people, \"See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, and there's none like him among all the people.\" And all the people shouted and said, \"God saved the king.\" So they're looking at this big goodlooking guy standing there, foot taller than anyone else. He was the best looking guy in Israel. He comes from a famous and wealthy family and and the guys are might looking at him being like, \"Man, this guy is cool. He can probably bench 400 pounds.\" The girls are looking at him and say, \"He's cute. How many wives does he have?\" I'm just kidding. And the warriors are looking at this man say, \"I would follow that man into battle. That's a man I would follow. A man that looks like that.\" Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all of the people away, every man to his house. So the prophet in his old age, he lays out how the new kingdom of Israel would function in that book. And Saul also went home to Gibia, and there went with him a band of men whose hearts God had touched. But the children of Balile said, now this is important. But the children of Balile said, \"How shall this man save us?\" And they despised him and brought no presence. But he held his peace. But Saul held his peace. Look at the character of King Saul here. He had just been crowned king. He had just been anointed king. And yet he had patience with these people that that criticized. Children of bile means worthless people. And these are the ones who will complain no matter what you do. They will find fault in everything. They're always they're always finding fault. They're always criticizing. These kind of people are always present. They're they're present here. They're present in every church. They are always there. And no matter what you do, they are going to criticize it and they'll make fun of it. The Bible calls them the children of Bile. Other men when they became king later on they killed these people that would criticize them. Solomon's son Riaboam. Remember that story? David's son Solomon and Solomon's son Riaboam. He said that my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. I'm going to be hard on you. But this man Saul, he was kind and he said, \"No, just leave them alone.\" Really, any ruler of of any sort, there will always be children of Blay that criticize and don't help in any way. But I think that we should always take the attitude that Saul originally had and just leave them alone. You don't have to chastise someone from the pulpit. You don't have to chastise someone publicly. Just leave them alone. Every there they'll always be there. Whether it's our president, how thin Scandi is and and you know, someone will tweet and they tweet back and forth. It's like just just leave it, you know, just just let it go. So the um so Saul is now king. Now the uh there's this king that rises up this this Ammonite. The children of Ammon, they come from this man Lot. So you remember Abraham and his nephew Lot. Lot came out of Sodom. Sodom was destroyed. His wife turns to a pillar of salt. They they go up and they hide out in the in the mountains and the Lot ends up sleeping with his daughters and they have one each daughter has a son. One is named Ammon. The other one in the other one's name is Moab and that's where the Ammonites and the Moabites come from. And they were constantly at war with Israel. So this man, this Ammonite called Nahash was his name, he brings an army to this city and he besieges this city and they the um the the people in the city, they reach out to this man, this conquering man that's going to about to about to take their city and they say, \"Hey, can um can we make a deal and then we'll serve you?\" And this man, Nahash, evil man, he says, \"Okay, we can make a deal.\" He says, \"I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you to be a reproach on Israel. How's that for a deal? Then you can serve me.\" And they were like, \"Uh, can we have seven days to think about it?\" And they sent out messengers to help them. Saul, it starts getting among the people and then in Saul's hometown, he hears the people crying and he says, he says, \"Why are the people crying?\" And they tell him the whole story about Nahash. Now this is the king of Israel. Now remember, Israel is used to getting destroyed by any invading army. And that's why they they were so quick to say, \"Hey, let's make a deal.\" And he's like, \"Okay, I'm going to gouge out your right eyes and then you can serve me.\" And they're like, \"Uh, well, let us think about it.\" What they said. and they sent people out to get help. Finally, it gets to the king. It gets to the leader. Let's read it. Chapter 11, we'll just start with verse one. Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabeshgilead. And all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, \"Make a covenant with us and we will serve you.\" So the Jewish people at Jabeshgilead, they were used to getting conquered. So they wanted to make peace. We'll pay you off. And Nahash the Ammonite answered, \"On this condition, will I make a covenant with you that I may thrust all out all your right eyes and lay it for reproach upon all Israel.\" Oh, you want to make a deal, huh? Those are my those are my terms. And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, \"Give us seven days respit that we may send managers unto all the coasts of Israel. And then if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.\" And and then came the messengers to Giba of Saul, and told the tidings and the ears of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. And behold, Saul came after the came after the herd out of the field. And Saul said, \"What alth the people that weep?\" And they told them the tidings of the men of Jabesh. And the spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings. And his anger was greatly kindled. And he took an a yolk of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coast of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, \"Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul, and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto this oxen.\" And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the people, and they came out in one consent. So Saul said, \"Listen, we are going to battle and if you don't come, all of you 12 tribes, if you don't come and follow me into the battle, then you're going to be like this ox that I just cut up.\" He showed leadership there. And when he numbered them in Ba in Bez, the children of Israel, there were 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000. And they said unto the messengers that came, thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabes Gilead, tomorrow by that time the the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came down and showed it to the people to the men of Jabesh. And they were glad. So they sent messengers and said, \"Tomorrow we're going to be there and we're going to bail you out. Here comes the Calvary.\" Therefore the men of Jabesh said, \"Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemth good to you.\" Now watch the leadership of Saul. He shows that he can lead in battle. And it was on the marorrow that Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together. And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, \"Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men that we may put them to death.\" Remember the sons of children of Bile, the sons of Balile. It's like, \"Oh, do you remember they were talking about you? You Saul.\" And Saul said, \"There shall not a man be put to death this day, for today the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.\" Then said Samuel to the people, \"Come, let us go to Gil Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.\" And all the people went to Gilgal. And there they made Saul king before the before the Lord in Gilgal. Second time. Now Saul was proven in battle. And there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. So we see this man Saul. I'll um we'll we'll stop there. The musicians can come and close. You see this man Saul, he started out very very good, very brave. I love that part when he hears that his people are in trouble and he says, \"You know what? We're all going to to bail them out.\" That had never really happened in Israel before. And now this king shows that God is with them. And he gets all the people together. And here they go to conquer this guy that was about to do these awful things to their brethren. And we see this man Saul was leading them into battle. A truly great man. But soon things will begin to change. And this power in Saul will start to turn to pride. And then this pride will turn to jealousy. And then all of these problems that Saul has, they start to work on his mind and they start to trouble him and they really they make his life miserable from this from this is the highlight in Saul's career. This is the best that it gets and he's going to win some more battles and we'll get to that in the next time we get to Saul. But it'll he'll soon start making mistakes and he'll st soon soon start relying on Saul more than he relies on the Lord. God bless you [Music] [Music] Michael upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord, teach me Lord to way. Teach me Lord to wait down on my knees. Tell in your own good time. You'll answer my please. Teach me not to rely on what others do, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. For they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Oh, teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. will teach me Lord to wave while hearts are a flame. Help me humble my pride and call on your name. Keep my faith renewed and keep my eyes on me. Let me be on this earth what you want be to be. For they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall bow up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Oh, teach me Lord to wait. I really think the story of King Saul is the most tragic story in the Old Testament. We see what a tremendous potential that this man had. He had every character that we would think that a king should have, but yet he let it get to his head. Later on, we'll see that his whole character changed when power corrupted him. But before that, he truly was a great man. Boy, just the battles and the leadership that he showed in Israel really hadn't been seen until since Joshua's time. And he got them together and he said, \"We're going to battle. And if you're going to chicken out, I'm coming after you after the battle.\" Just a tremendous leader. Wonderful leader. Let's all stand. [Music] Teach me Lord to wait down on my knees till in your own good time. You'll answer my please. Teach me not to rely on what others do, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. All they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord or teach me Lord to way. Very important week this week as we prepare for a communion service on Sunday evening. Keep that in prayer. The scripture that we read during every communion service that says, \"Let a man examine himself.\" So let us examine ourselves this week. Make sure that we are right with the Lord. When we come and take the cup and the bread, we want to be worthy. We'll never be worthy maybe in our own eyes, but we want to be right. We want our heart to be right to where we can say, \"Lord, I make a lot of mistakes, but you know my heart and in my heart I truly want to be a Christian.\" Then on this coming Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening at 3:00, we have a um have a potluck at UD Doll Park and that's for everybody. The youth are planning it and they're organizing it, but it's for all of us. We can all we can all go and um I think that's it. Zach and Zeke, may God be with you on your traveling. May his Holy Spirit be in the vehicle with you and guide you and protect you. And I pray that when you get back home that the Lord will bless you there and that you will u find the desire of your heart. And remember, the closer you get to God, the more you want to be closer to him. As you get closer and closer, the greater he is. And the closer you get, the closer you want to be. Let's bow our heads. Our father, we thank you Lord that you have preserved these stories in the Bible and Lord that we can see great men in the past and and how they rose up to power and Lord how you were with them. The same God that was with Saul and changed him is the same God that's here with us. The same God that was with David is the same God that's here with us. Same God that was in Moses is the same God that's here with us. And Father, we want to speak to you like Samuel spoke to you. Be with us, Father, we pray. guide us, protect us, prepare our hearts, Father, for this communion service this Sunday. And we pray that you would bless the gathering we'll have on Saturday. And Father, bless each one that's here tonight, those that streamed in. May your your hand be upon them in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] The love of [Music] God is greater [Music] far than tongue or pin.

Would you stand with me this morning? We're going to sing Holy Forever.

Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? Holy is the Lord. [applause] Amen. Holy is the Lord. We're going to have uh Brother Lyall open in prayer and bring the prayer request before the Lord. Before we sing it, let's sing that old hymn of the church. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound [music] that saved a wretch like me. Key of F. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save a rich like me. Oh, I once was lost, [singing and music] but now I'm found. I [music] was blind, but [singing] now I see. It was grace [music] that taught. Let me hear you. Was grace that taught [music] my heart to fear and grace my fears [singing] breathe. [music] How precious did that [music] grace [singing] appear. The [music] hour I first believe through many dangers. through many dangerous toys to [singing] snares. I [music] have already come [singing] to [music] grace that brought [singing] me safe. thus [singing] far. Oh, and grace will he be home when we've been there. And when we've [singing] been there 10,000 years, bright shineing as [music] the sun. [singing] We've no [singing] less days [music] to sing God's praise [music] than when we first began. Let's raise our hands and sing. Praise [music] God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Oh, praise God. Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise [music] God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Praise God. I'm really lying. If you have a need, as you know, you can raise your hand and the Lord will see your need. Even if you don't raise your hand, he already knows it. But you raise your hand in faith that you know he's going to he's going to answer. He's going to be there for you. And then if you don't have a need, you can raise your hands and worship to him this morning. He is worthy of all praise. [music] Good morning and God bless you all. You know this morning we were reading in our devotion about uh [music] when the ark was brought into the temple that Solomon had just built and when the people were in unity with one voice [music] and the musicians were in unity. Everything was in unity in one accord. And then the spirit of God came down in such power and such presence that everything had to stop. They just had to stop in awe and worship of God. And I pray this morning that as we're joined together here, that our hearts are joined together, our minds are joined together, our thoughts are joined together, our spirits are joined together, our hearts are joined together as [music] one in Jesus Christ. that we can approach the Lord together and [music] just invite his continued presence because his presence is surely surely here. We have one written request this morning from brother John and sister Anne Lucer. Please remember an as she travels to Pennsylvania tomorrow to be with family as her father's health is failing. Thank you for your prayers. And sister, we pray that God go with you and minister [music] to your father and to your family that's there. So, let's just join our hearts together in prayer. Lord Jesus, Lord, it's such a privilege. It's such an honor, Lord, to be gathered here in 2025, Lord, to look back at Calvary, see the price that you paid, Lord, that you made the way for each one of us by your grace, Lord. that in spite of our the many dangers, toils, and snares that we've come through, you've seen us through them all. Lord, we just pray that you continue to be with us. Help us, Lord, to bring as many as we can with us, Lord, as we someday will be there for those 10,000 years just warming up. Just just a warm up, Lord. Lord, we just thank you for your love, your mercy, and your grace. We look forward to the word this morning, Lord, to to instruct us, Lord, to draw us closer to you, to to correct us, Lord, and Lord, just to help us be the people that you want us to be. We pray that you'd bless the offering that's offered this morning, Lord, that it'd be used for the purposes that please you. We thank you for everything. Thank you for each other. And Lord Jesus, we love you. We thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ly. You can all have your seats this morning. We're gonna sing this song. It was a great thing that he did for me. Key of G. Go ahead and put the just the chorus up there, Brother Tim. Just [music] to start off, it was a great thing. How many know this song? Few hands. Okay, it's pretty simple. Sister Anne knows it. She's going to sing very loud. Help us all. I'll sing. Oh, it was a great thing that he did for me. It was a [music and singing] great thing. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. I started clapping. Nobody started clapping. So, I'll clap just just the music. We'll start with just the music and clapping. Then we'll add voices. How's that sound? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It was a great thing that he did for me. That he did for me. It was a great [singing] thing when [music] he set me free. When he set me free. Jesus died. Oh Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see it was a [music and singing] great thing that he did for me. Let's sing that again. It was a great thing.

Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. [applause] You all did very good. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Daniel's going to get ready to come. We're going to sing this blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's always good to be in church. It's always good to sing songs about the goodness of Jesus, what he's done for us. Brother Daniel's going to come. Let's just enter into an atmosphere of worship really this morning. So when our pastor comes, there'd be nothing in the way. Just be a good let may the Lord come down and dwell in the praises of his people right now. There is a blood that cost a life. There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. death its price. And when [singing] it flowed down from the [singing] cross, my sins were gone. [music] My sins forgot. There was a grave. There is a grave [music] that tried to hide this precious blood [music] that gave me life. But in three days [singing] he breathed again [music] and rose to stand [music] in my defense. [singing] So I come [music] to tell you he's alive. to tell you that [singing and music] he drives every tear that falls. So I come [music] to shout and to proclaim [singing] to shout and to proclaim [music] that he's [singing] coming back for you. There is a blood. There is [music and singing] a blood that sightes the blind and sightes the blind that heals the sick that heals the sick. The [music] lonely the lonely [singing] finds. It has the power. It has the power [music] to free the bound as chains [music] that [singing] fall upon the ground. So pour, so pour it out to [music] cleanse my soul and let [music] it liquid. Glory [singing] flow [music] because he lives [music] to make me whole. [music] I owe my life. [singing] I owe my all. So I [music and singing] come to tell you he's alive. To tell you [music] that he drives every [singing] tear that falls. So I [singing] come [music] to tell you that he's safe. To shout and to [music] proclaim that he's coming. So I come. [singing] Oh, so I come [music] to tell you he's alive. [singing] to tell [music] you that he dries every tear that falls. [music] So I come [singing] to tell you that he [music] saves to shout and to proclaim [music] that he's coming back for you. What can wash away my sin? [music] Oh, what [singing] can wash away my sin? Nothing. [music] [singing] Nothing. Oh, what can [singing] make [music] me whole again? Nothing [music] but the blood. [singing] Nothing. Let's sing that again. What can wash away? Oh, [music] what can wash away [singing] my [music] sin? Nothing. [music] Nothing. [singing] What can [music] make me [singing] whole again? Nothing but the blood. [singing] Nothing [music] but the blood. There is a grave. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life. [music] But in three days [singing] [music] he breathed again and rose [singing] to [music] stand in my [singing] defense. So [singing and music] I come to tell you he's alive. [singing] to tell you that he [music] dries every tear that falls. [music] Oh, so I come to tell you that he saves [singing] to shout and to proclaim that he's coming.

Do you believe that this morning? Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen. God bless you friends. Let's bow our heads. Lord God Almighty, we thank you, Lord. Thank you for your spirit. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you for your love. Thank you for the blood that was shed on the cross, for our sins, Lord, that we might spend an eternity with our savior. Lord, we pray that your spirit would be present with us this morning. And Lord, as I open up these scriptures and as I read the word, may the same spirit that was there when it was originally spoken be with us this morning, we pray. Father, may each person that's here, if they would have something on their heart, something that they would need, I pray that they would receive it this morning. That all of us would leave this building better people. Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. First welcome to our visitors. I have uh brother Brian, Sister John Vanden Langenberg. Where are you? Welcome, brother, sister. Welcome. It's good to have you in service. is I think that you know a lot of people here probablyize [applause] for all the construction out out here and and ripping up all the concrete. You know, sometimes you have to rip things out. You have to tear something down to rebuild it in the right way. And it's the same with us. The Lord sometimes has to tear us down &gt;&gt; so he can rebuild us in the right way. We could we could take the sanctuary and we could just slap a coat of paint on the walls, but it's the same wall. It's just got some paint over it. It's the same wiring behind the wall. The problems are still there. But when you tear something down, when you really get rid of the old and replace it with, the Bible says the new man, &gt;&gt; then you have a change. Not just changing the outside, but Jesus goes in and he changes the inside of a person. That's what we've been talking about on this sermon on the mount. We'll continue that in a little bit, a little bit later on, but that's what the whole thing about Jesus Christ is. Before Christ, it was the outside. Jesus didn't do away with the law, but he fulfilled the law and he started to work on the inside of a person so that word could come out from the inside and manifest itself on the outside of us. I want to give a report, a short report on the trip that uh Daniel and Lily and I went to Louisville to do an outreach. I asked the church to pray and and we went I sent a video when we were there. We um it wasn't what we expected and uh if if you want to put the picture up of the place that we had. This is our um the location. We expected about 50 or 60 people. We got about what we expected and uh we had our service there in that room. We um my brother bought dinner for everybody and it uh as I said it turned out different. Thank you. It turned out different than what we expected. What we wanted was my brother talked to all of the it was a gym if you don't know if you're not familiar with it. So we started this boxing gym about six or seven years ago and we wanted to make it an outreach to the local community and it's done very well. We have a Bible study every week. Many of the uh fighters that have come in have made changes in their lives and and their families. So, what we wanted to do is take the next step. And the next step was to have a service and to open up the altar for those that may need something to come in to come down to the altar and give their hearts to the Lord. So, what we were planning on Adam got everything together. He got everything rented and he and he uh had it catered. He spent a lot of money putting all this together and a lot of prayer and a lot of work that he put into it. He asked me if I would minister. So, we brought uh Lily and Daniel out to do the music and my nephew Adam's son also helped with the music and we had it all ready. And what we were going to do is we were going to have good worship and then I was going to speak and I was going to open up the altar and all of these people that had not given their hearts to the Lord, they were going to come to the altar. They were going to give their hearts to the Lord. They were going to be crying and there was going to be big changes in all these people's lives. And we had it figured out and and we had it ready. everything we had. We told the Lord what we wanted and he reminded us that he's in charge and not us. &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted. That's what my brother wanted. And that's not the way it turned out. We went there and we got about the same amount of people as we were expecting, but they weren't the people we were expecting. It wasn't the sinners, the gang members, the inner city ones that showed up. They didn't show up. Very only two of them really came. But who did show up were a few of the leaders in the community. Two young pastors at a church who were just starting a church right down the road. They came. We didn't know. Um, a pastor that I knew of a fairly large church in Jeffersonville, he came, which I wasn't expecting him to come, and um there were uh a number of more of the leaders in the community that came. one uh brother came that he's he's kind of a pastor, but he has this big building and they actually bring in some of the the poor people and give them a place to stay for the night if they need a place to stay and give them food packages in that big beautiful beautiful building that they have. So they they showed up and the coach for the mixed martial art uh part of the gym, he showed up with with his fighters and they're already Christians. They're good men. The the leader is he lost his son last year. His 19 I believe he's 19 drowned and it just really really hit him hard. tore him apart and he doubled down and he said that that was one of the pivotal times in his life and he was just kind of riding the fence. He could have just went off into the world and done his thing or he could have just jumped in with both feet to serve Jesus Christ. He jumped in with both feet &gt;&gt; and tremendous testimony from him. We had him open up the service and I ministered on on some things and uh which I'll share in a moment. And uh some other ones that showed up is uh David Andes, you know, Daniel Andy's ministered here for a while. His brother, a friend of mine, we worked together when I was in Jeffersonville. He showed up and one of the pastors, one of the young pastors that had recently been, he'd really been in the saddle for like two weeks. He had just been elected pastor of his church. They don't have a church building. They're renting. And he showed up and and he had a jacket that said Andes Roofing on it. That is David Andes and and Daniel Andes's brother has this company. Well, he ended up he was he worked for that company and he had no idea what we were somebody just had invited him and it was the community. So he came he had no idea that we were close with Andy's family. So here he is and he meets David and David's like, \"Hey, that's my name and that's my brother.\" And he says, \"Oh.\" And then they they start talking. So it was it was really we could see that the Lord was with us. So, we didn't have this outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we wanted. But we have to be careful in not trying to put God in our own box and try to make him meet our expectations. Because I tell you, if we do that, it won't be as good. It won't be as farreaching if we get our needs met. And then it really becomes about self. I wanted just me, my flesh. I wanted to see these these young people coming together and coming to the altar. I wanted to see that. I wanted to see them from my sermon come up there and just be touched and fall down at the altar and just start praying and start worshiping. I'm going to talk. Take a time out here. Gotta lace up the cleats or I'll fall over. Um, that's what I wanted, but it isn't what God wanted. There was, by the grace of God, one young man came to the altar and gave his heart to the Lord. And that was, that was beautiful. But what we had, we had these two young pastors who had recently been elected. They have a church of about 100 people. They have no building. This other man is a leader in the community. He's got this big building that he does all of this uh humanitarian work from and nobody to occupy it and they never met each other and they were literally two blocks from each other. So they get to get well I talked to both of them and I said hey I want to introduce you to him. Pastor with no building and congregation meet brother with building or a pastor with congregation and no building meet brother with building and no congregation. And then they got together and this other man that I knew this other pastor is a fairly large church over across the river in Jeffersonville. He had the resources and he has the resources to help these people and to mentor these people. And afterwards I just felt for some reason I look and it and I I think we had beautiful music. The the um Lily and Daniel and Benjamin did a great job. And I ministered and my sermon didn't really didn't really do anything. And I'm I'm thinking, well Lord, what is going on? Why do I feel good when I went home? And I felt good because God used this to build a foundation for something that's coming. And so when I was talking with Adam, Adam was like, \"Man, I'm sorry that all these fighters didn't show up. I don't know why.\" I said, \"Adam, if they would have shown up and they would have done what we wanted and they would have fell down at the altar and they would have given their hearts to the Lord Jesus, where would you have sent them?\" They didn't have a place to go in that community where they lived. They're not going to drive an hour away or 45 minutes away. They needed a place right there. And what happened was we built that foundation. And now the Lord, I believe the Lord is going to use what happened. And it's going to be a much greater work than what we wanted to do, what we were expecting. God was in it. Can you imagine when the Apostle Paul when he went to the church at Ephesus? He went there, there weren't 60. Like in Louisville, there were 12. Can you imagine when he got there how he felt? It's like, wow, just 12 people. And he stayed there for three years and ministered to these people, building and building and building. And then he turns the church over to a young man. We all know his name. His name is Timothy. The church continues to grow. But way back when it was 12 people, Paul saw that there is potential there. He didn't just say, \"Oh, there's not enough people. I'm going to go to the next place.\" He didn't say, \"Oh, well, nobody fell down at the altar.\" You know, none of this. All he said was, \"Have you received the Holy Spirit since you've believed?\" They're like, \"Whoa, we don't know that there is a Holy Spirit.\" and he tells him how to be baptized. And then it started to grow and grow. And then here comes Timothy. And Timothy takes over and continues it to grow. And then another man came there in the in the last years of his life. One of the greatest people that we have ever seen in this Bible. His name is John, the beloved disciple of Jesus. He ministers at Ephesus. And he continues to grow to where Ephesus was, if it wasn't the biggest, it was one of the most important and biggest hubs of Christianity in that whole area was Ephesus. Started with just a little group. And I look at what happened with our trip. It was not what I wanted, but thank God it wasn't what I wanted. They would have came to the altar. They would have done what we want, what we, our measure of a success is. And then they would have just gone right back and it would have worn off and they would have been the same people that they were before. But now we have these men who are invested in that neighborhood, in that area that have a burden. All of them are doing outre outreach work and helping out. They're doing everything that they can. They have a burden. I jump in. I'm going to leave. Adam has a burden. And Adam is working now with those men and they're putting they're helping get this thing together. Now, those pastors are going to start teaching the Bible study. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's going to it's just Thank God. Thank God &gt;&gt; that he didn't do what I wanted him to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [applause] I spoke on and we ministry is is such an important thing and if you really have a burden from for the people it's not your ministry that matters. My friend Steven Bryant sent me this quote this morning from Charles Spurgeon. He said, 'If sinners be damned, at least let them leap to hell over our dead bodies. And if they perish, let them perish with our arms wrapped around about their knees, imploring them to stay. If hell must be filled, let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions, and let not one go unwarned and unpaid for. &gt;&gt; That's how it should be. You're going to go to hell over my dead body is how we should be saying it with everyone that's around us. With our children, with our friends, I stand for Christ. And brother or sister, if you're going to go to hell, if you're going to choose to go to hell, I'm going to do everything I can to keep you from that place. And that was what Jesus Christ did. He came here. He gave his life. He went to the cross so we wouldn't go to hell. He was spit on. A crown of thorns was pressed into his scalp. He was laughed at. He was stripped naked and hung up on a cross dying for all of us so that we would not go to hell. &gt;&gt; And if we have his same spirit, we should have the same motives as Jesus had. &gt;&gt; I told a story. I was the night before um the outreach meetings. I woke up at uh like 4:30 in the morning and there was a time difference. So, it was like 1:30 here. And for some reason, I feel like the Lord laid an experience that I had a a couple weeks ago on my heart. Very common experience that all of us have have been in. I was driving and I came to a red light. There was a truck, a pickup truck in front of me and I I was behind the pickup truck and the it was a nice pickup. It was a a man about my age. He had a beard about like mine. He uh the you could tell he was well off. You could tell he was conservative. And I was just I when I pulled up, you know, you can sometimes see him in the in the the mirror, the side mirror. I could see his face in there. and I pull up behind him and the light turns green and he doesn't go. He's distracted with something. So, I'm like, \"Okay, how do I handle this?\" I obvious can tell right now I like this guy. Um, what do I do? Do I give him a little do I just not do anything or do I give him a little tap or do I do like so many people do and lay on the horn go stupid, you know? And so I have this quandry. Not that I would ever do that, the latter. Um, but I'm I'm I'm sitting there, the lights green and I just give him a little tap and he looks up. Oh, sorry. And he he goes, \"The Lord brought this back to my mind in the middle of the night and I actually woke up and I was preaching on it and this man that was in front of me, I feel like he represents so many so-called Christians today where the light is green and they're sitting at a green light and they're not going. They're just sitting there and they're causing the people behind them to get backed up and sometimes it takes a little tap. Sometimes it takes something a little bit more. But the point of it is move. The lights green. Go. And with these folks in in the the Louisville outreach, I told them, I said, \"The lights green. You leaders in the church, hit the gas, start doing something. Don't just sit there and look around and daydream. Go. And that's the way a Christian should be. We should always have that thought. I'm not just going to sit at the at the green light. I'm going to go. I'm going to do something. Jesus, when he came, the first the first record we have of him besides when he was about 12 years old, he came he came to John the Baptist. He gets baptized. He's John says, \"I should you should be baptizing me.\" And Jesus is like, \"Well, yeah, that's true, but it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.\" He's like, \"John, you and me. We need to fulfill this.\" John baptizes him. He comes out. He goes into the wilderness. He's tempted in the wilderness for 40 days. All the temptations that you and I feel, Jesus felt those. He was a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. He knows how it is to have a desire that you shouldn't have. Jesus knows how it is. He overcame it. Then he comes out of the wilderness and he starts preaching, \"Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" And then he gets his disciples and he brings them to this place on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, a hill there. And he starts to preach his first recorded sermon. And I believe it is the greatest sermon that has ever been preached in the history of mankind. And that is this sermon on the mount. He starts out with the biatitudes. We've gone through those those blessings. And then he gets into and we're in Matthew chapter 25. He gets into he says, \"You have heard it was said of old time, thou shalt not kill.\" He starts in the ten commandments into the law. He says, \"I didn't come here to do away with the law. I came here to fulfill the law.\" And he says, \"You've heard it said of old time, thou shalt not kill. And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of judgment.\" The sixth commandment. But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. Jesus is starting to work on the inside. The law was working on the outside. You have heard it said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery. Seventh commandment. But I say unto you that whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. And Jesus talks about divorce, which we went over a couple weeks ago. And now Jesus is going to reference the eighth commandment. We know it as thou shalt not bear false witness and other state statements in the Torah about lying. We go to read. Let's start in Matthew 5:33. And let's get into our scriptures. It says this. Matthew chapter 5 verse 33. Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, thou shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine knows. But I say unto you, swear not at all. Neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his foottool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. Well, the sisters do today. I'm just kidding. But we can't. You have to dye it. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou cannot cannot make one hair white or black. But let your comm communication be yay yay nay nay. For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. Now, it seems like these first couple script scriptures I read, it seems like they're about swearing an oath. And James, one of Jesus's disciples, his halfb brother, um, is probably quoting Jesus in his epistle when he writes this. James 5:12 says, \"But above all all, my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or with any or after any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, lest you fall into judgment.\" Same as what Jesus said on the sermon on the mount. So James was probably and you'll see many of the disciples will quote Jesus in their in their ministries. So many people read these scriptures in James and in Matthew and they come up with the tradition that we are not supposed to swear an oath. Court of law. Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? So will help you God. I do. And then many Christians will say, well, we're not supposed to swear. We're not supposed to do that because James and Jesus said not to do it. So, I can't swear that oath. And friends, so often people look at the New Testament with an Old Testament mentality. Now, here's a rule. We're not allowed to do this. But remember, Jesus isn't working on the outside. Jesus is working on the inside. He wants a change of a heart of heart. And the point of this scripture, when you do that, you miss the whole point. When you say, \"Okay, well, I'm not allowed to do that.\" No, no, no. You're missing the whole thing. The whole the the meaning behind that is Jesus says is saying that you should always be honest. &gt;&gt; You should never have to swear. You should never have to ever promise or or say, you know, I swear on my mother's grave or whatever. You never do that because every word that you say should be the truth. &gt;&gt; Everything. And he's saying that if you have to swear, there's something that you're doing wrong before you have to swear. &gt;&gt; Verse number 33 again. Again, you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not forcewear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. So the Jews is what he's saying here. The Jews just by tradition, they would swear by something greater than themselves. And we do the same thing as God is my witness. I never said that. God is always your witness. He hears it all. &gt;&gt; You know, I sw I I swear to God, you hear sometimes say, why are you swearing to God? Why won't you just speak the truth all the time? &gt;&gt; I swear by, as I said before, I swear by my mother's grave. Again, they're trying to add more credibility to your words when you should just always be telling the truth anyways. So the Jews had too much respect to swear by God. So they would swear by something a little bit lower than God, but still something greater than themselves. So they would swear they would say, \"I swear by the temple or I swear by Jerusalem or I swear by heaven.\" And then saying these things was was something like saying I swear by something a little bit lower than God just to give me a little bit of wiggle room maybe in my statement. You see when you were kids you know I promise I didn't do that. That's not Jesus is saying don't do that. I'm not talking about opinions. I'm not talking about uh some people say, \"Well, I'm just too honest.\" No, what you're really saying is, \"I have no wisdom.\" And I say whatever comes into my mind. When people say, \"I'm just too honest.\" Honey, do I look fat in this dress? It's like, don't lie, but use wisdom in your answer. You don't have to give your opinion all the time. It's like, do I look fat in this dress? And did you see the Dodgers won the World Series last night? 11 innings. No, you say something like, you know, that's I've never liked that dress. That's not my favorite dress. I'd rather you wear something else, you know. But don't don't just lie because then that lie will propagate into something else. And you should it should be addressed maybe. So I'm I'm I'm gesting a little bit. But even something like that, something as simple as that, it can result in something bad if you lie about that. So what God said in the Old Testament was really that you shouldn't swear, but that you shouldn't do that you should do what you promised that you would do that you should do what you say. He's not saying don't swear. He's saying do what? Do what you promise to do. Do what you say. But I say unto you, verse number 34, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne. Remember the Jews would say, I swear by heaven. He's like, \"Don't do that. That's God's throne. It's still God, nor by the earth, for it is his foottool. Neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.\" You can't swear by these things. This is all God. So, you're really just you're just lying. Don't Don't do that. It doesn't add it should not add any credibility to your statement at all. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black, but let your communications be yay. Yay nay nay for whatsoever um whatsoever is more imp more than these cometh of evil. Big statement right there from our Lord Jesus. New International Version says all you need to say is simply yes or no. Anything beyond this comes from the evil one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said 56 times in the book of Matthew, I tell you the truth. You read verily, verily. That's all that we don't talk, we don't say verily, verily today, but we do say, I tell you the truth. And that's what he was saying. I tell you the truth. Like 50 times in the book of John, he says the same thing. I tell you the truth. The fact is that Jesus was the truth. And what I'm trying to get at is how important it is. The truth is John 14:6 Jesus said unto him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the father except through me.\" John chapter 4 says this, \"But the hour is coming, and now is Jesus speaking, when true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth. For the father is seeking such to worship him. God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. We talk about the spirit all the time. But do we talk about truth as much? It's both. We should never ever speak a lie or speak a halftruth or propagate a lie. Facebook started in 2004 and that kicked off modern social media. Have you ever shared a post, shared a Tik Tok video, shared a YouTube video, shared shared an email, shared whatever it is? Have you ever forwarded something like that? You put your name on that post. whatever it is, you're sending it out. You're sharing a news article that some whatever it might be that this celebrity is is heading up a um child trafficking scheme or something like that or Donald Trump's working with the Pope to create a new world order or something like that. You see that? You see it? You you forward it along. It's harmless, right? Well, I didn't write it. I just forwarded it. Here, read this. I don't know if it's true, but read us, man. Man, that's messed up, isn't it? Your name, both physically and spiritually. Your name is now tied forever to that thing that you just forwarded. Your posts on social media are forever recorded on on cyerspace. You can't if you delete them, they're still there. If you forward something now, you are tagged with that article. You are now part of that and you own it. If it's a lie, if it's an exaggeration of the truth, you are part of it. You forwarded it. It is now within you. It is now on you and it can't be deleted. And everything that we say too, there's God's recording angels. We have this in cyerspace in the natural world and we have God's recording angels recording everything that we say and tying it right back to our name. &gt;&gt; You hear something about someone, you repeat it. If it's a lie or whatever, now you are guilty of that lie. &gt;&gt; If it's an article about something, whatever it is, and you forward it, now you are part of that lie. Remember the last lesson? If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. Because it's better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go to hell. &gt;&gt; The stakes are very high. We think, \"Oh, it's just an article. I didn't write it, but you forwarded it. You sanctioned it.\" Well, I don't know if it's true, but and you still propagated it. I don't think we understand the seriousness of our words and everything that we do every single day. Jesus said, \"If you just hate a man, you're you are in danger of going to hell.\" There's a awful thing that happened. It's called the big lie. I'm going to read I um I wrote this from different articles and I want to read it to get it right, but uh the protocols of the elders of Zion. Could you put up that picture? It's one of the most evil publications ever printed. And I'll read I'll read what it is. Thank you. You can take it down. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fabricated text purporting purporting to detail a Jewish plot for global domination. Largely plagiarized from several earlier sources, it was first published in Imperial Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. It played a key part in popularizering popular popularizing belief in the international Jew in an international Jewish conspiracy. The text was exposed as fraudulent by a British newspaper in 1921 and by a German newspaper in 1924. So friends, if there is something that's wrong, I don't believe that we must keep quiet. I believe that we can stand up and say, \"No, this is wrong. But we don't want to take it an a step further into gossip. But beginning in 1933, versions of the work were assigned by some German teachers as if they were factual to be read by German school children throughout Nazi Germany. It remains widely available in numerous languages, in print, and on the internet, and continues to be presented by anti-semitic groups as a genuine document. It has been described as probably the most influential work of anti-semitism ever written. Although Nazi Germany perpetuated centuries old lies about the Jews, this time those lies would have their most devastating effect. Like never before, anti-semitism was manifested in a sweeping national policy. This is in Germany known as the final solution. which sought to eliminate Jews from the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; To accomplish this, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda, Joseph Gobles, launched a massive campaign to convince the German people that the Jews were their enemies. Having taken over the press, they spread lies about lies blaming Jews for all of Germany's problems, including the loss of World War I. One outrageous lie known as blood liel dating back to the Middle Ages claimed that Jews engaged in the ritual killings of Christian children and use their blood in unleavened bread eaten at Passover and a lie. Using the Jews as a scapegoat, Hitler and his followers orchestrated what they called the big lie. This theory states that no matter how big the lie is, people will believe it if you repeat it enough. Something as outlandish as those things that I just read, if you keep repeating it and repeating it, people will teach their children those things. People will start believing those things and they will present them as the truth. If you keep repeating it enough, no matter how big the lie, think on religion in these things, in this context, a burning in your bosom, say the Mormons, something that might seem scriptural. You're praying about about accepting this Mormon faith, and it might seem scriptural after you get this burning in your bosom, but it's not. But if you say it over and over, you think that it is the word because it's said so often. You think that it's in the Bible when it's not. Catholics, they constantly give homage to Mary. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, now and at the hour of our death. Over and over and over, they say it, and then it becomes scripture to them. becomes real. Oh, well that's that's what's the word says. It is not what the word says because you won't take the time to stand back and question how you believe and dig into the Bible and say is what I believe right? And it happens so often things that people think this is a fact. This is how God speaks. This is exactly what it is. And it's said over and over and over. And then they teach their children the same thing over and over and it just becomes real. This is just how I believe. This is just a fact. And when in fact that it is just a big lie and it has done nothing but pull us away from the Bible and Christ. The thing that I say a lot, it's always Christ. Plus, anytime you add something in there that diverts your mind, diverts your eyes from Jesus Christ and his word, which points to him. Every every word in the Bible, as we were talking the other day, points to Jesus Christ. And if anything comes in and points you to something else, question it. One of the stipulations for the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was that the Palestinians stop teaching their children that it's an honor and morally correct to kill Jews. Teaching their children. The big lie. Oh, it's good. They're not real people. They're evil people. And it's said over and over enough to where they believe it. And it's normal when we raise our children up with rhetoric. How can we expect them expect them not to believe it? And then they will teach their children and their children and their children. And I go back to the Mormon faith. It was all made up in the beginning. And then you have 10 million people or whatever it is believing this Book of Mormon that was a that wasn't even real. We should never just believe what we hear. Whether it's on the news or social media or something that we've grown up saying or something we always hear at church. Our words have meaning. friends. I was flipping through YouTube this morning and um looking for something that something else and I saw a recent video came up of a minister calling a man that I used to work for when I was in Jeffersonville calling him the Antichrist because his do his doctrines were wrong. I don't mind disagreeing with someone, but when you start raising it the to the level &gt;&gt; of saying that he's possessed by a demon or something like that, whoa, you've gone too far. Now you're getting back over here where they were in Nazi Germany or wherever it is, and you're propagating these lies. And then people are going on and I saw the comments on his on his uh YouTube page. And it it was like, \"Oh, brother, thank you for telling us the truth. Thank you for doing this. What do you What are we doing calling each other names like that? I don't care how much I disagree with a brother. We should never attack someone like that and calling them an awful name like that. That is horrible.\" And that propagates hatred among the people. And then it propagates a church that has a chip on its shoulder and that's willing to say bad things about other thing other things and willing to to share these videos. When you say things like that, you are outside the word of God. I mean, I believe it's in the book of Jude. The Bible says that even Michael the archangel did not bring bring a railing accusation against the devil. But he said, \"God rebuke you. Satan, even Michael the archangel didn't do it.\" And here we are saying bad things, saying these things and propagating these lies about other people. We are in direct violation of what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5 and all throughout his ministry and in what the disciples said. I disagree with a whole lot of things in the Catholic Church and what it stands for. But I would not lower myself to saying that even the pope is the antichrist before these conspiracy theories and you and your name is tied to each one. Friends, what what if the post is wrong? Now you've lied and have you repented of it. And it's so easy today to not repent. It's like, \"Oh, well that one wasn't wrong or or or that one was wrong. Well, I'll just forward the next one.\" And if it doesn't happen, you just go on to the next post. Jesus said, \"But let your communication be yay, yay, and nay nay. For whatsoever is more than that, more than these things comes from evil. There's a a man that prophesied that uh you probably heard of it that the rapture was going to happen on September 23rd and 24th. How many have heard that? Anybody see that? Oh, more than I thought. [sighs] after he predicted that rapture would happen on on September 23rd and 24th. I mean, they were on there. They were doing a live feed. They were expected to be taken up and everything was going to go blank and the rapture was going to happen. It didn't happen. So, then he goes and he changes his prophecy. Oh, well, maybe I got the numbers wrong. And he he sets another date. Three times this guy did that. And the last one of the last things that he said, I went on there and I saw some of the of the comments made on his YouTube page. This is the guy prophesied September 23rd, prophesied whatever it was in October, prophesied another. It didn't happen every time. Here's some of the comments. I'm a Nigerian. I got my own confirmation in December 2024 before you came out. Nothing can change my mind. The man's name is Joshua. I love you, brother Joshua. Failed. A failed prophecy, but I'm going to dig in. I believe you, Joshua. Stand strong. We understand you, brother. Jesus is coming. Sounds good. September 23rd, 24th did not fail. But is the start of the rapture event that extends through the Feast of Tabernacles, which is over, by the way. The rapture time frame now being watched is for October 13th and 14th or shimini at past. It's believed that the current delay is because of the 21 because of a 21 day a 21-day war in heaven that occurs before the start of the rapture great tribulation. And he goes on for paragraphs to explain this. Digging in say I was not wrong. I'm I'm right. Just a comment. Another comment. When Jesus and his brothers were supposed to go to the Feast of Tabernacles together, Jesus decided not to go yet because he was waiting for his father's timing. Just because he didn't come on time doesn't mean that he's not coming. Keep your lamp keep your lamps trimmed with oil with oil. Again, making an excuse. Sometimes it's time to step back and say, you know what, I was wrong. But this stuff spreads around the world now with social media. Brother Joshua, I see the spirit of God rest upon you because of this scripture, 1 Peter 4. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit the spirit of glory and God rests upon you. All the insulting that's going on now is only because you stand with our Lord Jesus Christ. Take your reward for great great is your reward in heaven. We love you, brother. I understand you don't want to condemn the man, but he got up there and told the world that this was going to happen. Another one. I was asking God for weeks for confirmation about a rapture that you said. He gave me one, but I wasn't satisi satisfied. So I gave then he gave me another confirmation. Then yesterday while I was taking a nap, he brought he brought my spirit to an open field. And then when I looked up in the sky, it was perfectly blue. No clouds except the numbers that were written in the blue sky. 23 23 23. And they was and the way it was written is like God using a a board pen, but it was a cloud. I was shocked. When I woke up, I felt so heavy because people out there are sleeping and numb. of supporting a false prophecy. And these people are saying that I was right when I believed it and I passed it on to everybody else and now I'm just going to dig in and say that I'm right. social media. When you forward one of these posts, your name is written right on there forever. When you post something, it is you that's saying it. Let your yay be yay and your nay be nay. It's not okay, friends. It is not all right to post something wrong or say something wrong and just go on to the next thing. Jesus is saying that here. He's saying everything that you should that you say should be truthful. I don't have time to go through these, but let me just read some scriptures. Just sit back and listen to these Old Testament and New Testament. Zechariah 8 says this, \"These are the things [snorts] that you are to do. Speak the truth to each other and render true and sound judgment in your courts. Do not plot evil against each other and do not love to swear falsely. I hate this, declares the Lord.\" Psalm 15. Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who who speaks the truth from their heart, whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor and casts no slurs on others. Mark 7, the Lord Jesus, what comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that the evil thoughts come. Sexual immorality and theft and murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lwdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly. All these things come from the inside and defile a person. Colossians chapter 3, the Apostle Paul, you used to walk in these ways. He's talking about sinful life in the life that you once lived. But now you must also rid yourselves of all things as these anger and rage, malice, slander, filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed in the knowledge in the image of its creator. See how Jesus Jesus went after the inner man, not the outside. Proverbs chapter 8. To fear the Lord is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance. Evil behavior and perverse speech. Proverbs 11, a gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy person keeps a secret. Think about social media. Proverbs 2019, \"A gossip betrays a confidence, so avoid anyone who talks too much. James chapter 1. Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight reign on their tongues deceive themselves and their religion is worthless. They do not keep a tight reign in their tongues. They deceive themselves and their religion is worthless. Friends, think about it. Think about the the bar that that the Lord sets before us. And we think just I'm not against social media by any means. I think social media can be used for the Lord. I really do. But when we are just forwarding things along, what if they're wrong? What if it's false? Now you have lied to as many people as you sent it to and however many people they sent it to. The worship team can come. We have a friend. We have a saying, friends, that a man is only as as good as his word. We've heard that. Well, you're only as good as your word. I'll go a little further to say that a man is his word. That's how important our honesty is. We are what we say. John chapter 1 verse one says, \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.\" So God is his word. So we made in the image of God are also our word. How important is honesty in our lives? How important is telling the truth? &gt;&gt; I'll close with Matthew chapter 5:33. I'll read I'll read it again. Hopefully it's a with a little bit more understanding this time. Matthew chapter 5:33. Again, you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, neither by the earth, for it is God's foottool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou cut not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be let your communication be everything that you say. Let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these comes from evil. Jesus said these things. And do you see when we deviate, when we stray a little bit from the scriptures, do you see it can create a big lie. We see politicians do it all the time. The Russian dossier for Trump. They knew it was wrong in the beginning and they purposely spread it. Lies. And then we hear them so much and they become real. The things that we say, the things that you teach your children, the things that you say to each other, the little sayings that we have, go back and say, you know what, is that scriptural that I say these things, the religious words that we say? go back to this Bible and say, \"Is that what this Bible teaches or is it just that what I learned?\" He raises the bar high and he puts it upon the believer and says, \"You do these things. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.\" He's not saying, \"Get a saw and saw off your hand.\" He's saying, \"Get to the root of the matter. If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. He's not saying to spoon it out because you just look at the bad stuff with the other eye. He's saying get to the root of the matter. And here he's saying, don't swear by anything. You shouldn't need to swear. Yeah, if you have to go to court and you have to put your hand on the Bible, that's fine. But your word all the time, every day should never have a lie in it. Never. And Jesus warns us that anything more than the truth cometh of evil. Very the Lord Jesus. As I said before, when I read this sermon on the mount, it's why I like in my ministry, I believe the Lord's led me to just read the whole don't skip over. Don't take a verse here and over there and over there and try to put them into a sermon. Read it all in context. One of the things that when you read it in context, you can't just skip over part of it because maybe I'm not living up to it or maybe our church doesn't think that that's important. If it's important enough to put into the Bible, if it's important enough for Jesus's day, it's to say it's important enough for the man for us to believe. Amen. Amen. I speak Jesus, brother Tim. First verse. I just want to speak the name of Jesus. over every heart and every mouth. [singing] Cuz I know there is peace within your presence. I speak Jesus. Verse two. I just want to speak the name of Jesus [music] till every dark [singing] addiction starts to break. [music] Declaring there's hope [music] and there is freedom. I speak Jesus. [singing] Cuz your name is [music and singing] power. Your name is heing. [music] Your name is life. Break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I just want [singing] to speak the name of Jesus over [singing] fear and all anxiety. [music] To every soul held captive by depression, I speak [music and singing] Jesus is your name. Oh, your name is power. Your name is [singing] healing. [music] Your name is life. [music] Break every stronghold. [singing] Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. [music] Oh, shout Jesus from the mountains. Jesus [music] in the streets. Jesus in [singing] the darkness. Over [music] every enmy. Jesus for my [singing] family. I speak the holy name. Jesus. [music] Oh, shout Jesus from the [singing] mountains. Jesus in the streets. Jesus in the darkness over every enmy. Jesus for my family. [singing] I speak the holy name. Jesus. [music and singing] Sing it again. Shout Jesus. Oh, shout [music] Jesus from the mountains. Jesus in the streets. Jesus [music and singing] in the darkness over every enemy. Jesus for my family. I speak the [singing] holy name Jesus. Cuz your name is power. Cuz your name is power. Your name is healing. [music] Your name is life. Oh, break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. I just want to speak the name [singing] of Jesus over [singing] every heart and every mouth cuz I know there's [singing] peace within your presence. I speak Jesus &gt;&gt; again. I assume the Apostle James. The pastor of Jerusalem church was quoting the Lord Jesus when he said this. But above all, my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or with any other or with any other oath. But let your yes be yes and your no be no, lest you fall into judgment. As for us, the same friends, be honest. The Bible commands it. Love one another. Be honest with one another. Be careful. Don't take anything lightly. Even if it's a if it's a Tik Tok post or or it's a YouTube video, take it seriously because it says here, lest you fall into judgment. These are perilous times. As the Bible said, we should use caution in everything we do. Don't let a negative word about anyone anyone come out of your mouth. Be positive. It doesn't mean don't stand up against something that's wrong, but it does mean don't propagate anything that's questionable and don't call anyone names and insult anyone. Jesus said a few verses before, he said, \"Call no man Raqqa.\" It's calling a man a name. Calling him worthless. Should never do that, friends. As I said, serious times. Amen. I hope you feel good. [applause] I'll tell you what, if you really read Jesus's preaching, like I talked about the rubble out there, he reduces us to a pile of rubble, &gt;&gt; but then he rebuilds it. And boy, that rebuilding feels good, man. It feels good. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It feels so just He's good. He is good. He loves us. And I'm thankful that he gives us correction because we need it. I need it. You need it. &gt;&gt; And if we think that we don't need correction, then we really need correction. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Our Father, we thank you. We thank you, Lord, that this sermon was recorded, that we might read it. And Lord, it's hard, Father, it's hard to even move past one verse, just one sentence Jesus said. It's hard to just move past them because it's there's so much wisdom in everything that he said. Oh God, we thank you. Thank you for the correction that this word brings. And Lord, I want to do better. I want my yay to be yay and my nay to be nay. I want people to look at me and say that every word that that man says is true. Every word I want them to look at our congregation. Every word that that woman says is the truth. She never has to swear. He never has to swear. He never has to put his name his hand on the Bible. His words are true. And Lord, your words are true. &gt;&gt; And as you said, I am the truth. Oh God, we thank you for the truth. Now Lord, as we go, pray that your hand would be upon us. Lord, may we be strong in your spirit, living your word and Lord, getting better every day. Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of our failures. And Lord, we claim the blood of Jesus Christ over our sins. And we are grateful and we are a happy people that you've given us what you've given us in Jesus name. Amen. Have one more village. I pledge allegiance to the lamb. These Christians had one question. Renounce Jesus Christ and live or don't renounce him and die. Will you renounce him? Yes or no? And they said, \"No, I will not.\" And they gave their lives. How many people today, this very morning, if someone tells you, \"Renounce the Lord Jesus and walk away from this thing called Christianity [music] and you'll live and you'll prosper.\" How many people would want to do that versus how many people would say, \"You know what? I'll take my way with the Lord's despised few.\" How many people will take their way with Jesus Christ today? &gt;&gt; Today, it's not dying for him. That's easier, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Today, it's living &gt;&gt; for him. So, will you play? Would you pledge allegiance to the lamb this morning? Pledge allegiance. Give him your life. [applause] Give the lamb your life. Say, \"Lord, I pledge allegiance to you. I will walk in your spirit. I will be your servant. Lord, I give my life to you.\" Will you pledge allegiance to the lamb this morning, Brother? Verse one. I have heard how Christians [singing] long ago were brought before a trend [singing and music] stone. They were told that he would spare [singing] their lives if they would reounce [singing] the name of [music] Christ. But one by [singing] one they chose to die. the son of God. They [singing] would not deny. Like a great angelic choir sings, [music] I can almost [singing] hear their voicees ring. [music] &gt;&gt; Now sing it to him. I pledge alance to the lamb. With all [music and singing] my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce [singing] [music] to the land. &gt;&gt; Now the years Now the years have [singing] come and the [music] years have gone, but the cause of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost, to reject this world or embrace the cross. [music] And one by one, let us live our lives for the one [singing] who died to give us life. [singing] Till the trumpet sounds on that final day. [music] Oh, let us humbly stand [singing] and boldly say [music] it. &gt;&gt; I pledge [singing] alance [music] to the lamb. With all [singing] my strength, [music] with all I am, [singing] I will seek to honor his [singing and music] command. I pledge alce [singing] to the lamb to the lamb of God. To the [singing] lamb of God who bore my pain, [music and singing] who took my place, who wore my shame. [singing] I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge [music] alce to the lamb. Just our voices now on the chorus. I pledge alce to the lamb. With all [singing] my strength, with all [chant] I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge [singing] alce to the one more time all our voices I pledge alce to the lamb with all [singing] my strength with all I am [singing] I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce [singing] to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Boy, that felt good. Oh Lord, thank you. Oh boy, I want to do that every day. Lord, I pledge allegiance to you. I give my life to you. Tonight, we'll have um we will I'll probably answer a couple questions. One of the questions that uh has come in fairly often is about tithe, tithing, and offerings. I will um give a shorter answer on that and maybe a couple other ones. And uh if the Lord's willing, we'll have a shorter service tonight, maybe a little longer worship service and a little longer time for prayer. So, hope to see you tonight 5:00. Brothers and sisters, I love you very much. Jesus wanted a church that people would walk into and that they would give their hearts to him. Not necessarily because of their love for the Lord, but Jesus said because of their love for each other. And that's how that Jesus prayed John chapter 17 that people would accept him as the Messiah because they see a church that loves each other so much. Friends, I think we have it. I want to continue. Love one another. Pray for one another. Help one another. God bless you. You're dismissed. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Glory. [singing] Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is marching on. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, [singing] hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] His truth [music] is [singing] marching on. Mine eyes, mine eyes have seen [music] the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are storm. He has loosed the faithful lightning [music] of his terrible [singing] swift sword. His truth is marching [music] on. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. His [singing] truth is marching [music] on in the beauty of the liies. In the beauty of the liies, Christ was born across [music] the sea with the glory [singing] in his bosom that transfigures you and [music] me. As he died to make men holy, let us live [singing] to make [music] men free. While God is marching on. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] His truth is marching on. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Oh, yeah. His truth is [singing] marching. One more time. Glory, [music] hallelujah. Oh glory, [singing] glory, hallelujah. Oh glory, [singing] glory, hallelujah. Glory, [music] glory, hallelujah. His truth is marching [singing] on. His truth is marching on. [singing] His truth is marching [singing] on. His truth [music] is marching on. Give the glory.\n"}, {"id": "2024-08-05 - Faith In Action (Hebrews 11) Daniel Evans - Daniel Evans.txt", "text":

was up hunting and I saw this beautiful golden eagle flying they're just huge it seems like wherever you see an eagle there's always a crow or something pecking at it and it was flying along and and and that thing that it had a crow following it and that thing was dive bombing it and that eagle just kept on flying just ignored it just ignored the the little demon that kept on after him and after him and after him and then after a while he kept on and that Crow came to dive bomb him and he turned over on his back in mid-flight and stuck out those Claws and that Crow pulled away and he flew away and Eagle turned around and started flying along they're so beautiful let's let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 sister Lily if you could keep playing for a little bit Hebrews 11 let's start with chap uh verse number 32 and I'll read through the end of it says this Hebrews chap 11:32 and says and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised from life again to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of crew mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worth worth y they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which do easily beset us and and let us run the race let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was not that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father what faithful words you have given us thank you for this book of Hebrews and father we pray that that as this sermon progresses as this day progresses father that you would instill more of that Faith from those great Patriarchs that we read about father May that Faith be more and more in our hearts and in our souls that we may represent you better father increase our faith Lord today we pray in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior amen God bless you you can take your seats

something on my heart I've had it on my heart about six months now I believe the Lord's he continues to bless us he's just he's just so good I've had it on my heart um Stephanie was reading a book and she was so excited about it it was called the cross and the switchblade is anybody familiar with that book it's uh it's written by a man named David Wilkerson it's it's basically his story about how he started this organization called Teen Challenge and it's done just it's been a tremendous work it's done so much for uh for so many people and it's not just for teens it's for the whole spectrum of society um by the way way brother Aaron pointed out to me this morning speaking of of our young people that they're about to go back to school if you haven't already brothers and sisters pray for our youth amen and when you go back to school young brothers and young sisters be a light wherever you are be wherever you go bring that faith of Jesus Christ with you be encouraged and then you encourage others also sister Becky I just saw you back there God bless you it's good to see you um but uh so this is been on my heart this Teen Challenge and and thinking about the tremendous testimony of this man named David Wilkerson how he was led and and I can't give the story now it's so long and just so powerful but how he was led to these in inner city Youth and the drug addicts and and all of the the abusers and the Crim ridden gangs and all that and and just how the the Lord just paved his way provided not only provided an audience for him but provided the money that he needed to go out and and do the work and it's just it's been something that's just been on my heart to have a type of a Ministry that we can help people off the streets and I think we're in a good place in this this portion of Tucson that we can really use that so I've been praying about it and and just thinking about it for for quite a few months now now really I mean it's been a couple years now ever since I started coming to this Tucson Tabernacle um so sister um sister Zyra gave me a testimony the other day um we spoke on the phone and she said that she was at this thrift store just down the road here on um stone stone and Roger around there and she was in there and she was doing some shopping for or something and she started listening to the music that was being played in the store and she heard oh this is Christian music it just made her feel good so so she she uh she had uh someone on her heart a family member that really needs to get into some sort of program so she was talking to the people there and it turns out it's a it's a Christian thrift store and she wanted she asked do you have any programs that you know of that could be for this this um family member that needs it and they said yeah and and they told her about this program that they have so I was talking with sister Zyra and she um relayed this to me and I said you know what it's on my way home I'll stop by there so I was driving by and I had a hard day at work and and I was just really struggling with some things and I always like to drive by the church just makes me feel better so I just drove by and just just to look at the building and and see what the Lord's doing it just gives me Faith brothers and sisters just makes me feel good so I drove by and and looked at the church and then I remembered oh sister zyus said to to visit this this thrift shop so I go in there and uh I walk in and there's a bunch of people at the cash register and I immediately notice that um the m Christian music I thought okay this this feels good and it's just it's pretty bear and there isn't a whole lot of stuff in there so if I forget I I recommend this place if you have any donations that you want to make of of decent furniture or anything bring it to this thrift store I think they could really use it they're doing a good work so I was I was in there and I waited till everybody left and then the guy behind the counter um I walked up and I asked him I said uh uh a a friend of mine told me that you all have a um a program for substance abusers and I said uh and not just for kids for for adults I said uh do you have something like that and he looked at me and said not me I said not for me and I said well you know I on Tabernacle I'm the pastor of that church and it's like not for me and and he says he says yeah and he gave me a flyer oh I left it in my vehicle um he gave me a flyer and it was Teen Challenge and he says 'y yeah he says if if you someone needs help he says ' we'll help them and no we won't require any payment and I said well I would like to I would like for our church to help in this so I'm talking with him and as when he mentioned Teen Challenge this kind of squirly guy he was working there he he has one eye that goes this way and one ey that goes straight and he said he says I'm six months into the program doing good it's like oh wow good and he goes by and then somebody over here he says I'm I graduated I'm past a year he says he I'm serving the lord now he says I'm doing doing good I'm off I'm off all the drugs and I I said all right and then another guy over here he says he says I'm nine months in and he says it's the best program in the in the world he says he says we're serving the lord we're doing this and what did this place does is it hires these people to help get them off the streets and give them a job to do and I was like Lord this is feeling really good do you have maybe some sort of a of a sign and just a little bit more you know you want a little bit more Gideon was like well yeah you know it's it's wet on this side and it's dry on this side but let's do it backwards just so I'm sure so that's how I was feeling and I said I said uh maybe just Lord maybe just a little bit more and and kind of the squirrly looking guy he comes he comes by and I said well I said kind of my history I said I was in um Louisville for about 17 years and I recently moved back to Tucson and the the the guy he says I was in Louisville and he said it right he said Louisville I say Louisville still the girls here from Jeffersonville they know so he said uh he says yeah I was in Louisville he says I was I was I was raised there and I said really what part of town were we on he said well I wasn't really in in Louisville he says I was I was from across a river from a little town wow I said What town he said Jeffersonville Indiana you ever hear that I said actually I'm not from Louisville either I'm from Jeffersonville I said I was there 17 years he said really he goes I'm a red devil he says he says I went to Jeff High I was like wow man thank you Lord this is this is still feeling good I said really I said I said uh you ever hear of uh brandom Tabernacle he goes oh yeah he goes brother brandom he goes Joseph Brandon voice of God Recordings he says oh yeah I was like wow wow yes so I started talking with him and he said oh he and he tells the the um the guy running the cash reg as we talked for a while and I said here's what I used to do and all that he goes he goes hey and he walks over the cash register he says uh you need to talk with this guy pointing to me he said you guys really need to talk so I got um he put me in touch with one of the directors for Teen Challenge here and uh we'll see we'll see we we don't want to get ahead of the Lord but we'll see how it moves and brother Arie maybe we might have something to direct some of these people that we witness to all the time that really need the Lord I know brother Arie has such a burden amen for the homeless people and the substance abusers so maybe we'll start moving that direction and we we'll start helping in that way it was just it it was just a a the Lord was with was with me there and I was telling this testimony and somebody tells me they said how do you have all these testimonies like wow you're you're always how do you have how does the lord always do this stuff in your life he said you know the Lord I feel like the Lord's not doing doing anything in my life he said I serve the Lord and I do all this and because I put myself in that situation exactly because I put myself where the Lord can use me I could have just drove right by the thrift store and I wouldn't have had that testimony to to give to the church but we need to put oursel in the Lord's way put oursel out so the Lord can use us and in doing that always be ready to give a witness always be ready to talk about the Lord and then he he can use you and we're about to read about these Heroes of Faith in in Hebrews chap 11 they were always available for God they always put themselves out there they they walked in God's path and they stopped at the thrift store they did itow when Matthew was there and Jesus Christ walked by he's there with changing the money he had this great career this man walked by he said I'm done with it I'm following him and if he would have stayed a tax collector we would never know his name but instead he wrote the first book in the New Testament I mean tremendous on because he got up and he did it he put himself out there so that God could use him and what I don't tell you all is the nine out of 10 times that I fail maybe 99 out of a 100 I don't tell you the story I embarrassed my wife I don't tell you the story when we were at an ice cream place in Jeffersonville and these people got out of church and these two old ladies were sitting at the table there in the in the in the ice cream area and I went down and I said so did you just get out of church the woman said yeah and I said uh what the what the preacher preach about uh I don't know it's like okay do you love the Lord um yeah okay um uh what's your favorite scripture in the Bible well and these two old old women um she said something I said I said have you given your heart to the Lord Jesus and and the old woman says you know what I believe a Christian is she said I believe a Christian is someone that would allow two women who just got out of Church to enjoy their ice cream without bothering them I don't tell you those stories but that's usually what happens we've got to put ourself out there and if you fail 99 times out of a 100 you succeeded one time and we want to succeed I got the brothers together last night and we went to visit a church literally across the street over here and I appreciate the brothers coming and and we went over there just to put out the right hand of Fellowship to this this little Spanish church and we went in there and uh it was people were so nice and there's a small group what was it maybe 30 people something like that it's all men all from young men all the way up to older men and uh they uh we we got our place and we all sat down and then the music started and it was terrible it was loud banging drums I was like oh man and I was struggling my head started hurting I couldn't understand anything that was saying because it was so loud and so turned up and the speakers were were cracking it was just it was it was just like I was like oh man I said Lord and I had to bow my head during the the the the pre-service during the worship service and say Lord I'm sorry I made a mistake for bringing these brothers over here with me I said Lord I'm sorry and and U I said I said Lord just just help us to get through and and and I made a mistake and and it continued on and then they uh you know when we clap at the end of the of the song I was clapping because it was over and then they uh they invited the the guest speaker and uh he came up and immediately I was in a bad mood I immediately didn't like him he came up and after about two minutes my thoughts completely changed brothers and sisters we always have to be careful about judging and just because that music didn't sound right right to me just because I didn't I couldn't hear the words just because it it gave me a headache and it made me nervous it doesn't mean that it's not right we're not changing our music to match that but it doesn't mean that ours is any better than theirs that's the way that they like to worship right so it's okay and when this brother started ministering he has uh he has a church in Monterey Mexico and he started his sermon with his with his testimony and I was telling sister Lily and Daniel earlier it is so important that all of us have a testimony that is what you can tell people that's what grabs their attention if you would have just opened up the Bible and started teaching it would not have been effective like this but he started with his testimony he said I was he says I started drinking at 10 years old he says my dad was an alcoholic my dad used to beat me and he said he would beat me so bad he said the only when he would finally stop is when I would wet my pants he said he beat me so bad he said I hated my dad got to be 15 years old he meets a 20-year-old girl she has a 5-year-old son this they get together she she she's um gets pregnant he's 15 he starts beating her just as he had learned and he's on drugs and he's drinking he's an alcoholic he's doing all of this stuff he's a thug you should have seen the pictures of him tattoo across his stomach I mean just someone that you would not you would be afraid to even walk into this building and there he is up there and he's got this he's got this girlfriend and the picture of him there and and they're just she's not living right she had a bad profession she was um like a a a model that you would see at a ball game and she's she's not looking good he's he's has his problems and then he he come he gets mad at her and he beats her she leaves and then she doesn't have anywhere to go she's on the streets she calls him back she calls him and she says I want to come home I don't have anywhere to go she said but I can't I can't come home and and H and have you beat me like this he made a change in his life a young man 15 years old he made a change in his life the Lord God of of hold of him wow the drugs and the alcohol let me tell you this guy was the perfect example of a loser on the streets substance abuser everything that he could have done wrong he did wrong but then God got a hold of him and he starts they have more children they have three boys and a girl the one of the boys is the adop he adopted the 5-year-old boy that his wife had and then they had one so he's only 10 years older than his oldest son and they're raising these children and he said I had to get over that with my dad and and he started quoting his dad his dad would be sitting there with a bottle in his hand and saying son never drink but he set a bad example how can you tell someone not to do something if you're doing it and yet this young man he the Lord is on his mind and he's he's he's moving forward in life and he's raising these children and he starts he gets gets a hold of the Lord he starts going to church he starts preaching the gospel and what a testimony I got to tell you I bowed my head so Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for thinking anything bad about this music forgive me and he's giving this testimony and he raises these children and he put up a picture they all had a wedding at the same time all three of his boys they all married very fine young ladies and his daughter she's she is too young to get married yet but she's she's serving the lord and he said these brothers are a witness he said my children have my boys my daughter have never drank they have never done drugs and they have never slept with someone had sex with someone before marriage prise God and the same thing for these young ladies that these boys married they met young and these girls have the same testimony as the boys that they married I looked at that I said Lord that man is a hero he is a great man he could be listed in in some of these people that I'm going to talk about today they get he has he starts this church and this church grows and grows and he starts a Ministry out to the homeless people and the substance abusers now he's helping countless people he's got five or 600 people in his church and they have this ministry through Monteray helping the substance abusers and getting them back on their feet praise the Lord for this man for what he's done that young man well he's not a young man he's 40 years old I was I was looking at him like Lord that is a hero of the Gospel right there and I was so proud to have been there what a testimony from this man Hebrews chapter 1 I mean 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear God requires Faith brothers and sisters we look at the things things now and they're here and God creates them but they came from nothing but he is God so when he speaks nothing becomes something that's with us in our in our lives this man right here nothing became something when God stepped into my life the man that we heard last night nothing became something when God stepped into his life by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh you know that story Genesis the beginning of Genesis Abel was born Cain was born twins Abel gave an offering to God that pleased God it was he killed a lamb he killed an animal knowing that his that something must die for life to be produced for life to continue Cain made a flowery altar it may have been much prettier much nicer but Abel's was accepted by God and Cain's was rejected because it wasn't right it was his self-righteous way that he said Lord you're going to do it my way because this looks better to me and then the anger welled up in Cain and he killed his brother and here comes God walking and he says where is your brother Cain he says his blood is crying out to me me from the ground think of the think of the faith that Abel had so much so that that when he was killed his blood poured out on the ground and even his blood was so full of faith that it cried out to God that's Faith how wonderful that we know that when we die whether you're I know people argue should be cremated should you be buried you whatever this listen wherever you are if you're an ash blowing in the wind it's going to cry out to God and God will answer Cain's own blood I mean Abel's own blood crying out to God and God heard you remember the story of Elisha when Elisha got sick and died and they put him in the Tomb and then there was there were there was a funeral possession coming by and I believe it was the moabites the Raiders they came down and they were going to rob this funeral possession they take the body and kick throw the body in the they threw the body in the grave and they took off well that grave just happened to be Elisha's grave the prophet that dead body of that that dead man that had died fell upon the body or even the grave we don't even know if the body was in there it fell in the grave of Elisha and that faith that was in Elisha that spirit that was in Elisha was so great that that body jumped up again came back to life that's how important this faith is and when we have that faith that is in us that we are Eternal there's nothing can ever take us take life from us if our blood is spread out on the ground it will cry out to God Beautiful by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God am how many want that testimony Lord when I die when I pass from this Earth let me have the same testimony that Enoch had I don't Enoch said we we don't know much about Enoch it's only a couple lines in the Bible but we do know that he something was so great about this man his faith was so great He's listed here that God just raptured him took him up and that same faith that was in Enoch has to be the same faith that will come at the Rapture it has to be the same can you imagine living a life that pleased God so much that he says this is my bride all right sweetheart let's go and he takes us up just like he took Enoch just like he took Elijah but is but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is must believe that there is a God and he and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him think about everybody says oh I know there's a God do you really do we really know that there is a God then how come we don't have faith if he's God then he knows what's going on in my life if he's God then he knows my problems if he's God then he knows how he to get me out of him if he's God he knows how to save me if he's God he knows how to save my children my grandchildren but we have to believe that there really is a God and I think so much do we we say it we give it Lip lip service but do we really believe that there is a God if we really believe that there's a God then we should have faith in him that he can do it not faith in ourselves we always want to have faith in ourselves that's not it you have faith that he is God and that he is able by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet as not seen as yet moved with fear here prepared an ark for the arc to the saving of his house by the which he com he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive an for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went if you read in the Bible God just calls Abraham out he says he says leave so Abraham gets his family and they just they leave he didn't tell him where he was going he just said come out so Abraham by faith just starts walking he probably walked hundreds of miles trust in God every step of the way knowing that God is there knowing that God had spoken to him we want it right now but Abraham reason that he is used as an example throughout the Bible is because he had such Faith by faith he soldiered in a Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen through faith also Sarah her self-re receiving strength to conceive seed and was delivered of child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised we are so hard on Sarah you know oh Sarah laughed you know it it was it was Abraham's Faith oh Sarah did this and you know she had Abraham go and and sleep with her concubine and then and then they had this child and then she kicks them out and and and she gets mad and all this the Bible sets Sarah as an example to us right here in Hebrews 11: 11 Sarah was a great woman and a leader she was tremendous because she had Faith she had faith in her husband's testimony that he had been with God right what a precious sister therefore sprang there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude ude and as the sand which is in the which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth they saw these things far off they knew they had promises Abraham had a promise you are going to be a father of many nations he said look up see all the Stars can you number them start counting them Abraham it's like one two three I lost my place all right try it again one two I lost my place there's Millions up there and God said look up Abraham that's how your seed's going to be but I don't have any children but that's how your seed's going to be and he held to that promise walking around doing everything that he could and yet making mistakes plenty of them but he had that the all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on Earth they saw as I said they saw these these promises a far off I remember I was hunting a few years ago and it was hot we were out for the morning hunt and we were coming back down in the catalinas and I looked brother John and I saw my truck and it was way out there like uncomfortably far I looked and I'm on the side of this mountain and there's this little white dot out there and it's my binoculars yeah that's I think that's my truck so start walking but I kept it in sight and it wasn't a straight journey I had to go down the valley and up the mountain and and down through the through the thickets and the bushes and I'd get up high and it would be a little bit closer and then I'd go down and and fight through the sticker bushes and everything and hot and tired and I'd get up to another Ridge and it was a little closer and that's how these these these tremendous people in this book they saw it a far off and they were willing to go get it they were willing to put their lives on the line they were willing to have faith in this because they knew I knew my truck was there I just had to get there for they that that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a a better country that is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city not ashamed God's not ashamed to be called our God we're ashamed of him it's sad but how many people are ashamed of God how many people won't stand up and say I'm a Christian I don't act like that I don't make fun of God I Revere prayer I Revere God and maybe I don't fit in but you know what I'll Stand with the man that died on that cross more than I will stand with the pressures that the world puts on me as I said God's not ashamed of us I believe he's proud of us I believe he loves us and we should be proud of him we should always be singing his glory we should always be talking about him never be ashamed of the Lord never be ashamed of this Bible it's everything always be willing to quote it always be willing to tell your testimony as I said we all need to have a testimony by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac thy she seed Shall be Called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he had received received him in a figure this boy Isaac was promised to Abraham remember the stars of the sky and Abraham still was without child so so he had a baby with his concubine Sarah maybe doubted Abraham didn't really know what to do so they did this and and and Abraham's like well maybe maybe this ishmail maybe this other son Maybe that's the seed that are raised up and God said no it's going to be another one and then this young this boy is born and he and he he raises him and Isaac was not a 10-year-old or 12-year-old or seven-year-old boy like you see when Abraham brought him up to mount Mariah to sacrifice him he was like 2530 years old his beloved Son now look at my son Daniel thinking about think about taking him up knowing good and well and here he goes going up the mountain God had told him to sacrifice this boy that I gave you that didn't yet have children and take him up lay him on the altar build an altar kill him and burn it and that's what I want can you imagine so he's walking up there and here's his son going and he's like hey Dad uh yeah we have the bundle of sticks and there's no sacrifice where's the lamb where's the RAM and he says says son God will provide a sacrifice you go up there he lays his son on the altar the young man lays down he takes the knife to kill his son according to God's promise God says it's enough Abraham I know you I know you love me I know you believe me and there they looked and in this desert place there's a Ram stuck in the tree they go get that and that becomes the burnt offering that's what he's saying here he's saying that he was he was going to give up his son but whose spirit is that in in Abraham think about someone else who gave up his son and this son was greater than Isaac probably the same age 33 years old but this one really happened nailed him to a cross imagine how proud the father was of his son Jesus Christ never sinned never did a thing wrong and yet put him on the cross for everybody to laugh at to strip naked spit on his face Abraham a beautiful type of God and his son by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph Joseph and worshiped leaning upon the top of his staff brothers and sisters he blessed his family bless your family bless your children you have to have a blessing to give a blessing make sure you are right with God and lay your blessings upon your family you can do it says in the book you have every right to bless your family not only your children but your grandchildren so there's Jacob you know the story about Jacob how he how he wrestled with the angel so he's going he has his twin brother Esau and he had left and he had stolen the birth Birthright Esau was not happy with him bad deal Esau is a great warrior Jacob wasn't so Jac is like man what do I do so he sends his servants out he's got to meet he's got to come back home so he's going to meet his brother he's worried his brother is gonna kill everybody take everything away so Jacob goes before the Lord and a man comes that night an angel of God the Bible says that Jacob wrestled with God and he wrestled with him all night you know you know how that was me neither but it happened he wrestled with his Angel so finally all night long then the Sun starts coming up and the Angel's like let me go the sun's coming up and he's like I'm not going to let you go until you bless me so then the angel did some sort of a move and struck Jacob in the hip caused him to be crippled for the rest of his life life Jacob says I'm still not letting go until you bless me so then the angel gives his Blessing to Jacob now we see Jacob limped the rest of his life and here he is he's got his children before him and he limps up and he leans on his staff because of that crippled hip and he lays his blessings upon his children each one of them all 12 of them and then after that his son Joseph brings his two sons to their grandpa Jacob and has him blessed them you know the story where he crosses his hands with Ephraim and Manasseh but he laid His blessings upon them so those blessings come down you think that your grandpa and his prayers brother Burgess you think you're not benefiting from those blessings that he's given you he has blessed you I want to bless my children the same way amen lay my blessings upon them brother helped me out the other day so much and I wanted to pay him and he wouldn't take any money and I was sitting in my study and I was like Lord this brother has has done so much what can I do for him he won't take any money now I'm not saying that if you owe somebody money I give you my blessing I'm enough you have to give you have to pay them but this brother he's sitting in the back wouldn't take anything so I said Lord I'm reading this chapter right here I said Lord if I have anything let me give my blessings upon him and may he be blessed for what he's done for me amen and that's how we can do brothers and sisters we have that we have that Authority we have that ability to lay that those Blessings by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's Commandments by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter this man Moses um amram and jabed they had this son they knew that he was special they were killing the babies at that time the the boy baby throwing them to the crocodiles out in the Nile River and here they build this little basket and they take their son and they had faith in God how many of us would have faith in ourselves in hiding our children more than faith in God they put them they they felt the leading they put him in the basket and put him out among the crocodiles and Out Among everything else and he floated right down to Pharaoh's daughter then she raised him as a king he had everything that he could ever want raised him as as rich and and and as whatever he had a desire to have he was given to him and then he looked and he says you know what he said I would rather be a Christian than to have all of the the world's money and everything else all of the women all of the popularity all of the influence all of the Tik Tok all of the Instagram all of that stuff I would rather have Jesus Christ and if I'm going to be on there I am going to lift up Jesus Christ and I'm going to influence people in that way he says I don't want to be with Pharaoh he became a slave by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season Moses his greatest desire was to serve God esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of reward the English Standard Version says for he kept his eyes on the future reward right he saw that truck out in the distance and he's focusing on that he wanted that future reward and not the Quick Fix he knew he had a promise Deuteronomy he had this promise he said the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me Moses speaking among you from your fellow Israelites then you must listen to him for this is what you asked of the Lord God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said let us not hear the voice of the Lord Our God nor see this great fire anymore or we will die the Lord said unto me Moses speaking talking to the people the Lord told me what they say is good I will raise up for them a prophet like you Moses from among their fellow Israelites and I will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything I command I myself will call to account anyone that does not listen to my words that he that this Prophet speaks in my name who was he talking about Jesus Christ amen he says he's going to be like you Moses except better by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is visible invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them faith is action Faith is doing something faith is not sitting there and saying Lord I just want you to I just want you to be first in my life I just want you to help me Faith is is something that you do Jesus said have faith it means have faith it doesn't mean just sit back stop by the thrift store witness to someone put yourself in God's service by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians aade to do were drowned by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by by faith Rahab the Harlot perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace so so Joshua goes over he attacks um Jericho big giant walls they walk they March around the city the walls fall down they go in and Rahab had protected the spies that we went that went in before because she had the Revelation that these brothers were right in what they were saying so she hid them didn't tell on them and then Joshua's destroying Army comes in kills everybody but Rahab and her family everyone in her house because Rahab had that Faith does it say if her brothers and sisters and Mom and Dad were Sinners or not doesn't say but because of her faith they were saved because of rahab's faith and then you know what happened she was a prostitute she made her living in a bad way right but then God turned that around through her faith in God and married her to one of the greatest Generals in Joshua's Army and gave her a Wonderful Life and then she had children and those children had children and then you know who sprang up from there King David from the from the union of Rahab and Salon and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of baric and of Samson of jeepa and of David and also Samuel and of the prophets and brothers and sisters I wish I had like all day long now I know what this brother's saying when he wrote this like we can keep going let's talk about all of these who through faith subdued Kingdom wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions I'm not and what more shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of baric and Samson and jeepa and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained the obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again the shunamite woman and Elisha the boy died Elisha came and laid his body upon the boy and he came back to life again same happen happened with his predecessor Elijah and the widow woman women received their dead to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover over bonds and imprisonment they were stoned believe it was Zechariah that was stoned the prophet and others they were son aunder Isaiah son in half they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute and Afflicted and tormented John the Baptist in the New Testament wandered about in his goat skin being destitute T tormented didn't have anything he ate Grasshoppers and honey that was his that was his diet but they took god seriously they put God's word first these were great people who put faith into action they actually did it they didn't just talk about it they didn't just teach it they did it couple minutes but they were brothers and sisters they were fallible normal people that had problems every single one of them they they weren't these great people on a pedestal that you might think here they they they did things wrong but it's okay Moses was a murderer he forgot to circumcise his son Abraham gave his wife to another man because he was afraid of being killed Sarah laughed at the promise of God Noah got drunk when he got off the ark planted a Vineyard made some wine got drunk Rahab was a prostitute they were average ordinary people just like you and me yes but they put God first they had faith and they changed the world and we can do that of whom the world is not worthy amen H that is so beautiful of whom the world was not one worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provide some better thing for us than these people a better thing for us that they without us should be made perfect better than the burning bush experienced with Moses better than than David killing Goliath better than the walls of Jericho coming down with Joshua better than the prostitute Rahab finding a Godly husband better than all of these things better than the blessings that Jacob gave to his sons better for us because they had not received the promise of Jesus Christ yet and we have our faith should be higher than theirs it should be we should be walking in faith saying Lord you've done all of these things I read in my Bible read read Hebrews 11 wherefore we wherefore seeing we are Al we also are encompassed about with so great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight Hebrews 121 let us lay aside every weight and the sin do easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us this cloud of witness that's all over the place it's in the Bible here all of these great men and women of God and we read it and it's everywhere we have no excuse we're surrounded by this now let us run the same race that they ran looking unto Jesus it's better than my truck out there a few miles away keeping your your eye on the cross looking at looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen amen brothers and sisters we live below yes our means we live below what we were called for we should be so much more now look at that brother that that spoke yesterday I look at him and I think what a man but he started right with his family he started with his family got everything in order with his family and then he started reaching out and he started helping other people but he started right at home he built this foundation and now he's helped hundreds or even thousands of people because he was led by faith to do these things we were Made for More We Were Made for More than we give we were made for more than we do every one of us every person in this building was made for more listen to this I know who I am because I know who you are I heard this song and brothers and sisters it's so beautiful the cross I know who I am cuz I know who you are speak speaking of Christ the cross of Salvation was only the start now I am chosen free and forgiven I have a future and it's worth the living cuz I wasn't made to be tending a grave I was called by name born and raised back to life again I was made for more so why would I make my bed make a bed in my shame when a Fountain of Grace is running my way think about those words why would I dwell in my negativity why would I dwell in all of these problems that I've created for myself don't lay in that grave that you made that I've made get up and get out of it make a change have faith in God know that it's not even your faith it's Christ's faith that comes into you so when these brothers were going when Abraham was wandering in the wilderness it was the faith of Jesus Christ that God had placed there it was faith in God it wasn't faith in Abraham he failed and failed and failed Moses failed and failed and failed but it was faith in God that God could do it cuz I wasn't made to be tending a grave I was called by name born and raised back to life again I was made for more so why would I make my make a bed in my shame when a Fountain of Grace is running my way I know I am yours and I was made for more oh Hallelujah you called out my name so I'll sing out your praise Hallelujah you buried my past and I'm not going back Hallelujah you called out my name so I'll sing your praise singing Hallelujah you buried my past I am not going back I wasn't made to be taking a grave I was called by name born and raised back to life again I Was Made for More come on sing it over yourself oh so why would I make a bed in my shame when a Fountain of Grace is running my way I know I am yours and I was made for more I Was Made for More I was not made to fail I was not made to just

in a portion where brother Brandon was talking about the law and what it took and then brother Daniel asked us to read chapter 15. and right at the beginning those who still wanted the law were trying to force the law back on the Believers so we'll read those verses then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are all which we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest had this daily ministering often offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away the sins this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost is also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days saith Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquity iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus so what a promise and he kept keeps his word amen for it reaches to the highest mountain and it flows to the lowest Valley wherever you are whatever state you are it will reach you there oh foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] always values [Music] it will never lose one more time sister hope if you'll be ready for Adventures to the highest mountain and it flows [Music] amen amen the Green family asked us to please say thank you to the church for all that they did and all that part did and watched and the cards have been sent and things they appreciated very much so we know how much that family means to us but we can in turn pay back some of that favor just so they wanted just to be sure that we thank the congregation [Music] tears will never stay on the streets of that City [Music] of pain or death on my mind teardrops [Music] drops aren't welcome [Music] memories [Music] on my mind [Music] teardrops aren't welcome beyond the gates hurry for the heart will never break it [Music] tearsity no reason [Music] gender [Music] teardrops aren't welcome behind the Gates [Music] me

bright nor could go straight through the sky to lose time oh love of God how rich [Music] I'll measure [Music] strong it shall forever foreign and then the words of that song As We Know there's the main verse of that it was found written on the walls of an insane Institution many years ago they don't know who the author is but they know that whoever that was was certainly inspired to write those words let's pray Lord God we thank you for another opportunity to come together to worship father to sing to to Father get into your word and understand it better I pray Lord that you'd be with us tonight father God my words is I read the words of this book of Acts I pray that The Same Spirit father same anointing that was on the author would be on here at the pulpit tonight the father that you anoint my words and anoint the ears of the year be with us Lord we pray we love you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can take your seats um again thanks to uh brother Aaron he mentioned that to thank you for the kindness from the Green family um what a nice it was a nice funeral it was uh I thought it was I thought it was interesting that uh sister green always said that she wanted to sing at her own funeral so as as it would have it they they played at the end of service they played a recording of Sister Green singing and I don't know if you noticed but there was a big picture window in the back of the funeral home where the service was and when sister green as soon as she finished singing this giant plane comes down over the Catalina mountains and and dumps this big red slurry fire up on top of the mountain and I thought what a perfect did anybody else see that wasn't that it wasn't that great it was it was and it was right at the end of her song and it came down and I just felt like the Lord turned the mountain red just representing the blood of Jesus Christ and how sister green me she may have gone and brother green may have gone and many of our loved ones may have gone but because of that red blood of Jesus Christ we have the opportunity to see them again one day that that just blessed me when I saw that come down I thought it was a fitting end um after the after the service we had a group pretty much the whole congregation I think that was there came over to the fellowship hall and we had a really nice time a fellowship and I am wild people were fellowshipping I am noticed some people coming in to the door here obviously everyone was out there in the fellowship hall and I noticed some people coming in to the door and I wondered okay what's going on in the sanctuary so I walked in and I saw some of the some of the kids and there was a lot of the family there and I think the the legalist part of me came out a little bit and and I told I told one of the the brothers that was there that was his kids I said I said hey I said I said don't let the kids um be running around the fellowship hall and I was I think I was a little bit I was a little bit too firm I was a little bit too sharp and if any of you know me I know some of the brothers know me that sometimes I can get that way a little bit where I'm just I'm too pointed and when when I did that I could feel that I offended the brother a little bit and uh he was very respectful and he he and his wife gathered up the kids and they they went out in the into the um Fellowship Hall and I wasn't kicking them out I just I wanted control in the sanctuary but like I said I think it came across too strongly and I could feel that I I grieved maybe grieved the spirit a little bit and I I may have offended the brother so and then if you know me you know that I can't think of anything when I've done that I can't think of anything until I want to make it right so finally I tracked him down I went looking for him actually I went outside I was trying to find him right after he left I walked out and I couldn't find him outside I couldn't find him inside I thought man I really messed this one out so but after 30 minutes or so I found it and I walked up to him and I said Hey brother I said I didn't mean to be so so sharp when I said that about the kids I said I just walked in and and um I saw the kids in the in the fellowship hall and I just wanted things to be I just want to keep this holy and quiet in here and he was he was visibly upset about it so we started talking and and I said brother just forgive me for the way that I came across so that's when I said hey why don't you gather up all of your kids all of these these young people and I said let's go upstairs and I'll show you our new room up there and let them play and enjoy themselves so I convinced him to come up and and we went up there and I tried to break the ice a little bit more and uh he said do you still have that Chapel up there Steve do you still do Sunday school up there I said yeah let's go let's go across the hallway so we left the family and the kids up in the upper room and then we walked across the hallway into the chapel and had a conversation with him and uh I said I said again brother I said I'm sorry about this I said I I sometimes I I get a little legalistic in in my life I said but I didn't mean it that way and he said he says you know he said it's okay and he was very very nice to me said it's okay he says he says you know he says I grew up my family grew up here my grandpa brother green was the pastor and and he said you know I just I just wanted the kids to see and I said brother I said I feel terrible and and we talked a little bit more and he said you know he said I have the table on my phone he said I listened to brother Branham a lot he said I love his message and he said but you know he says I think that sometimes what these these ministers teach what these pastors teach isn't what brother Branham taught and I said well brother I think now you're preaching my message and he says he says well he says he says it's true he says that they teach all of these different doctrines and he says I listen to these tapes and he says I don't see what they're teaching here and we had a really nice conversation so as always I think the Lord can take our failures and then he can turn them around and make it a blessing so it was really nice meeting him is very very nice brother it's Andrew is his name you probably all know him I didn't know him Andrew Green but a very very nice brother and just really impressed me impressed me in his knowledge of the word and of the scriptures he's very active in his church and if you were at the funeral wow can he sing amazing voice very very talented talented brother so we had this conversation and and as I was praying about it yesterday evening and this morning I got to thinking you know what this is exactly what I'm going to teach on on Wednesday night that's exactly what I'm going to teach on tonight is Acts chapter 15 and it's the same principles as what happened in the church yesterday with me and it's the same principles as what this brother was telling me that he was struggling with so let's turn to act let's start with Acts Chapter 14 verse 26 so so we can get an idea of what's going on here so this is Paul for those of of uh of you that uh Cynthia God bless you it's it's good to see you see your brother Joe it's good to see you Cynthia thanks thanks for coming what we're doing is we're teaching on the book of Acts we started weeks and weeks ago and and uh we we've gone through how the day at Pentecost how they received the Holy Spirit all the way up until now this Acts chapter 15 and what's happened is we see that Jesus died he rose up from the dead he promised that he was going to send his Spirit upon his disciples and he leaves he ascends up into heaven and he sends his holy spirit down to the disciples in what was called the day of Pentecost then they started doing the exact same thing that Jesus did when he was here so you look at the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John you see everything that Jesus did during that time now you see the book of Acts and the the disciples are now doing what Jesus did previously in the in the four gospels so that's what the book of Acts is it's basically Jesus A continuing continuation of Jesus's Ministry in now not in Jesus but in the disciples so the spirit of Jesus in the disciples there you have the book of Acts in short so now we're in chapter 15 where we're going to start in 14. So what had happened is they had just gone on their first missionary trip and they came back Paul and this man named Barnabas and then they sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled and when they were come they had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith unto the Gentiles and there they Abode long time with the disciples now right here we have two different groups of people for those just getting started in the book of Acts we have the Hebrews who for thousands of years have been considered God's people and we have this other group these new Believers that the Hebrews kind of shunned for all these years but now things are changing and God wants these Jews to start accepting these new believers and that's when we see the message starting to go to the Gentiles chapter 15. verse 1. so they had come back to Antioch and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so we have Paul and and Barnabas and the brothers they're going out and they're spreading the gospel they're doing Miracles they're doing doing all these things and they come back home come back to their home base in Antioch and then they see that while they were gone these people had come from Judea probably from Jerusalem they came and they started telling the people these new converts that unless you're circumcised which is from the law of Moses you can't be saved now you think well circumcision back then how important was that well let's turn to Genesis chapter 17 first circumcision was a covenant that God made between him and his prophet Abraham Genesis chapter 17 verse 10. now let me show you how important that this Covenant was this is my Covenant God speaking this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your Generations he that is born in the house or brought or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed so anyone that you even a slave or anyone a prosely anyone that you bring into the fold also has to be circumcised not only your children and ye shall circumcise let's see which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my Covenant powerful powerful statement that God gives to his prophet and this statement this Covenant between man and God went on for thousands of years so now these two brothers come down from Judea the church at Jerusalem probably they come down and they come down to this group of Greek speaking Jews and Gentiles all mixed together in Antioch and while Paul is gone they start preaching hey you're wrong here is what the prophet said you need to be circumcised according to this word now I want all of us to think where would you have been on the side of this argument before I read the next verse where would you have been where would I have been uh in this argument think about it would I stand with the prophet Abraham would I stand with the prophet Moses who brought these laws or this guy Paul where did he come from you know number one he was persecuting the Christians now all of a sudden he's he's this big guy and he's going out and he's preaching Jesus to all these people and and who is he to say that this isn't important very very put yourself in the spot where would you stand brother and where would I stand and this happens all the time this type of thing by the way before I get to the next verse how many times do you see someone come into a church there was a two brothers from Canada you probably know him um I know him fairly well they uh they came and they made their rounds in the United States did they come here they did okay their buddies of mine I know anyways for those of you you don't know what I'm talking about what they would do is they would come into a church and they would start heckling the women saying oh your your hair is your your skirts not long enough your heels are too high you're and they find everything that they could find wrong with the women and with the men and I sat across from these brothers discussing this and I was like brothers where are you getting all of this and they would go and they'd take one quote over here and one quote over here and they put it together and they'd make this Doctrine and then they would go from church to church heckling people and causing problems and just wanting basically to pull the people away from their Church many of us are familiar with these two brothers but there's also that Spirit isn't just in the extreme like those two brothers but that spirit is all over the place and we see that this is what happened in this church and these people these two brothers were probably very respected Brothers they obviously knew the word well and they came in and what they did is they caused trouble now remember Paul was going through do you remember the area he was going through from the previous galatia so if you look in the book of Galatians Paul addresses this I believe it's in Galatians chapter one and he calls them troublemakers referring to these brothers right here verse number two when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they were preaching circumcision exactly what is in the Bible given to Abraham preached by Moses one of the laws preaching these things there's no small dissension and disputation with them they determined now this is the group at Antioch they determined this caused a problem it's like well we need some answers here that Paul and bartimus and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question so it's like Paul and Barnabas we love you but we need an answer maybe from the ones that were so respected like maybe Peter maybe John these ones maybe James these ones that walked with Jesus Paul all right we'll go so we have to realize that when Paul was was telling these Brethren like no you don't have to be circumcised you don't have to you don't have to go through all of these laws and all of this stuff Paul was not preaching against the law Paul was not saying that the law is wrong if you look Beyond this chapter you see that Paul very much his whole life honored the Jewish principles and the Jewish traditions and the Jewish law he never varied from it we see later on that brother Lyle or I one of us will get to that Paul wanted to get back to Jerusalem to honor the feast day to be there so he can observe this this Feast this Jewish tradition that I guarantee you Paul still believed that was right but with these new converts he says no he says you don't have to do this so whose side would I have been on at this at this moment I mentioned the legalism nature sometimes that I have I think Brother Andy I think I know where I would have been in this specific place I think I may have been on the wrong side but thank God we have this word recorded here and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they cause great joy unto all the Brethren so they stopped in these these different spots and everyone rejoiced that they had so many conversions and so many baptism and the Lord was was doing so much and the church was growing and everyone was just rejoicing and then they came to Jerusalem and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders and they declared all things that God had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed very very important part of that scripture these are not the Pharisees like you think that crucified Jesus these are the Pharisees these are the ministers that had given their hearts to Jesus Christ these are the ones that have they were they were ministers before they saw that this man Christ this man Peter this man John this man James these brothers are right in their Doctrine this man Jesus fulfills the the Prophecies of this Messiah so these are real Believers Minister brethren and they said that it was needful to them it was needful to circumcise them these are the new believers and to command them to keep the law of Moses now of course these Pharisees believe in grace you can't believe in Jesus and not believe in grace you can't believe in Christ and not accept the sacrifice that Jesus made for us so these Pharisees knew but they were they were caught up in in their traditions and their way of thinking and the apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter and when there had been much disputing so they had all the brothers together maybe in the church now this is the church this is the First Christian Church in the whole world that they're at in Jerusalem thousands probably a people that were members of this church and when they had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and Brethren now remember Peter is a very respected man and brethren you know how that a good while ago God made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe now do you know what he was referring to you guys remember what was it what was the man's name Cornelius right so what happened in this he's referring to a couple chapters back I think it was Acts 10. he was referring to when this man Cornelius an angel comes and visits this this uh I believe he's a centurionist soldier Cornelius and tells him that this man Peter has the truth for him and to send people to go get Peter and to bring him back Peter was up on the housetop praying Peter sees a vision down comes all of these unclean animals that Peter would never eat as a Jew they were against the law to eat them you know what they are can anybody say I want any of them are what a pig a pig because it doesn't chew its cup it's cud but it has a cloven hoof you can eat it if it has a cloven hoof and choose its cut fish rabbits because it chews its cut and doesn't have a cloven hoof uh there's a bunch of them that you can't eat so all of these come down and Peter is hungry and the Lord tells him rise up Peter he says kill these animals and eat them and Peter's like not me because I'm a Jew I don't I don't need anything like that um I'm kosher and uh then the Lord tells him why have you made unclean what I have made clean so Peter it's like wow what then there's a knock at the door and there is this Gentile saying come to my Master's house and tell us about the Lord so Peter goes and he goes to the cornelius's house he preaches Jesus Christ they accept him and we see a conversion of a gentile right here so that's what he's referring to here when he says by my mouth the first one should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith amazing so he's saying that God filled these unclean they used to call them heathens these these people that didn't believe the message before they come in and those that have believed their whole lives and have lived the message and done their best and lived lived a life Worthy the Holy Spirit does the same thing to both of them you have somebody that knows nothing about the message then you have somebody that knows everything about the message and wow they received the same thing it's amazing he's saying that God is Not exclusive to any denomination or any group as long as there's Jesus Christ there now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear now remember there's a difference as I said right when we started this series I said that there's a difference between a disciple and an apostle an apostle would be one that sent out to spread the gospel a disciple is one that has received the gospel and now believes Jesus Christ so we are all disciples I'm a disciple you're a disciple all of us are Disciples of Christ let me read that again now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear so he's saying that these people have have accepted Christ but now you're saying that they have to live up to all these Commandments I'm not talking about just the ten there's like 600 more in Leviticus and and and exodus and Deuteronomy there there's all of these Commandments literally it's over 600. and they take these and then they twist them and they they they they fight over how they're supposed to be implemented and all this and you get this big conglomeration this big mess of a religion and all it is is about legalism it's washing dishes a certain way special diet sacrificing in a certain way special clothing with tassels woven in a certain way not eating as as we said catfish and pork and rabbits and and I don't want to get too too far into it but not having a television not watching movies I hear a certain length choose a certain size skirts a certain League Church three times a week all of these different these different um ordinances and he's saying here Peter's saying but you still sinned but you still have failed he's not saying that any of those things are wrong he's not saying that that Holiness is wrong by any means he's not saying that but he's saying but it was incomplete without the blood of Christ I think it's in the I think it's in uh I forgot where it was in Romans I think it is he says he talks about the grace of God and he says but then do I sin that Grace May abound he says God forbid I won't do that yet because when we see that Peter is saying that this failed and he says you weren't even able to live up to this he says your ancestors were your parents weren't your grandparents were all the way back to Adam you weren't able to live up to these to these ordinances and now you want to place it place this on these people and you want to make them live up to this when you couldn't do it talking about these men that came in there to galatia to Antioch and what good did it do you know what good and I I look at look at my life and I I think about and I still I still do my best to live a very legalistic life I do my best to toe the line you know and I know sometimes I don't talk like it but I haven't had a TV in decades you know I don't go to see movies I don't do I don't do any of those things but what good that's just me doing my best to serve the Lord that's me doing my best to live a holy life before the Lord works Grace is what God did for me works are what I do for him but I look back even at my life and the way that I live just in Daniel's a witness how we lived as just as close as I could as perfect as I could to all of these different doctrines and I think what where did I ever through my doctrines through my legalism where did I ever lead someone to Christ never and very seldom has it happened and here we see that very question instead of all of these things Peter here saying salvation can't be found in anything except Christ but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they and then all the multitude kept silent and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them what if this had been an intellectual gospel what if this would have just been someone who goes and they can just open the scriptures and explain it but the supernatural followed this ministry that's why I believe that we must have that Supernatural following our Ministries it needs to be there it shows that God is with us because there were miracles and there were new conversions and there were baptisms and the body was growing they received Paul and Barnabas with respect and after they had held their peace James answering said men and Brethren hearken unto me do you know who this James guy is is very very important this isn't you know you read in the gospels Peter James and John this isn't John's brother James he was killed earlier in the book of Acts this is Jesus's brother his not his real brother but Jesus's brother James his foster brother I guess we could call him James was also the pastor of the church at Jerusalem very important man but Andy I had a question for you so if James was the pastor of this church in Jerusalem he was the first pastor how could Catholicism say that Peter was the first one doesn't make sense it's a it's a flaw it's a fatal flaw saying that that this Peter was the first leader he wasn't yes he had the Keys of the Kingdom but this man James was the pastor of the church so these brothers they they weighed in on on the circumcision and the other things Paul and Peter weighed in their side now we see James and he weighs in and he had a lot of authority James says this James answered and said men and brother and hearken unto me Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name not for his name now Simeon in other words for Simeon is Simon Simon is actually Peter so he's quoting Peter but he's using Brother lilies Jewish name because it's directing it to a bunch of the the Jews the original Believers here and you know I just one thing it's one of the reasons I just I love I love this Bible so much I like to look at the past in the Bible the Bible it shows the purpose in a lot of these things even the language that was written in you see Matthew Mark and Luke and John and acts and Romans and first and second Corinthians all the way to Second Timothy it's written in the language of Greek not Hebrew if it was written to the Jews it would have been written in their language but it was written in a language and then the Romans and the Greeks they wouldn't have understood probably Hebrew but they spoke this language Greek so this Bible this new testament was mostly written in that language so that these new Believers would understand look at the focus look at look at the emphasis that's put on the new believers even in the very language that it was written in then if then we see the book of Hebrews and you can remember because it's named Hebrews that was written more to the Jewish people and that original language was Hebrew or Aramaic the that that language back to James back to James speaking and to disagree the words of the Prophet as it is written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up so he's referring back to the prophecy of a man named Amos a prophet that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things so he's quoting the prophets and he's saying that the prophets are not saying that they have to be converted to the Jewish message before they come to Christ he's saying that they have to be converted to Christ he's saying that there's not a step between between an a new a new person that may not know anything about Jesus and Jesus you don't have to go through Judaism brother Lyle you don't have to go through the Hebrew you don't have to go through all the laws you can just go straight to Christ there's a parable it just comes to mind there's a parable that these laborers are out in the field and they've been they've been working and they make a deal they one comes in the morning he makes a deal with with the owner of of the um the farm or whatever it was and it says I'll give you this much so they go out and work they work all day then he hires some right at noon time working half the day they come out they they go working and then right before quitting time he hires this other this other guy and then at the end he pays them all the same and he and they said well how come we worked all day and this guy gets the same pay as us and he says I gave you exactly what we agreed to and that's the same here is you don't have to go through all of these different roads to get to Christ like the Jews did you can just go straight to him so a new believer doesn't have to conform to all these things that comes later that new believer you can go straight to Christ and you're there you're already home run out of the park you made it now if you love God now you can start to implement these things in your life where am I at verse 17. I just read it I'll read it read it again that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the Lord who doeth all these things known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world God knows it all he knows what's going on he knows where you were born he knows where you're going to die he knows Genesis to Revelation he knows the beginning to the end now James says here now we see the authority that's in this man James were for my sentences my decision is this that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God he says James is saying don't trouble them don't don't trouble these new Believers with all all of these rules and and all these regulations and and all the way you eat and circumcision all that he says don't trouble them but he doesn't doesn't say us brother Paul he doesn't say that we have that that we the Jews and I'm not saying that we are but speaking back in the book of Acts he doesn't say that Paul should change he doesn't say that Peter should change he doesn't say that they should start living like the Gentiles do he says he's talking to them he's talking to the Gentiles now this is really neat but that we write unto them so he's going to write a letter and it's it's really this is really amazing because you get a letter inside of This Book of Acts so you know the Epistles that we have first and second Timothy and Titus and and uh first and second Corinthians all those we have an epistle inside the book of Acts and it says this but we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood so he's telling the new converts to stay away from eating things that were sacrificed to Idols in other places Paul Paul says hey don't worry about it but don't offend anyone but here James is saying that this is a really big deal to the Jewish Believers so do your best to stay away from those things and these new converts they may have been brought up by their families and with certain values that that may not have lined up now he's he's talking about things strangled and from the blood and and from um things sacrificed to Idols but then he says and stay away from fornication and some of these Greeks and these Gentiles may have been brought up that that oh it's okay to go out and run around before you're married but this was a very very important thing to tell all of the children not just the Jewish ones but all of them hey don't do this before you're married it'll cause all kinds of problems he says from things strangled again this was a pagan ritual these animals were sacrificed on Pagan altars and then they were sold for food and the same thing with the blood some of the cultures would eat blood or add blood to certain dishes and this was an offense to Jewish people so basically with the Jews everything had to be bled out before it was kosher before you could eat it so he's saying here that these things are especially offensive so don't do these things even though you might feel you might not feel condemned by it but those long time Believers that will offend them so now we have two ways going back here back and forth we see that that Paul is saying to those longtime Believers he said he's saying hey have some Grace have some patience with these people don't worry about it if they're not living up to all of these these things that that you set forth now don't you backslide he says but but respect them in the way they were raised and just don't do these certain things and then on the other side for the new Believers he's saying hey and you respect these long time Believers respect their thoughts respect how they act two there's a mutual respect in this letter written by James both sides I love that that's a Christian way you know we see so often we see the more rebellious say you can't tell me what to do we know I know that's that's not the point you know so so there's that sometimes that disrespect but then there's the disrespect of of the like our friends from Canada oh you're looking like this you see all this girl's dressed and you know all of that oh did you see this guy you know he's out there swimming in a pair of shorts you know you know and then going on that and Paul or James here is saying respect each other James continues on and he says for Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day so so he's saying hey Moses is still a prophet he's still being preached in the churches that shouldn't be forgotten he has a prophet after all don't forget what he said but then we've taken that and made as I said like 600 of all of these rituals and stuff that they didn't do anything they really didn't accomplish anything so they write this letter then it pleased then well that's what James said we should write a letter that says this then it pleased then pleased at the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surname barsabis and Silas Chief men among the brethren another masterful decision by James so maybe they wouldn't let's say by the end of you and me are Barnabas or Silas and or were Barnabas and Paul and we come back to the church and we're preaching the same thing that we were before they might not believe us but instead they sent two representatives from the church that people knew to go with them this man Judas of course not is cared as another man named Judas and Silas Chief men among the brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this manner the apostles and the elders and the Brethren sin greetings so here's the letter the apostles and the elders and the brother and sin greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Celestia for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so these Brethren came from this church and they said we're from the Tucson Tabernacle and our pastor says this and this and this or we come from the thing that would bug me so much is when the Brethren would come from Jeffersonville when I was back there they'd go all over the world and they say we're from Jeffersonville and here's how you should do things and and here's what brother Branham said and here's here's uh here's what brother Joseph's teaching and and all this let me tell you we can all speak for ourselves brother Branham there's 1200 tapes and they're really good if you want to know what brother Branham said listen to him you don't need me to interpret it to you it's he spoke good English spoke very understandable English if you want to hear what he said listen to him and the same goes from rep representing Brother Joseph or representing brother Biscoe or any of these other men of God let them speak for themselves they don't need us talking for them it causes problems and I've seen it so often these problems people come in they stir up the people and they'll come into a church cause all these problems the churches will split and I have all these problems because they're representing somebody else if you want to know what I'm saying listen to me go on tucsontabernacle.com I'm I'm there a couple times a week if you want to hear what brother Branham says listen to him don't take someone else's word for it because there's always an agenda there and that's why we see all of these problems that's why brother Brandon when he was preaching he said refer back to these tapes and if you'll listen to that quote he was talking about the Seven Seals if I remember right and these people are getting it mixed up and they're quoting me wrong and all just listen listen to what I say and that's why we see all these problems that's why it is so important if you want to believe William Branham listen to him as I said he spoke very clearly and that's what that brother said up upstairs he said I love listening to brother Branham it's because everybody changes it to match their own agenda I could talk about that brother Jordan all night long you know I just because I've seen so many problems the exact same thing that was happening here in the book of Acts they go and they represent someone and here is the letter that comes out and it says for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such Commandments we did not send these guys out as I said let the prophet speak for himself it's we have here in the Bible we have small small precious writings from the prophet and they're just they are golden to us we just cherish them so much and we read them and we study them and we come to church to learn more about them and the ministers they they study these things and they they they try to apply we try to apply them to our own lives but then we hear Brother Branham and we can hear him we can listen to a whole tape and and really understand what he is saying and if you want to believe him believe him you don't have to have me explain to you what he was meaning he did a very good job of it and as as brother said and I've said before I really don't believe brother Branham intended for us to have all of these different doctrines that go around the church and divide people I just I don't believe that he intended that I've listened to him since I was born and he's uh it's just a blessing every time it really it really is Sister Cynthia when I talk about brother Branham he was a man that that was here in the 40s and 50s and 60s he started a Ministry that really changed the world it was he started what's called charismatic Revival he uh he did absolutely incredible things one of the most the most gifted person that you could ever imagine he preached right here in this church he preached from this pulpit and what would happen is people would come in the prayer lines he would tell them exactly what was wrong with them if they were sick in fact many times he would say here's your address and tell tell the person their address he would say things that no one knew he was he would say this morning you went to the doctor's office and the doctor looked at you and he was wearing a blue vest and and something on his head and he's told you these things things that he absolutely could not know but the Holy Spirit was working through this man to increase the people's Faith so they could be healed and when I mentioned William Branham he he was he was very special he's the reason I'm converted he's the reason I'm a Christian today so he holds a big place in my heart verse number 25. it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord to send chosen men unto you this is our letter part this is the continuation of the letter chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth for it seems seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these Necessary Things that you abstain from Meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do well fairly well wow very simple very very simple he's saying stay away from idols and live clean not all of these rules and all these regulations and all of that he's saying just be a Christian so when they were dismissed they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation I'll bet they did and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them and after they had carried their space they were let go in peace from the Brethren unto the apostles I can finish notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still no no let me go back to that previous verse it says verse 32 verse 31 I'm sorry which when they had heard when they read this letter they rejoiced for the for the consolation so so they were happy about all this that that they didn't feel led to be circumcised even though there was a very strict rule yet the the letter came back no you don't have to do that no you don't have to do all of these all of these rules basically stay away from idols and live clean and then Silas decided to stay and the other brother went back Paul also in Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others also and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do now they had left Antioch for a little while and all kinds of problems came in with this these legalist Brothers came in and stirred everything up and caused all these problems so Paul's like hey we need to go back to all these churches that we visited and make sure they're doing okay make sure troublemakers hadn't gotten the middle of them too and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was marked remember this guy he was the one that left in the middle of a missionary trip before upset Paul but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them to pamphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God and he went through Syria and cilicia confirming the churches so we see that there was a contention the minute the um musicians can come make ready we see there was a contention between these two brethren and and they couldn't get it reconciled so they parted ways and I don't think we hear from Barnabas again the rest of the book of Acts is mainly about Paul but I want to I think the first part of Acts 16 also goes very well with 15. let me read the first three verses speaking of Paul then came he to Derby and to lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a Jewish a Jewish and believed but his father was a Greek which was well speaking of Timothy which was well reported of by the Brethren that were at lystra and Iconium him would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek so Timothy didn't think it was necessary to be circumcised or he would have already been circumcised but now he gets on the field and he's going to be witnessing and preaching to Jewish believers so he had to be circumcised because they wouldn't have accepted him so we see that's why Timothy Timothy now is on the scene and we see that he took on this circumcision for the ministry not necessarily because he felt a conviction but for the people that he was preaching to we together do you understand do you understand that there was a this letter was a mutual respect this letter was written to these new converts and it was like no you don't have to conform to all of these rules just don't live immorally and don't get caught up in these idols and don't drink the blood because it's going to offend really bad that's really bad don't do those things and then he speaks to the new converts and he says Hey respect these longtime believers respect what they do and respect the way that they live because Moses taught all of this stuff so we see a beautiful mutual respect in the book of Acts brother and if you want to come you understand do you love the book of Acts I love it I love it because I see especially in this book I see that this is what we struggle with so often in our churches well someone will come in or someone within the church and start pointing fingers both sides both sides will the liberal ones and the legalistic ones start pointing fingers at each other and it does nothing but cause problems what he's saying here is respect each other don't try to impose things that never worked in the first place because it it it doesn't work it wasn't written for that it was just written as a guiding principle to keep us on the path till we get to Christ amen let's all stand through the blood through the blood through the blood we can come to his presence through Jesus Christ [Music] all through [Music] Jesus Christ awaken down [Music] for the Paul if you if you come in close by the Paul I uh I asked a young Lydia

good it's good to see you and your family I um there's really nothing sweeter than a mother I asked sister Jessica to sing that song um because El Shai has a very special meaning it means it means the the breasted God the god that can nurse life into an infant into a helpless a helpless person and it's such a loving spirit that this El Shai has and as I said it's it's so applicable to Motherhood before we get started brothers and sisters I want to say that just over the past couple days that I've been contacted by a few people and and I'm just so proud I'm so proud of our congregation I'm so proud of the individuals that are going through all of us are going through something but to see character rise up above a trial is just it's such a blessing it's so encouraging to me and we should never ever say a a bad or a critical word about anyone either if it's if it's to their face or behind their back or even to your husband and wife if if you even a husband and a wife talking in private we should never even say a word about someone else even in our private Chambers it brothers and sisters it can do such harm point out when someone is speaking negative don't necessarily try to correct them but point out that Christ was Perfection and Christ is the one that we look to Jesus is the one that taught us not to say a a critical or a negative word ever he and he set the example he was spit upon they spread rumors about his mother that she had an affair with a heathen Roman soldier those rumors followed him for his whole life they accused him as he started in the ministry they accused Jesus of betraying the very Jehovah who was his father and yet he cried out to God for for to forgive those who spoke against him if we are not Christians if someone does us wrong and we are not a Christian then we have every right to fight back we have every right to speak evil of them if they speak evil of us we have every right to apply an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth if you do me wrong I can do you wrong if you are not a Christian but if you are a Christian if you truly believe in Jesus then you have no you forfeit those rights no matter what someone says about you you have no right to respond none that's what a Christian says twice yesterday brothers and sisters experience this one once someone who was hurt by someone by someone else that was offended by someone else and that someone else ended up coming to his rescue saving him from from a very difficult situation someone who was he was they were offended at and then yet this person later on comes and goes out of his way to take care of the person that was offended and then another time a brother felt condemned he he let his temper get to him and and he texted me and he asked me to pray for him and because he he he had said something wrong last week and he couldn't wait to get back to work to make it right on Monday and he said brother what do I do and he confessed these to me and I said brother said that just proves I said you're awesome I said what you just told me just proves that you are a Christian that there is that spirit that holy spirit inside of you that is is causes repentance and you're sorry and you want to make it right shows me there's something very special about that brother shows me that he has that Spirit of Christ we make mistakes and other people make mistakes in dealing with us us also but remember as a Christian we forfeit our rights no matter how bad someone treats us no matter what they do we are not permitted to do them evil harm speak against them in any way because we're a Christian Jesus said in Matthew chap 5:38 has been on my heart the past few weeks as you know you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile goeth him Twain give him that asketh thee give to him that ask asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it have been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy if you're for remember as I said if you're a Christian you forfeit that but I say Jesus speaking but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you persecute you that was Jesus Christ's first sermon we're talking about the Rapture and we're talking about the son of man Ministry and the resurrection of the Saints and the Heavenly City and the bride of Christ brothers and sisters none of us are going to see that unless we have that Foundation none of us will see those things unless we have the foundation which is of Christ and what Christ taught we can't expect that we're that we're entitled to something if someone says something behind our behind our backs or whatever it is if you are despitefully you used love that person if you're cursed behind your back if you're cursed to your face pray for that person Jesus commanded that it may s it may see seem simple but how many people really do it Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it do you think he was just talking to himself it wasn't he was talking to us I'm thankful for that one text I got yesterday I can see that it's doing something a church the ministering and and and and what we're doing here as a as a the Tucson Tabernacle it's having an effect at least on a few people bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans do so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that word perfect in Modern English means blameless brothers and sisters if we can't get the very basics of Christianity the very first sermon that Jesus preached how can we expect to see him when he returns let that sink in these things are basic Christian principles and he said so that you might be the children of your father if you do these things when God came to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 he changed Abram's name to Abraham he changed Sarah Sarah's name sarai's name to Sarah he gave Abra abam a covenant of circumcision and he promised Abraham that although he was 99 years old and his wife was 90 that they were going to have a child and Not only would they have a child Sarah and Abraham both would have this child but God would make nations from them nations from Abraham and Sarah it was a promise and when he came to Abraham to give him these promises when God came to Abraham to give him all of those promises that I said and even the Covenant of circumcision that was told that you were one of God's people when he gave that commandment he came in a certain name he announced himself as El Shai the god that can nurse love life into a child as a mother can nurse life into an infant Genesis chapter 17 verse1 says this and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God the original Hebrew word for that this particular scripture is El Shi walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations so this Same Spirit the same elai this loving spirit that came to Abraham Was the Same Spirit and when Jesus said come unto me all ye labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest there it is manifested itself later on and then you will be able to overcome if you really truly understand this El Shai then you'll be able to overcome when someone speaks evil of you when someone hates you when someone lies about you you'll speak positive things about that person and you'll get down on your knees and you'll cry out for Mercy for that person that's what else should I will will produce and the closest thing that I have ever seen to Eli This Love that Jesus had and this love that when God came to Abraham is the love of a mo mother to a child it's the closest thing to perfect love that I have ever seen when my daughter was born meline we took her home and Stephanie laid her on the bed and and Stephanie just started weeping she said she's so helpless she says I am completely responsible for this precious little baby I don't believe Brothers I don't believe that the love of a man even for our own child can compare to that love that a woman has when God separated man and a woman a woman had strength certain strengths and the man had certain strengths and he gave that love that El should die he gave that love to the woman it's something that she just has and me as a father I remember when when meline was born I mean I was just in love with her when Daniel was born the same thing the kid I was just like oh you know this this is he came out and and Stephanie was just so happy and here's the difference between a dad and a mom I picked him up and I turned him to the doctor and I said is he supposed to look that way he looks like Yoda except he's red I said are feet supposed to look like that Stephanie thought he was perfect my wife looked at that little boy and he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen when I was born my dad looked at me picked me up saying thing and he says is this chin supposed to be like that made my mom cry there's this there's a difference and that love of a mother is just so beautiful Susanna Wesley she was the youngest of 25 children how is that even possible my my sister she went to she had she was on her fifth child for for the sisters that have some children she was she was on her fifth child and and she thought she knew what was going on and and she went to the doctor and and the doctor said uh yes she said uh you're you're pregnant you're going to have a child and this will be your your fifth child um she saides and she said said well how many children are you planning on having she said three her husband Susanna Wesley's husband was Samuel Wesley and Susan Susanne Wesley's life was filled with hardships she and her husband had 19 children but nine of them died as infants two there was two sets of twins that died and then one of the babies died when the maid acally smothered it she was tasked so she was tasked with raising the remaining 10 children and it was under very very difficult circumstances when the children were young her husband who was a minister her husband left her after they had an argument and he was gone for over a year and she was left trying to provide for these children they were in a in a place that they and moved later on they moved and they started a church that he was he was placed in a church that hated their doctrines very a very liberal area and they were a conservative group and they they were under a very hostile environment so she didn't have the community she didn't have a husband that would take care of her and there she was watching over these kids when he was gone when her husband was gone she wrote him this letter she said a woman she said but I'm also the Mistress of a large family and though the superior charge of the souls contained it lies upon you yet your long absence I cannot but think but look upon every soul that you leave under my charge as a talent committed to me under a trust I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother and as a mistress wife I felt I ought to do more than I had yet done I resolved to begin with my own children in which I observed the following method I take such a proportion of time as I can spare every night to discourse with each Child Apart on Monday I talk with Molly on Tuesday with Hattie Wednesday with Nancy Thursday with Jackie Friday with Patty Saturday with Charles she took time with every child and even though Suzanne was doing everything that she could to feed the children she made this statement she said I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother I feel I ought to do more than I have yet done I resolved to begin with my own children and she felt that she wasn't doing enough as a Christian and look she was working her fingers to the bone no husband there no Community to help her and here she is with these 10 children doing everything that she can and you know what she says I haven't done enough she saysi can do more and instead as many people do they want to reach out to someone to outside maybe for their own benefit they want to start a Ministry over here or over there and they neglect the greatest need that's right under their nose and that's what Suzanne Wesley had she said that I'm going to start with my children and it changed the world her saying that in my opinion that was the greatest decision that she ever made was focusing right there on her family and she ended up it affected millions of people she took the time with every child to read them the Bible to pray with them she loved her children and she built that respect from the children for her and her husband finally returned to his family but he never provided he was never good husband he was a minister but he went to prison twice because of his financial issues all that time he was away from his family and when he was with his family he really wasn't a good dad to him 1 Corinthians 113 113 says this but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so in the order of the household it puts the man as the head of the woman and suanna Wesley honored this she gave her husband the preeminence in the family it didn't matter to her that her husband wasn't living up to his responsibilities she had a responsibility and the word said this it doesn't it is not a qualifier if someone else is living up to their responsibilities as a Christian as if you have to live up to yours you have to live up to your responsibility no matter how someone else treats you she lived up to that and in in that it says that Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman so Brothers as we are husbands to our wives loving our wives we should act like we would want Christ to act to us he wants to hear us we want to we want him to hear us we want to be able to speak to him we want him to answer we want to have that loving relationship with our lord and there we are say okay I want this but I'm not going to give it to my wife we should be that loving caring husband as Christ is to the Man 1 Peter chapter 3 says this likewise ye wives be in subjection verse one likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives amen while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear so a wife can win her husband to the Lord just by her behavior who's adoring let it not be outward adoring of plated hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of the meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this man in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned thems being Sub in subjection to their own husbands even as Sarah we just talked about Sarah and Abraham even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement Peter here is saying you're a daughter of this this woman that lived over a thousand years ago and you should you are her daughter so you can have that same faith if you follow these even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well you are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel that word weaker vessel is physical the man's bigger and stronger and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so if you're not treating your wife correctly if you're you're bickering and you're arguing then your prayers Brothers we're talking about husbands then your prayers won't even be heard by God we like to say the women we can we can say a lot of things that a a woman is disqualified as far as her prayers being heard but if the man's not treating his wife like he should brothers our prayers aren't hurt either family starts see how important a family Unity is that love one another it's not just it's not just not doing things it's not just giving up drinking or smoking or whatever it is we also have to work together as a family unit as parents so our very prayers will be heard and we understand we're too different people men and women Brothers you know when our wives say you don't understand me they're right we don't understand them they're hard to understand and it's we are hard for them to understand but we love each other and we work together for these things Susanna Wesley was a good mother and even though her husband had problems she didn't waver she didn't complain she didn't divorce him their house was burned down twice young boy John Wesley almost died in one of those fires she had to separate her family because they didn't have a house to live in she had to put the kids in different homes and to make things worth they were as I said they were hated in that area because they because of their political and their religious views Samuel was was like a trump supporter preaching in like Seattle wasn't popular it wouldn't be well received but with her husband not being a good provider the people around her hating her and their doctrines and whatever they they were doing she still she kept her testimony and even with all of his Seminary education John Wesley Charles they they went to these highlevel seminaries and even with their great education that they have John Wesley said I learned more about Christianity from my mother than from all the theologians in England she raed she raised two of the greatest men that have ever walked the Earth in Charles and John Wesley and it started a Revival that swept the whole world John Wesley rode a horse all over Europe preaching the gospel sometimes four times a day preaching sermons and the spirit that was on Wesley to teach the people then spread from John Wesley and went around the world an exposition of the seven Church ages says this since the fifth age had brought a great dissemination of the word through printing the sixth age was quick to take advantage of it the age was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of intellectual Men Who Loved God and served him missionaries abounded around the world and spread all over the world abounded and the word spread all over the world it was an age of Brotherly Love it was an age of the open door and this was the age that John and Charles Wesley started they spearheaded it and it started from a mother teaching them at home Suzanne Wesley changed the world and it was hard biographer for Suzanne Wesley wrote this although she never preached a sermon or published a book or founded a church she is known as as the mother of methodism why because two of her sons John Wesley and Charles Wesley as children consciously or unconsciously will applied the example and teachings and circumstances of their home life what they learned at home they applied in their life and millions came to Christ through the meth Methodist Church it was the age of the open door and how much did those individual prayers and bible studies how much did they have to do with that when our children brother and sisters when our children hear our words when they see how we handle situations when they see us lose our temper it makes them lose their temper when they see us complaining about around the supper table it makes them complain when they see us wanting to get our way it makes them want to get their way it create our weaknesses create weaknesses in our children or when they hear us praying in private or when they see us studying our Bibles or when they when we're talking around the Lord about the Lord around the supper table that creates strength in our children when they see us handle a situation that in a way that may be the harder way but it was the right way that builds a character in our children my mom I never heard my mom complain about anything in my life and I never heard her she say she was tired she died brothers and sisters she died a terrible suffering death I've never seen seen anybody suffer like my mother suffered for days and weeks and months but she always kept her testimony from the time I was born until the time she passed away that woman had a testimony and it never wavered and it had an effect on us her four children every morning I was always the first one up Mom would squeeze me fresh grapefruit juice and and she she always make me a bowl of oatmeal and she'd she'd take the oatmeal and she'd put the brown sugar and then a thing of butter on the top and she wouldn't mix it in but she just put it right there and then she'd give it to me and I just loved it I would eat around all the way and then I'd get to the Sweet buttery stuff in the middle right and that was the last couple bites I just loved the way that she did that and it was early morning it was like 5:00 Rock would' be up and we'd be talking about the Lord and and just she would ask me little questions what what do you think about this and and it was just it was a precious time and it built a character in me from my mom my brother Jeremy is serving the lord and voice of God Recordings he's a man of integrity and he's honest he's doing everything that he can everything knows how to to get the message out to this Dying World my brother Adam he's preaching every Wednesday he is preaching to Inner City young people he's winning Souls these kids most of them almost none of them have dads or none of them have even met their dad some of them are 25 30 years old and Adam is teaching the Bible that they've never heard before and he's making a difference started with just a few people now there's like 70 of these boxers these Fighters coming on Wednesday night and he's winning these Souls my sister I mentioned her she's she's got five kids at least the last time we counted and she's one of the best Mothers I've ever seen she's stays home to raise the kids they made Financial sacrifices so she could be a mom to them and those kids are absolutely precious you talk about sweet kids and it's because they they got a mom that loves them I think all of this is a testimony to my mom and how she taught us and she made time with each of us and each one of us had that personal relationship with our mother and it produces something in the future it's so important our time is with our children our time with each other and I'll get to this in a minute but sisters you do not have to have biological children to be a mother I really don't think that has anything to do with it it is a spirit that God gave you it is that El Shai that is manifested in a woman of God and it is just it is without equal the Apostle Timothy we've all read the letters to Timothy when Paul writes both of his letters to the Corinthians his letter to the phiman his letters to the Thessalonians to the Romans to the Philippians to the Colossians both the letters to the Thessalonians and even the letter to the Hebrews Timothy's mentioned he listed at the beginning that he seems to co-author Corinthians second Corinthians Philippians Colossians both the letters to Thessalonians and to philimon seems to be a co-author on those Timothy went before Paul to certain places probably to prepare for Paul's arrival and Paul took him with him when he went to Corinth and thessalonica and to Macedonia to preach the gospel of Christ and eventually Paul placed Timothy to be the pastor of the Ephesian church one of the most advanced churches in the New Testament you read the book of Ephesians and it is deep and it is powerful and Timothy was placed to be Pastor over that church this man Timothy was one of the greatest Servants of the Lord in the whole new testimony and he was unique because his mom was Jewish and his dad was Greek and Timothy was one of these new Believers one of these new converts and he may not have looked at looked or act like one of the traditional Jews but Timothy had a gift that Paul identifies and Paul identifies where this gift comes from 1 Timothy chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son he's calling him Timothy his son in the gospel to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I served from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy look at the relationship ship that Timothy and Paul had the greatest of all the apostles in Paul with this man Timothy Timothy must have been a man of impeccable character verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first brother Jeremy am I in the right spot okay glad I had your attention First Timothy that's second Timothy I'm sorry second Timothy verse one let's go to let's go down to verse five when I call to remembrance see that's why you gotta use the good old Bible you know and and not and not the electronics all the time they are a blessing verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in my grandmother in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice I am persuaded I am persuaded that is in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Paul is saying that the gift that's in Timothy was first in his grandmother Lois and then in his mother Eunice and that gift was passed down from eating oatmeal in the morning and talking about the Lord from studying the Bible down to Unice and then Unice had learned from her mother and she was serving oatmeal to her little boy Timothy and she was talking about the Lord and she was talking about the Messiah and she was she was teaching this young man about the word of God and she was instilling not only the word in him but this great character because she had a great character she had a gift as the Apostle said and here it is and it goes right into Timothy the boy and he changed the world he was one of those first ones pastoring one of the greatest churches that's ever been close with one of the greatest Apostles that ever been I wonder how it was growing up in Timothy's House El Shai must have been present in that home really to produce such a great man the um this word elai to me just hearing sister Jessica singing it and and being and listening to it over the past day how beautiful this these words are and what it represents that it's this God that comes to the helpless person and this God is able to pour out that spirit and that love and to take care of that person and to nurture nurture him up comes to Abraham and says you're Barren Sarah you're Barren I know that but look at the Spirit really that our mothers have come and give them a child give them covenants give them a promise encourage our hearts encourage us to do great things but today we don't see that elai anymore now we see that it's it's a it's a shame many times for a woman to have a child to kill it before it's born it's a shame for a woman to have like my sister to have five of these beautiful little babies little little kids running around but she's proud of them I'm proud of them amen and there's not time that's spent we all we all want to blame the world brothers and sisters if you send we want to blame the school system if you send a bad kid to school at 8:00 in the morning you're going to get a bad kid when he gets off the bus at 3:30 but if you send a good kid to school one that has come up in the gospel one that understands the word one that has good parents if you send that kid to school not only is is the kid going to come back a good kid but that kid's going to make other good kids and he's going to have or she's going to have an influence on the others that Spirit of the family and of the parents is going to continue on and as I said in closing we can have the musicians come a woman brothers and sisters doesn't a mother doesn't doesn't mean that she has to have biological children you can still have that Spirit of a mother as a nurturing that elai Spirit where you're taking care of of of a child or or of someone else that nurturing way my aunt Jacqueline she never she was never married she never had children but she's quick to tell you that she has 10 children because that's how many grandmothers she had or how many Grand child children she has and she loves every one of us like a mother loves their children and we're thankful all of us are for the love that we have and it's that Spirit of el Shai coming out in a woman and she's always the Lord's always willing to bring that precious little baby which is you and me into his bosom to take care of us there's one last mother that I'll mention and that's Mary the greatest mother that has ever lived in my opinion she was she had this child brothers and sisters it wasn't even hers it wasn't Joseph's child this was God took a fertilized seed and placed it into this woman and she had that child she loved that child like her own she cared for him Joseph was a good dad he passed away at a at a um when when Jesus was young but it shows you that that love of a mother goes far beyond biology that love of a mother is it's it's a love of God is what it is and as I said it's not from the world this comes directly from the Lord Jesus I want to I want to have one I want to read one more scripture I think I have a few minutes Ephesians chapter 1 verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will we consider ourselves Sons and Daughters of Christ but it says here that we are adopted and yet he loves us just as much much as he does his own children shaat and and and um Hannah the Jewish people are the rightful Sons and Daughters of God they have a claim to that but us through adoption we are now his sons and his daughters and we see that that El Shai Spirit come unto me all ye that labor in our heav lad and I will give you rest everyone come to me yes he is Mother amen he has that wonderful spirit that brother Joe you and I could never understand but God has it amen and he wants us all to come in he wants us all to be part of him and I want all of us to benefit from the mothers that we have and not just the mothers but but the sisters that they have some age on them and they and they understand things and the brothers that's why next weekend next Sunday night I want the young people I want you to be here but next Sunday night I want to have the elders

sisters of like Precious faiths join our hearts together to take these requests and then maybe if we have just a minute after their prayer I'll share a couple of little things with you just just because but let's just go to the Lord father God lord Jesus we're grateful Lord that in these dark hours in which we live that there is light Lord that you are the light of the world and you said that we are the light of the world Lord help our lights to shine Lord there's been confidence expressed Behind These requests Lord for this young man that's in danger of having a a serious loss of of

that you would send your angels send that healing Spirit Lord to this young man Lord and help him in this time and help him to realize that you're there and that you care Lord for the other request that was brought here as well Lord I just pray for that that you would meet that need Lord and that you would just help us all Lord to draw closer to you to one another Lord we thank you we thank you again for this privilege that we have to come to you and Jesus precious name amen brother Jordan if you could put up that picture that I gave you this morning yeah there we go now there's two wonderful things in this image the first of course is my sweetheart and the second you notice in the baptistry there's a painting in the background of these mountains and these are those mountains this is at the monida border we were going up to a family reunion in the very northern part of the panhandle of Idaho this last week and we'd driven past this place a couple of times since we've been married but it's always been either coming in the wrong direction bad weather you can't see it and this time it was visible and we could see it and we wanted to get get a picture of it and Heather was so happy to be able to to finally see this I was happy to I'd seen it back in 1970 with brother Francois when we were on a trip but uh anyway and and and I won't tell you about how he had to make a huge turn on the free where it says authorized Vehicles only but but I said Heather I'm authorizing this turn and we went ahead and and we made it so anyway that's on the moon either border if you're ever headed up Interstate 15 and just as you approach the Border Crossing into Montana you'll see a sign that says monida one mile uh don't go that far just before you get there there's a chain up area on the side of the road that's where you want to stop and that's where you can get that picture and the and the mountains are just perfectly framed there uh anyway that was just a real blessing but we had opportunity to be with family have their side of the family the wear side and a couple of cousins that uh they're not Christians uh I'm not certain that they're anti-christian but they certainly don't believe in uh in the Lord and their dad uh Heather's father's brother Heather's Uncle he was very adamant about not being a Christian but his wife Gwendolyn she became a Christian and I know that she was praying for her sons two boys Greg and Keith and and it turned out that in this property that we went to uh to have this family reunion that the cabin that Heather and I were in was the same cabin that these two brothers were in her cousins that she may be seen twice in her life and we were way off at one end of the property together so we were able to spend some time in Fellowship there and and we were able to answer some questions in a way that was not offensive to them that respected them but still brought in the Lord Jesus Christ and and and and and you know we were invited to stop by then see them and so forth so I I feel like there was progress made if you happen to think of of Keith and Greg Ware Greg is a retired University professor in Keith is is I'm not sure exactly what he is except he's basically retired as well I think but but these these men and their families need the Lord Jesus and and and I believe that that we won't be complete without them so we need to reach out and embrace him if you remember them in your prayers we'd really really appreciate that um and uh I don't know what else to say except that we had a good time a good time in the Lord a good time renewing connection with family and uh and and that in some way we were able to uh to to be a witness for Jesus Christ and and that is always always a privilege so God bless you thank you for humoring me with uh This Isn't She Lovely I don't know how I could be such a lucky guy to be married to Heather God bless you our wives love us when we get to stand behind it's amazing I remember seeing sister grain somewhere around what sister Matisse says and going like this to brother Greene but it never stopped him it's the the Seven Peaks on that border the brother Brandon the Lord showed him that was his his life and all that's what that was there's amen Sweet Hour of Prayer I'm sorry the lily of the valley I have found a friend in Jesus you know I found him but he knew me already and that's that's wonderful [Music] [Music] the lily of the valley in him all I need to cleanse and make me [Music] if sorrow is my comfort and trouble his Mustang he tells me every Care on him too long Hallelujah [Music] up until 2002 may all my Greeks has taken and all my friends and my strong and mighty power I have all for him Forsaken and all my idols give me by his power [Music] on the world [Music] the brightness [Music] is up ten thousand to my soul he will never never live by faith and do his blessed with a wall of fire about me I'm nothing now with this man I hear my hungry so shall feel free then sweeping up to Glory will see his message [Music] [Applause] the rest of the sometimes we've been up to glory to see his classic face [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated [Music] our sister hope has a song special I don't see her where is she there she is she's coming in all right so appreciate that you know this this morning brother Daniel speaking speaking of a relationship with God talking about it's not just to know him by name or an acquaintance from a distance but a relationship a fellowship that's true and as he was finishing up sitting there and I just had my eyes closed and praying felt the Lord just tell me it's a job where it's work something you do to establish the relationship and and I just thought well we don't work for this he said no but it's a denying of self and I just felt he said to me you see I had to go to Calvary I had to deny myself to go to Calgary to make sure this relationship was going to work and it is working I said to brother Daniel I said you know we just me and my wife on Thursday I believe it was we we passed 44 years married and uh I uh I I owe it all to her basically I think she's she's been a wonderful lady and a sister and all but it's it's a relationship just just because you say you're married doesn't start it's a constant constant working and doing and I felt he just said just give of yourself and work that relationship all drawn out to you so if you just sit there and say Lord here I am waiting he's wanting to see some reaction on our part yes Lord I have found a friend in Jesus he's everything to me thank you sister [Music] they called him Jesus Jesus he came to love [Music] is there to prove My Savior Lives [Music] Because He Lives sing it with me I can face tomorrow

have that relationship with him I am I appreciated that for the Lyle sister Heather it's good to good to have you all back with us there you are God bless you Let's uh we've been going into the book of Acts and I've been getting some feedback from some different folks that have been blessed by our study on this book I've been hearing a lot of people say that you know I never I thought I've read the book of Acts I thought I understood it but I never really understood it I never understood that there was so much that this book was so rich and it is it's just it's so as uh the song goes so deep you can't get under it so high I forgot but you know the song I'm talking about it's a great song I just can't remember it Let's uh let's get started in this in this book of Acts chapter 18. So what had happened in chapter 17 is Paul had just been to this place of of Greek culture and Society with Greek gods everywhere lining the streets and the marketplaces it was this place called Athens so Paul Paul was there and and he was able to preach to these people and to bring it right down to the level that they understood as I said Athens was a hub of Greek culture and we see that Paul as he was walking down the marketplace he saw all the different idols and all the different temples and he went by this place called the Temple of the unknown God and he used that place as he went up on the mountain he used that place to preach a message to these gentile people and we know that we have seen now from our study in the book of Acts that that we see really three different kinds of people that Paul is preaching to he's preaching number one to the Jews in the synagogues these are the ones that have accepted the Lord Jesus and have a background that have been taught by probably the Pharisees but the Pharisees or the Sadducees and they have seen Paul has explained to them and showed them this Jesus Christ in the Old Testament in from from Genesis from Abraham all the way through Moses teaching and all the prophets Paul has been able to show them how Jesus fulfills all these prophecies so we have those Jews and then we have these other folks that the Bible says that they feared God so these are these Gentiles that have come in and accepted at least part of the Jewish Theology of the one God a monotheistic religion which is not normal for really anyone outside the Jewish people so they were able to come in and they had accepted this Jewish god but they had not yet accepted the Jewish way of living with all the rules and the regulations so we have that group and those two people those two types of people were in the synagogues and then we see in the Athenians we see in the the ones from Athens we see this other this whole new group of these people that knew absolutely nothing about God all they knew was idols and and and and idol worship and and all of these different Greek gods and Zeus and mercury and all all these different ones that there are thousands of them that they had worshiped so we see in Athens we see those people start to show an interest in this Christianity I appreciated what brother Lyle said when you came up here you said um that you asked for prayer are these were these family members I couldn't quite hear that their family members and I appreciated brother Lyle saying that he was able to answer some questions without being offensive very very wise and we see the Apostle Paul has he's the master of that wisdom to where he could bring it right down to where everyone he was talking to whether it's the Pharisee theologians or whether it's these Greek Jews or whether it's these converts or whether it's these completely heathen people he could speak to all of them so I see you brother Lyle maybe you were able to apply some of this book of Acts that maybe that we've been studying to to your wisdom and I did appreciate the way that you said that without being offensive we saw that Paul in Athens he quotes actually he's talking to these completely idolaters and he actually quotes a famous celebrity of the day and he says that that this celebrity says that we are all the offspring of God and that celebrity when he had taught that that celebrity was talking about that we are all offsprings of Zeus so Paul is able to take that and then he's able to get their attention and preach about the true God and how we are actually offsprings of this true God and then he was able to bring Christ into it and it really intrigued these people in Athens so now Paul goes from Athens which was like I said the Hub of the Greek religion he goes to one of the most awful places on Earth at that time and that is the city of Corinth verse number 18 says this and after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth now Paul and his team they go from Athens they take a ship and I found out today from Brother Lyle that they they sail along and then there's this little Peninsula or this little section of land that they have to they have to go through and they actually Portage the boat they take it and they put it on some sort of of rails or rollers and they drag it across this two is it two miles one or two miles come on brother Lyle we're not we don't live in England thank you about four miles that that they had to bring this boat across this piece of land and then they they get over to this place called Corinth now Corinth was an absolutely massive City we think about Athens and how famous that was but Corinth is somewhere around 15 to 20 side 20 times the size of Athens and it was absolutely evil it was a terrible City and it's neat because I as I was studying on on this this city of Corinth I said you know this looks like a modern day Las Vegas and uh because it was it was filled with prostitution filled with immorality filled with just every type of advice that you had in that day that City had it and it was an absolutely disgusting City I can't say I can't say enough bad about it so Paul he goes into this city like I said a modern day Las Vegas and it blessed me today because when I saw brother Lyle this morning before service brother says hey I'm really looking forward to Acts chapter 18 and he says you know that place was like Las Vegas I was like oh brother we're on the same page that's exactly what I thought so really gave me confirmation in talking about this so we see that Paul goes to this city and there's Believers there not yet but there will be so Paul goes there and he's going to build a church now this place Corinth there's a couple letters that we have in our book that are written to these Believers in Corinth it's called first and second Corinthians so now you see what a bad place this is and you see now Paul is going here and he's going to start this he's going to start this church and he starts up this church and he's preaching like I said he's preaching to the Jews and he's preaching to the Gentiles and he's preaching to the kind of the the converts there he's preaching to all these people but what do you think that they struggled with they struggled with the same things that were prominent in their City so let's let's quickly let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 6. verse 9. now remember Paul is writing this this letter to the Corinthians to correct them and it says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not now Paul remember as I preached on acts 15 and in Galatians last last Sunday remember Paul isn't the farthest thing in the in the world from a legalist but that doesn't mean that Paul is against a holy holy life says here first Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor nor revelers nor extortion or shall enter shall inherit the kingdom of God now look at this next verse as such were some of you wow so these people that Paul had witnessed to they came out of that but you're washed you're Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God do you remember my sermon on Acts chapter 15 and on the Galatians Paul was correcting a problem of legalism within the church at Antioch there now Paul is writing in First Corinthians he is writing to correct immorality and writing to correct the sin that was prevalent in that area and don't you love the book of Acts now when we read these books and we'll get to Ephesians a little bit later but when we read these books Galatians the Corinthians we see oh this is who this is written to these people in that area were struggling with these types of things that's why you see Corinthians it's a lot of Correction it says here well in Corinthians IT addresses a lot of immorality IT addresses sleeping around before marriage which is called fornication having relations with someone who's not your spouse which is called adultery the difference there between adultery and fornication effeminate it says here and I'm going through these these uh what he mentions here in First Corinthians effeminate which is homosexuals abusers of their selves with mankind which is also homosexuality idolaters which is worshiping anything other than Jehovah God like in Athens thieves covetousness covetous drunkards you know what all those are revelers reveal here revilers which is actually a a modern word is Slanders Slanders that are causing harm to other with others with their words extortioners none of these shall enter the kingdom of God as such were some of you wow that is the church at Corinth so you can see why this church this letter that's written to these people that we're going to be talking about here why it is so corrective it talks about a woman having long hair it talks about how when men and women divorce and and how that that of a man should treat his wife and a woman should treat her husband it's all of these things that are very very important that they didn't know about because they came from such sin so that is the book of First Corinthians and this who I'm talking about right now is who he is he is writing to and now we're seeing he is starting this church in this Sin City called Corinth are we together so we know now what Paul is facing there and he Paul found a certain Jew this is verse number two yeah there we go thank you and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them I I don't have time but I could talk about how that that this Emperor had kicked out all the Jews of Rome it you know where it gives an excellent um description as this is in the church age book but it's it's when this man he kicked out all of these Jews because he thought they're causing problems I'll just I'll just say it for a minute so what happened is we had the First Church of Rome okay and this Church of Rome was all of these just solid Jewish believers and these people these people are like Paul Aquila and Priscilla were part of it they were just solid Jewish people that understood Jehovah they understood Christ but this man goes and he kicks out all of the Jews for this First Church of Rome so they all leave and we see that these other people take their places that don't have that walk with the Lord that these Originals had and they bring in idolatry now this is all in the church age book I I recommend that you read it they are they bring in idolatry and then we have the foundations for the Catholic Church that was a bonus I didn't have that in my nose and found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontius lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them and because he was of the same craft he Abode with them so Paul had the same profession as Aquila and Priscilla and wrought for by their occupation they were tent makers so now just because Paul was a minister didn't mean that he was solely dependent on the Believers to support him the in lean times these Ministers of these rabbis back then they always had another craft that they could fall back on that they could do and that's where Paul he must have been taught that in his hometown of Tarsus and that's what that's what happened here so he goes to this Corinth and he goes to work and I think about me I kind of had a similar um experience to where I used to be I used to I went to college and I and I got I I got this job and and when I came back here I needed something to do I needed a job and the Lord provided a job doing the same thing that I used to do way back when and the same thing here happened to Paul he comes here to Corinth and he's able to to step right in and to work in this profession of tent making now when they had the um when they had the synagogues many times people that were of the same occupation would sit in the same areas so when Paul was probably sitting in an area he that's maybe I don't know it may be how that he met Aquila and Priscilla because they were of the same craft they did the same type of work so we see that that they had this in common and then Aquila and Priscilla this really great couple and they come they come up later on in the scriptures they are just a wonderful wonderful uh couple people but this friendship that they had lasted forever it really lasted until the end we see Aquila and Priscilla we see them in Romans we see them in First Corinthians and we even see them in the second letter that Paul wrote to Timothy which is the last work that he penned that we have record of so the right at the very end of his life Paul even mentions Aquila and Priscilla so they were lifelong friends and they probably met most likely met right here in Corinth and he reasoned and Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks so again as I mentioned we have the Jews and the Greeks in the same church we have the the ones that feared God these are those converts that came in and then we have the the real Jews and when Silas and timothius would come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ now we all know who Silas is but this timotheus this is Timothy this is someone that Paul writes his letters to when he's in when Timothy's in Ephesus and when they oppose themselves that word opposed it means that they opposed Paul and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads I am clean from henceforth I will go until the Gen unto the Gentiles Paul was fed up with this hypocrisy among the Jews and he said he said if they don't accept now Paul was doing something a Jewish Tradition now you remember in the gospels when Jesus sent out his disciples to preach and to heal the sick do you remember that and he said when you come to a city and they don't accept you he said Shake the Dust off of your sandals Shake the Dust off of your clothes and then go to the next one now what that was is that was a Jewish tradition so what would happen is the Jews they would be in the Gentile area and they would go and then they would come home to their Hometown to their home Jewish country and before they would walk in they would stop at the border they would take off their shoes and they would knock the dirty Gentile dust off of their shoes and then they would put them back on and they would walk these proud stuck up Jews I hate to say it but that's what it was so what Paul is doing here this is a serious insult to the Jews so what Paul is saying is I'm going to shake this legalistic gust off of my clothes and I'm going to go to these more pure Gentiles the exact opposite of what the Jewish tradition was that was that was a slap right there but the boldness of Paul he's he's like well it's what's good for what's saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander and he's like listen you're the ones that are dirty not them so he shakes that nasty dust off of his clothes and then he's going to the Gentiles he's saying I'm done with you with your closed-minded legalistic self-righteous ways finished with it and he departed vents and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshiped God whose house was joined hard to the synagogue so Paul is in there and he's debating maybe with these with these Pharisees and and these Jews these legalistic Jews now he is able to if it got rough but for God's serious Paul could just exit stages left right into or stage right whatever this may be right for you but right into this house of justice and go right in there and be safe I think it was a he stayed with Justice and I think who was it that he stayed with last chapter um same thing he stays with this guy Justice is Jason Jason is who it was he stayed in Jason's house and Jason suffered persecution for housing Paul and Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized so still Paul with that gift of being able to bring the message to the people now Crispus he was you know what there is a let's go to First Corinthians 1 14 real quick let me let me read that so he was he was Paul's convert and it says here I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius so this man right here this Christmas this this leader of of the synagogue Paul actually baptized him I love when the two scriptures come together it's like oh that's that guy just just great but we see in the next verse we see these conversions going on and we see the the Lord moving but we see in the next verse that things aren't all butterflies and daisies in Corinth things are going to go south here in just a minute it was a case in lystra when Paul was stoned it was he was threatened in thessalonica if you remember as we're going through this book The Believers snuck him out of thessalonica in Berea same thing they had to get him out of there pretty much everywhere Paul has been it's been persecution persecution persecution by these Jewish people and Corinth was turning out the same the in the Bible doesn't say it but he had to be having problems because of this next verse the Lord then spake the Lord to Paul in the Night by a vision so there must have been something coming against Paul be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city I think what an encouragement what an encouragement to Paul that the Lord Jesus speaking to his servant and telling him that I'm with you Paul and these people that the Lord is talking about they had no idea that they were about to become Christians they had probably never heard the name of Jesus before in their lives but it was about to happen that there was going to form a Christian Church in the city of Corinth for the Lord he said that I have much people in this city and I would like I wish that I could get sometimes I wish I could get that same Assurance for here in Tucson that there are a lot of people that are God's people that still need to come to him I would love to have that Assurance from God that there are that there are still people hungry for the Lord but I believe this day is is not the day that Paul was in it's just few and far between the Lord hasn't told me but I just have to go on believing that there are more people in our city that can come to God that can come to Christ and he continued there a year and six months he was in Corinth for a long time and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them so even after he shook the dust from His Garment he stayed there and when galio was the deputy of a a Kai AKA the Jews made Insurrection with one Accord against Paul and brought him to the Judgment seat here we go again we know this story well it's happened over and over and over so they they the Jews go and they stir things up and they bring them to the Roman Authority saying this fellow persuadeth man to worship God contrary to the law same thing that these two troublemakers when they came to Antioch they're saying the same thing this guy isn't preaching what our law says he could he should preach and just like Antioch and everywhere else the legalistic Jews do not like Paul's message about Christ and not having to live according to the law they cannot stand that message so they try to get the Roman Authority as I said to arrest Paul why not have worked in Jerusalem with Jesus why wouldn't it work here you know Satan has a bag of tricks and those tricks work pretty well and he takes those tricks and he uses them over and over and over again many times he appeals to the legalistic nature of a religious person and when Paul was now about to open his mouth so he was about to say give himself a defense galio said unto the Jews now Galileo is this ruler said unto the Jews if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness OU Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and your law look Ye Ye into it for I will be no judge of such matters the same thing very very similar thing that happened to Jesus Remember When pilate had Jesus and he's like oh what am I going to do this is just this is a mess and he says oh hear it I'll send them to Herod and let him deal with it so that's exactly what happens to here here that they're trying to get this man to do their dirty work and now this galio didn't even give Paul a chance to talk now this is where the Lord remember he just promised Paul protect you Now watch how God protects Paul he says if it were a matter of wrong or Wicked lewdness or ye Jews reason would that I should bear with you but if it be a a question of matters and names and of your law look ye into it for I will be no judge in such matters and he galio drove them from the Judgment seat then all the Greek Greeks so now they're all fired up Paul's gone so the Greeks took this guy named sosthenese the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the Judgment seat and Galileo cared for none of those things who is sosthenese where did he come from I thought the other guy was the rule of the synagogue so we have a new ruler of the synagogue somebody must have got kicked out so now we have sustanies and uh sustanese is also in the Bible where is he he's Paul's writing a letter from Corinth and it says and oh yeah it was I think it was first Corinthians first or second Corinthians there Paul is writing back to to the Corinthians and and he's he's saying these things and he says oh ingredients from softon he's our brother and like oh sosthenes you remember him yeah he just disappeared one day oh he's with Paul good I'm glad I'm glad he's in good shape so Paul was Paul this sustines actually traveled with Paul and Paul after this Terry there a good while and then took his leave of the Brethren and sailed thence to Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his head in centria for he had a vow now so Paul is leaving Corinth and it seems like he shaves his head but actually he really just cuts his hair and what did this mean that that he he he was shorn because he had a vow well if you look back in the Old Testament you have there's a word that all of us are familiar with and it's called a Nazarite vow and this Nazarite vow means that this this man he wouldn't drink wine he wouldn't do a lot of other things and one of the things that he also wouldn't do is cut his hair now can you think of someone that had a Nazarite vowel just say it Samson right Samson had a Nazarite vow so he let his hair grow long you know somebody else that did Samuel the prophet he also had this vow so they they would go they would go for this period of time when they had this vow and then when their their time was over then they'd get a haircut and that's what happened right here is Paul got a haircut before he left now we think so much because of Paul's message especially to the Galatians but all throughout Paul's message he is saying listen you don't have to live up live up to all these Jewish rules circumcision and and diet and all these things and and really pressing that but if you look at Paul right here Paul greatly reverenced the tradition of the Jews for himself that Nazarite vow Paul held that in a high regard so much that he took this Jewish vow and we see that Paul and and we'll see here in a little bit that he even more reverenced the Jewish the Jewish traditions and when he came to Ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasons with the Jews so now he's out of Corinth and he goes to Ephesus Ephesus is a big city like Corinth and there's a lot of Jews so the so the Jews at at Corinth they disgusted him so much he shook the duff dust off of his clothes and he didn't go back into that synagogue but now he goes to another city oh and he goes right into the synagogue at Ephesus Paul doesn't care he doesn't care if you're Jewish if you come from his background he doesn't care if you're Greek he doesn't care if you're Roman he doesn't care if you've you accept Jehovah or not he doesn't care if you're an idolater Paul wants everyone to come to Christ and he proves that in every city that he preaches look at the variety of people that Paul is preaching to so he comes to this city at Ephesus again there's no Christian churches yet so he goes in and the only places that he has to preach are in these synagogues so when they desired now remember he's in Ephesus when they desired him to tear a longer time with them he consented not wow that's different remember all the other places like get away get away get away kill him you know throw him in jail get rid of them but these people at Ephesus they're like well we want to hear some more so these people the Ephesians had something a little bit a little bit special it seems like to me and if you read the book of Ephesians you'll see that it's a much more advanced letter than the book The Book of Corinthians the books of Corinthians and he goes back to Ephesus later on in fact he goes back to Ephesus in the next chapter in chapter 19. so we talk about a little bit more about the Ephesians in in there but I will say this that the central theme of the book of Ephesians is the Holy Spirit and Paul preaching a deeper Doctrine to these people than he does to the Corinthians and we'll see here in the next chapter and I'll leave that into the capable hands of brother Lyle to show us what message Paul preaches to in to the Ephesians in the next chapter verse number 21. but Paul made them farewell saying I must by all means keep this Feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return again to you if God will and he sailed to Ephesus again Paul Paul is showing that he has not forsaken his Jewish roots he was honoring the Jewish tradition of the feast in Jerusalem and when he had landed in caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to Antioch now there's a lot in that verse 22 that may not that may not be all of that apparent it says here and when he landed at caesarea and gone up right Jerusalem he salute to the church and he went down to Antioch now Jerusalem is a high elevation in that part of the world in fact it's about the same elevation as Tucson fact it's about the same latitude as Tucson and if if you go to Israel it actually looks a lot like Arizona looks like this part of the world so Paul so pretty much anywhere in that area you have to go up to Jerusalem and that's why it says here and had gone up it's up in elevation so they went up to Jerusalem now it's odd to me that we don't know more about this visit than a politics it's odd to me that it's like well why isn't a little bit more written we don't know there's nothing significant enough to be recorded in the Bible of this trip but one thing that we can assume is this was a short trip and after he had spent some time there in Jerusalem he departed and went over all the country of galatia and frigia in order strengthening all the disciples and a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus now this guy is intriguing this man Apollos very very interesting man this is the first right here this is the first we hear about Apollos but he plays a very important role in the message going out to the different churches in First Corinthians Paul mentions that there are fightings among the people you remember that scripture that there's fighting among the people some say that I am of Paul and some Apollos and some Peter so Paul is putting this man Apollos right up there with him and Peter this man must have been very very good at what he did this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John now for those who say baptism isn't important right here you can see that that if you just knew the doctrine and the baptism of the Prophet John the Baptist your understanding was incomplete this man of paulus was from Alexandria Alexandria is in Egypt which is one of the biggest cities in the world and it had an enormous Jewish population it also had some of the best schools on the planet so we can assume that Apollos was probably highly educated in this city in his hometown of Alexandria so somehow the teaching of John the Baptist came to Apollos and he began preaching John's message now he didn't know about anything about the day of Pentecost he didn't know about the Holy Spirit he didn't even know about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but he is still one of the most gifted preachers that anyone had ever met so he shows up at evidence Ephesus and he starts preaching John the Baptist's message and it goes to show that there is so much about John the Baptist that we don't know he John the Baptist we know that he was a powerful Minister we know that he preached against marriage marriage and divorce when Herod married his brother-in-law's or his brother's wife Philip's wife we know that he preached the Messiah we know that he preached against obviously preached against divorce and he preached against the priests and he preached the Messiah but it must have been a very deep message to have gone as far as John the Baptist message went he must have been really something that we don't read here in the Bible now Paul now Apollos and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took under they took him under them and expounded unto them the way of God more perfectly so Aquila and Priscilla they knew Paul and they knew Christ and they knew the Holy Spirit and they knew baptism so they take one of the most gifted ministers probably in the world at that time he comes into their home and they're probably like hey Apollos you're really good but you need to know a little bit more so they bring him in and they start teaching him and what struck me the most from the scripture is look at the humility of Apollos educated knew the word knew the scriptures knew the Torah knew it better than anyone and here he is with this humble Little Couple comes in and they tell him about Christ and they tell him about the Holy Spirit and he accepts it with all of his heart what a humble man what a good man and when he was disposed in fact brother Branham Likens Apollos to Billy Graham Billy Graham was probably as far as the church world the one of the greatest ministers Christian ministers the world's ever seen and for brother Branham to compare this man of paulus to Billy Graham is a great compliment from him also and when he was disposed to pass unto Ikea the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through Grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ and and we can close if the if the musicians would come so this man Apollos Aquila and Priscilla they explained to him these things and you know like the bereans do you remember the bereans from last week they went and they checked the scriptures I guarantee you Apollos did too so they take they take Apollos takes what Aquila and Priscilla had told him and enlightened him and then he was able to take that Revelation and really present it to the people and there were groups that had heard now Apollos as I said he was all over the place in a great Minister there were groups that had heard Apollos before that he probably had this revelation of the Holy Spirit and of Christ and Paul actually goes and encounters one of these groups and how did Paul handle this when he encountered Apollos this great man comes and he preaches this Gospel of John the Baptist and he converts these people and then Paul comes in and he starts preaching Jesus they're like oh yeah we know and how did Paul handle it brother lie I was going to tell you in his in his sermon on Wednesday it's beautiful Acts chapter 19 is is a wonderful wonderful chapter and Acts chapter 18 17 16 15. oh they're all great I love them all and and I've just been so blessed to be to been going through we've all been blessed to go through these and you see the different people you see from Athens in 17 and you see these just idolaters and Paul is able to speak to them in their language you see that he comes here to Corinth and the most evil Sin City that that you could ever find Paul goes right in jumps in and forms a church right there absolutely beautiful the gifts of this great man the Apostle Paul God bless you brothers and sisters continue reading this book of Acts and I pray that tonight gave you a little bit better understanding of this Acts chapter 18. let's stand God bless you all [Music] oh Lord send your power just now oh Lord

maybe their questions that they had on on who you are they're their thirst for understanding uh who created them wanting to to know where they came from and and their excitement when they found answers in the name of Jesus Christ and we can relate to a lot of these stories Lord and they failed just like we do and quarreled among each other just like we do they needed to ask for forgiveness just like we do Lord and we love to to see your Bible come alive and [Music] just ask that one day Lord will be able to to spend time with these characters that we're reading about Lord and to think that it's really we're part of the same story and we get to spend eternity with some of these characters Lord and we I I don't understand it here on this side but what a what a remarkable thing that'll be to to be able to to talk for a thousand years to each one and they're going to have questions for us just like we have of them and all part of the body of Jesus Christ we're thankful that's again more that we're able to to Fellowship around your word we just ask that you would forgive us where we've fallen short give us strength and courage to depress the battle and maybe take this light

mind you can all have your seats shalom sh English English the peace of God be with you truly the peace of God be with you this morning my name is Mark I wrote a book about the life of Jesus Christ most books about a person end with their death but that's in chapter 15 my book goes on to chapter 16 and we're going to share that with you this morning now when the Sabbath was passed Saturday night after the sun had gone down Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and slom bought spices that they might come and anoint the body of Jesus very early in the morning on the first day of the week Sunday morning they came to the Tomb at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who will roll away the stone for us but when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away it was very large and entering the tomb they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed but he said to them do not be alarmed you see Jesus of Nazareth who is crucified he is risen he is not here see the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and Peter that he will go before you into Galilee there you will see him as he said to you so they went out quickly from the tomb for they trembled LED and were amazed they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven demons she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept and when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her they didn't believe her after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the rest but they didn't believe them either later he appeared to the 11 as they sat at the table and he rebuked their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they did not believe those Witnesses who had seen him after he had risen and he then said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damn condemned and these signs that shall fall they believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink of any deadly thing they shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of the god and they went and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word through accompanying signs amen good morning God bless you rep God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive God's not dead he is alive I feel him in my hands

service today so that means we can go as long as we want no service this evening and no Sunday school as you saw the Sunday school was here um and uh another note brother Daniel wanted me to add there's uh a financial report for the church we're not going to do that this morning we're going to do thatn Wednesday night um so we'll have just a little financial report on how the church is doing

and he's not respond responding so we're praying that God will heal him that's a serious need it's not too serious for the Lord and another request from Sister Salazar she's she was cleaning this week and she got something in her right eye and for the past four days she's been seeing uh with a film over it and it's scary because some of you know she already has a problem in her left eye and she relies on her good eye to do things that she'd need to do on an everyday basis if we could have the brothers come up to prepare for prayer this morning she relies on that good eye and so now this eye is is damaged and she's been having headaches and trouble driving and she doesn't want to have to go to the doctor or the or the ER she's asking God to heal her and restore her he can he's able he's

put this display together and it's symbolic it's made from B cloth from Uganda bark cloth is a burial cloth and brother Lyall and sister hea Heather had it and they graciously used it to make the tomb

faces it's good to have everyone one place I was bragging about the kids I'm going to um I'm going to tell something on them I'm going to tell a secret on I'm not going to embarrass you though okay so Daniel after I ministered last Sunday Daniel came up to me and and I know my son and he said uh he said hey Dad how's it going and that means I could care less how it's going but I got to tell you something so he says uh here here's the thing he says you know you were talking about um Taylor Swift in in uh last last Sunday sermon I said yeah he goes here's the thing dad he says he says you know that that um that place is it is a boba is that what it's called that place it's a it's a Boba place he said he says you know that place and and the owner a a Christian guy and I said yeah he says you know they have a car karaoke machine there and I said yeah he said dad last night I sang Two Taylor Swift songs like buddy and he said yeah dad he says and I was like well I said you know I probably wouldn't have said it if I would have known that that you were doing that but that was just the Lord and and when we do something if we make a mistake the best thing that we can do is to correct that mistake amen so d said but Dad while we were there he said that this owner he's a Vietnamese man he said he invited us to sing in his church and I said sing what no so so the actually our young people went to this Vietnamese Christian church and Daniel was taking videos while while they were um fellowshipping and they sang for this church and they blessed this church it was it was you all right the new the numer sisters were there and Daniel was there and I think a lot of them were there and it just blessed this this church to reach out like that so then they go there they went hiking yesterday and they they had the the youth together and they came here and practiced and then they went back last night to the Boba te place and Daniel took some videos when he was there our young people were there with that karaoke machine and they had the whole establishment up and praising the Lord and and dancing to the spirit of the Lord singing gospel songs I'm so proud of you all yes let's keep this going you know it's we've everything's been going so well and the Lord's been blessing us so much I what I want to say is Satan get out of the way because we just started we're coming and you better get out of the way what a what an exciting time that we live in and on this Resurrection on this wonderful day that happened 2,000 years ago when Jesus came out of the Tomb we have to understand what happened during this time and remember you can't have a resurrection without a death I mean you can't raise something from the dead if it's not dead right and you can't have a death brothers and sisters you can't have death without suffering so it's all part of this great plan and the best times in our lives brothers and sisters are not the good times are not the prosperous times the best times in our lives and many many of us can look back are the times that we were suffering let's turn to Isaiah chapter 53 now this was written 700 years before the prophecy came to pass in this Messiah this man named Jesus Christ Isaiah 53 verse number one says this who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should just desire him so he's saying he's just going to be an everyday young man not even particularly goodlooking maybe like Moses was or like Joseph was in the Bible this is an ordinary man he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he was and he made his grave with the Wicked the thieves on the cross and with the rich in his death Joseph of arthea because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth I wish I could have that testimony amen yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors what a prophecy that was wholly and fully fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ that came 700 years after the prophet Isaiah prophesied that a man of sorrow and grief and today we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus but last week was Palm Sunday the Bible says he rode into Jerusalem the most important city in the world rode in on a donkey and people were celebrating his arrival like David coming in to the city with the Ark on the shoulders of the Levites and David danced before it was a wonderful time that Jesus came they were they were taking off their garments and they were throwing them down in front of the donkey that Jesus rode on and and with the Palm leaves and singing hosana To The King King but that time fulfilled scripture but as far as Jesus's Ministry it was a very small almost very almost unimportant part if you and I were there we would think that this was my highlight of my life this was the greatest time that I've ever lived that when they finally recognized who I was but it wasn't with Jesus his time his greatest time was yet to come and it would happen within a week a week later after he rode in on Palm Sunday now when he came in it it it was a it was a good day and then during that week things gradually got worse and then it came to the real suffering the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Apostle Paul says this and he said unto me so Paul he couldn't see he had a thorn in his flesh his eyesight wasn't very good he may have been suffering from some sickness and he sought the Lord three times and the Lord said to him my grace is sufficient for thee my my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather GL glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong 1 Peter chap 5:10 says this but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect perfect establish you strengthen settle you Ecclesiastes 71 says this a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth I don't think when we read this and we we read of of the The Passion of Christ this this week that that Jesus went to I don't believe that the Lord wants us to suffer I don't think that's the point I don't think he he wants bad things to happen to us it's like if you know like going to going to my wife is like hey honey I got a $1,000 bonus today oh I'm sorry honey I'm I'm really sorry we we should we should lament that no good things are good things and he doesn't it doesn't say it's like hey uh hey honey remember that speeding ticket I got the other day our insurance went up 25% yes we're going to suffer for that one that's really good yeah the dog died this morning that's not that's not what he wants that's not what it's about but it's during those low times that God really speaks to us human nature brothers and sisters human nature requires suffering our nature gravitates towards sin and God uses the suffering that we have to perfect us even you go all the way back to the Book of Genesis and you look the first thing God says do whatever you want but don't do this one thing look at the nature of a human being goes directly to that one thing that he said not to do it's the nature of a human being to go towards sin and it's the good times when times are easier and we have we have memories maybe of having more money or or having a little bit better job or an easier time of life most of the time that that our lives don't make any changes we only make changes maybe for the worst in those times but the best times the good times are not associated brothers and sisters with positive change wow in fact the good times are the hardest times to change it's in the hard times that we make changes in our lives like the Rich Young Ruler things were going really good for this young man he had a lot of money everything was good he had a high standing in the church everyone respected him and he sees this man who people were calling the Messiah and a prophet and he sees this this he hears his teaching he says oh this man is great and he knew that this Jesus something about him was associated with eternal life so this Rich Young Ruler goes to the Lord he bowed bows down before him he pays him respect and he says what must I do to obtain eternal life and Jesus looked on him and loved him there was something about this young man Jesus saw he said you haven't suffered things are too good and he said sell everything that you have give it to the poor and then come follow me because this young man hadn't had any problems in his life there was no there wasn't that great character that was there so then he he goes and he the man was grieved and he couldn't do it he had a chance maybe to be a disciple we don't even know his name if he would have made the right choice yes he would have suffered yes there would have been problems s but instead the next time we see this young man he's in Hell lost his salvation and then on the other side there was a beggar named Lazarus that just had nothing in his life that was always struggling and we see that Lazarus when he died he went up right into the bosom of Abraham the Rich Young Ruler he died he went down to Hell we see which is more important the good times and the bad times I was talking with a uh a guy at the gym I've known for a while he's come to church here a couple times he's not he'd be fine with me telling the story he came up to me and I I said I said hey how you doing um and he said uh he said not so good I was like okay um here we go and uh he says you know he said I'm sick of it and I said what do you mean you're sick of it he says you know he says God always sends these women into my life and he said and I get attached to them and and and I I I give them I start talking with them they tell me their problems and I counsel them and he says then they just they then they leave me and I said I said really and I said that's God's fault and he says yeah he says why does he send them into my life if it's if it's not for me if it's just to make just to hurt me just to upset me and I said I said okay I said I knew the answer but I said and how old is this girl he says she's 25 and I said and how old are you 47 I said don't blame God for your bad decisions right we can look at these we can go through life and say oh just because God puts something something comes into my path that doesn't mean to take itow make a decision in your life so he's he's there he says he says what I do he says I talk to these people he says I spend my time and and they they tell me all their problems and I help them and I counsel them and and then he said finally they get they they they don't want to talk to me anymore and then then they just shun me I was like oh yeah takes all your time he goes yeah and I just give and give and give and give and God never gives me anything I was like listen man I've been sitting here for 30 minutes you just got a free counseling session from the pastor and I said what did I get out of this said write a check Tucson Tabernacle make an offering but it's all about me he was thinking about himself and when I told him I said listen I said you haven't gone far enough I said what you should do is you should say Lord if you never want me to have a wife I just want to be in your will if you never want me to have another job Lord just let me be in your will I will do everything that I can to serve you and work as hard as I can but if you don't want it Lord I want your will and I said you're not there yet and I believe this young man I believe young man he's almost my age is a child of God I really do and I think that his time is coming that he's going to have to make a decision he might be forced to make a decision I was talking with another young man's about Daniel's age found himself in jail been there for a little while and I went and visited him and I never met him before he's got a good family he's a good mom got a good brother he's he's he's he's got a good child and he just made bad decisions all through his life and finally this bad the last bad decision landed him in jail and now he's awaiting waiting sentencing and he he was talking to me and I was I was understanding what he was what he was doing and and and he said I said Do you believe God is in all this he goes I know he is he made the wrong decisions all the time until he got put in a jail cell and then he says now he goes he goes Pastor now all I have is time he says I think about the Lord all the time when I now that I'm here but before I was here he says I never thought about him and he says now I'm here and I don't have anywhere else to go and he says now I'm praying and I said brother this is the best time of your life it may seem hard this may seem like the hardest time but it's not it is when it is the hardest times in our lives that God finally can he's knocking all the time but it's the hard times that we finally listen there's a woman Matthew chapter 15 we call her a syap phenician woman she was her daughter was mentally ill her daughter had ma major major problems so she comes to the Lord Jesus let's read it Matthew 15:21 then Jesus went then and departed under the coast of Ty and siden and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and the disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us so this woman came to Jesus and he ignored her let me tell you she wasn't quite low enough she wasn't quite surrendered enough she wasn't quite at Rock Bottom there yet she was about as bad as it can get but there there was still a little bit more that she had to do all the pride maybe was not out of her yet it's a hard one to swallow but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel he looks at her he says look at you you're not even a believer you don't look like us you don't act like us you're not worth my time what would I have done if someone treated me like that it wasn't the case for this woman though her daughter was the most important thing then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me was she low enough yet but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs he's saying do you want to take my time you think my time is worth giving to a dog like you but her daughter is more important than her pride and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table she says Lord you are my master Lord You're my king I'm not worthy even to sit at this table but I'll take just a few crumbs that fall off then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so she had reached rock bottom but notice she didn't just sit there and not do anything and then when she came into a little resistance she didn't just say I will it must not be the Lord's will she didn't just say well I'm trusting that the Lord will heal my daughter it's a promise and I accept it brother sister I'm just going to hold fast to that that's not what she did that's the mistake that many of us make we get lazy we're not willing to give everything so that we can receive what we ask for so then God in his kindness and his compassion he will put on this hardship to us put us on our back and then finally he can get through to us and speak to us my children are here I'll tell you the hardest time in our lives with me and Stephanie was when our kids weren't serving the lord and we we would cry and we would pray and and and we we didn't know what to do crying out to God saying Lord I don't care what it is Lord I will I will give everything up I will give my job up I will give my Ministry up I will give it all up and Lord save my kids I don't care what it is wow Lord I am humbled Lord help us and they saved my kids and it was at the hardest time that really we get an answer back and and I remember praying it's like Lord we've homeschooled them we've never missed a service at church I've done everything I've known how to do to just walk this perfect line kept them from the neighbor kids protected them as far as who they hang out with and then I felt like Stephanie and I both got an answer was that my will God speaking or was that your will is that how you think this should be happen is that how you think or have you really surrendered your life have you really fallen down and ask the Lord Lord I don't care however you want to lead me we will follow and that's what these hard times that's what these troubles give us they give us a surrender that's what they gave to the lord it's in the lowest times in our lives that God really speaks to us and that's the time when we respond to him as I said he's always knocking but in the good times in our minds everything's going good that's not when we answer the hard times the worst times they're the greatest times we love hearing testimonies from people that that they go through a hard time time and and then they come out we love that because they went through it as I said you can't have a resurrection if you don't have a death and you can't have a death if you don't have suffering that's what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus comes down his disciples heaviness he knew what was going to happen he goes and he asks his friends he says can you just pray with me a little bit I didn't think it was that important he gets there and he gets on his knees and he ask the Lord the father remember he was a son he was the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he was real he knew how it was to suffer he knew knew how it was to feel Temptation he knew what we were going through and there he was with everything on him and he's praying and he's saying Lord let this cup pass from me but thy will be done you think well brother Daniel he uh he was the son of God he should have known he should have known what was prophesied about him he should have known his role in these things that's why maybe it wasn't so hard for him it was hard for him think about you I'm G to ask the church here something how many people here and I want you to raise your hand if this is true how many people here believe that Jesus Christ is their Savior and how many people here are Christians amen don't raise your hand on this next question so if you are really Christians the Bible says I believe is brother ly did you read Mark yeah brother Lyall read Mark at the end there and when Jesus is giving his disciples his people he says if you believe on me the works that I do shall you do also and then in mark 16 he said they shall cast out demons they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if that's the case then why do we fear when we get diagnosed with cancer wow why is that there anxiety there why do we fear if we're diagnosed with heart disease what says right here there's a prophecy right here for me and I just gra why shouldn't I just be healed well here's Jesus the same way and he's like he's like yeah I know I know what's prophesied of me but do you think the enemy wasn't there every every gun in hell was pointed at him you think that the enemy wasn't coming in saying maybe you got the prophecy wrong maybe maybe you're not this or or all of this this confusion comes in our mind if we don't have enough Faith to be healed how could we ever say that Jes Jesus knew he was the Messiah so it should have been easy for him it was not easy he knew how it was to suffer and then we worry about our kids like like I have like many of you have St John chapter 14 verse1 14 says ask anything Jesus speaking talking to us he says ask anything in my name and I'll do it yet we struggle we worry about our children it's a time of suffering but there's a time when you when you finally you get so low and you just cry out say Lord I don't care I just want your will I just want you I just want to be I just want to be what you want me to be I want to do what you want and there was Jesus in The Garden of the Gethsemane saying Lord whatever your will be done and then he gets up and here it comes the people to take him away they take him as you know to be tried and beaten all of his friends that night you know the ones that we rever so highly Peter and James and John they all ran away they all forsook him every want which fulfilled scripture and here's Peter and he just he just told him at the Last Supper Lord I will never forsake you I will never do it and and Jesus said you're going to do it three times before the next morning Peter you going to do it before the rooster craws and here's Peter and now the the Lord's taken away and they was surely thinking that he could save himself and somebody asked him do you know him and he was afraid he said no I don't even know the guy when this book when these gospels were written you notice one of the most beautiful things about the Bible is they record their mistakes wow they record their own failures and here read out of the Book of Luke and here's here's Jesus or here's here's Peter and he's probably telling Luke here's what happened that night I cut off the guy's ear I ran away from him and then I I forsook him three times they kept asking me I forsook him and then the last time not only when somebody asked me not only did I say I didn't know him I started cussing and then you know what happened there a far off Jesus looked over caught Peter's eye and Peter just was destroyed he started weeping and he he ran off crying the lowest time for Peter the lowest time for all of these people then Jesus is put up on the cross here he is stand up there nailed to the cross still this man he's still getting lower he didn't even reach the lowest yet and the disciples as I said they were giving their testimonies later maybe Luke was writing them down and Peter maybe said yeah I was one of the ones with with that was with Jesus oh you were the one one of the ones that stood a far off you were one of the ones that that were far away from him they didn't have enough courage to be with him yeah that was me it was a low time so there's Jesus up on the cross and there is a man that was crucified next to him that said Lord I'm mercy on me he tells the other one he says he doesn't deserve to be here you and I deserve to be here and Jesus said this day you will be with me in Paradise what was the greatest day in that thief in that criminal's life it was his lowest day wow it was the day that he was crucified it was the day that he was suffering that was his greatest day and it's our greatest times or when we're suffering because that is the time that we can speak to Jesus we were when Jesus died and he he got got to his lowest and it was his greatest achievement he conquered death Hell In The Grave right there he conquered all sin right there when he died who could say that I Lay My Life down many of us could say that brother Leo we can't say I take it up again that was reserved for one man one man with the power to do it how could somebody be dead for three days and then have still the power to take his own life to raise his own life up so here's Jesus he dies and all the disciples they they they they run away and and they're sad and and they don't know what to do and they had already forsaken him really the lowest the lowest point in their entire lives and then they start questioning he couldn't have been the Messiah I saw him die well yeah but didn't he say that he would raise again so easy easy for us to forget the promises of God we might not forget them like St John 14:14 ask anything in my name I'll do it but we just don't think that he's going to do it and here are these disciples struggling going through and and Jesus is put in the Tomb they the disciples go back and and and and they're don't know what to do they're afraid Saturday was a a very very difficult day let's let's read Luke 23 I want to read about that man that was on the cross verse we'll start with verse 42 for time sake and he said unto Jesus Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour of the day and there was Darkness all over the Earth until the N 9th hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and when Jesus cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I Comm in my spirit and having thus said he gave up the ghost so when Jesus died over in the temple there was a curtain and this curtain inside the temple was in this area that only the high priest could go one time a year and then that high priest when he went in there he would make a sacrifice and atone for the sins of the people and then the presence of God would come in to that area into that holiest of holies was covered with a curtain thick heavy curtain and when Jesus died on the cross that curtain was ripped from the top to the bottom top to the bottom if you would have if it would have RI ripped from the bottom to the top any of us could grabbed it and maybe ripped it but it was God that broke that curtain think about that curtain how long was that curtain in the temple we don't know it could have been new it could have been there a year it could have been there for a hundred years we don't know how long that curtain was covering that holiest of holies but that curtain the greatest day of that curtain's life was when it was ripped in wow and it's the greatest day of our life when we are ripped into and we finally surrender to the Lord Jesus then after Jesus had died Joseph Vera got his body and he wrapped it and another man that came to Jesus by night this guy Nicodemus he uh didn't really want everybody to see he was a he was a a priest he didn't want everybody want to see was associated with Jesus but he came with Joseph of arthea because he Joseph couldn't have done it by himself so he takes this body and they wrap it up and I think probably the sisters were watching and I'm like yeah maybe they didn't do such a good job when they wrapped up Jesus so when they saw that then the sisters that same day on Friday remember the the Sabbath starts at sundown they went and they got a bunch of ointment and spices and they got it together and then they were going to go on the first day of the week and they were going to do it again they were going to embalm this Jesus with the spices so he's put in the grave he's there all day Saturday and then on Sunday morning as you saw the play The Sisters go to the tomb and and he's not there they go and tell the disciples Peter and John they run back and they they look in they look in there and he's they like he's gone he's not there Mary Magdalene was probably saying Hey listen he is risen the Bible says it was like idle Tales to them like what he's risen it's like guys he said he was GNA rise Mary believed it but so these brothers are like I just I can't I can't I can't really like digest all of this they were down Luke chap 2 24 verse 13 so while those disciples were talking about things a couple of them a couple of followers of Jesus they go on the road and they're walking to EMAs this town that's right really close there to Jerusalem and behold two of them went that same day to a village called theas which is from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden they shouldn't that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was Copus answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou Hast not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and the word before and mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and the rulers they delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done we thought he was Messiah but we were wrong he wasn't because he died yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the supplier so this morning these sisters were up there and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and a certain and certain of them which were with us went to the supplier and found it even as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken he said you don't remember what he said you don't remember the promises that he gave gave ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and then the spirit started to build they started to hear the word of God and they started to apply it to their lives ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh to the village where whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us like wow this guy is awesome he's special they didn't recognize him yet for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tr with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and they eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures at the lowest point in these brothers lives they were wrong we thought he was Christ we thought he was Messiah we thought he was all these great things we saw do these Miracles maybe he was just a prophet maybe he was just a good man maybe he was just maybe we were all wrong about this no Copus you weren't wrong he promised these things you just had to get really low before God could really speak to you then Jesus said he told his disciples he made a very strange statement he said take up your cross and follow me these things that I've suffered now you suffer them if you stand for me you're going to be hated so when we get down when we get low and it seems like things are just going so wrong no that's the time that God speaks and it's sad it's sad that the only time that he can speak in a human being's life is when he is so low that he just completely has nowhere else to go there was another guy I was witnessing to and he just wouldn't I was he's like oh you're you're you're wonderful and you're great and and I love all of this and and everything that you've said me it's it's such a blessing told me it's such a blessing from the Lord and and all and everything's just so good and then when he got what he needed I haven't talked to him since he just left just lip service he wasn't low enough but when you get so low that you have nowhere else to go then everything changes imagine that thief on the cross his worst day in his life life was his greatest literally it was greater than the day he was born as the proverb said that torn Veil the greatest day in that curtain was the day that it was ripped in half and torn up what was Jesus's greatest day wasn't Palm Sunday when everyone was singing his praises and everything was good it was when he bowed his head he said father into thy hands I commit my spirit the greatest day is my greatest day because that's the day that all my sins wiped away there was a a young brother that uh he's a good friend I haven't talked with him in a while but he's he's a good friend wasn't living for the Lord he was 20 in his 20s and he's just drinking partying doing what kids do sometimes and and he was just going down the wrong road and had this this girlfriend and and they were just there there wasn't there wasn't much to them but he got invited to a youth meeting and in this youth meeting the Lord started dealing with the young man and they were up at the altar and they were they were worshiping brother Josiah the musicians can make your way up they were they were worshiping and and he felt there was a call that was something was pulling on him and he was he didn't have a job he he was like I said he was he was doing drugs and and drinking and everything was just really bad in his life but there was something pulling on this young man came to the Altar and he was praying all the young people were up there and they were all weeping and and he was just just just everything was coming out and he was repenting and and he was crying on his sleeve of his suit of his new suit that he had bought and he kept wiping himself and and and praying and something inside of him said raise your hand up to the Lord and he looked down at his sleeve and there was snot and everything all over his sleeve he says I can't raise my hand I'm embarrassed everybody will see what's what's on on this he kept praying and something said raise your hand doesn't matter what everybody thinks of you he raised his hand and the Holy Spirit came down and filled the young man changed his life and he never went back from that point and then he went and led that young lady to the Lord now they're married have a beautiful family he was influencer on my son Daniel and his guitar he's a really great guy that a lot of the kids would look up to and he he when he changed then he was able to give something back to the youth he helped my son [Music] that day at the altar when he was as low as he could be then he was able to make a choice that was the best day for him this man that's this young man that's in jail right now let me tell you this is his greatest day he's in the he's in the cell right now what is he thinking about he's probably thinking about a resurrected Lord Jesus he's probably thinking about our conversation from a couple days ago where I told this is your greatest day this is the day that God's going to deal with you so why is Easter important to us why is the crucifixion important when Jesus said take up your cross look what I have done as a sister saying now you go do the same brothers and sisters none of us we have problems those problems are a blessing but none of us has stooped as low or hit as Rock Bottom as Jesus Christ did he knows what we go through if it's a child if it's a [Music] job if it's an attitude if it's a religion if it's a denomination if it's a judgmental Spirit he's he humbled me he humbled my wife with my kids to the point where we said Lord I don't care I don't care what it is I need you God I need [Music] you we need him but he went through it he suffered and he died so that we might live please brothers and sisters if things are going good if you think everything's okay fall down on your knees and thank God for his goodness and surrender your life to him as I said it might be sin but sin comes in many many different forms sin very very plainly comes in self-righteousness s sin very very often comes in judgmental [Music] ways [Music] brother in Christ alone my hope is found he is my life my strength my song this [Music] Cornerstone this Solid Ground firm through the fiercest drought and storm what Heights of love what depths of Peace when fears are still when striving cease my comforter My All In All here in the love of Christ I Stand think about these words in Christ alone who took on flesh amen the fullness of God in heless Fai this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to save till on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was a here in the death of Christ I live Brothers and Sisters Let's worship God now just just let aside everything that's in your life amen let go any type of any type of feelings that you have let go any type of of of thoughts and and ideas about how he should be and just say Lord I surrender to you let this Easter be a time that things change let it be a time that changes in our families let it be a time that changes in us don't forsake Him don't leave him there were two thieves on the cross two of them one on one side one on the other one of them could not do it the other one all he had to do was surrender and say I was wrong I've been a sinner my whole life and I I am ready to give my life to Jesus Christ brothers and sisters not just to go to heaven but because he is worthy he died he went through all of that if for no one else he went through it for me Daniel Evans he went through this for and I will love him for my whole life because he did it and I will preach him and I will lift him up I will give him my life and it's him and him alone any Minister that's worth anything will point to Jesus Christ and this Easter brothers and sisters if there is something in your life that you want to get rid of if there is if there is a dedication that that you want to make and you are welcome to come here at this Altar and make that choice and I would suggest that you do it if you haven't done it Jesus Christ is alive the Easter not only celebrates his resurrection but Easter celebrates his suffering and his death and he did it for me and he did it for you now the least that we can do is give him our lives let's all [Music] stand there in the ground his body lay Light of the World by Darkness slain then bursting forth in glorious St up from the grave he rose again and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine brought from the precious blood and as he stands and as he stands in Victory sin's curse has lost it grip on me for I am his and he is mine I'm bought with the precious blood of Christ no guilt in life no fear in death this is the power of Christ in me from life's first cry to find no breath I know Jesus commence my destiny no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ no power of hell no power of hell no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Stand I would suggest that if you don't know Jesus Christ in the way that you should know him I would suggest that you don't leave this building today until you meet him until you call out to him until and he answers brothers and sisters let me tell you there's Spirits all in this building right now there's the Holy Spirit and there's the spirit of the enemy and it's all working and the enemy spirit is so deceiving he's far beyond us but it's only through the power of the holy spirit

but don't if you are a child of God as Peter and the disciples were he will let us get so low that all we have we lose everything everything all we have is him I don't want to come to that point
