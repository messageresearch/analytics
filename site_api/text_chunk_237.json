[Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah help me sing this can't you see why I'm happy [Music] brother oh can't you see why I'm so happy I've [Music] accepted the word of of the Lord the reve word that was spoken by the prophet of Mal oh can't you see [Applause] [Music] one I'm so happy I've accepted the word of the Lord aren't you glad Pro of can't you see why this little bride so happy we've accepted the word of Our Lord the reveal word that was SP by the prophet of Caroline and I were talking about it just this afternoon wondering where would we be if it was for this great message maybe I'd be a Pentecostal still a Pentecostal pastoring a Pentecostal church maybe an evangelist traveling around from Pentecostal Church to Pentecostal church maybe some of you had still been on a bar stool maybe you had been in a Baptist Church or some other type of church but God's grace God's grace amen I'm so grateful for it Joel 2 verse 23 Joel 2 verse 23 and then we'll skip down to verse 28 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former for rain and the latter rain in the first month verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and he believes in true prophecy amen your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days while I pour out my spirit now for us that are westerners and having been under the influence of Christianity most of our life if you would have been a Jew when this was prophesied by Joel it would have seemed seemed like absolute heresy to you because prophets were the ones of Sal Visions nobody else prophets were the ones that had God's spirit nobody else so you can imagine when they heard this prophecy in their day and they thought this man was out of his mind prophecy is tricky you see prophecy has a timeline on it now I know that some of you have probably seen some of the videos that have been put together and um I've gotten several different ones in the last few weeks and it's been people charismatic preachers and different types of preachers that have taken the things that brother brandham said about seeing a woman either being the president it would be a woman president or the Catholic Church put it on YouTube and lots of people of course have seen it and they themselves if they didn't cover exactly the way he said it now you know what that's going to do since Cala was not elected yesterday as president the danger with prophecy is that it can look like prophecy and yet not be now if Kamala Harris would have been voted in by the people of the United States it still would not mean she was the woman the prophet saw that's right right so it has to be the right person the right time so whenever we look at Joel's prophecy it was exactly the same way and yet the Fulfillment of it they probably looked for it for years and years but a man anointed by the Holy Ghost for the season when it fell said this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel so sometimes we look at prophecy and we're thinking is this it is that it could that be it could that be it could that be it I don't mind telling you some message preachers put some things together a while back and I mean just by reading it on a couple of chats that I'm on I thought woo better be careful your brother you're going to get you're going to get in hornet nest here you're going to lay it out here to where if you're not careful you're going to get yourself hemmed up in a box that's why you don't hear me doing that ignorant stuff if God's Prophet didn't know whether or not as a woman or a church who are we that we think we do come on come on now so the best thing for us to do is just say Lord help me to find what's going on where the time is what's right I'm so glad that we can have that attitude I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray have a prayer call here for our brother Tyler I see him back there in the back tonight he had some needs he wanted us to to remember him for also I heard from Brother Wade and sister Anna altland today and they're in the need of prayer we have several of course in our church family that's fighting some real tough times right now sickness and things let's just remember them and take them before the Lord today Heavenly Father we count it oh once again such a great honor that we can be here on Wednesday night what a privilege how we love church on Wednesday night it just seems like it's such a boost for us Lord to help us I'm so glad that we don't have to go just from Sunday to Sunday I know there's churches all over the world and that's that's the only time they can get buildings and so on but I'm so grateful that we can have a midweek service lord it's just like another Holy Ghost Shop full of Holy Ghost steroids for us we just love coming together and singing and praising and praying and hearing your word thank you for it Lord I pray it never becomes common place to us Lord Jesus now as we approach you father we're asking for the needs among your children all the requests that was signified by the raising of a hand and we pray father that you would just help each one we have several in our church Lord that's dealing with some real difficult times right now we pray that you'd be mindful of them father I pray for brother Wade and sister Anna Lord that's so looking forward to being church tonight dear God that just things worked out to where they couldn't be but we pray that you'd be mindful of them this prayer cloth that I have in my hand tonight father from my young brother I pray that you'd minister to him Lord dear God help me tonight as I try to bring forth the word what you placed upon my heart today Lord help me to get out of the way Lord we we realize that our nation has come through a a very difficult time time a time of great Division and a lot of trauma and a lot of things that's that's went on and Lord I know that no matter how an election goes there's always going to be people disappointed but Lord I pray there may be people that we would differ with as far as our political views and all that but Lord I happen to know of an individual that at the last presidential election his wife got so distraught because it didn't go the way she thought it would and should and she got under such stress and such pressure that she wind up taking her life so Lord some of our fellow Americans tonight they're crying they're sad oh we may laugh at them cuz we're of the opposite party but they're still part of our nation Lord so I pray you'd help them because I realize Satan loves these opportunities to make people so despondent that they just take their life we know it don't make no difference who's in there anyway as far as being peace and bringing all that to the Earth there's only one that can do that and that's you but Lord however long that we can live here and have peace we certainly desire it but be mindful of us Lord God help us not to bring politics so into our lives and into our church that we don't even speak to one another because we're of a different political party and we can see it happening inside our message ranks not So Much by politics but by division of doctrinal issues help us I pray father will we ever grow up it's no wonder the Rapture hasn't come yet Lord it's a it's evident we've not grown up enough we're still fighting like children fighting like babies but help us I pray father speak to us your word may we have an element tonight Lord where we can grow as we hear your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated now just in case tonight some of y'all are Wonder wondering did I vote Yes I did and let me tell you how I voted because it was a three-way election that I voted in the prophet describes it this way God voted for me the devil voted against me and the outcome will depend upon which way I voted come on so you know who I voted for almighty God Amen so that way I win in every election it don't really matter thank you Lord aren't you glad that we're part of that tonight let us go immediately now into the resume of the church ages from the church age book page 377 and let's resume on what we've been looking about on the the latter rain the former and the latter rain truly this is part of the prophecy of this hour where we're living you know it's sort of like if you go into a mall and you could go this way or that way or that way or and and you don't know where where you're going um most generally when you walk in an entrance whether it's on the east side the West Side the north side South Side whatever it is whenever you walk into that and they're going to have this large kios type of thing there one of the first things that they're going to identify is you are here so you are here in front of Kirklands in front of you know bels or whatever it is but it just so happens you're not looking for that store you're looking for Sears or you're looking for whatever more but you can't get to the other place if you don't know where you are so you got to find out where you are and then find out okay ultimately what I'm wanting to do I'm wanting to get ready to get in the Rapture so I can leave this world is that what we want we want to be ready we believe we're in the age of the Rapture so we need to find out where we are so Satan doesn't always work only on trying to confuse the people of where they're going but try to confuse them of where they are now dis sensationally if he can confuse people and try to tell them that they're actually still under the third word or the third ray of light or they've not really moved into the fourth ray of light or the fourth word that God said would come in the last days then what they're going to do is there in proximity to where they need to go it's going to put them way off so they're trying to look and say okay so where are we where are we you see that's where with the majority of Christendom today they don't have no clue where we are prophetically so the Lutheran there's several dispensation behind the Methodist there's several dispensations behind the Pentecostals are behind for some of the message people that have gone no farther than just God Center Prophet they are behind also and why does Satan do that because he knows they'll never get to where they need to be if they don't know where they are it's one reason why that so many people constantly fight the thing do I have the Holy Ghost do I or don't I well sometimes I think I do sometimes I think I don't I believe I do after that service oh yes I know that I do and then a preacher will preach another service and it leaves you hanging well I'm not sure now I don't know where I'm at don't you understand why he does that it's to confuse you it's to confuse you with your walk with God you cannot have abundant growing revelatory Fai in your walk with God if you're still struggling am I Born Again or not am I just Justified or Sanctified I don't know I need to know where I'm at I mean those what I'm talking about now I believe with all of my heart that in this last days that God has given us a message that we can apply the token with but it is not just a message of the token it is a message of assurance that we can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have passed from deaths unto life and then what does that do that helps us to be identified with where we are well if we know we're truly born again then we know when we hear messages preached that are calling us to a closer walk with God then by that being able to identify where we are then we know that message is not telling us that we need the Holy Ghost it's telling us we need to let the Holy Ghost we have mature itself and grow out of us and we're being corrected in that way but if a person is constantly going back and forth well I don't know if I got the holy ghost or or not I think I do I don't know if I do or not whenever they hear sermons they process it through that mixed state because they don't know where they are it's time for every person in this church to know where you are with God men women boys girls every one of us so we can know exactly where we are so we can go on from where we are and be what God has called us to be now let's watch this also then how that the church ages parallel the individual walk before God so watch this in page 377 paragraph 2 this age started just after the turn of the 20th century now notice the time frame where we are this is in the resume of the ages and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now remember this is the age when the true Brad is going to return to being the way she was at Pentecost not UA Street Pentecost but the original now remember what makes it so confusing sometimes is because we have two dispensations that are going to be called by similar names so the original was called the original Pentecost then another one happens in 1906 what do they call it Pentecostal so both of them now are going to have a move of God now watch this it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost no she's not returning to be the church but the bride we know there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power so it's not just intellectual it's not just reading it's not just knowledge it's not just quoting quotes quoting scriptures but there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century now watch what's going going on the Believers sense this in their spirit so they're walking into the mall of God and they sense in their Spirit there's a promise there's a promise God God wants to restore God wants to send something back to us God wants to wants us to be on fire God wants us to have the manifestation of the gifts and the promised word and they begin to cry and they begin to pray now watch they're finding out where they are they're lacking something they need more now their Methodist grandmothers and grandfathers had shouted their mothers and fathers had become the Highway of Holiness people and some of the independent Pentecostals but it hasn't really yet merged so the Pentecostal is basically just a an upgrade on the the Nazarene and the Methodist but they still didn't have the restoration of gifts but they shouted and they more emotion was coming in the church services and they would pass out on the floor and they'd get fans and fan them and they' lay on the floor and theyd get water and pour it in their face I ain't talking about Pentecostals this was Methodist and Nazarene and hus people but now Watch What Happens what seemed to be the answer now you talking about tricky brother sister so genuine sincere people of God are seeking God's face they're sensing it in their Spirit they're looking at the mall directory as we would say and it's Sav you all are right here you need more than the methodus you need more than the nazarenes you need more and they began to pray and pray and what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit now remember the prophet said it seemed to be the answer so what did did they take this as oh my this is what they had on the day of Pentecost this is the original church it's happened again in California it's in Zeus the Street Revival this is it this is the original bride move come on now well it seemed that way I kind of figured y'all be quiet but I didn't think it'd be this soon it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration oh this is what we've waited for for years God said I'll restore sayith the Lord all the Canam all the Palmer worm the caterpillar I'll do it I'll do it now what's what's going on Satan is trying to confuse them on where they are and the prophecy at hand it all has to do with season and timing so they're convinced brother John this is acts two it's it's it's here it's on the earth now watch it was in believe that this this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not sir for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain amen the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but as far as they were concerned they didn't need him anyway so instead of looking by the word and saying okay well we are part of it but it don't end here there there comes something greater than us this is the restoration of gifts but instead of leaving their message where God put it as the restoration of gifts they said this is the definite evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost now when they added those few words words the spirit of organization got in this move then everybody that spoke in tongues as far as the way they looked at it had the Holy Ghost we've been there done that ain't we Lance oh yeah well as soon as you spoke in tongues that was it you got the Holy Ghost now think what Satan had done sincere people crying praying seeking God looking in the Bible hungering and thirsting after God no wonder the prophet said if it's God you seek be sure it's God you get right good advice don't you think now what so they thought and taught that what happened in 190 six was the light of rain but they had it backwards the light of rain can only come after the former Reign comes first and the prophet had not even been born yet certainly had not come to his maturity in his message to bring the word now notice as he goes on he says that the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come but we've got this group then that was come out in 1906 and they made the claim we are the original Pentecostals we are the original it's been born just like it was and Acts 2 but when you go to reading Acts 2 compared to what they had it wasn't or acts 8:16 or acts 8 or any of them other places praise the Lord but yet they made the claim to originality to originality you see the Catholic Church does exactly the same thing and the bride makes the same claim that's the very claim of all the churches they are the original well I'll tell you how we're going to know who is come on the one who leaves the world in a body change that's right that will be the latter rain and the latter rain will anoint their former Reign you see only those who receive the former Reign under the prophet's Ministry of Malachi 4 will actually have seed life to be anointed for the latter rain so Pentecost then had it B backwards now did they have great manifestation of gifts yes there was great healing there was signs there was wonders there was Miracles my brother Jim Woodson was telling us whenever we went over into badine North Carolina making some deliveries over there and some of his family was over there and he was telling us about some of the people and they used to prophesy and have prophecies that was just unbelievable the prophecies that they give out absolutely incredible not some of this gener IC stuff that we hear today but you you'll be here and you'll go there and you'll do this and you'll do that and happen exactly to the letter didn't it brother Jim and you know some of the ones even that I saw in Pentecost Lance and his family also have seen and some of you with your backgr but yet making that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the denominational spirit that Satan wanted now notice what he said thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we've kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power so can you imagine in a church meeting the Holy Ghost is falling and people are being blessed and getting saved and my speaking in tongues and whatever more that they were doing and demons were moving right in that same service and people were becoming possessed by demons and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences and this is what I say to us as message people if we are not careful we are heading to the same fulfillment of this quote right here we're going to make our own fences we're going to make our own this is what we believe and we don't believe nothing else but that period stop that's the end of it bless God I'll tell you one thing and if you don't see it the way we do you ain't going what what's the difference between us in any other organization when we do that my we can't even go to a to a Mee and because well I'll tell you one thing they don't believe this the way I do you know what if we're not careful we're going to get to a place we can't go nowhere we won't have no confidence in nobody but oursel and you get that away and you're losing fellowship with god well come on somebody say amen amen oh my notice they wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did look at all the fences friends that are around us look at the fences many of you that have been around the message for years and years you've been in one fence and into another and out of that one into another what's a fence for it's to group people or animals or something together and put a fence around them and keep them in there and not let nobody in or not let nobody out well bless God I'll tell you one thing you can't come to our church if you don't so and so we won't let you do who in the world gave you the keys to the kingdom who in the world made you the bishop over God's people and their souls to say you can't come boy if you don't have church the way we do at our church you ain't even having Church who made your church the example for everybody in the message well Hallelujah notice remember while Jesus was upon the Earth so was Judas each came from a different spirit spirit and upon death each went to his own place the spirit of Christ later came back upon the true church and the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now do you understand there are people in our message ranks that are working under the spirit of Judas they will betray true men of God they will lie on them sell them out for money or whatever working under the spirit of Judas there will be some preachers that will be saved if no more for the reason that God can prove to the devil he can do it some of the greatest troublemakers I've ever met in my life are men who said they're preachers let me tell you something every a man that says he's a preacher don't mean he's a man of God that's right there's all kinds of men that are preachers but it don't mean they God call in come on now don't get quiet on me already how do you judge them by the word not by signs so watch the spirit of Christ came back upon his church the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church now watch what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age can't you see why the devil is trying to come in our own ranks I know friends you may wonder why is brother Donny keeps saying this why does brother Donnie keep going this way because whether or not you understand it more and more preachers around this message are not preaching the message at all some of them won't even stand and read quotes anymore they won't even stand and make references to what the prophet taught in this day well if that's what you want I'll tell you one thing it's time for you to leave or me one because as long as I'm going to be here at this church I'm not only going to preach the Bible I'm going to preach to you the message of this hour it's going to take the message of this hour to get us out of here we've heard the story of Jonah we've heard the story of uh of Noah we've heard all of that it's going to take more than that to get us out of here and a body change it's going to take the message of Malachi 4 so the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost but my question to you is which one the Acts 2 version or the isusa street one cuz they are not the same that's why I'm not interested friends in mixing ausa street with what we have I've done been there and done that if I wanted that why in the world was I hungering for something more I should have just stayed where was ain't that right brother Larry but it didn't satisfy me when I was in it it sure won't satisfy me now after I've eat the good food I've been eating now oh my in her will be the fullness of Pentecost how many believes this amen for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at beginning the beginning that is is thus sayith the Lord now watch again in page 379 and he reads these scriptures in Joel 2 that I read to you when we open the service now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran AIDS did not restore the church it started a Reformation the westan AIDS did not restore the Pentecostal age now notice the Pentecostal age did not restore so why would I want to point you back to what Pentecost had when it did not restore it was an added element do we need it yes do we need justification what about sanctification well if we need them to then wouldn't you say we also need the restoration of [Music] gifts oh my but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of differentiation now the beginning notice in verse 25 Joel two the Locust cankerworm caterpillar Palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all those insects are of one and the same in different stages they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages notice organization denomination and false Doctrine do you understand many of the message people that we're not an organization and they think they're exempt because they're preaching false Doctrine it's the same Antichrist Spirit you may not have the structure of an organization that your head is in Cleveland Tennessee or up in akan Ohio but when you deny the word of God for the hour you're anointed by Antichrist I love this and the poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing facei but why is the Harvest rain going to fall on now you see whenever they would plant this and the prophecy that they gave he was taking the planting season as it would have been in the country of Israel and that part of the Mediterranean so they would get the early rains in the springtime and then they would break up the ground they would plant the seed in the ground wherever it was suitable depending on what type of product that they wanted and then the former rign they would sew that down and the seed would be planted and the latter rain would produce the crop so the latter rain depending on what it fell upon it would produce the crop look at our nation the state that it's in how do we get here because some of our fathers our grandfathers some of the Senate some of the Congress of years ago that started passing some of these liberal bills and these woke moves that's all around everywhere that's what's got us where we are now when a boy don't even know if he's a boy no more and a girl don't know if she's a girl no more come on Church what we've never thought would ever get to such a place my goodness that that our government would want to put tampons in a in a in a man's bathroom are you kidding me you mean we got men that are that insane yeah we do they are that insane and they want to run our government well praise the Lord and it's going to get worse and worse as we go in time oh but brother Donnie Donald Trump wanted he's going to take us back to God don't you believe that for one minute of your life there's only one way we're going back to God that is not by Donald Trump or the Republicans or the independent that's by the coming of the Lord Jesus I know a lot of people are making Donald Trump the Messiah he ain't my Messiah he is not my savior I'm looking for my Lord Jesus to come amen oh Hallelujah notice this my my next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing F so when the Harvest rain falls on the bride who's been feeding for years on this revealed word what will it produce in her it will turn her inside out she's feeding and storing that word up in her soul her soul will manifest that final attribute of God inside of her and it will start from the inside of her soul and come out to her body her eyes will change her hair will change her limbs will change and in a moment in a twinkling of an ey she will be chain why because she's been feeding on the anointed word of Malachi 4 and the light of rain which is rapturing Faith is going to fall on him what's it going to do to the World Council of churches head up in the person of the devil in the form of the Antichrist come on somebody what's he going to do to the nations of the world they're going to gather in the plains of the field Where I Stood many years ago in the valley of megiddo as I stood up there where Elijah had stood there near his cave and look to the left as far as you can see and look to the right as far as you can see and there in the valley of magto and they will gather together all the nations of the world and the L of rain's going to fault and what are they going to do try to kill the Jews and they're going to come against them and the Lord Jesus will come but you and I won't be there as far as down on the earth we're going to come back riding on white horses why we have been anointed to fly we have been anointed to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man and when the Lord Jesus comes to fight the battle of Armageddon and he'll look around behind him and say come on children go with and there will come the Bride of the Ephesian age of the samna age of the Sardis age of the thyra age and there will be as that bride Hallelujah the resurrected dead anointed by the latter [Applause] rain Hallelujah notice this thus at this very moment moment we're in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and who is that that shall attempt to deceive the very elect while the spirit of the Antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus' name wow so you mean they're not just saying father son Holy Ghost they've updated they're saying in Jesus name claiming they have been anointed by God for the last day they are the false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word never they have added to it or taken from it now listen this is the tricky part no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it notice the difference now some of them will deny it others will just bypass It Go Around It Don't Preach anything don't say anything that's going to cause anybody any problems you jellyfish well we believe in Holiness here but we we we we ain't going to preach it for about 35 years we're going to see if we can win somebody in it might be that very thing they need deliver to their minis skirts well praise the Lord hallelujah notice but the deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain so whether it's monetary or following or numbers uhhuh so they just you know scur around certain things don't you understand every true man of God will be faced with that Temptation right there every one of them and he will know it and he will see it and he can look at one side and see if he just skirts around certain things Don't Preach this don't say that don't say that you'll be more liked you'll be more accepted you'll have a bigger following you'll have this and that and the other and then he'll see the other side the harder way the narrow way people will walk away from you they'll turn back from you they'll ridicule you they'll run you down they'll stab you in the back they'll do this that the other well what person as far as feelings wouldn't rather choose the easier way oh yeah sure everybody will like me man aive them and who wants you know who wants to be shot at and who wants this and that and the other who wants to do all that sort of thing so every servant of God will face that challenge every one of them and it's not like they'll face it once some some some of them will face it over and over again because God is using them to prove to the devil I've still got some boys down on the earth in the latest in age you compromise and you'll do everything you can devil but you can't get my boys cuz they're born of my jeans oh yeah watch this oh my they deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach listen salvation and deliverance through the power of God so they're not sing there offering you a rosary they're not telling you to pray to St Andrew for this and St Anthony for that and you know St Joseph for this and that and the other they are preaching Deliverance by the salvation of the Lord Jesus and preaching Deliverance by the power of God just like Judas was a Ministry imparted by Christ remember he tells us in the church age book that Judas did not have an inferior Ministry so un like the 11 they were all anointed and they casting out devils and you know doing all the supernatural things and Judas is just kind of carrying along nothing ever followed his ministry and he couldn't ready preach I imagine he is probably one of the most charismatic preachers in the whole bunch I imagine that dude had Miracles that was phenomenal makes you think no I Miracles that was so phenomenal you've heard me say it from years and years ago that when the Lord Jesus said one of you is going to betray me they questioned thems before they even questioned him when you look at the Last Supper and the way that they set they didn't set the way we set like this you're setting this way but they prostrated themselves on Long sofas and they would have been leaning back one against the other Judas was right by the Lord Jesus and when they look at him at the table they thought oh no he's fixing to take Jesus place he already had the money Jesus really trusted him even though he was a thief that's right when they said it's the last supper and they come in and sit down and they looked up there sitting at the table here's the center of the table arced sort of like this and they looked up there and there was Judas and he said oh dear God Judas must be going to take over Jesus had been telling us he's going to leave I knew Judas was a Preacher Man I knew that guy had Supernatural I didn't know he was going to take over well it wasn't actually that Judas was going to take over Judas was going to be taken over Satan having now entered into the heart of Judas Simon's son Jesus knowing all things have been given to him by the father oh Lord he was so close they looked right at him and didn't see it Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you and one of you is a devil not going to be but already is imagine Jesus having a devil in his ministry team wow notice oh my they preach out salvation and deliverance to the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal wow but it is leot toan not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them startling signs so not something that could be questioned but a sign that is so phenomenal it would be startling boy I got you thinking tonight ain't it yeah good deal startling signs among them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger a so they preach the coming of Christ but they don't preach the bride coming of Christ and they don't preach the coming of Christ to reveal himself in profit form in the last days remember he tells us in sort 1965 the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he will come according to Luke 1730 let me just tell you what God's given to us so there was a family that lost an 18-year-old son brother Welch Evans and his wife so they were tore a piece and brother Brandon was out of town they try to call get in touch with him they call Billy Paul brother Brandon returns to call he says brother wel the Lord hasn't showed me anything about your son I I I don't know he hasn't showed me you can find this in Sister Angel's book gener ations testimonies so he said let me let me see let me pray let me see if I can find something from the Lord so he told them he searched the regions the regions and couldn't find him nowhere so he went back to where the automobile that he was in hit a truck so he went back to that place and then he calls brother welz and tells him he must have been in the passenger seat up front because I saw the wreck so you imagine God lets him now see the wreck again in a vision and he said I saw the wreck and when the car hit the truck I saw a light go out of the passenger side in the front seat and it went up before the Throne of God brother Welch if you want to know where your son is right now he's talking to my daughter Sharon Rose glory to God and brother wch if we could ask him did he want to come back he would tell you Daddy I don't want to come back and he said when you see him again to him it will only seem like he's been gone from you for three [Music] minutes for three minutes why they've broke into eternity why would God save all these secrets of the sixth dimension for us in the last day because we had to find out where we were and where we're going when we leave here and where our loved ones are and they are not dead and there's something about hearing it preached and we're talking about it you notice that atmosphere as it started changing when I started talking about that what is it hearing that present day truth brings us closer to that dimension remember it's not but 20 ft from us for those of you that was here the other night and brother Lewis is and I I preached about changing his address and brother Lewis had signed a change of address notification and I gave his new address 20 6 and seven 20 ft from us sixth Dimension seventh Church age 26 and 7 amen hallelujah but remember we're not just going to 26 and 7 but we're going to wind up on 8 because 8 is a new beginning The Eighth Day speaks of Eternity why was it that God never allowed Paul to preach the message of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride why was it reserve for us in this last day why couldn't Peter preach things that are to be it was reserve for the bride at the end time those that are going to be a living Remnant Hallelujah when the lter rainfalls she'll already have them seeds in her heart she'll already have the future home she'll already have recognizing your day and the lighter rain will fall on that seed Oh Glory to God so you imagine Lance and you four girls the next time you see your mama to her alone to be like she's gone about 3 minutes Paul's been there for 2,000 years over 2,000 years but it's like you just arrived they ain't going nowhere they ain't got nothing to do they ain't got no times ain't got no clocks they ain't got no schedules they've just arrived they broke into eternity Hallelujah where was that oh let me find myself here they preached the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though empowering signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all can anybody give me a big hearty Amen to [Applause] that ah yes this false spirit in the last day is so close to the real it can be distinguished distinguished only by its deviation from the word wow but he's already told us that they can have signs wonders Miracles right preach salvation preach Deliverance but wonder what they'll deviate from apparently they're not going to deviate from salvation not going to deviate from Supernatural come on well this is kind of one of them services that get you thinking don't it now watch and whenever it is caught and being anti- word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God [Music] we're getting people saved people's getting healed we get results don't we we have to be of God ah what crucial times are these in which we live can everybody say Amen to that how careful we must be that we remain True to this word and not take from or add to it for he who would speak what God has not spoken makes him a liar so for some around the ranks of the message is simply taking away the need to assemble ourselves together we don't need to we've got the tapes we've turned our homes into churches there before we go to church every day cuz we play tapes every day in our home so we really don't need to go to church because our home is our church and we don't need one another and we don't uhuh so you just took away that's right from what your very Prophet said Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors back there to open to get in and fellowship with your brothers and sisters and if you don't feel like that I'll tell you it's time you got to praying but you see reason we say oh well Ephesians 4 says that he gave some Apostles and and some prophets and some pastors because some people need them your name was just took from the book of life you are twisting Ephesians 4 to match your own ideology reading the original Greek it does not even implied in such a way so some people need to go to church but we don't cuz we listen to tapes and we really don't need to yeah you just added to and took away think of it friends think of it oh Lord Jesus what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God sending forth manifestation in tongues and interpretation and prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word Drew up a doctrine that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues was far from evidence they were manifestation but not evidence the falsity of the doctrine can all oh my not only be seen by lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribed to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of the doctrine proven they were not in the truth as they would have people believe oh it look good it look look like the return of Pentecost now you realize there some of the preachers in our message that's going around and preaching you know if you're not having meetings like this with them preaching of course in your church you better leave your church now they don't go ahead and tell you the rest of it but I'll go ahead and tell you the rest of it leave the church you're going to and move to their church cuz we're the one that's got the move of God now you see what that's doing it's making another denomination so then whoever believes like we believe we're the ones with the move of God well I wonder if we judge the Ephesian Church by your church or the Corinthian Church by your church one if to have the type of meetings you have in your church in Corinth so I don't understand why God didn't make your church one of the original 12 and instead of making them the original 12 and told you to be like them instead of them trying to be like you whoa we got a problem here Houston but you see what they do oh we're it we're it we've got it boy we've got the brides move how many brides revivals have we have and they put a fence around it and when you do you're cutting yourself off Word of Life Church please I beg you as a servant of God don't never do that to us amen we will cut ourselves off from God when we do it and it won't happen immediately it never does but in time we'll sever ourself from the rest of the body and then we are this Elite whatever we think we are and we look down our nose at everybody else and you know what God will do God will move right around us and reach out there and get grab a hold of alley rats if he has to he'll do whatever he's got to do don't think that we have any Monopoly on God don't think that you can say who can go to heaven and who can't go to heaven don't think that you can say well bless God I'll tell you one thing I don't this God ain't asking you God is telling you what his word says and expects you to do it is that right no it proved it wasn't it could not before for it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were deceived now if it wasn't the genuine what was it it was the husk the CHF in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing but as you go into the field and see what looks exactly like wheat and yet it's only the husk for the wheat seed had not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain Yet to Come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been buried at N Sea it sent up a shoot at Sardis it grew a tsel at Philadelphia it was a mature to look at leaa but it would not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet yet come upon the scene but now according to the time wherein we stand in the Le of and age the prophet messenger of Revelation 10:7 must already be in the land praise the Lord once more thus saith the Lord must be here already oh Hallelujah to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the Harvest but what happened in every one of these ages they were living in a glare of the past age notice this an identified Christ what was the matter with the Lutheran living in the glare of the Lutheran age when John Wesley found the secret of sanctification they couldn't go they were living in the glare of Luther's age what happened to the Pentecost is why wesle was organized until he was living the glare of another age that was in Wesley's age when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals they were living in what Wesley said sanctification it was hard for them to believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the gifts they was living in the glare of another age now we find out that now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're Plum past that amen well tell me how can I be past it if I've got people trying to tell me I need to go back to it come on now brother Donnie are you saying well that we're past it we don't need it no no we took the truth out of that that's right and brought it with us God sent justification what they do they formed an organization out of it God called the elect out they pulled the truth of justification out with them and merg it into the new message sanctification is that right then what did they do sanctification they formed an organization around that and then God sent the restoration of the gifts over and over again the prophet calls it that for Pentecost restoration of the gifts and they took justification sanctification merged it right in with the restoration of gifts and then they could look back at the westl move and say we're beyond that it didn't mean they didn't believe in sanctification when the prophet said we're Beyond Pentecost it don't mean that we're beyond the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost but we're in another time frame and the church said so do we believe in justification if your bride you do do we believe believe in sanctification do we believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the message that Martin Luther brought of justification was all right for Luther's age but that's as far as it went sanctification was fine in Wesley's age that was as far as it went then we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing it was fine in the age but we're going beyond that now we are beyond that now come on CH it's got to where that you can't even read quotes like this in certain message churches they will shut down on you when it gets to where I cannot preach the message of the hour it's time for me to stay home yep if I can't preach the message I'll stay at the house I mean until y'all want me to go somewhere else Do We Believe It or Not we've got to become Beyond this thing because we've done the same thing with it they did before make an idol amen out of it I belong to this order of it I belong to that order notice he doesn't call it denomination but he calls it order God will send somebody that'll smash that thing amen and tear it to Pieces praise the Lord and confirm his word the full word notice praise be to God now we see that's true God rich in his Mercy let us stand let me share one more with you tonight Luther went to husk with his first word that just shall live of Faith Wesley had two words sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts remember the Pentecostal message is the restoration of the gifts the bride's message is more than restoration of the gifts praise the lord it's that plus Pentecost had the third word restoration of gifts but the entire seed has to come forth notice Luther had a word Wesley had a word Pentecost had a word but the fourth word is the entire seed no wonder Satan wants to keep people in a glare of the age behind them because they focus on one word or another one word or another one word why stop at restoration of gifts when we can get the entire seed which includes all the gifts amen I took her the other day after the service on Sunday was talking about receiving the love of God or the god of love and I told her I was sitting at the house Sunday afternoon and just going back through the service and the word and stuff and I said you know our daughters have a portion of your love our church has a portion of your love your mother your siblings your nieces your cousins but I have you you and I said it's the same with me people in our church have a portion of my love I said Harry my brother mention Justin my sister-in-laws and mention my grandchildren my my daughters but I said you have me and know me in a way unlike any of them do amen you know me when I'm down you know me when I'm low oh you just be around me and tell why cuz she has me I don't want just one word amen I don't want just two words I don't want just three words I want him and if I get him I get the gifts now if anybody tells you that brother Donnie don't believes the gifts you look them in the face and you tell them they are a liar I believe in the gifts and I want every one of them that God wants you in our church but I cannot produce them amen and neither can you amen oh my you see how they denominated on one word and another word and another word but there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there that has to produce itself again on a bride justification yes sanctification yes gifts yes but remember people focus so much on speaking in tongues and brother brim said speaking in tongues was the least of all the gifts and okay uh I'll admit it I am really weird okay you can you can nod your head that's okay not going to hurt my feelings I am weird I am strange I'm bizarre I have some very unusual thoughts I believe in all nine spiritual gifts instead of just three three was what I heard mainly talked about in Pentecost three is what mainly here and talked about in the message I wonder why we don't want the other six so when we pull up all these quotes about gifts of the Spirit do we not know there's six more included in that yes for our church I don't want just tongues interpretation or prophecy I want Discerning of spirits which will be two or three Witnesses that will discern when somebody's speaking in tongues and then they'll sign their name on it amen and say tell brother Dave tomorrow not to go to that certain job that he's got set because coming through there'll be a an American propane truck come through about 12:00 and if he's there it's going to blow up and it'll blow that whole house where he's at tell him not to go thus sayeth the Lord amen and then it's laid up on the platform here this way the prophet Tau it I know we don't want it wonder if that's one of them words wonder if that's one of them words that somehow we think we have a superior understanding to than our Prophet messenger brother sister when we head that way we're headed for trouble that's right I don't care how long you've preached how much you've sung shouted jumped jerked whatever you've done who in the world in this message thinks they have got more understanding than the prophet messenger that God sent to bring us this way m m let me close with this seeds on air with a shock once a carrier of a true word justification then it became a carrier of sanctification then it became a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going back try to eat something Mana from another day it's rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that plus amen I'm sorry well no I ain't sorry actually you're not keeping from me my pluses amen you're not going to hem me up on justification saying we ain't going no farther I've done been farther than that you ain't going to hem me up on sanctification and you certainly ain't going to H me up on gifts and say well this is the light of the day this is the bride's Revival I'm sorry I had that years ago amen amen I've got that already I've had gifts of the Spirit in my life since I was a kid amen God's given me many words from people amen God used me when I was a kid I go pray for people he put it on my heart Carol's been with me one to man at Uncle's house one time and I just a boy me and Carol just got married and I told him said I'm not sure why I'm here can I go in your bedroom I said sure I mean this acting real scared and I was too I didn't know what in the world was going on out I knew was the Lord had sent me up there so Carol stayed in the living room prayed with them I went in there I started praying praying praying come out in a few minutes the Holy Ghost all over me I couldn't hard him stand still shaking and quivering like a leaf so I said can I pray for you'all I said yeah yeah there's real scared I started praying God prayed out of me the very secret of their hearts God prayed out of me things they had discussed before I got there you believe God still does the same thing that's this man right here and this one right here when they were traveling the other day and they were delivering some disaster relief to the flood deal and all that come back to service the next day and they they they said it sound like brother donning was riding in the truck with us how in the world did he know that I didn't but God does why same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost come on children he is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart the word is not a man come on I'm not looking for a man to tell me what my name is I've know that since I knee high to a grasshopper I'd rather have the word discern my very heart let that word discern you what does it do it brings his presence right down where we are do we believe in that that's the kind of gifts I want in our church yes we got that plus until Jesus Christ is Manifest in the fullness of his power I'll get to you I'm on a detour I know you don't know it but I'm on a detour but where the Prophet said that the fullness of the son of man will be among his people in the last day deity the fullness of the godhead bodily on the earth in the form of a bread so no I'm not stopping at justification I'm not stopping at the restoration of gifts I want the giver amen I've got to go further back than isusa Street I've experienced ausa Street and I wasn't satisfied I've shouted I've run I've danced brother Chuck Dixon and I were sitting in a location a certain night under a tent a very strange presence come on the platform everybody else was gone remember brother Chuck was sitting there I seen an angel of the Lord walk around the outside perimeter of the tent tent was rolled up my hair stood upon the back of my neck like that and I seen him standing out there the spirit of God spoke to me and said go meet him I said Lord I'm afraid I said brother Chuck I just seen an angel of the Lord I've got to go out and pray brother Chuck said Lord have mercy brother Donnie he got down on the platform hit his face like this on out found a solitary place where the presence of God come I was a Pentecostal he told me something about my Ministry and things that would happen I've experienced that but why did it leave me hungry why did it leave me searching I saw a little Carside boy one time come up for prayer I laid my hands on him I watched almighty God straighten his eyes out straight as they could be I did it leave be Hunger for More don't just give me one word two words three words give me the volume of the book amen Lord Jesus help us to that father Lord God God we we thank you for what what we've experienced and what we've had Lord we don't want to stop with one word or two words oh those experiences that I've had and some of them I've had Lord I'll never repeat because they're just meant for me and you to know but yeah Lord the ones I've had have been wonderful but Jesus Jesus I still crave a hunger a thirst and I read a statement the other day where your Prophet said what we need so much in the church is a Revival of love I've thought oh my goodness is this part of that Capstone a Revival of Love setting down on the bride right before she goes away help us Jesus add to our justification add to our sanctification add to our restoration of gifts word upon top of word on top of word justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the bap baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself it's amazing that the prophet said there was something more that he had to preach to his church he preached many them great sermons The Seals and Christ of mystery warning then judgment all that and he said now there's something more there's another step for this church and that was the token oh Jesus we love your signs we love your Miracles oh God I long to see more of them but Lord God I not going to Major on just healings and deliverances and signs and wonders God I want people that are so in love with you and so in love with each other Lord God that people can talk about them and run them down and whatever and they're so full of the love of God that they're praying for forgiveness let's talk about being like Jesus then Judas could heal like you but he couldn't love like you oh Jesus help me to love like you help me to forgive like you help me Lord to draw a bigger Circle it seems that as we go on in time let's message people are getting better and better and better at drawing smaller circles instead of bigger ones and we sure didn't get that from our Prophet messenger cuz men told him they were drawing him out and he said whenever you do Brothers I'll just draw you right back in people don't have to draw us out anymore we'll draw them out and throw them out forgive us God help us to get out from under this sectarian anointing in the last days Lord Jesus help us God lord I've been wondering and thinking about all this flood relief and I've heard so many different testimonies of people in our community and people from Elizabeth and Johnson City and different ones I heard another one yesterday people that had heard all kinds of things about us criticized us and said this and that even one man said the Lord rebuked him for things that he had said about us cuz he found out what he had said and what he had heard wasn't even the truth some of the finest people ever met in his life he said so Lord let our light shine let them see Jesus let them Feel Jesus when around Lord oh hallelujah we're not handing out Church age books and seal books we don't have message water we don't have message Cheerios it's just plain old Cheerios but it's bride delivering Cheerios and the bride delivering poptarts and crackers and baby Dippers Hallelujah let them sense it Lord Jesus Jesus let our light so shine father I pray we worship you tonight Lord you didn't say by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you cast out Devils because you have Miracles because you said in Matthew 24 they'll come before you in that day and say they've done all that and I'll say to them depart from me I never knew you but you said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have such love it's recorded by some of Nero's historians and some of those and the other Emperors that when they would bring the Christians to burn them to kill them they kept commenting about the love they had not only for each other but for their enemies so before before they would light the Torches and set some of our brothers and sisters on fire our brothers and sisters would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness they would put sheep scans on their children and turn them loose in the Coliseum and turn the dogs the leopards the Lions loose on their little children dressed up like sheep and make them parents stand there and watch it and then parents would bow their heads and pray for their forgiveness and we wonder why we're not any closer to you if somebody does something to us we'll never forgive them we'll hold a grudge against him the rest of our life and say we're restored I wonder Jesus help us God we hold things against people and get bitter and then say we're bright and our brothers and sisters had to watch their babies brains be beat out wives watch their husband's guts be tore from their bodies and pray for their enemies and we say we've got the same Holy Ghost and if people people cross us we cut them off won't have nothing to do with them forgive us Lord forgive us Lord anybody willing to say that with me tonight forgive us Lord for us forgive us teach us how to love Jesus we worship you father we bless your name Lord oh Hallelujah can we just raise our hands in the presence of the God who is love thank you Lord teach us how to live in love and dwell in the land of love oh we'd rather dwell in the land of the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders or the financial blessings and live in the land of the material live in the land of Lea as Carol and I saw a video on YouTube the other day of Russia's new bomb called Satan to they can send it from Russia to any place around the world in 30 minutes and under it can have multiple Warheads up to 15 Warheads on one missile 500 times the power that was on the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Hypersonic and so far we have nothing to catch it or stop it and they can control each of those Warheads so they send it up above the Earth's atmosphere in an arc way above her radar can read it and then they bring it straight down and when they come down so far say over Central States they can designate one head to go War of the Warhead to go to New York another of remember all nuclear one to go to Los Angeles one to go to Colorado one to go here one to go there and there we look up and there they are well I say we we're not going to be here and they called the name of that missile Satan to and they're new super Hypersonic plane that's going to carry it it's called Spirit messenger but don't look for me cuz I'll be gone cuz I've done got under another Spirit messenger praise God that's why you ain't taking this message Away From Me Brother Don ain't you tired of it are you kidding me I get hung up on tapes I've been listening to spoken words original seed for the last month and a half so I bounce from it to end time seed sign preach the next day and then I go from that to Pirate transformation then I go back to spoken words original S I think Lord Is this never going to end we've broke into eternity don't you love him oh how many wants to live and dwell in the Land of Love let's just open our hearts tonight before we go I know you got to work you got school tomorrow I know all that I hate to I hate to hold you on Wednesday night but

straight to your car and go to the house let's just love him a little he's come tonight to tell us where we are and he's come to show us the journey and he's come to tell his children don't stop at one word or two words or three words but take the entirety of it bring Discerning of spirits with it bring tongues with it bring interpretation but don't major on a minor don't let all your studying being on the gifts of the Spirit my goodness I've done just out of curios this week I I studied the words looked at the words gifts of the Spirit and put in quotation marks so it would only pull up those words from 1947 to 1965 our Prophet mentioned those words 73 times through a span of 1947 to 1965 and some preachers are mentioning it every service you say what's wrong with us and you go to looking at love and you go to look at at forgiveness and you go to look at some of these other things thousands of times are we balanced or all way off somewhere may God help us har sing something let's let's worship Him can we can we just close our eyes now and just for a few moments we're going to leave this we're going to leave this building here in Rapture we're going to just try to lay our burdens aside and your workload of tomorrow and your test and whatever you have to do you're troubled about your math and your biology and maybe some of your brothers have got a business transaction or whatever but just let tomorrow's evil take care of itself let's just get called up into his presence now this a name of this series I've been preaching to you now for several years getting in the spirit let's get in the spirit again of Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelation 10 not just 107 but 1 to 7 you see the prophet preached Revelation 10:7 for years something happened to him and he started included verses 1 to six so he started preaching Revelation 10 1- 7 I don't want to just preach Revelation 107 I want to include verses one to six I don't want just healing I don't want just signs I want to be a preacher that can forgive I want to be a preacher that can be talked about run down lied on stabbed in the back by message prates used abused lied on everything that you can imagine some things you can't even imagine believe it or not friends I'm a miracle before you tonight if it was not for the holy ghost in my soul I would be one of the most bitter resentful human beings you had ever meet you know what would have made me that way Christian people a lot of them preachers but the difference is I got the Holy Ghost yes and the Holy Ghost helps you through all those things

have a testimony from a brother John Taylor word of this is to the Word of Life Church all is well with us our daughter Emily for whom we have asked for prayer for a year ago following the death of her husband has come all the way back praising God all the way she has learned to turn things over to God to call on him frequently and to trust him to take care of it and to thank him constantly the physical and emotional toll of the preceding three years have been huge and we have been very concerned at the time prayer was answered somebody say praise the Lord amen thank you Lord Sister Laura wo wants to thank uh God for being able to be back in the house of the Lord today thank you for your prayers cards messages I'm getting stronger and have a doctor appointment this week for followup appreciate your continued prayers God bless my precious church family we love you all so much well we like the wo family pretty decent too don't we amen Ed jablonski who is having surgery for an aneurism and needs prayer that's brother Eddie's father so he certainly want to pray for that need this morning want remember brother Joe Green and his assembly brother Jean Gordon passed away a a longtime Deacon and family members so we want to remember those folks that as we pray today thank you for your prayers my first two weeks of chemo treatments went well and uh with almost no reaction to the medication I have two weeks off then we do this again two weeks on two weeks off in that cycle please continue to pray that the chemo treatments are doing their job against the intruded uh sales in my body your prayers mean so much to me again thank you God bless you and praise the Lord Brother Glenn tamlins somebody say thank you Lord praise God just for his uh continued recovery and ask God to just be with him during his uh his ongoing treatments brother Keith Phillips is very sick this morning with the GI virus he's had for the last three days he wanted to be in the service today but just was not able so we want to certainly continue to remember brother Keith brother Bert sister barbar we want to thank the Lord for his goodness for all he's done for them and they're streaming the service and we just would dedicate this service to them this morning uh brother Chris connley and sister Sharon many of you know them the couple that's been coming over from over in Hendersonville North Carolina V being a part of our assembly his father passed away suddenly I believe on Thursday or Friday and they're just uh just very very very shocked by this and they're asking that we would remember those folks in prayer as we pray today also Fred Jones a good friend of ours is going to be having surgery on Tuesday Morning asking that we would remember him in prayer so let's remember that sister Bonnie Potter s to please pray for my daughter Leah and her family urgent unspoken prayer requests the Lord knows all about also we wants to want us remember her son Davey he's asked for us to pray for his boss's son Jared Pritchard he has cancer so we want to remember that prayer request today as we pray all the unspoken prayer request I know there's many needs in our assembly but let's come all these things unto the Lord Brother Joel if you take us to the Lord in prayer this morning buddy B hearts and heads Heavenly Father what a friend we have in you and when we go through these things and we hear of these circumstances among others Lord we know that we have confidence in our friend and I love how the prophet places it Lord he makes it such that our relationship with you is even closer than friendship he says that God wants to come down and be buddies and so father we can share things with buddies not that we wouldn't necessarily with friends so much but Lord we bring these needs unto you and we just know that you will meet them Father according to your will and purpose and when we don't understand father when we have to scratch our heads when the doctor turns and walks the other way and says there's nothing more that can be done and even when it seems like even within ourselves there there's no more that we can pray and we don't even know how to pray at times Lord you come on the scene and you move and these are not just words that we speak these are not just fairy tales that we read about but we serve a true and the Living God and that same God you yourself came and began to dwell in this Humanity these old frangible Dusty devilish frames in which we live father you chose to live in these bodies and so father May the words that you've spoken Lord may we take them Upon Our Hearts and speak to these needs Lord if we know these individuals may we find an opportunity in place that we can go lay our hands upon them or speak a word to them Father that would bring encouragement and even healing bring Victory and bring deliverance and bring encouragement father this this is what we've called been called to do in this age not just to come to church and hear words father from a man that's preaching but Lord we're to take these words that's our identification and these things are real to us and so father may we be put on display and may we have these opportunities father we look for what you're going to do in this service today may all thoughts that are unlike you be moved out of the way may all purposes all plans Lord we don't even know if we'll walk out of the building today so while we're here we're going to glorify you we're going to extol you we're going to magnify your name on high father that's why we are here this place may you come and fill it father with your presence and may we be receptive when you come by and may it be like the the Saints as they were walking that day father May our hearts burn within us by the things that we'll hear today everything may it be anointed and submitted to you and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord ushers if you want to come

when the doctor shook his head and said she's gone you could feel that father's heartbreak you could hear them crying Lord their little girl was only 12 years old then somewhere in the distance outlined against the sun there came a man on a mission from the throne said look somebody's coming but what they did not know it was their promise coming down that dusty road there's a promise coming down that dusty road and from your holy hands healing virtue FL he's got the kid of what you need death and hell he did defeat there's a promise coming down that dsty road well their Wonder turned to mocking when Jesus did speak he said your daughter's not dead she's just asleep and then he turned to the unbelievers and he told them all go home they heard him say leave me and death alone then he laid his hands upon the child he looked death right in the eye he said all power of Heaven and Earth belong to me and with a voice that sounds like thunder he HED at the Sun and then he said little

I'm so glad he's been faithful when I've not he's been faithful when you have not but he cannot deny himself so that's what we're grateful for he cannot deny himself so if he puts a deposit of himself in us he cannot deny that we greet you today in the name of the Lord certainly welcome you to the house of God the visitors that are here with us we welcome you into our gates let's turn to the Book of Revelation if you would Today Chapter 1 verse4 read a couple of places in the in the scripture I've been speaking about the bride's Bill of Rights and I I'd like to pick up again today by the help of the Lord on the right to a spiritual priesthood as the elect of God Revelation 1 ver4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins I love this in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests now remember we don't deserve it there's nothing we could do to ever gain it but he has made us this himself made us Kings and and priest unto our God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Revelation 5 verse 9 as John picks up again about the priest and this is after the lamb now has opened the book after The Lamb opens the book tears the seals off then this is what takes place in heaven and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth God hasten the day that'll happen how may like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you let's hold our request in our hearts before the Lord Lord Jesus we count it such a privilege that we could be gathered here today already sensed your presence and for that we're so thankful we realize Lord that as Mortals one day we're going to have to stand before you we're have to give an account for our life every day every hour every moment that we've lived help us I pray father that we will realize when we stand before for you that day many of the things now that take up so much of our time will be absolutely worthless we would have will wished so desperately we would have taken more time for the things that really matter for those that stand before the white Throne every thought every wrongdoing every evil will Flash before them by then there'll be no mercy so while there is Mercy now father we want to ask you forgive us forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings help us that we can be more in love with you than we've ever been in our entire lives help me today Jesus to get out of the way speak the word to our hearts we present our needs to you now father we commit the service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated it was actually God who instituted the priesthood in the Old Testament to give his people a goet the priesthood would bring sacrifices from the people into God's presence because every Jew was not allowed to go directly into the presence of God God allowed them to build a tabernacle and then a temple God's presence came and Sanctified those two places and made their sacrifices and their offerings acceptable the people would stand on the outside while the priest was on the inside doing this work of reconciliation and Redemption for them but the priests themselves were not any more qualified than the people were unless they came through a process to make them fit to stand in the presence of God they were first called by God the tribe of Levi and then they were also anointed by Moses at the time and they were sanctified IED or set apart for a man to walk in there even though he was a levite without being anointed he would die without being set apart Sanctified he would die so when we come to the New Testament and then we look at What the Lord Has Done to start a church a bride a new kingdom a new order of a different type of priesthood a priesthood that will not offer Pascal Lambs or a bulock or an incense or trespass offering but we will offer ourselves we will offer the fruit of our lips we will raise our hands and offer that to God we will bring him so many things but none of them are for sin or for atonement but unless we also are anointed Ed and consecrated our offerings are not received so it's not like that we just bring it to God and God is so desperate that God will just take anything and everything that people give him no he won't either he will only take that which meets his strict requirement and that is it must come from priests that have been set apart and set aside and Sanctified but they also need to be anointed but how do they become anointed well he crushes the lily of the valley and the rose of Sharon and he releases the perfume out of the life of the only sinless one that ever lived on the earth after the fall he sends that back upon us and anoints our lives to where that what we do is mixed with the fragrance of the Pascal lamb even our prayers uh I know you Bible readers know this that our our prayers have to be mixed with incense in order for him to receive them it has been said that prayers are like little children going out into the flower garden or the wild flowers and they pick the yellow and they pick the red and the white and the pink and maybe the fuchsia but at the same time they'll pick some weeds because weeds also will flower their mother meets them at the door and whenever they bring these flowers to their mother and their mother being wiser than they are able to look and see but this is poison and this is not really acceptable and the mother sorts through the flowers as they bring them and she separates them you understand that our prayers Before the Throne of God many times when we pray we have selfishness we have arrogance we have pride we have an objective that isn't quite right before the Lord how is it that God accepts our prayers they are mixed with incense and the incense goes in with our prayers and blends the aroma to where the weeds of selfishness and self-pity and all of that we pray don't sit there and look at me and tell me you don't do that and how in the world can God then receive our prayers and our prayers be as if it was the Lord Jesus himself praying it's the incense that makes up for what we lack and our temporary understanding aren't you grateful for that watch's this in the Messiah the prophet said God called Messias God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God like Jesus was God's high priest and we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs amen Messiahs oh my do you see it the same things he did in his church the same power he had in his church his church becomes his Dominion he is King over his dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering listen to this now spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name oh my amen there you are Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what the main one anointed off of the great one so if we're not Anointed God cannot hear our prayers if we're not Anointed God will not receive our worship we could say the name of Jesus and oh Lord I worship you I praise you I adore you I exalt your name but if we're not Anointed with the anointing of the day you see Jesus said in Mark chapter 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you can imagine millions of people have gathered today in churches all around the world and they've worshiped and they've sung and they believe with all of their heart they they have worshiped and praised God and God has received that worship but he has not unless they're preaching the right thing cuz you said Jesus said how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so you mean our worship is either accepted or rejected based upon the doctrine that we believe and teach so when we teach for Doctrine the Commandments of men our worship is a complete waste of time you might as well be singing jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh but we say the name of Jesus I don't care if you do say the name of Jesus it's only accepted when it's revealed it's accepted through the revealed word of the hour you see that is the name of God the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God for the word name in the Old Testament actually is shim which means reputation traits characteristics of the person you're identify amen so God then has him a church as he did 2,000 years ago he has one today and they are anointed to be able to not only carry out his work cast out Devils heal the sick do all the great things that he did but they're anointed to worship him to praise him they will worship Him in spirit and in truth read with me in Exodus 28:41 and thou shalt put upon the them upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with him now he talking about the Holy garments that only the priests could wear and thou shalt anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may Minister unto me in the priest's office now look what happens they are anointed they are consecrated and they are Sanctified so they couldn't just walk in with any type of clothes that they wanted they couldn't just pick out their favorite perfume that they wanted they had to be Anointed with a special concoction that was made by the Apothecary that had five different elements given by Divine proportions by which they were anointed in other words we'd say it like this in this day the fivefold ministry five aspects of the oil so much of Cal so much of this so much of myrr they couldn't pick even their own concoction it had to be exactly the way God described it a fifth of this two fifths of that one tenth of that a fifth of this put it all together and then mix all that together and it produced this phenomenal type of aroma so you had no no question about knowing when a man was a priest because when he come out from the presence of God even without his miter and the heod and all that on him he had a smell about him that you knew he'd been in the presence of God you see we don't want to just have enough religion that makes us feel good when we're here on Sunday morning we want to be able to walk out these doors and have the smell of Jesus Christ on our lives that people will know there's something different about them people if we don't have that we're not a success notice now in Leviticus 8 verse 10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was therein and Sanctified them how can wood and gold now remember a lot of the wood was chatim wood there was gold which represented deity silver which represented silver blue which represented the Heavenly there was a color from the mollusk there was all these different colors that were Blended together so it was elements of the Earth the metallurgical value the gold the silver the brass and all that the copper come from the Earth part of it come from the sea part of it come from trees part of it come from insects what was God doing pulling from botony Life pulling from all these Elements of Life to give a place to worship him so how could a little a silicus which was a little tiny bug that lived on the oak tree very very rare and they would catch this only the female could do this and they would take the body of the female and they would squeeze this out of her body and it would produce one drop of this dye this dye then in turn was used to be able to dye part of the garments and part of the color of the Tabernacle so God would allow them to take an insect there was a mollusk which came from the Mediterranean and they would take it and grind the shell and be able to mix another color so what's God doing pulling from botney Life pulling from Oceanic life pulling from human life taking the badger which is a very rotten mean animal and God pulling from all these different Avenues and bring it all together and you've still got all this element that is not holy how's a holy God ever going to get in that place cuz he had to Sanctified amen with with what with what part with blood part with oil and the rest Spirit there's two types of sanctification deity type and human type now watch in Leviticus 8:10 and Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was there in and Sanctified them and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar notice how many times seven times and Anointed The Altar and his vessels notice now the gender that he gives to the Tabernacle it was a hymn his vessels both the labor and and the labor also identified his foot to sanctify them so what are they doing consecrating sanctifying how can you take take gold and make it holy for God there's a process now how are we then ever going to be able to present our bodies since our bodies are unregenerate now no matter how much Holy Ghost you've got in your soul your body is still according to what the prophet taught us whenever you see a man priest potent a prophet he said he's born between Satan and Eve Satan and Eve so our bodies are hybrid is that right yet Paul tells us in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you would present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable before the Lord which is only your reasonable service how can my flesh ever be considered to be holy how could your flesh brother Joel ever consider to be holy that God himself would look at it cuz my body don't have the Holy Ghost my soul does my soul has been redeemed but how can my flesh when Paul goes on to say that we would lift up holy hands but how how can I ever reach a state of Hol and sanctification in my body that my body will be holy to God I've got the answer in front of me you want to know it might take me a little while to get to it notice again in Leviticus 8:12 and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him so he's pouring this anointing on now remember specific oil specific elements specific measurement word word word commandment commandment command commandment obedience obedience obedience and then when the obedience is rendered it produces a product which can actually take a mortal man and he walk in there and become Anointed with this oil and it transforms him into a holy priest amen amen glory to God than I told you the other morning the Lord I got up out of bed and I was fixing to start the day and the Lord spoke to me and gave me something this is it so you see there's a sanctification that the Lord does and then there's actually one that we do now it takes both actually to make us acceptable and the one that God does we can't and the one we're supposed to he won't the one that he's supposed to do we cannot do and the one we're supposed to do he will not do you read with me in Exodus 29:42 this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your Generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory amen now watch it was Moses that anointed the priest and they were Sanctified by an order of obedience to the Commandments of God but it was them that Sanctified them but what's going to sanctify now the building and the Tabernacle it's actually going to be Sanctified by the shakan glory of God so you mean then God could come in a building say like this this sheet rock come from the same place that other buildings were made out of so it could be a honky tonk or a bar or a you know a school building or whatever so this this sheetrock didn't come from some Holy Ghost fil place where all holy ghost fil people made it and all holy ghost fill people worked on this building there's some that did and these panels here they come from a place where uh they manufacture panels for auditoriums and all types of things and this carpet was made in the same place these W these trees this all these different things it's here so what we say this is a holy Place well what makes it holy it's not the stone the piano made by Yamaha that that one there we didn't order a particular holy Yamaha piano and a particular Fender holy guitar and a particular holy apartment for Rolland only makes holy drums for Holy Rollers that set of drums could wound up playing rock and roll music same with that piano but we say but this is a holy place so what makes it holy His Glory Hallelujah and the Tabernacle shall be Sanctified by my glory look at the word Sanctified to consecrate prepare dedicate be Hallowed be holy be separate to be set apart be treated as sacred so how many of you would bring your biscuits and gravy and your sausage and your bacon and your cup of coffee and your hot chocolate and your donuts and all that in here to church with you this morning and set there and eat it anybody well you have no problem doing that at home right you could sit outside in your car and do that you you'd be okay with that and then you go walk right out of these doors go through the hallway that come out on the other side into the fellowship hall and we sat right there yesterday we ate food we talked we drank we had Fellowship why that is built for a separate purpose this is hallowed for the preaching of the word for the sick being healed for the Lost being saved praise the lord it's the way we consecrated the building it's the way we dedicated it and the purpose we consecrated it for for us to just come a a a little distance and bring that same food out of that building and to bring it in here why we would feel terrible we would feel awful in doing so why because of the way we built it of the way we consecrated it and the purpose of is don't you understand your flesh is no different than your brothers your sisters your mam your daddies that don't even believe this word but yours is consecrated for a special service to almighty God hallelujah you come from the same lump of humanity that your father and your mother and your siblings and your aunts and uncles but you brought your body to the house of God to dedicate it to the service of Adonai amen now notice what God said that he would do Exodus 2944 and I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons now Moses and God both must perform an act of sanctification on the priesthood God will do his part but he wasn't going to do Moses part so Moses had to anoint them actually Moses based the priests before Moses would dress them he bathed them can you imagine how humiliating for them priests they said Moses we've been taking bath since we were little guys but they needed to be bathed under the administration of the Prophet that's why some of the message preachers stink real bad they refuse to be Washed by the Water of Malachi 4 and when a message preacher gets to the spot he thinks he don't need the message message no more you watch him start preaching stinky doctrines you watch him turn into a stinky preacher and have a stinky Church come on somebody I don't know about every other man of God here in this place today I still need to be washed by the purity of the teachings of Malachi 4 I hope I never get so big in my own mind that I think I don't need it I've lost my mind when I do so Moses then would bathe him brother Joel then Moses would close them and put the garments on them again how humiliating that they they themselves had bathed himself and dress himself for years and years but this was God's instruction God was making the priesthood and in one sense of the word bow to humility to the higher office above them I know some of our preachers are ashamed to quote the prophet anymore but you're looking this morning at one that is not ashamed of the message of Malachi 4 I'm not ashamed to tell you where I get it from I'm not ashamed to tell you I am anointed with the anointing of the last day years ago I was a Pentecostal preacher and that's the anointing I had on me but I've got a different anointing on me now it's a Rapture anointing it's an Elijah anointing it's a translation anointing it's a Rapture Revelation oh Hal Hallelujah Revelation 10 anointing anybody here with me today now notice God says I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify both Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office the garments they could have them on that was not enough they could have the oil on that was not enough don't you understand what one of the things that separates the bride from the church that the church can have anointing of blessings oh the Lord blesses us and we've got this and we've got that and we're growing and we're doing this that and other sure that comes from just having part of the blessings of the Lord but we don't want just blessings we want life I don't want just the gifts I want the giver my focus give me the giver and I get every gift he's got come on somebody give me the giver I get everything I have need of Hallelujah notice now number again chter 8:1 17 for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I Sanctified them for myself now watch what God did while death is striking all the land of Egypt God is performing a work of sanctification and the firstborn are being sanctified ified by the smearing of the blood over the door the token of course and then going through the rituals of eating the lamb and the bitter herbs so while people are dying people are being Sanctified while people are being killed the firstborn of all the land of Egypt but God said now this is what I'm going to do from this day forward the firstborn of all of Israel belong to me and I sanctify them to myself so then you could either take your son to the Tabernacle and give him a service to the Lord or you could redeem your son that also transferred over uh to your animals and you could redeem them animals or you could bring them to the priesthood so God had a set value on a donkey you remember the prophet talking about that little donkey and she give birth uh to a little old ugly thing and that little old thing come out of there standing there bowlegged standing there and his ears all flopped down but he said that Mama was really taught in the word and she would look at that little donkey of hers and say son you are my firstborn oh but mama my legs are bowlegged and my my ears is all hang down don't worry the priests will never see you because there will be a lamb offered for you Hallelujah God redeemed them all under one spoken word of sanctification now remember just by God speaking this it brought it to pass over the entirety of all the firstborn that was alive and all of those thereafter by the spoken word of God praise the Lord Jesus notice then God said what he done I Sanctified them for myself Jeremiah 1:5 before I form thee in the belly I knew thee before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nation you mean before Jeremiah even got to exercise his free moral agency well some of you Baptists that have a hard time with that wouldn't you God chose Jeremiah before Jeremiah could even know anything about a choice well hang tight he done the bride the same way so God Sanctified Sanctified now I know you're going through your mind right now you're thinking sanctification sanctification you're thinking about the modern term of the way that we look at it and you're thinking about people getting rid of cigarettes and people getting rid of rock and roll music and people cleaning their closet out no no no no that that's what Come Along on down in time but this is the original application of sanctification in the Old Testament that it was something that was hallowed or set apart for the the service of God now remember that God himself is the only one that can sanctify people well enough for the Divine approach remember to approach him we must be accepted and we cannot sanctify ourselves in this sense to a clear enough stage before God that we could walk in there the way we want to well God hey I'm Donny rean I just come to talk to you today I want you to know I want to pray to you a little while no man can come to mees Jesus said except my father draws him first is that your Bible now watch in St John 177 Jesus praying sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify them set them apart consecrate them Father as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself now does that mean Jesus was sneaking around smoking was Jesus sneaking around drinking a little wine on the side and Jesus was sneaking around doing some things that was wrong no but Jesus was a man and Jesus as a man could have had a wife I'm going to stagger some of you no doubt Jesus as a man could have physically fathered children but it does not mean those offspring would have been literally Sons and Daughters of God but he knew it would stumble some of you if Jesus would have got married and had a wife and had relations with a wife and had a family and all of that some of his people it would have stumbled them they' never been able to understood it so he said I set myself apart if he hadn't already done it enough Oh Praise You Lord Jesus and for their sakes notice now he's praying and he does not say father for your sake I won't do this or I won't do that but I won't for their sakes amen I'll tell you what friends you watch how people relate relate rather to other people and see how they use their cloak of Liberty in things and their attitude toward offending others and you'll be get a pretty good idea if they have eternal life or not how much say jump and scream and shout that don't really that don't really cut it and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so here there is an element of sanctification that must come from the ministry in order to greatly affect the ministered to watch in Ephesians 5: 25 Paul's speaking husbands love your wives him as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word this is hegeso which is a little different word than what we just read a while ago it means to be hallow be holy separate from profane things dedicate to God to consecrate now this type of sanctification we cannot do ourself he has to do it amen he has to do it we could never separate ourselves from that sinful nature we were born with only God can kill that nature Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered with out the gate so he goes beyond the gate as it was the day that they released the goat when the sins were transferred upon the head of the goat and he went out into the Wilderness so the Lord Jesus suffered without the gate outside of Jerusalem so whether you believe in Gordon's calvary or the original one both of them are outside the wall so it doesn't really matter so he went outside the gate in order to suffer for the people a reject for the rejected notice now man also though has a part in sanctification Exodus 29:37 7 days shall thou make an atonement for the Altar and Sanctified and it shall be an altar Most Holy whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy so when Moses done his part and he went through this this ritual of seven days to sanctify the altar then whenever they would bring a lamb just a regular lamb out on the field a bulock a ram whatever it was and they would place that sacrifice on this holy altar oh instead of this natural sacrifice transforming The Altar and making the altar unclean it had the exact opposite effect so you take this regular bulock this regular lamb this regular turtle dove this pigeon whatever it was and you lay it on the Altar and by simply touching the altar God looked at that and said I accept that Holy Lamb amen amen thank you Lord praise be to God 1 Chronicles 15:14 so the priest and the Levites Sanctified themselves so you mean God wouldn't do this no you see when people come to the Lord God will take many things from them there's people sitting right here today that I know by personal testimony that God took marijuana from them God took cigarettes from them God took drinking from them God took pills from them God took all types of things and there's other things they have battled and struggled and fought with to sanctify themselves through why God wants both efforts of sanctification to be manifested in us as his children children we're already lazy enough us bunch of sorry no good no count for nothing Leo to sins we're rotten we're spoiled we no good come on somebody say at least ouch if you can't say amen and if God done the whole thing would' be worse than what we are so God will do what we cannot do and then God says now I want you to sanctify yourself so the priests and the Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel 2 Chronicles 29:15 and they gathered them their Brethren and Sanctified themselves and came according to the Commandment of the King by the words of the Lord to cleanse the house of the Lord now notice it's them so they're sanctifying they're laying aside habits they're laying aside things that they know is not right you know the way we do it today for many of us we're waiting on God to take him away from us and God is waiting on us to lay them down I wonder how many years some of you all have lost waiting on God to do something for you that he will never ever do sir praise the Lord y'all still with Me 2 Chronicles Chronicles 2934 but the priests were too few now this is the rededication of course so they could not Flay all the burnt offerings now here's all this levitical order and God would always keep the even the natural reproduction of the Levites to where it would be able to compensate with the growth of the tribes of Israel think of that even naturally you've got all these other 11 tribes that's living out here and as they grow and multiply and multiply if God don't let the priesthood multiply and be able to provide for himself there'll never be enough to be able to take care of all the needs now here it wasn't that there wasn't enough a number that there wasn't enough preachers as we'd say that were in a Sanctified state to where they could take care of the needs of the people so people were bringing offerings and bringing offerings and they were just piling up they were just piling up because there were not enough consecrated priest to be able to fle which means to take the meat off the bone and bring it as the acceptable approach into God's presence notice and they could not Flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their Brethren the Levites did help them till the work was ended until the other priests had Sanctified themselves for the Levites were more upright in their heart to sanctify themselves than the priest oh brother so now remember the Levites it was a whole tribe of Levi Levi but part of them carried the tent part of them washed the pots part of them supplied the oil they were not called to go in as priests so here was the called out of the called out the priesthood was called out of the levitical tribe as the bride is called out of the church so the some of the priests had got so cold and so indifferent on the Commandment of God and the Levites had more of a desire to be holy how sad amen I said how sad oh my 2 Chronicles 31:18 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters to all the congregation for in their set off office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness am so in their set office they Sanctified themselves in Holiness now this is not just of course now speaking to the preachers alone every one of you whether you're a singer whether you're a musician whether you're just a member of the Ley you have a position in the body of Christ and nobody can take your place but brother Donnie I'm just a lay member what what what can I do you are to sanctify yourself in your position as Ley you're to pray for those that are the leaders you're to pray and petition as priests and pray for the leadership of God in the ministry not only in our church but around the world that God will get every predestinated seed so we can leave this mess that we're in y'all want to go home I'm tired of this world I'm sick and tired of the sin and the debauchery of evil that we're living in and putting up with every day let's get out of here children but we cannot do it until everyone whose name is on the Book of Life is called chosen Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and in their position watch Paul carry over this in the New Testament 2 Timothy chapter 2: 20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and you see this also of course in the Tabernacle there were vessels of gold vessels of silver vessels of wood and vessels which were actually clay Earth pottery notice how he Likens this he said and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use you mean that Paul lays a lot of this responsibility on us as individuals yes sir that if a man looks at and it said if I'm no more than a lady or a woman I'm going to be the best that I can be for the kingdom of God I'm going to pray I'm going to read my Bible if they need anything done around the church I'm going to do what I can do I'm going to pray for the ministry I'm going to take the Sunday School teachers on my heart I'm going to take the leaders of the church on my heart that God will help them and lead them I'm going to pray for brother Donnie the way I ain't never prayed for him in my life because brother Donnie needs prayer Amen brother Donnie can tell you that I need prayer yes why I'm trying to to lead you out of this world into a body change look friends the men of God in this age are trying to preach their sheep to a level that no other age has ever done Paul never had to preach his people into a level of a body change Luther never had to preach his people to a level of a body change don't you understand the men of God in this hour are going to accomplish something that has never been done on the face of the Earth they will preach the living bride into a state of a body chain that death will give way hallelujah oh do we need to be Sanctified do we need to present ourself in the presence of God that he can use us not just me you I find this statement in 1 Peter 3:15 very unusual and Peter says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthe of the reason of the hope that is within you with meekness and fear so you s ify the Lord God in your hearts and you're just thinking he's going to say well you go to church and you know you get down on your knees no actually you sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and then you share with others the reason of the hope that's on the inside of you on oh and then some of you all are wondering what can I do what can I do you've got so much to do my goodness we'll never get it done will we watch this if was ever a call to the church to sanctify ourselves and get away from the things of the world we're ready to cross over my goodness friends if you say this 1955 what about now are you ready tonight to throw aside and sanctify yourself from all your unbelief anybody Now watch how this sanctification for self will come into Ed Ying the body I love the way brother Ram deals with this in the adoption series I was talking to a little preacher yesterday going to preach for him and if you Nots up here on the highway and I asked him about a certain thing and he said yes brother Brenham but the most of my people doesn't believe in that I said most of them are legalist and he said yes brother doesn't believe that but he said for their sake you see this puts a pastor in a very odd and unusual State sometimes amen so here this man brother BR was going up to preach for him and of course the doctrine that brother BR was talking about was predestination election for knowledge and all that and many of this Brothers people come from the Pentecostal background which believed in legalism some were Methodist so whenever brother brandham asked him about that and he said yes brother brandham but a lot of my people don't believe that now some of yall know the rest of this quote but some of you I wonder what would be your idea to advise this brother to do I notice he quotes the scripture of the Lord Jesus I sanctify myself for their sake Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 was to take the gospel to the world it said for their sake I sanctify myself make yourself for for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake so don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do so if you meet your enemy then what would the natural reaction for a lot of us be it would be get upset at our enemy you know say something or give him that look you know that he knows uh that look of disapproval but when you really learn to sanctify yourself more and more in a deeper consecration you start sanctifying yourself from within now notice he's not saying the spirit of God's going to do this but this is something we're supposed to do we're to sanctify oursel from within and by doing so we are expressing the greater work of God from within our soul I realize friends this is not very deep this morning but I'm actually preaching bride material so for those of you that are interested in going home there you go so if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for San not knowing what what you not knowing what you might do and you're want to be a little Messiah here's your chance sanctify your temper sanctify your arrogance that also carries over on Tik Tok flipflop Instagram and all the rest is social media trash even some of our sisters I understand take the social media and preach a little bit sisters you ain't supposed to be handling the word either behind the pull pit or on Instagram Amen Brother D Amen brother Preacher Brother Donnie I'm with you brother glory to God well thank ke I'm glad y'all are back here cuz they sure ain't many I'm back here I think the sweetest scripture there is in all the Bible it's this scripture father I sanctify myself because of them the SC sweetest scripture in all the Bible he was a man he could have had a wife you say I was making that up a while ago he could have had a home place to lay his head he had rights to that he was a man he could have had good clothes but what did he say father I sanctify myself for their sake what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world he put an example and Brethren as ministers I'll tell you it pays us not to get too much of this world's goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to you you sanctify yourself from them that you're going to lead for them that you're going to lead that's what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers amen you can go ahead and say Amen it ain't going to make me mad I'm going to say Amen with you hey this is part of the message I know we don't hear preachers read this very much but it's still the truth if we add more Sanctified preachers in the Pulpit but have more sanctified people in the pews notice he said Sanctified life of ministers that walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world keep from it father I sanctify myself for their sake for not because he had to but he did it for their sake Romans 12:1 that us change a bit I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of god notice he makes those mercies plural I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living s sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen I read that the I thought how is that even possible this was born between Dawn and Betty Reagan I was conceived in sin come to the world speaking lies give my heart to the Lord as a young boy been preaching since I was 18 be 50 years in a few months and yet this ain't got the Holy Ghost a bit more today than it haveen I give my heart to God years ago the flesh I'm talking about so how can I present this as a holy sacrifice so the difference between us now in the New Testament in the Old Testament was they presented dead sacrifices but Paul specifies I beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice so instead of me just killing it one time laying it on the ah there you go God do whatever you want to it well bury that old thing God don't want that God don't want your old dead hide God don't want your dead carcass got your God wants your old live carcass you you could only offer it once if you present it to him as a dead sacrifice but if you give it to him a Living Sacrifice you can do it every day oh glory to God you can do it every day day after day days lead to week weeks weeks lead to months months lead to years and years lead to decades and before long you've dedicated the rest of your entire life to him instead of bringing a dead carcass and laying it on an altar you sanctify yourself for your neighbor's sake you sanctify yourself for your enemy sake you sanctify yourself or maybe a brother in the church that there's something come between you but you sanctify yourself and try to make peace even though in reality he was the one that wronged you thank you Lord but remember even when we come to church sometimes we're not always dealing with sanctified people some people are Sanctified by God but they've never yet learned the latter part of that half of the equation and that is to sanctify themselves so that's why we have gossip in the church now we got visitors here today and I'll just preach our church here because I'm sure they don't have none of it where they go I know brother Jason's church and brother Luke Gibson church and my everybody there just just as sweet as honey I'm telling you what they ain't nothing but Angels them kind of ride motorcycles and we think because well I man I got sanctifying yours aone you know what love the message folks have done they think that sanctification is a one-time thing oh I got San I before got the Holy Ghost so I'll be sanctify the rest of my life you will be sanctifying that mouth of yours just about every time you open it up come on somebody you going to have to sanctify your thoughts you're going to have to sanctify when you go to the house of God somebody will get your parking spot somebody will get your favorite spot in the Pew we'll have to sanctify ourself when we come to the Lord when we come to service the devil will put that old thing in your mind oh I forgot to turn off the curling AR at home I forgot to turn off the crockpot I forgot to do this don't you understand what it is the devil trying to grab a hold of your mind but you sat there and say Satan in the name of Jesus I've come to Worship the Lord I've come to praise God my hands are Sanctified my feet are Sanctified my voice is Sanctified I set them aside for Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Applause] can I have a few more minutes so God's presence in the Tabernacle and in the temple made them holy watch in Matthew 23:16 woe unto you you blind Gods which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the Temple he is a deor you fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold and whosoever shall SAR by the altar it is nothing but whosoever swears by the gift look how backwards they had it the gift that is upon it he is guilty you fools don't you love Jesus gentle mannerism you fools and blind for whether is the greater the gift or the altar so they were magnifying the gift when the gift itself had not the altar Sanctified it could not even be accepted and look how they had changed oh children I'm afraid now that was the end of the Jewish ages and now we are the end of the Gentile ages and if we're not careful the same thing is happening again we're going to magnify the gift over the giver we're going to magnify the gifts come on I believe in the gifts but I do not believe gifts take precedent over the word of God every gift should be subject to God's word and God's message for the hour and the word and the message will sanctify our gifts if we will allow it if not they will be rampant and reproduction of 1906 Aza street so you bring your Al your gift to The Altar and the way they looked at it the gift was greater than the Altar and the gift ofin itself had no ability to transform or change but you placed the gift on the altar it leaves my hands and God changes it it's now accepted so if a consecrated piece of chatim wood overlaid in Gold a little bit of silver if that could transform a normal sacrifice I wonder what God in my soul and God in your soul would be able to do to our body brother Harold we would just allow it to be so and see this is what and you feel you feel so terrible said well this so stinking thing about me I'm so rotten I'm no good I'm this that why should I even worship God this old body of mine we need to move up I hope you understand what this morning is this morning is a call for us to come higher was a higher understanding that oh glory to God that the Eternal himself that lives in our soul wants to San sanctify our body and make the uplifting of our hands as Holiness unto the Lord and the sacrifice of our lips acceptable in the presence of God it is not coming out of a sinner's mouth these are not Sinners hands I don't smoke I don't drink I don't run around but my body is Sanctified by the Living God which is deity inside of my soul there for I can lift holy hands I can lift holy hands at the Corinthian Church remember a lot of Gentiles there mainly Greeks mixed in with Jews some of them that had gotten saved and a question began to raise up among them should the saved wife leave the unsaved husband or should the saved husband leave the unsaved wife because Judaism basically taught the same thing that if a Jew to marry a gentile their children were not holy they were illegitimate same with the Romans which is hard to believe as vile as they were yet they T that if another person if you want your husband or your wife accepted some sort of other religion that you should actually divorce them because your house is not clean your house is divided but watch Paul yes amen and the woman which ha a husband that believeth not if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him am would you notice that it doesn't say let her put him away cuz that wasn't the way he believed it let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband yes amen is Sanctified GL I about had me a spell the other day and the Lord was putting this together I'm telling you the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife can you imagine for the sake of the righteous daughter of God that God will accept her husband as being set apart and Sanctified unto her and because she has found favor Oh Glory in the eyes of God God oh hallelujah hallelujah God looks at them as different what's this the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife you better thank God for this part of this because there's been so many times we have not believed his word we have doubted him we have questioned him oh glory to God but the Fai of our Lord Jesus has Sanctified us brother Paul the face of Abraham Sanctified Sarah remember the prophet of God said Sarah never did believe it was not Sarah's Fai so much it was the fa of Abraham and his facei Sanctified his household glory and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean amen but now are they holy thank you Lord now of course verse 14 does not mean that our children are saved from this but God acknowledges and recogniz us that Christian mate it may be a Godly little woman and maybe every child she's got don't serve God and her husband don't serve God but God sets apart that whole situation amen for that daughter don't give up on your children hallelujah hallelujah don't give up on your grandchildren don't give up on your husband your wife hallelujah look at how powerful the life of one believer and a home [Applause] isall that Christian mate sets apart that home for God's blessing Hallelujah there's many a sinner man that's been blessed by his wife being a child of God there's many a sinner woman there's many a sinner child that's been blessed by being set apart well you say Brother Don there's people that come to our church and ain't right of course they ain't but I figure if they can come long enough they might get around where there's enough of us at they might get a good ghost of the Holy Ghost himself I'd much rather be in here well what if they drink what if they lie what if they run around come on you Liars come on you Jezebels come on you whatever you are come right here this is like a hospital we're here to minister to the sick we're here to minister to the lost we're here to minister to L the SE and wash them by the water of the word and close them with holy garments so they can be set aside for a Rapture so God blesses the lost for the sake of the saved amen amen thank you Lord you parents that have got children that's getting old enough to go out on their own I would keep them in my house as long as I could am I know they're going to get old enough and they're going to make up their mind what they're going to do but you want to hold them under this atmosphere as long as you can amen God in the soul sanctifies this body 1 Timothy 2:8 I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up what kind of hands amen holy hands without WRA and doubting Hebrews 13:15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God when everything is going good and all your bills are paid and at least once months whether you think he needs it or not you want to know how much you're supposed to praise him you say the word you say it come on don't nod your head I want to hear you say it say it tell yourself this is how much you're supposed to praise God self Donnie you hear that this is how much you're supposed to praise God well I do it I do it three times a day brother Donnie that ain't near [Applause] [Music] enough the SA rice of praise to God continually that is the fruit remember fruit is progeny mixing together two things upper and lower lip new births inside the soul produce mixed together with a Sanctified body what does it produce a sacrifice of praise a sacrifice of praise notice the prophet said the Bible said you're a royal priesthood A peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise unto him oh my the fruits of your lips pouring up praise daily before the people what a high priest we have what a high priest or priesthood that we're in oh come on now don't you love that he didn't just stop with Jesus what a high priest we have and what a priesthood we are in in the priesthood of the circumcision not of the flesh but of the heart amen the heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost that's right then you can offer praise and adoration to God the spiritual sacrifice your lips pouring out praise unto him again they are peculiar people of royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice giving praise to God listen to these next words whether they feel like it or not Hallelujah whether they feel like it or not that's when it really becomes a sacrifice stand spiritual Amnesia God's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people A peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name God called his church and separated it from the world for that very purpose God didn't just save you to save you he saved you to love him he saved you to praise him to worship Him I got to read one more is it okay we'll pick it up again but notice this about worship I hope this transforms the way you think about worship we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we're at work we should worship him but now notice what he says this is every time the opportunity presents itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him so it's not just you standing be your machine that you work at at work or you driving down the road but worship is also reaching out to others amen watch if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this amen wow you mean that is worshiping God worshiping God you man at your work when you hear a man using the name of the Lord in vain and you get a chance to one side and slip over and take it by the hand and say Amen there's a better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a Meek and GLE way all those things is a worship and when you see someone sick and the doctor says there's no more that can be done we ought to worship God by telling them there's a God in heaven that answers prayer [Music] now let's be honest would we have ever thought that would be worship so you mean by sharing that the Lord Jesus Is A Healer a savior a redeemer you are worshiping God and your you thought it was just about this true divine worship is coming out of your regenerate Soul pouring through lips of a Sanctified Tabernacle Hallelujah I said one more it keeps growing I'm sorry I love this listen to this I'm going to close for sure I believe that Christian Life is a continual sacrifice he that will come after to me let him deny himself daily every day not 46 days of course he's speaking about Linton let every day take up his cross and follow me said Jesus not just 46 but every day Jesus actually spoke about your cross more than he spoke about his own look how many times in the gospels he mentioned you taking up your cross and see how many times he talked about himself taking up his he knew the harder battle wouldn't be himself it'd be us oh how the Christian loves to to it he doesn't do it with a grudge he doesn't oh he he does it with a a feeling that he loves God and he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake praise the Lord some of y'all said praise God for the first time so I ask you Priests of God in a little bit you'll be walking out them doors what till we going to do but Brother Don I've wasted so many years forget all the waste what are you going to do from today forward don't do a bit of good to spend all of our time Walling on our mistakes and we've all done all that but what are we going to do from this day forward as Priests of the most high God we have been Anointed with an anointing the eagle anointing of the last days to loose the seals to release the Thunders the voice of God to release a building of a body of God on the earth that would actually come to such a state of maturity their completion and Perfection will call for the rest of the dead I'm not just waiting to see my little girl I'm wanting to see Paul and Peter amen James and John when the resurrection happens it's going to be all of them it ain't going to just be those from our church those from our age they are all waiting on us Hallelujah Jesus if God can sanctify us on his part and then us sanctify us the rest rest of the way and lay aside our you our differences and our doctrines and sure we're always going to have things and there there's certain stands we have to take that we cannot compromise on no but I'm talking about things many things that we argue and fuss about it don't even pertain to Salvation in the first place and if we can go to loving one another and praying for one another even though we don't agree with one another my goodness how many people agreed with Jesus and they prayed for all of them look at the prophet of God what an attitude look at the spirit I don't just study this message I study the spirit this message was delivered in you know I find that messenger saying people throw him out he just draw a Bricker circle they' throw him out that Circle he draw a bigger one they throw out that she kept on drawing a bigger one well come on somebody boy if anybody throws us out of the circle GL to God I'm turn them over to the devil Hallelujah they repat their serpent seat now show me where the prophet of God or the Lord Jesus had that attitude he kept praying for him father forgive them for they don't know what they do and I don't mind telling you I'm going to go ahead and say it I don't figure there's anybody here today that don't need a closer walk with God I don't fig there's none of us here today that ain't messed up and messed up and scrupled up and all kinds of mess ever was if it ain't for the grace of God there won't be none of us go noow if it's going to take Grace for me why not give Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else and Grace to somebody else Remember The Headstone is not coming crying Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine The Headstone is not coming crying gifts gifts gifts but the headstone is coming crying Grace Gra why because that's what we need it's going to take the rapturing grace of almighty God to get this bride together but he will do it it will be a miracle for him to get her together but listen out devil let me tell you right now the Lord God will get his bride together from around the world in every nation every tongue every Kindred they will come to that place of rapturing faith and all hell will not be able to stop him Hallelujah par it Lord God what an awesome day to be living dear Jesus I come before you today as a priest of God my brothers and sisters also come I don't come as their priest necessarily and that I'm above them and greater than them and have a greater position than them I come with them every daughter of God standing here today Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost is part of the priesthood of of God I remember that day when that little woman had that baby and it was crying and crying little sister satting there in a chair felt so sorry for her gave her her seat she had a prayer card and she said honey God just keep putting it on my heart to pray for you old baby I know brother Ram's going to pray for it but would you just let me pray for it just kind of get this out why sure dear go ahead that little sister laid her hands on that baby the woman come in the prayer line God shows the Prophet The Vision he does not rebuke that woman for praying for her but he said God healed her whenever the woman prayed for her but brother Randon was not after arrogance and pride well glory to God I prayed for him so that puts another feather in my hat he didn't have feathers in his hat he wanted all the glory to go to you and he said the reason was that little mother could have a Fe feeling that maybe he couldn't have the same way father whenever they'd bring a cross-eyed child across the platform there wasn't a one of them not a one of them that ever walked off that wasn't healed why recalling his little Sharon rose laying there eyes crossed with the pain it puts such a feeling in the heart of this priest many of us can share with those things Lord may we walk out of here today brothers sisters ministers non- ministers alike and realize we are called to intercede we are called to pray we are called to sanctify ourselves we're called To Worship we're called to present sacrifices one of the greatest we can ever give you is to place our bodies on your altar as a living sacrifice Lord God I don't know how many more years or months or weeks or whatever that I have I live in a few months I'll be 68 years old I'm an old man wow it's hard for me to Fathom sometimes I don't know how much more time I've got I don't know how many more sermons I get to preach but how much ever life I have left I want to give it all to you Lord I want want to be sensitive so if your Holy Spirit comes upon me it lows which it does and Home Depot and it does I want to be so sensitive that I can stop whatever I'm doing whatever I've got planned for the day other people say oh yeah that's wonderful thank God we have a pastor like that but help them to realize I want sheep like that and that's the kind of sheep you want where you can deal with this and maybe they're fixing breakfast so they're at the grocery store and the Lord puts brother Daryl on a sister's heart to pray for him and she just pulls a little basket of groceries over to one side and Bows her head Lord God I don't know why but I pray for brother Daryl today that you'd help him she may not know he's just left a meetting over mour Arkansas and his back went out this morning when he got up at 4:00 to head home or something like that and she's praying for him he's going along in pain and Agony and the spirit of God comes in his car where he's at and touches our brother why cuz a daughter of God obeyed the Holy Ghost and Sanctified her time praise the Lord oh Jesus I wonder how much you want to do Among Us not just from the pulpit out but in the body you didn't just save me sanctify me Sanctified the preachers you've Sanctified a wife is I accorded to him the other the other night that for many thousands of years the Jewish vows of a man taking a wife would be thou sanctify thee unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel what I've heard today is you saying to your bride my wife my spouse my beloved be thou Sanctified unto me for I am the god the god of Israel Lord Jesus we worship you father and many but just just like to take a few moments and maybe just have a rededication service this morning it ain't been that long since we dedicated this building but maybe we could just rededicate ourselves our praise our time our thoughts you know it already I don't need to tell you but one of the greatest shortages that we have in this day is time remember that message I preached to you years ago the bondage of time never enough time are they Satan's got more and more and more things to occupy our time than ever before and the difficult part about it is many of those things are not sinful they are not wrong but we just give so much time to this and time to that the prophet said as far as he knew he never stole anything in his life but he had stole time from God maybe many of you have not stole one thing since you've got saved but I wonder how many of us have stole time time that he wants oh Hallelujah Lord God I bless your name Jesus please forgive me please forgive me Lord hallelujah hallelujah many wants to just rededicate your life with me today deacons trustees ministers sisters brothers young people those of you that are streaming the service at the archive it may you pull

So may they use that faith and that passion and pray for that family. Dear heavenly father, and all these other needs, Lord, I can't remember them, but you see them, Lord.

And we like that, don't we? Yes, we do. Amen. Sing it, buddy. [Music] When all foundations have been shaken. When I'm left standing in the dark. When I'm in the pillow, heart is breaking. You still rain and you're still God. And when it feels all hope is gone, heavy questions so hard. And though my soul may feel forsaken, you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know that you can trust your heart. [Music] And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] I will declare you with my faith. Though voices whisper that you're not, you'll never leave me nor forsake me. But you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, [Music] I know I can trust you with your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know I can trust you with my heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you're still God. [Music] And when my enemy surrounds me, I trust the victory of your cross and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus. For you are God and I am not. [Music] And though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. [Music] You still reign and you still God. You are good and you are faithful as you have been from the start. You work in all things for your glory. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] Yes, this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Ask the brothers to put this on the screen. I I really didn't want to sing this by myself. Um, last time I sung his song, it was during the prayer line and I battled singing it cuz I stood there and I was like, \"This is not a congregational song. This is not a congregational song.\" And then Aaron, he looked at me and he's like, \"All right, it's your time to I was like, this is not a congregational song.\" And then everybody proved me wrong and said, \"This was this is a very good congregational song. So, if you'll help me sing it. If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles. If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies. If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside, there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got chains, he's a chain breaker. [Music] We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night. And we've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fire. And we've all run to things we know just ain't right. But there's a better life. There's a better life. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. If you need freedom, save it. He's a prison shaking savior. If you got change, he's a chain breaker. [Music] If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it. Somebody testify. Testify. If you believe it, if you receive it, if you can feel it, somebody testify you got pain. He's a pain. If you feel lost, he's a way. And you need freedom for savior. He's a prison shaking savior. You got change. He's a chain breaker. Sing that course again. If you got pain, he's a pain taker. If you feel lost, he's a way maker. You need freedom, a savior. He's a prison shaking savior. God change. He's a change of beauty, freedom, a s. He's a prison shaking savior. Got chains. He's a chain breaker. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is he your chain breaker? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here. I just pray that you come expecting. &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before. Not too high. I can't do this. He can. &gt;&gt; It's like you can't sit there, but he can. &gt;&gt; Right. You're not going to get anything if you just sit there. You come expecting. What am I doing? Uh if you don't come expecting, you're just come to a building. But if you come expecting, then he's going to speak to you. Amen. God bless you. If you would turn with me to Genesis, Genesis 12. We're going to read several places, Lord willing. Verses 1 and three. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We love you so much and we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you've called us. And Lord, not only did you call us, Lord, but you give us the grace to respond to that call, Father. And Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to you, Lord. We see you in every avenue of our lives, Lord. Lord, even when we're doing wrong, we we've got the grace to have you, Lord, tell us that we're wrong. We're so thankful for that, Lord. There's many people that do wrong and don't even know it, Father. Lord, as the bride of Christ, we're so blessed, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight we're here, Lord, not to see one another. Although it's nice to see everybody, Lord, but we've come to see you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we have to look past the veil many times, Lord. And tonight is is another night that we're we're asking that you would help not only myself look past the veil, Lord, and help me to understand that I'm speaking to God in flesh, but I'm asking that they would look past this veil and understand that God in flesh is speaking to them. Father, I pray that you would just take control of this service, Lord. You know what's on my heart. You know, Lord Jesus, that I've studied and I've looked at this, Lord. And well, to be honest, Lord, if my thoughts are here, I I don't want them. I just want you to have your way, Lord. I I pray that you would take these things and just make them and custom fit each and every individual. Lord, we love you and we thank you for it, Lord. We ask it in your name. Amen. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord willing, I'm going to speak on destroying all hope. Um destroying all hope. Um I know hope is faced, little sister, and it's important, but I I think sometimes that God wants us to destroy the hope and get to faith. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hope waivers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've hoped for a lot of things in our lives, but when you have that faith that comes from God, it don't waver. &gt;&gt; It don't waver. And and another thing about hope, and I was just praying and thinking about this, you know, a Christian's faith doesn't determine the outcome. A real Christian's faith doesn't determine God's will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So, we can have all the faith in the world and we can really believe and we we've seen it even here in this church. We've really believed for Sister Erica. That didn't that didn't waver what God's will was. &gt;&gt; We were following general orders, right? &gt;&gt; We were doing exactly what God called us to do. just believe because there's nowhere in the scripture that says have faith and so and so is going to pass away. That's that's not what's in the scripture this have faith. &gt;&gt; But as a Christian, we have faith in God that his will will be done. as a real Christian. The ones that that fall away from from from God and Christianity are the ones that that say they have faith and they might actually have faith, but they don't have faith that God is going to do his perfect will. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just keep that in mind. if we're going to I I I preached this in in Monosel a couple weeks ago, but the Lord's kind of turned it and we'll see how far he turned it. You know what I'm saying? Amen. Now the Lord said had said unto Abram, \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will make thee a great nation.\" Now, this is Abram, still not father of nations. This is just Abram. So, he's putting that promise forth, right? &gt;&gt; Believe it, receive it. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Uh he will heal the sick. He will, you know, you I I've called you to prosper and be in good health. All those promises. There's a promise right here. &gt;&gt; And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursth thee. And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Man, that's a lot of that's a lot of promises right there. That's a lot of things. That's that's God putting his for his word forth. He's sewing forth. I don't want to wear you out. Go ahead and be seated. Let me stand for a little while. You go ahead. Now, we're going to turn to to Genesis 13 uh 14- 16. And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place with thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward. So we see here that God has he he made the promise. He made the promise and it's out there, but he's still not the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And there was things that he had to do. Now, now Abram believed God, right? &gt;&gt; He believed God. He was there. The faith was there. He had a supernatural interaction with God. &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you, if you're real Christians, you've had a supernatural interaction with God with your salvation. That's something supernatural. Logically, humanity doesn't see this unknown being, right? &gt;&gt; And he doesn't see how in the world that he could save us &gt;&gt; naturally. But you've had a super something supernatural happen to you that you believe in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a supernatural interaction with God. So, we're we're we're believing. That's faith. We believe in that. That's faith. But Abram had to separate from Lot. He had to start getting things out of his life that were interfering. Right. And so he's moved from justification, being called &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; into sanctification, getting cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Right. But it still doesn't make him a father of nations. &gt;&gt; It's still not producing the seed. &gt;&gt; Right. justification, sanctification. For all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that the man so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. So here he is repeating again. That's why we come to church. This ain't nothing new, brothers and sisters. I'm not here to surprise you with with new word. That's if I am, then you need to get me out of here because there ain't you know that's not right. This this is not new. I'm just maybe bringing in a different way or or I can express it in a way in in a moment in your life right now that you'll see it better. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not bringing anything new. &gt;&gt; So Abram is God is dealing with Abram the same way. He's telling him over and over again, your seed. You'll be blessed. You're the father of nations, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Abram's like, \"Okay, all right. I I'm seeing it.\" And as now, Abram, sanctify yourself. All right. I can do that. I'm going to separate myself. Now, I'm a little hard-headed. It's going to take me a while. We can't go through the whole whole scripture. And I don't know anybody else like that. But old Abram, bless his heart, he was a little hard-headed. It took him a while. We know the story. I We don't have time to to rehash all that, but you understand where I'm coming from. And this these are not the these are just a couple points that that I picked up. Now, let's go to Genesis 18 verse 10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So, here's that promise all those years ago and it's been repeated and it's been told and Abram was still believing &gt;&gt; but he had somebody very close to him &gt;&gt; that their faith had kind of fallen off. &gt;&gt; It kind of fell off. &gt;&gt; She's like, \"Well, that was nice.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, Abram, bless his heart. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of shaken a little bit. &gt;&gt; We all have those &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; We all have those that we we go through the we we believe and we have this faith and we get sanctified and then we think we come across old friends or our family and they're saying, \"Is that message really &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; necessary? Is holiness really necessary?\" That's good. &gt;&gt; Do you really have to live that way? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was a prophet really necessary? I mean, there's plenty of Baptist churches that that have a lot to offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if you don't want to go to the Baptist, you can go to the Methodist or the the Pentecostals. Pentecostals. Shout. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and and work it out. I'm a good Christian. I don't know how many times I've heard that. I don't have to believe like that. &gt;&gt; I love God. They have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They have faith. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; They had to. They believe in Jesus Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But here they are. And those those things whisper in ear. We've had a great falling away from the message. Did they ever have really have faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they really had faith, but it only come to a spot. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Any anybody that can talk you into something can also talk you out of it. Right. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that I don't care that crazy. I don't I don't understand why in the world people would walk away from this. &gt;&gt; I just don't get it. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to comprehend. And then I see the ones that have walked away and most of them their lives went &gt;&gt; they lost everything. &gt;&gt; Their dignity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Used to have a standard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there's no standard. &gt;&gt; Huh. But they had faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they went ahead and took God's permissive will. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, \"After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure with my Lord also?\" or being old also doesn't make sense. This don't this don't line up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody in the world is is is doing this. I can come in and I can worship God and I can at any old church. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. They had faith in that. And the Lord said unto Abram, Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of shy bear a child which I am old? And I meant to mention this. It's Sarah and Abraham at this point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; let's just stop right there just for a second. At this point, he's the father of nations. &gt;&gt; And he's got one son, Ishmael, &gt;&gt; it's not the promised son, &gt;&gt; and it's not certainly not of nations, right? &gt;&gt; It's not what God has is has really called him to. He knew that it was supposed to come through Sarah. And Sarah said, \"Let me help you out, God.\" Oh, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I wish that I could take back all those times that I helped God out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be awesome? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd be a whole lot further down the road. &gt;&gt; If I would stop helping God out and if I could take back the times that I did help God out, &gt;&gt; preach now, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. Oh, the mighty John. Let me help you out, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I got this. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. To take those away. &gt;&gt; And to never do it again. Let's be honest, &gt;&gt; cuz every one of us here, the Lord Terries, is going to try and help him out again cuz we just we're hard-headed and we still got flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard for the Lord? Back in church again. at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son. Uh that the one who doubted the one who questioned the one who shook on her faith in what God really told them or and and and told Sarah you're going to have this child and she laughed at him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And God looked past her ignorance &gt;&gt; because his will will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children of God can only fall into permissive will for so long. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's been times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; There's been too many times I've been in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; However, because I am a son of God, because you are sons and daughters of God and you're the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; your final act will not be his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that soak in just a minute. &gt;&gt; There's plenty of people out there that are falling into his permissive will time and time and time again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they'll end up in his permissive will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we have real faith. We have something anchored and solid, something that that's going to hold us and keep us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when all the dust settles and everything shakes out from our hearts, it's going to be yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my way, Lord. It's your way. &gt;&gt; It's not my will, Lord. It's your will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it takes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to take control of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Genesis 22 verses 1. I got a lot to cover, so we're going to have to verses one through. We're going to try. And it came to pass after the these things that God did did tempt Abraham. What? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. The devil is the tempter. Not according to this right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Why would God do that? Cuz we need faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we need unshakable, unquestioning faith at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; That's why God will tempt us. &gt;&gt; He will shake us. He will question us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't just pick up a basketball and are able to play basketball or baseball or sewing or whatever cooking. Lord, please help us. They don't just go in a kitchen and just make this meal that's just fantastic. Takes practice. Right. &gt;&gt; Takes years of practice. &gt;&gt; Well, what makes you think it that we're just going to step into this faith? &gt;&gt; If God don't have us practice believing what God has for us, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we just supposed to step into this and say, \"Well, I'm here, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I hear your call.\" &gt;&gt; Wow. True. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a rude awakening when God tempt us. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of those those things go back to that that wanting God's will more than we want our own way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's so easy to pout on God. &gt;&gt; That's good. We all have that lip that can roll right on out. &gt;&gt; We just push that thing out there. You You said you were going to heal me and I had to wait three weeks. &gt;&gt; You said you'd provide my every need. And &gt;&gt; I had to go to the food stamp office. &gt;&gt; Guess what? He did provide your need. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; Just not the way you wanted, &gt;&gt; right? But we get this attitude against God saying, \"Hey, this is the way it should be.\" &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; But we have to practice that. We have to get into that mode where we struggle sometimes &gt;&gt; and we believe. We really believe. We're taking the word and we're taking it. We're eating it and we're believing saying, \"God, you'll provide my every need.\" And I have to ask somebody for $10 for gas or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; It's getting tight in here. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't like it. I don't I don't like it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Humble thyself. Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to heal me. Yeah. Go to the doctor. Right. There's all kinds of variation of this the same mindset, the same thing that we've had on God because we expect God to do things a certain way because we wanted the miraculous. We wanted the the the spiritual, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We want to hear it from the pulpit and embrace it and and just take it. &gt;&gt; Well, you got to embrace and take this part, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, \"Take now thy son, thine only son.\" Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Didn't we say Ishmael was here? &gt;&gt; All those things that we helped with, &gt;&gt; he don't even recognize. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chalk that up to stupidity. &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to recognize that. That's good. &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claved the wood, the burnt offerings, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. So Abram, Abraham is making preparation to do exactly what God said. We're walking. He's walking in the word. And every day Abraham has those scriptures. I'll make thy seed as the sands of the sea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's got those. They're they're tucked away in his heart. He's got those promises &gt;&gt; and he's waiting at any moment for God to intervene because he knows that's what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's real faith. &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting God to intervene at any moment. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't waver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith from God wanting his will doesn't shake from one side or the other. But but every step we're saying, \"Okay, God, you're leading me this direction. I'm going to go this direction.\" &gt;&gt; And at any moment, you could step on the scene and change this situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says, \"Yes, yes, I can.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do next? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he didn't tell Syria, Sarah, his wife. &gt;&gt; No, he did &gt;&gt; cuz he was afraid that she was going to knock him down. Hm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got two servants and his son and his animal and the wood and he said, \"We'll be back in a few days.\" \"Where are you going?\" Oh, it's a surprise. He didn't lie and he took off. And at first Abraham said, \"Well, maybe if I get everything ready, God will stop me.\" &gt;&gt; And then God didn't stop him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he said, \"Well, maybe if we head down the road, we start out, then God will have me just turn around. He knew the promise. &gt;&gt; Maybe you woke up with a head cold and and first thing in the morning you said, \"Well, Lord, you're my healer. At any moment you could take it away at any time. I'm believing. I'm going to praise you for it.\" Ah, and you're doing exactly what the word says. Exactly what the word says. I'm going to praise you for it. I'm going to believe for it. By this afternoon, that head coat will be gone. Afternoon comes and goes. Well, I'll believe for it. I'm going to take some nightquil. I'm going to get a good night's sleep. Lord, is it okay if I take nightquil? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My face not shaking. I just I just need to get some sleep, Lord. You wake up in the morning and it's worse. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? This is this is in everything in our lives. We we we I wake up in the morning say, \"Lord, come quickly.\" &gt;&gt; And I have to go through my whole day. This is what's expected of us. We had to go through our whole day expecting him to come in a twinkling in an eye, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What's What's the difference? &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that and what Abraham had to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are to be expecting. We're supposed to be anticipating his coming and living &gt;&gt; like he can come any moment. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we have to go put our work boots on. &gt;&gt; I wish we could skip that part. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly, Lord. &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes to get you in that mindset of of even so, come quickly. &gt;&gt; We got to plant our potatoes, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He's called us that. &gt;&gt; Some of them crazy people that that believed that God was coming back in 77 or what it was, went out and got loans and all that and and went into debt and they left the message because he didn't come the way that he &gt;&gt; that that they thought he should come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man. There's plenty of loonies out there. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about out there. I'm talking about in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are crazy. &gt;&gt; But even so, come quickly. But Lord, I I'm going to have to save up for a car in case mine breaks down or whatever more. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's expecting the best. and planning for the worst. &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that side of it. &gt;&gt; I don't like that side of it. I wish it was all gumb gumballs and lollipops and rainbows and whatever else, &gt;&gt; but it's not. Reality is he's called us to a faith. Lord, I want your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And if it's your perfect will for me to go through this trial, this struggle, this low valley, &gt;&gt; even so come quickly. &gt;&gt; Circumstance does not change the bride's outcome. Then on the third day, day three, Abraham so showed him or God showed Abraham where he was supposed to go. It wasn't a quick trip. Three days he started heading in a direction. &gt;&gt; It sounds like life. &gt;&gt; Just heading in a direction. Now, our goal is to get where God called us to be. &gt;&gt; And day by day, &gt;&gt; moment by moment, we're progressing along. We have that faith that God is going to move for us. We have that faith that God is doing something in our lives. And we also have that faith knowing that he's called us to do something that's uncomfortable sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. Can you imagine in I don't know about you, but in with me in my heart when I know I have something that I have to do that I don't like. &gt;&gt; Lord, please help me. Lord, I I don't Lord, you know this is this is not what I had in mind. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to work with that person again. Lord, I know that you're molding me and making me and you're using that guy and I'm not supposed to ball up my fist. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you're never going to get anything else but brother John up here. I'm sorry. This is just me. I'm not trying to be nothing. I'm not trying to hide from from me. Unfortunately, you can see it. &gt;&gt; Three days, Abraham. Oh, Lord, please help me. I don't know what I don't know what you're doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's those times and and Abraham felt like his prayers didn't even get up past the ceiling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'd lay there and he's asking, \"God, please. I know what you promised. I know what you said. I know that I'm going to be the father of nations.\" And you said the seed would come through Sarah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you said that it was going to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; And you've called me to go sacrifice him. I I I don't I don't understand. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'm the only one who's ever had the I don't understand thoughts. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't get it. &gt;&gt; And it's human nature to want to understand what's going on. We want to be in control. If we understand it, we can control it a little better. Some of you have been praying for deliverance for years and years from a certain habit, a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Let's just get down to where it is. &gt;&gt; We know in the word it's against his word the the the besetting sin that's hanging on us. We know it's against his word to have this attitude towards somebody or an attitude at all in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we're walking along and we struggle with it and we say, \"Lord, you said that you deliver me from this and I'm fighting it still.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's against your word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not your will for me to be having this. Some of you it's it's it's doubt that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's things that you hide. Some of you it's things that are very apparent. An attitude. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a habit. &gt;&gt; It's all these things. You know what your yours is. I know what mine is. &gt;&gt; And we know it's God's will that it's not supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And we go day by day and we're under we're we're we're we're questioning and we don't understand. We've got these questions. God, why? Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know I can't serve you the right way with this guilt hanging on me. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I told you it might go in a different direction. Let me tell you, this is a different direction. &gt;&gt; I know this isn't your perfect will. And I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. And yet I still have this thing. &gt;&gt; That's a hard way to be. It's a hard way to live. &gt;&gt; Guilt is an awful thing. And for a Christian that's falling short of the glory of God, that guilt is very prevalent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it should be. &gt;&gt; It should bother you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this.\" &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost saying, \"Hey, you're better than this. You mean the Holy Ghost would tempt us?\" &gt;&gt; And God did tempt Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't say he was wasn't going to deliver him. Now, Abraham was in the midst of the trial. He didn't know the end. We're we we have the luxury of knowing the end of Abraham's story. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. We have the luxury of knowing the end of your story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's rapture, right? &gt;&gt; It's that perfect word living in us. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of it, what does it feel like? It's so heavy. I don't understand God. Right? &gt;&gt; Why can't I overcome this? God, why are you tempting me this way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes. And we know what his perfect will is this in this situation. Just like Abraham knew what his the perfect will was in his situation. &gt;&gt; But it don't always make it easy. &gt;&gt; Guilt don't go away because you know you're not supposed to &gt;&gt; and that you will overcome it. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have faith that you will. &gt;&gt; That's that's right. But it don't make it easier to deal with. &gt;&gt; Not as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Three days journey. He's still waiting. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's been 10 years journey. You're still waiting. That's tight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. Oh, it was like I was telling my son Ben on the way over here. I said, \"This is the worst part of the service.\" I get up here and I I I've been preaching long enough and I've done it enough that I know that if I submit and get out of the way, then he'll take over. This part's easy right now. Now the pre and the post not so fun. The pre you're thinking, \"Oh, am I really finding the mind of God?\" And then afterwards like, \"Boy, you really miss God. It's miserable.\" &gt;&gt; So Abraham was preparing to take off and he knew that he was going to have to face Sarah and have have to ask her some questions, maybe skirt around a few questions. And then when he saw that a far off, he knew, \"Oh, it's coming. It's coming.\" And Abraham said unto his young men, \"Abide here with the ass, and I will and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you.\" Abra Abraham was tempted of God. Abraham understood the promise. He's still waiting for God to intervene at this moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Still waiting for God to intervene. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But he knew the promise and he quoted the promise and he stayed with the promise. I and the lad will return. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen. I don't know when God's going to step in here, but I know what the promise is. Right, &gt;&gt; brother and sister. Are you glad you know what the promise is? &gt;&gt; Thank God. I'd go crazy if I didn't know the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be able to make it if I didn't know what the promise is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He kept quoting the promise. His testimony was positive. &gt;&gt; Should we stop there for just a minute? His brother Joel Forny says, \"Wowy, wowy woo.\" We get those wowsy wowsy woo moments. Poor me. I can't believe I'm going through this. God, why are you doing this to me? God, you said I was an overcomer. I'm not an overcomer because I'm still dealing. And a testimony and the confession is not what it should be. If you're in the midst of that besetting sin, if you're in the midst of that problem, in that situation, God's still your deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still the one who made the promise, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Circumstance doesn't change. Jonah and the whale, right? Surrounded by b whale belly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His circumstance didn't dictate the outcome. &gt;&gt; Right. Sure did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The promise was he was going to preach in Nineveh. &gt;&gt; He didn't like it. He didn't want to do it. &gt;&gt; He ran from it. God said, \"Guess what? You're going through a pipe, old boy, or a fish in this circumstance. &gt;&gt; Not going to be fun. &gt;&gt; Circumstance didn't change the outcome. Your circumstance, brothers and sisters, will not will not change your outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; His will is what determines where we end up. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our circumstance. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Not our issues, not our our attitudes, but his will will determine our outcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; and Abraham took the the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife. And they went both of of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, \"My father.\" And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" And he said, \"Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Lord, you said you were my deliverer. &gt;&gt; You said you were my healer. &gt;&gt; You said I was an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; Where's the sacrifice? By your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; I can't heal you anymore. He can't heal you anymore than he did on the cross. There's a promise. The work was performed. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Where's my burnt offering, Lord? And Abraham said, \"My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\" So they both for So they went both of them together right up on the hill. Now Isaac was scratching his head too, &gt;&gt; still questioning. And they came to the place where God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there. And he laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. Following through, following through. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not going to act ask us to sacrifice our son, &gt;&gt; but he might ask us to sacrifice our pride. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. God's a healer. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the doctor. God's a healer. Right. It's his word. &gt;&gt; It's his word. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew what he was promised. Brothers and sisters, we get so much going on and we've got so much of life happening. &gt;&gt; Life life isn't chaotic anymore. It just happens. &gt;&gt; I'm past the chaos. I'm used to the chaos. Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm used to the chaos. &gt;&gt; It just happens &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God expects us and not only does he expect us to to deal with it, but he expects us to do it well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have I've I've I've asked all my kids. This is one of my rules growing up in my house. They don't like it when I preach. It's nothing bad. Don't worry, boys. You need to work in the in the food service or um what's the other thing? Retail. So, you know how to treat somebody when you order food and they get it wrong. Boy, that's hard. Boy, that's hard to do. But if you ever been on the other side of it and guess what? You know how to treat somebody. I can tell the ones that worked in retail, they're all no joke &gt;&gt; cuz we've all had those customers &gt;&gt; and they're always right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like they're just right for knocking out. But we need to be able to treat people with kindness in spite of the problems that we have. And it's frustrating &gt;&gt; and it's hard. &gt;&gt; But we need to learn how to deal with stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; We need to learn how to treat people that aren't Christians. &gt;&gt; Because just because they're not treating you like a Christian would treat you doesn't mean that you shouldn't treat them like a Christian should treat them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be the only Jesus they see &gt;&gt; all day long. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Have you seen some of them characters working in that fast food joint? They ain't seen G Jesus and a lot of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You might be the only ones. That was free. That wasn't in my notes either. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,\"Abraham, Abraham.\" And he said, \"Here am I.\" Ah. And he said, \"Lay not thine hand upon thy lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearst God.\" Fearst God. How fierest God. I'm going to keep believing and I'm going to keep trusting. If it's it's so important that we keep the mindset God's knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; But I'm lonely. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been sick for this long. God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this besetting sin. I'm an overcomer. It's going to happen. The promise is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what's best for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that you should just embrace that besetting sense of, \"Oh, God's using it. Oh, I No. No. Quite the opposite. You push that thing away and you stomp it and you kick it and you tell it, \"I will not. This is not me. &gt;&gt; This is not me.\" &gt;&gt; I'm not catering to this. &gt;&gt; Even so, come quickly. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You ever been in such a place in your life and you've been fighting with something for so long and it seems like and your prayers turn from even so come quickly to Lord, can you wait till I overcome this? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; There won't be a lot of people that admit that, Brother Freddy. But I've been in that place where I've said, \"Oh Lord, you're going to have to hold on a couple days till I overcome this cuz I know this ain't right.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's where we are, brothers and sisters. It it it's not supposed to shake us. It's not going to shake us. We're sons and daughters of God. He knows what's best for us. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; We're not always overcomers on our time because our strength is nothing. We can't do it on our own. &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the very point that he's trying to get across to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That might be the whole reason why you're struggling with this thing, whatever it might be, because he wants you to settle in and know that you are nothing &gt;&gt; without him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome anything without him. And maybe he wants you to settle in and say, \"God, I give up.\" &gt;&gt; I'm done. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had a demon cast out of me by a look of a man of God cuz I was at that point. I was praying about something and struggled and struggled and struggled. And this brother just looked at me. He was under the anointing. He was in a place. He didn't even pray for me. He didn't lay his hands on me. And I knew at that very moment that I was delivered. &gt;&gt; How's that possible? &gt;&gt; I finally said, \"God, I've been trying for years. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; Here's a man of God. Here's an opportunity. I I'm giving it to you.\" Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've got to get to the place, brothers and sisters, where we realize that it's God and only God. All he wants us to do is believe. &gt;&gt; See the promise and walk towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep going towards it. Keep moving towards it. But I got this circumstance don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in Jehovah Gyra. Now what if Abraham says now wait was that vision true? Let me study now. Was that vision true? Brother Ram saying, is Abraham going to question his experience with God? Something that's settled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where the devil wants to get you. &gt;&gt; Now, God said for me to take my boy and kill him. Now, how am I ever going to to be the father of nations? And that's my seed. And that's a promise seed. Now, how am I ever going to be the father of nations when God is destroying the only hope I have? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Destroying the only hope that I have. &gt;&gt; Is that the hope? Only hope that I have. No, I still have I still got his word. He promised me back there that he'd do it. And through Isaac, all the world would would be blessed. Through Isaac, all the world would be blessed. &gt;&gt; Through you, all the world will be blessed. The bride is what's holding back &gt;&gt; those demons. &gt;&gt; So he said, listen to Abraham now. I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God is able to raise him up from the dead. Oh my, even with a a horse throat, I feel religious. So brother Brandham's got a horse throat. If I receive received him as one from the dead, what? Guess what? The garden made us dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we've received him as one from the dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We've received his promise. Don't matter the circumstance. Don't matter how how are we going to make this happen? We're not. &gt;&gt; We're not. God's going to make it happen. &gt;&gt; The seed in his own body was dead at 100 years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to being with. And then God performed a miracle and put his germ of life in there. He received him from the dead as one being dead. Then God's able to raise him up from the dead. Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. If that wouldn't make a Presbyterian shout. Think of that. &gt;&gt; So here he is. That's what I That's what I'm We're building our experience through our trials. And God's tempting us. We're building these experiences. &gt;&gt; All these trials. Look, I'm going through some hard stuff. Harder than I've ever had to go through. And as a Christian, you could all say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Going through some hard stuff, and it's harder now than it ever has been. &gt;&gt; But you know what the difference is? I'm not near as worried as I used to be about it. &gt;&gt; I'm not near as concerned about how the outcome's going to be as I used to be. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God tempted me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he followed through with his word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And after every victory, my faith got bigger. &gt;&gt; After every victory, I come back and said, \"Well, God, you did this for me. Is it too hard for God?\" My &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to his name. I'm going to switch gears a little bit and and just look at Philippians 2. Verse one. Now I got to make it fast. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, any if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, one mind. So what's God's mind for you? What is if if we're called to have the same mind of Christ, what is his goal? What is his purpose? What is his whole what is he waiting for us to get his mind? And we know that the prophet said he's under greater anticipation to call us home than we are &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to go home. That's his mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's called us to have that mindset. We're going home. &gt;&gt; Well, brother John, what? We can't go with all these circumstances. No, we're going home. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we get there. what we have to overcome to get there. We're going to get there. &gt;&gt; That's that's God's mindset, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he sees. Does he see me fall short? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Does he see you fall short? &gt;&gt; Has he thrown you out? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it. That guy, I'm telling you, I have worked on him and worked on him and worked on him. You know, we'll just start over with somebody else. No, he has that image in his mind that he had of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, \"I'm going to fill out that per that that picture album and you're going to be there &gt;&gt; in spite of you.\" &gt;&gt; Watch how I could sing, \"My God is an awesome God.\" Why? Because I know &gt;&gt; that he's put up with me. How awesome is that? &gt;&gt; My wife and kids don't even want to do that sometimes. But he keeps putting up with me. &gt;&gt; And we've all had those moments where we're saying, \"God, why do you put up with me? I'm just going to take this and just because it's encouraging. I just want to I want to take this little I don't this is the way the Lord's leading me. So, we're going to I put it in here and I didn't understand why, but we're just going to do it. It's a I perceive that thou art a prophet. It's 53. Brother Brown says, \"And coming down through the people.\" Now, now you all heard this before. I'm not telling you anything new, but I I want to stir it up, make you understand. Coming down through the people. Now, down in the south, they have the the Jim Crow law. That is colored and white can't mix together. So here come a a a colored girl about 17 18 years old and oh she was in her this her her eyes was white with cataract as my shirt and she was coming pressing through the crowds somebody please help me daddy and I thought why don't some of these people help that poor girl so I thought while he wasn't looking I'd move along a little so I got over there and I kept getting right in her way and watching ing these men to come. And she came right up and I stood like that and she bumped into me. She her hands tugged me. She said, \"Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.\" Said, \"Daddy.\" I thought I said, \"What are you looking for?\" She said, \"Sir, I've lost my daddy. I'm blind.\" She said, \"I can't find him. I don't know what to do.\" Said, \"Nobody will help me.\" Will you help me, kind sir? H &gt;&gt; will you help me con sir? &gt;&gt; So this is a a black girl and it was okay back then. It wasn't that's what black folks want to be called was colored. So don't get all crazy with that. That's what they maybe they didn't want to but that's what they were called. She's in a group of white people, blind, and lost her only way home, her daddy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Tough circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I said, \"Well, I don't see no more color people around here.\" Said, \"Where are you from?\" She said, \"Memphis.\" &gt;&gt; So, he's bringing forth. He said, \"Look, you're in a you're in a dangerous spot right now. You're a black girl in a white crowd. This is not a nice place. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz cuz a lot of them racist claim Christianity, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And shame on them, &gt;&gt; back then and now. Let's go ahead and say it. &gt;&gt; And I looked and there was a bunch of charter buses sitting there and I knowed one of them was from Memphis. And that's how I said, \"What are you doing over here?\" She said, \"I listening to the radio this morning.\" She said, \"I heard about all those deaf and dumb people they had up there that was deaf and dumb last night speaking on the radio.\" And I said, \"And you're blind?\" See? I said, \"What'd you come over here for?\" She said, \"I come to see the healer.\" I said, \"The what?\" She said, \"The healer.\" And I said, \"You don't believe that, do you?\" &gt;&gt; Hm. Sounds like she's tempting. You're getting tempted. The prophet is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; This is God called man tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; H Yeah. He says, \"Now that looked like a hypocrite, too, taking advantage of a blind woman.\" See, but I wanted to see whether she really believed it. Do you believe that's the truth? She said, \"Yes, sir.\" And I I began to feel it and she said, \"Yes, sir. I believe it.\" And I said, \"Why don't you believe that God would do something like that? As far advanced as med medical science is h science can't do nothing for you, why would you believe something supernatural would? Yeah. &gt;&gt; H. She said, \"Sir,\" and said, \"When I was a little girl, I got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor told me when they got ripe, I don't know what that means, but when it got ripe, they'd take them off.\" And said, \"Now they're ripe.\" And said, \"They say if they take them out, they pull the optical nerves right out of my eyes.\" Said, \"I can't see.\" And the only hope I got is to get in there. And this is the man last the this is the man's last night here. And they tell me I can't even get near the building. I've lost my daddy. I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. I've had those moments. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I said, \"Do you believe if you'd get in there, you'd be healed?\" She said, \"Well, I heard of a man on the radio this morning from up at Connect Ket, Missouri. Had been blind for 10 years and he received his sight.\" So said, \"Well, couldn't I be healed too?\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you overcome, too? &gt;&gt; Can't you be healed, too? &gt;&gt; Can't God take care of your problems, too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many's had something miraculous happen? Raise your hands. Get them up there. &gt;&gt; Look around. Whatever your situation is, if he did it for brother Harry, can he do it for me? &gt;&gt; If he did it for brother Rob, &gt;&gt; can he do it for me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to stop looking within ourselves and say, \"I'm a son of do son or daughter of God.\" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have just as much right to your healing, your deliverance, your overcoming as anybody else here. &gt;&gt; Sure. His word is not a respector of persons. &gt;&gt; I said, \"Do you believe that?\" She said, \"Sir, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll just get me into where that man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy after that.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I'll be able to find my daddy. She had a tiepole. She had something to anchor her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we know it wasn't brother Brandham. It was Jesus Christ. But he was a channel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She held on to that. &gt;&gt; All these problems are going to go away if I can just get to that place. &gt;&gt; I'll find my own daddy. I'll get my own way home. I felt my heart drop right away from from me. I thought, poor old blind thing. I said, \"Look, lady, do you mean that?\" Still tempting her. &gt;&gt; Still tempting her. Do you mean that? &gt;&gt; She said, \"Yes.\" Oh, I said, \"Maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see.\" And she grabbed me up like that. She said, \"Is you the healer?\" And I said, \"No, ma'am.\" I said, \"I'm Brother Brandham. Jesus is the healer.\" &gt;&gt; And she grabbed me. She said, \"Oh, Brother Brandham, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me.\" And I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby. &gt;&gt; Fanny Crosby never did get her sight. Never did. &gt;&gt; She never did. And I'm I'm going for memory, but if memory serves her, right, Brother Random said that if she would have got her healing, she wouldn't have been able to write those songs that she wrote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, God's a healer. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But as a son and daughter of God, he heals within the bounds of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you're casting a death. No, she never did quit praying for healing. Brother Brand doesn't say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But she kept believing. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's called us to do, to keep believing, to keep having that faith that he's called us to as sons and daughters of God. He's called us to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't call us just to believe because of the results because we don't like the results sometimes. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean he's not God. And it doesn't mean that his will hasn't been done. &gt;&gt; General orders by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; You are more than a conqueror. All these things and we hold on to those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll know when God says that's my will and then we won't have to ask anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But until that's settled in your heart, just like that faith is settled in your heart, you keep believing for his promises. Right. &gt;&gt; And I looked and I thought her only hope, Christ. I said, \"Now, I don't want to be recognized in the crowd. Lady, you bow your head and we'll have a word of prayer.\" Said, \"First, I want to hold your hand while I'm praying.\" I couldn't get her hand off my coat. She wasn't going to let me go. &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will wrestle with you. &gt;&gt; I will hold on to you, God. &gt;&gt; I'm not letting go. &gt;&gt; I'm not stopping. I'm going to keep believing. You're my deliverer. You're my my overcomer. You're my healer. And I said, \"Now let me have your hand.\" She said, \"Don't pass me.\" And I took hold of her hand and pulled it off and held her hand. And while I was praying, now you can mark this is fanaticism if you want to. That would be between you and God. See, I could only tell the truth. Something happened. I knew the woman was healed. I was waiting for the shrinkage of that cataract. I said, \"Now keep your lids closed over your eyes.\" I said, \"Now you raise your head just about to where you think my voice is coming and I'll tell you what to do.\" She said, \"Yes, sir.\" Said something cold went over me. I said, \"Just raise your head.\" And I said, \"Now open your eyes, for thus saith the Holy Spirit, you've received your sight.\" And she opened her eyes and she said, \"Is that light?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Is them black dots there? Is that people?\" Her eyesight was not clear. &gt;&gt; It wasn't It wasn't all the way there. &gt;&gt; This is another point where God is tempting this girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many times did brother Random say, \"Go confessing. Go believing.\" &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your symptoms are, you keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your your your your uh besetting sin is. You keep confessing your healing. &gt;&gt; You keep going. Keep marching towards that thing. &gt;&gt; Don't settle for it. Well, I can see white lights and shapes of people. That's good enough. Oh Lord, she says, \"Oh Lord, I who was once blind can now see.\" She let out a big scream. And then they've been some people standing there and watching and here they come. My you talk about and I happened to look now he's trying to get out of a meeting and he's supposed to meet these brothers that are supposed to escort him to a car and he snuck out a back door but there was this mass of people he couldn't get through and this is when he ran into this just in case you uh and I happened to look and there was an old man standing there with a cane an old club in his hand his leg was twisted sideways said brother Brandham I know you. He said, \"I've been standing in the rain for eight or 10 days here.\" Eight or 10 days in the rain. Why? &gt;&gt; God was tempting him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Said, \"You wouldn't pass me, would you, Brother Brandon?\" Said, \"I got a bunch of kitties at home.\" Said, \"They need me.\" said, \"A woman going to run over me and I'm twisted my leg like this.\" I said, \"Do you believe?\" He said, \"With all my heart and I said of in the name of the Lord Jesus, give me your cane.\" &gt;&gt; It didn't say his foot straightened out first. &gt;&gt; It didn't say he was healed and jumped around and handed him the cane. &gt;&gt; He said, \"Give me that cane.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know. Aa Allen used to have an anvil on the platform, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what would he do? I need healing for my eyes. Give me your glasses. &gt;&gt; He set them on the anvil and crush them with a hammer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't no turning back. Ain't no turning back. And the Lord who is my sovereign judge when that man in the act of faith handed his cane his leg come straight and he jumped into the air and screamed to the top of his voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you in need of? How has God been tempting you? Where are you at in your walk? Are you questioning? Do you not understand? You wouldn't be the only one. This message, have you read some stuff online and it's in your mind? Sometimes God opens portals to hell to get your attention. What are you made of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are you at in your experience? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants all your hope hope destroyed. We don't need hope in the last days. It starts with hope. A lot of times, a lot of things start with hope, don't get me wrong, but hope is shaky. &gt;&gt; We have to be established in faith, brothers. Come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's your walk? It's time to self-examine. Say, \"Brother John, I I believe I believe. But man, I'm really struggling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've been in a circumstance for so long. I've dealt with a besetting sin for so long. &gt;&gt; I've dealt with this struggle or that struggle. Does your circumstance change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. Does your problem change who God is? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Be sure that your call is sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're going through, brothers and sisters. Stand with me if you would. I don't care how bad that you feel tempted. Sometimes that tempted temptation is of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to make sure that you know that you know. And the and the closer we get to home, the more important it is that we're sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So things are going to get tighter. Things are going to get harder. We're not going to have this this instant success, if I could put it that way. This get-richqu scheme that that the devil's trying to feed people. He's trying to to to smooth over this this well, that's good enough. Nobody else is living like that. Nobody's still, you know, even the message churches, they're they're bickering. Some of them are bickering back and forth and we've got those that that believe in emotion and and those that believe that you have emotion. You're Let me tell you something. I've never seen nor has brother Harry or anybody else. Nobody's ever seen emotion heal the sick. Nope. So we shouldn't get emotional. No. I said emotion doesn't heal the sick. Emotion doesn't deliver. But I tell you what, if you get delivered, you're gonna have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you get if you get healed, you're going to have some emotion. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. That's where the balance is, brothers and sisters. We're not focusing on one side or the other. We know that they're both united in the fact that he's my deliverer, and I'm happy about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and and I'm going to express that happiness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father, Lord, I believe with all my heart, Lord Jesus, that you have spoke, Lord, if to no one else but myself, Lord. It seems so hard in lessa these days, Lord, this this old flesh. And it seems ironic, Lord, that we've got all these temptations around us. And we find that you yourself tempt us to see where our faith is, to see if we really believe. And Lord, you're not doing it out of meanness. You're conditioning us, Lord. And we can go home, Lord. I know there's people here, Lord, that are facing impossible situations. Lord, maybe it's their in their own life. Maybe it's with a sickness. Maybe it's with overcoming. Maybe Lord Jesus, they see in your word where you said raise them up in the way that they should go and when they get older they will not depart. And Lord, they're they seem so far away from where you called them in the way that we raised them. But Lord, is there anything too hard for God? Is there any circumstance, Lord Jesus, that we as a bride won't be able to overcome? &gt;&gt; No, Lord. I know with all my heart there's nothing too hard for you. Lord, help us to look to your word, to your promise, and embrace, Lord Jesus, what you've called us to. And Lord, even when our our mind is one set one way and you go the opposite direction, Lord, I know as the bride of Christ, we we say, \"All right.\" But sometimes it hurts even still. Sometimes we can't understand it. Lord, just give us grace. Lord, we love you. I pray, Father, that you would just help each and every one in this building tonight, Lord, to look to the author and the finisher of our faith to go ahead and finish our faith. whatever may come Lord we love you and we thank you for it Lordes &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Amen. Can we sing uh pass me nod? You want to sing with me just a minute? If you have a need tonight, he's here. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, \"Brother John, maybe he's tempting me.\" Maybe he is. But at any moment he could deliver you. &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight's your night. &gt;&gt; Oh, pass me now, oh gentle Savior. Hear my heart cry. Let's worship him now. Why others out are calling?

God always knows what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not in dark. He's not surprised. &gt;&gt; He knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; He's not shocked of your shortcomings and your faults and your failures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he's also not shocked &gt;&gt; of your faith &gt;&gt; and your belief in him. &gt;&gt; He knows who you are better than you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I got lots of pictures of my kids all over the house. Not so many of me. There's a reason for that. Was, you know, when I forget what they were like when they were little, I can go find a picture And sometimes we forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we're saying, God, I'm not I'm not anything like you called me to be. &gt;&gt; I fall so short. &gt;&gt; What's the first thing he does? Brother Harry pulls out that picture of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is you. &gt;&gt; You see it in my word. This is you. &gt;&gt; He ain't never going to forget. &gt;&gt; And that's what he sees. He always sweet sees that. Cuz when they get bigger, they ain't always so sweet. &gt;&gt; I wasn't either. And neither were you. &gt;&gt; But every now and then, it's good to remember what they were before the foundation of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he just pulls out that picture. I open up that word and I say, \"Oh, mama, that's me. &gt;&gt; Mama, that's me.\" &gt;&gt; I see myself in that word. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have any faults? No. That's when I need it the most is when I'm falling short and I'm I'm failing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need to look into his promise and see that he sees me the same way he and and he's wanting me to see who I am. Amen. God bless you, brother Justin. I appreciate you all. God bless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many you can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. We'll sing this song as we get ready to go. Let's just stay stay in worship just for a couple more minutes. I know it's late and kids getting back to school, but let's just sing. He didn't throw the clay away. You know, Brother John's talking about he every time you stumble and fall and that's the only song I could really think of. So, let's sing a song. He is the potter. I am the clay molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks. He just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. And over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the way I am today. And it's all because Jesus did all the clay. empty and broken. I came back to him, a vessel unworthy. I've been so scared by sin. But he did not despair. He started over again. Oh, and I'm so eating the road clay. [Music] Now, he knows me and makes me into his lik of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus in the clear way. Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likess. He fashions the clay of the soul of honor I am today. And it's all because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. [Music] He is the potter and I am the clay. Molded in his image is how he wants me to stay. But when I stumble and I fall and my vessel breaks, he just picks up all the broken pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. [Music] Now over and over. He holds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the That's all of our earth. That's what I am today. And is all because Jesus didn't throw a clear away. [Music] Now over and over.

[Music] if I'm better broken [Music] I'll be broken for you thank you [Applause] beautiful song beautiful words to say until you're going through it if we could sing like that whenever we've gone through trials wouldn't it be awesome would you stand up and just Let Her Fly most of us sit around like this why me Lord wowzy wowzy hmm but God's merciful to us in him one well to be thanking him every day for all the good that he's done every day we just kind of think well Lord when you're going to do this and when you're going to do that I've been waiting now for about 45 minutes I mean I prayed that prayer a while ago how long does it take you from the sound of us it's going to take a lot longer let us take a trip today what do you say let us walk into a room that is very very hot a room that is the temperature will be so excruciating that it'll be hard for you to breathe but what is going on in this room is going to be very essential and necessary for us to be what God wants us to be we're going to be looking into a great cauldron or a vat if you wish to call it that the temperature must be at least two thousand and twelve degrees for the process to begin go and go or is this getting too hot for you first Peter chapter 1 verse 6. we're in you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations that the trial of your face being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire may be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now listen what a compliment that Peter pays to those of us who've never seen him whom having not seen yet love in whom though now you see him not yet yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls praise God I may let you be remembered today as we pray heavenly father as we have our heads bowed in your presence Lord thank you for the service thus farther singing and the praise and the worship now we come to the breaking of the bread Lord we're praying that once again you would pass by this way and we would be able to see but the way the bread is broken that it was you who did it you have a marvelous way of doing that whether it's an African brother preaching or an Indian brother or whether it would be a brother from Europe different parts of the world but when the bread is broke it always has the signature about it if it's broken by you so we pray today that you take your word and break the bread of life to us that we can be helped by our gathering today Father I'm holding these prayer calls in my hands Lord and you see the needs your God desperate needs we're asking you that should move form father Lord I pray for Lance today you see dear God in the home in the bed and can't hardly move because of his back been bothering him for several days I pray in the name of Jesus that should move for him today father I want to thank you for giving Erica a good day yesterday she was able to get up and cook and clean some and do some things around the house we're just so grateful Lord God I told her last night this is only going to be one of many we're believing Lord God that you're going to completely turn it around and restore her father speak to us today Lord God In The Name of Jesus we ask and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated we certainly welcome each of you here today to the house of the Lord and let me call your attention back to verse 7. when Peter writes this and he says that the trial of your face being much more precious than gold now Peter didn't say that actually your face was more precious than God read it there if you'd like but he says the trial of your face isn't it amazing now we know that Faith there's no question about it but faith is more precious than gold but this is not the emphasis that Peter is placing on in this verse but he's making the comparison of faith and comparing it to Gold well how could that be well it's not just that Faith itself is compared to Gold but it's the transforming or the changing of the gold that Peter is comparing Faith to read it again with me that the trial of your face the trial of your face being much more precious than that of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire that it might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ so the testing of our faith is worth more than gold but also worth more than the testing of gold now we know that there's been many many gold rushes down through time and there's something about gold man absolutely loves it no question about it he loves it and it is caused so many deaths and so much suffering and so many hardships if you've ever really looked at many of the gold rushes that have been down through time and you realize it was very few that ever got rich well who got rich in some cases more than anybody else was the guy who owned the general store because he jacked up everything that he had and a lot of people went there and they thought they was going to get rich and they left worse off than there were before they ever went and yet we know there's something about gold still to this day a lot of our Market is based upon the precious metals of the earth gold silver brass all kinds of things that are there and God puts him there he knew that man would use them but he also knew that man would abuse them so Peter is comparing and he wants the Saints then and us as well to see that as as worthy as gold was and during this time frame when Peter writes this uh gold was a great great thing and it's always been we know since man founded even the Book of Genesis before man ever started started mining gold the Bible mentions and God had Moses to write it down when he talked about the four rivers that come out of the Garden of Eden and he began to write to this one particular area and he mentioned it by name and he said the gold is great there so God even himself took note of this of what gold would actually be but when we're talking about spiritual goal of course it's a different thing it's not something you can go to a jewelry store and buy it's not something that you and I can mind it's not something that we can make but it's something that God starts molding in us and of course before it can be refined you first have to have something thing to begin with so when people find the ore and I've seen a little bit of it and and see little specks and little small pieces you know where they get it but yet it's not in its purest form whenever they go to digging it out now depending on how pure that you want to make it you can make it more pure and more pure but what actually does it is fire and temperature so you've got to run it through one process and then you let it cool and then you take it back again and then you're emptying more off and more on so Peter found a great parallel between gold and our face that is compared to it now ultimately says whenever you look at the natural gold of the earth it is absolutely and will one day be destroyed it will be annihilated all the metals of the earth that have such precious value now will one day one day rather be destroyed when the atomic bomb arms will bring this place almost to Total Annihilation there won't hardly be anything left but the Lord God will keep the frame and the frame will be refurbished now notice he says that gold no matter how valuable that it is that the trying of our face is even greater because gold can perish now you can bring it to a spot to where it can be destroyed it can be absolutely annihilating and gold being refined by fire is whenever the dross begins to rise now say it like this several years ago Carol and I stood in South Africa and we went to a gold mine and it was one that that pretty much mined everything out and what they were still doing is they was taking the the trailings of the of the great big piles of dirt now years and years ago they was only able to take out so much of the gold out of the trailings as they call it and but here's these humongous mounds of dirt and crushed up Stone but they found out that his man began to understand more about it that he could run that same dirt through another chemical process which has been highly refined and they were able to get more gold out of that pile of dirt they'd been Landing there some of it for a hundred years some of it for 110 years but yet running it through a different process they was able to take more and more gold so they had this pot of gold and it was setting over a molten fire it was fire that was so hot and the God that was standing there doing it there was a couple of them and they had to have these heat resistant suits in order to be able to work it because it would have burned their flesh totally off of their skeleton it was so hot so they had to be dressed in a certain way and then they would take and pour it inside of this pot now this particular gold had been used over and over and over and over and over again weeks on end and they bring people to that mine and show them the same thing over and over again and this particular Ore had been used multiple times and by the time we saw it it was about 99.9 percent pure but each time it was run through the process it was making it more pure more pure now it's beautiful as it was when it was taken out of the Earth but yet it had pyrite in it it had dirt in it it had other chemicals that had fool's gold which is pyrite and it had different things in it and in order to be able to bring the Purity out of the gold what they had to do was bring the temperature up higher and higher and higher in order to separate the impure from the pure so when the fire would get hot it would cause the impurities to begin to rise to the top now they would take then a little scoop of a thing I look like a little coupon of a thing and with a long on a Long Rod where it wouldn't burn them up and it would begin to rise to the top and they could take that off well then they would bring it a little bit higher and it would become more would come out and more would come out each one of those those dips was taking the impurities from the gold now the gold is able to take that type of heat but it takes that type of temperature to be able to separate the impure from the pure are you hearing me today now if God requires and God wants us to be broken as our brothers so beautifully sung the song if that's what it requires to make us to be like he wants us to be is it that really what we want in the bottom line now if if God could get us then and truly we have value in his eyes when he finds this as we are he found us lost he found us all muddled up in the sins of the world we had Fool's Gold we had dirt we had the office mess and stuff probably have very little goal in reality but we had enough that was worth running through the smelting process so God began to allow trials to happen now the dirt it doesn't take near as much heat near as much temperature so when we first got saved God started letting us be tried God turned the temperature up to about 50 degrees and boy we thought man alive I'm doing so good I'll tell you what I'm a sweating like I don't know what and I'm going through the test and the trial praise God and God reached down on there and got a little something out of you and said it over on the on the side and you said praise the Lord I'm on my way to canaan's land and God puts you in the furnace neck the week after that God to turn the temperature up to about a hundred and you sought glory to God I'm twice as strong as I was last week and truly you were and week after week trial after trial test after test God kept turning the temperature up it kept going higher and higher and your thoughts and your shortcomings and your impurities kept floating to the top now it takes the rising of the temperature in order to separate these things from yourself but you see those things are actually in the ground and molded in the ground but the gold was created now with iron ore with silver with many of the precious metals of the earth they've got a smelting process for each one it differs one to the other because of the chemical breakdown and the type the temperature that it takes to break it down but whenever it comes into the gold of God it's refined when the draw is removed now as I stood there and I looked at that and I watched that part of gold and whatever they'd put it over there and it was so hot and I moved as close as I could without being in danger because I've got boundaries around it because they don't want you to get hurt but as I looked at it myself I thought I've been there I've been there every child of God's been there and yet some of you maybe you're there today and maybe some of you just got out and God's got you over here in in the cooling Avenue of your walk as God now and God's given you a little bit of rest and he's kind of giving you a breather and he's helping you with good things I aren't we glad he does that to us we couldn't take it if you did in France but the mercy of God knows exactly where the breaking point is for each one of us and that's the way out of his Sovereign Grace that he does so then whenever a person's face now remember it's not you're shouting that's going to the fire and it's not even your emotion or you're jumping and we believe in all that do we not but yet it's not any of that that is actually being tried it's not even your ability to sing or not to sing it's not even your ability to memorize the word to quote the word no what Peter is focusing on is the trying or the testing of your faith now what's it for brother Donnie it's to prove to you and not so much to God because God done knows what you'll be when you come out but it's to prove to you the faith that you have now you see God will allow stress and pressure to come our way he will allow sometimes relationships things with people friends family church people God will allow a stirring of our relationships in order to let a little bit of unforgiveness or bitterness that we did not realize we had and God will turn that temperature up just a little bit in order to bring that out and you know what that'll do that will cause that unforgiving spirit that you have within you to rise to the top of your gold now I'll tell you one thing if you've never had any stress uh things to go along with relationships God bless you I'm praying for you because you're going to eventually like whether it's your mama and you or your daddy and you or your brothers and sisters or people you go to church with or your best friend or whoever we're going to have them that's just part of it does God keep those from us as his people he does not as a matter of fact God will let you go through more than anybody else in the world so stress will be able to deepen actually and strengthen a Christian's walk I know we don't want to hear these words but but it's the truth so in the words of job job said it this way in job 23 when he has tried me or tested me then I will come forth as gold now I'll put this up and I want you to read this with me on the process of how to refine gold so to refine gold he must be applied to force the impurities to the surface the impurities are called dross the temperature must reach 2 thousand one hundred and two degrees Fahrenheit oh Jesus now the sad part about it is God won't allow us to take this fireproof suit into the smelter so it's the people on the outside I mean that's the way it is the preachers sometimes they're standing up there with that fireproof suit on and they're burning you up ain't they I mean they are setting you on fire and they're smiling and laughing and having the biggest time ever was well he better not laugh much because he's fixing to go through the same thing so you see it's the people standing on the outside of that are the ones that are administering and they're doing the goal the very best thing that can be done for them so the temperature must reach 2102 degrees fahrenheit as the dross or the impurities rise they are removed and more heat is supplied now watch what happens whenever dirt will be able to be released I I didn't go into an in-depth study to find out the metallurgical value and what temperature that each thing can be released but let's just look at it this way and say that dirt can be released at say 750 degrees Fahrenheit so whenever seven if the goal reaches 750 degrees Fahrenheit and then the dirt comes out and said man I'm getting out of here whoa I can't take this no more I know if I'll go up to the top I know they'll set me free I know if I'll go to the top I'll get out of here do you realize that's the way a lot of folks do God and that's the way they do Church whenever difficulties come around the church what do some people do the first little trial they bail on you they jump out the first little test comes through and the church goes through a trying time and a testing time and people say I'm about ready to look for me in the other Church go ahead dirt go ahead you dirt bag go ahead you dross come on now somebody preach with me I don't know about you when it's all said and done I want to be left in the pot amen if God's got to keep cranking it up and cranking it up Lord you ain't running me off I've got good goals amen so we'll say them that the dirt begins to this metallurgical reaction begins to happen and the goal starts you know the goal is the gold is good now believe it or not the gold is good it says I like this I really enjoy this this is my spot this is where I am this is where I'm brought to my very best Clarity this is where I'm brought to what I really want to be now this is why our Humanity our makeup does not like trials because your flesh ain't gold Jesus Christ will never see himself in your human body right now the only way he will ever see himself when you are in a human body is the new one you get on the day of the change is that right now notice in when the temperature rises then we'll say the dirt releases first and the dirt will come up from the pot wherever it's coming from each one of those little things that sell inside the go it begins to release the dirt release the dirt release the dirt and the dirt will begin to come up to the top then the individual standing out there and it's got that little thing and you'll dip it over like this like a Little Dipper and you'll go to skimming around the top and he pours that dirt on the outside then no more is coming out because it's reached the max so they've got to crank it up a little more and then they'll they'll find floating up the top oh my goodness what's I see there oh wow what that looks like temper now I know there ain't nobody here ever been through that but I'll say for these sorry centers that stream these services so there comes a little temper up to the top of it and the man reaches in there and he grabs a hold to that he begins to skim that right off the top well they let it sit for a few more minutes no more temper raises so what do they do crank the temperature they go to crank and the temperature and then they let us sit there and sit there and have remember it's boiling it's a cooking it's a cooking that gold is just a cooking and ever to ever degree that they add to it that goal says come on I can take some more come on I can take some more the whole Glory but yet every impurity inside of there is screaming to get out the dirt wants out the temper wants out the intolerance the unforgiving spirit whatever it is it wants out and that ain't but half the story God wants it out now notice the process continues and continues and continuous heat is supplied and reapplied until the gold is pure the refiner knows the gold is pure when he looks into the gold and sees his clear reflection so then here the refiner is standing there and he got some dirt off the top it got some ironpara at all he got this all temper off anxiety stress worry materialism he began to keep on doing it over and over and then the man reaches over and he looks inside of there and he can see his own image in this pot of gold here it is it's now reached over 2 000 degrees and the gold is not screaming for Mercy the gold is not safe let me out let me out turn it down turn it down I can't take it no more the gold is in its Glory why because the refiner can see himself in the goal I wonder how clear you and I are reflecting the Lord Jesus today I wonder when he looks at us does he see just a very vague image not no doubt he sees a part of himself because he's done a great work in many of our Lives has he not so we don't want to belittle that but I wonder then by looking if he would be able to look at Donnie Reagan today and he would look at you and look at you and he would bend over into the pot would he see what would he see what do you see himself as such Clarity that he'd be able to see not my eyes but his would he be able to see not my facial features but his isn't that what we want more than anything in the world now you remember in the Bible when the Lord Jesus prayed for a man and he was actually blind and he prays for this man and whenever he does the man his eyes are partially touched and he says I see men as trees I see men as truth now it is strange that the Lord Jesus would have to pray for this man twice was it just that the man didn't have enough Faith to release it all at once or what was there a Divine Purpose to be honest with you I'm not sure but we can see that the work of God is a process so here the man he was not able to see men as they are but he looked out there brother Taylor and he saw men and they they looked real vague like he said man looked like trees sorta I I ca I can't make it out well I wonder if the Lord Jesus would be able to look in the vat of our life or the cupola of our life would he see us as people that love him people that want to go to heaven people that want to be right but that's not what he's looking for you see you'd be able to look in nearly every Church in this area today and he would find people that don't want to be lost he would be able to look and not say almost every Church in the whole state of Tennessee as far as even in the United States they was none of them probably went there today and so I'm going to church so I can go to hell I'm going to church so I can be deceived because I want to be lost nobody in the right mind would want that so they're going to church because they feel like they're going to get something there that will help them be ready for heaven probably everybody who doesn't go for that reason but we'll say the majority of them do so but he's not looking for those who just want to go to heaven because that's the old song says everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die and that's what we got to do is die to ourselves so if he was looking for that then he would look in the in the cupola of gold and he would say oh yes everybody in there nobody wants to be lost everybody in there wants to go to heaven everybody in there wants me to bless them oh they're wanting new cars they're wanting new homes and then preachers keep giving them the 13 principles of how to be a blessed man and the 14 principles of how to do this and the 19 principles on how to do that but he ain't just looking in the vet for that what he's looking for is to see himself himself and what every aspect of our life so when he was here he not only healed the sick and raised the dead but he also faced persecution he wants to see that in our lives so we are going to be persecuted that's part of being a child of God but what he wants to see is his image of behavior reflecting itself through us and our Behavior oh I heard the voice of God say an amazing thing this week absolutely overwhelmed me I was just alone praying talking to the Lord and I heard him say these three things walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king wow walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king so guess what that's what I'm going to do so God wants to see himself when we fight he wants to see himself whenever we're being under oppression of the enemy and persecuted so he's looking for himself in every aspect of our life and that is what this separates of course the bride from the church because the church wants simply a ticket to Heaven no requirement you don't have to do anything you don't have to dress a certain way behave a certain way and do whatever you want to do oh sure that's what they think Heaven's all about it's just to get everybody out of this place it fits that way in six weeks heaven will be turned back into a shape like Johnson City in no time won't it it won't be a fit place for a child of God to live so the refiner wants to be able to look over into the cupola of gold and to be able to see his own reflection now Malachi 3 tells us this but who may have died in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appears for he is like a Refiner's Fire a refiners fire like Fuller's Soap he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness so God works a similar process in the life of his people that a man would in refining go now you see what this goal will do is when the temperature begins to rise and it begins to release things that's actually become a part of it through the process of Creation in the earth now the gold didn't ask for the dirt the gold didn't ask for the Fool's Gold but it was actually formed there in the creation of the world the earth and the temperature begins to rise and it forces the gold to release this part that is not itself listen to me if you're a child of God adultery is not who you are if you're a child of God pornography is not who you are lying cheating drinking so on and so on that is not who you are somebody say Amen so what does God want God wants to be able to release that out of you so the real you can shine through so it will it will expose our weaknesses it will expose our faults oh goodness we none of us like that do we you're like yeah brother Brown told us he said the reason we go to church is to see our faults oh my goodness how many goals to church they can be preached on why did y'all even come today we go through trials so we can see what we are lacking what we need oh my notices so it exposes our weaknesses our faults our struggles our impurities do that when the heed is turned up and when the heat gets hot it is very uncomfortable in it oh my goodness I'll see some of y'all saying here and I know what phase of life you're in according to kind of how you're reacting in the service some of you is wrapped up in thermal blankets some of you are sitting there sweating which lets me know where you are in the cycle of life and so each one of us were able to go through these different things but myself I I can be able to tolerate heat better than I can cold now I've been to Canada and it's 40 minus 40. and whenever I get done preaching I was soaking wet and they would pull the the vehicle right up to the door I basically stepped out of the church door and the car was right there because there's a freedom that's afraid I'd freeze to death because of being so cold and yet then people stand outside with a long sister stand there with a long sweater hanging down like this minus 40 standing out there talking like you folks here would in 70 or 75. yeah their blood is like molasses so they're used to it they're used to it they can stand there and do it I don't like that kind of weather God never made that place for me polar bears and all that sort of thing they can have it as far as I'm concerned I can deal with heat a lot better but it's the same way when it comes to our flesh and our soul whenever the pressure goes to be turned on our flesh oh we'll cry and belly ache oh I didn't think Christianity is going to be like this I didn't know it was going to be so hard to go through that and the flesh will go on and on and on and the soul is saying Lord Purify Me Lord cleanse me Lord sanctify me and if your body could hear your soul you talking about getting into an argument they'd go back and believe you please shut up your ass can God to turn up the temperature and I'm about to die this heat is absolutely killing me exactly the idea exactly the idea that God wants to do so the process our process you say when will this ever end I'll tell you when it ends this process will end when we meet Jesus face to face now think of this every one of us are going to see him you're either going to be ready or not ready it's up to you but the process for the bride will end when we meet him face to face and he will be able to look directly in our face for the first time without a veil or a covering of the blood and when he looks in our face we will be so much like him he will be able to see himself in US it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him is that right is that what the word says for we shall see him as he is I don't want to add to what John said but there's also another side to that and he will see us as we is that's exactly right we're going to see him as he is and he's going to see us as he has processed us to be through all these things of life oh you know in one way I'm so glad that God hasn't made it to where that it didn't require a real difficult type of process I'm glad that he's made it this way because it truly separates those that really want to go from those that really don't want to go so you see purification may sound harsh and the process may seem very difficult he said well brother Donnie how long does this take depends on you it depends on how much junk you got in you it depends on how much trash how much Fool's Gold how much dirt how much Humanity well thank you Jesus it all depends on you and I and how quick we will allow God to take it out of our lives so without this process we will be left with our impurities we will be left you see this is why that they cannot make out that number that goes through the tribulation period now if these people are actually under the blood how in the world could they ever go into a tribulation period for purification but they think they're under the blood but in reality they are not they refuse the process to be cleansed ready for the Rapture now we know that's being saved and the Rapture is not the same thing she'll be gets saved by accepting him as our savior but in order to go on the body change we've got to be called out separated called out away from the world and this process is part of it and many people simply do not want it they don't not want to be told they have to separate from the world well you can't do this and you can't do that no more and you can't I ain't no purchase are telling me what to do bless God it ain't the preacher telling you no way it's the preacher only repeating the requirement for the Rapture I thought you wanted to go so you see the process takes out all of these impurities and the dross that's inside of us so you know God may allow them a a relationship a friend of yours or or a brother even in the flesh or a sister in the flesh and struggles May raise up and what will it do it will try you in a way that you've never been tried before and then if you've got the least bit of bitterness or an unforgiving Spirit down inside mixed with your gold and now of course every one of us are totally convinced that we are 14 karat through and through from the toenail to the top of our last little head right up on our head we are all 14 karat gold there's no question about that right I'm talking about our character our makeup by even our family is 14 karat that's why some of you think your kids are a bunch of angels around here and you don't even correct them well praise the Lord Brother Donnie you don't pass the new birth on to your kids well they don't pass a new birth on our kids by having Sunday school class or by preaching is that right they've got to get it theirself and they've got to be purified just like you and I are purified but we want to wind up the goals of God he's going to gather his treasures one day you see he's gone there to prepare a great beautiful place now those of you especially you sisters and you're saying you you think about getting engaged or some of you sisters that's already engaged and married and you get your eyes on a new ring and you go say well glory to God my husband's making more money now than he's ever made before and he got me this little ring whenever we got married and I love this little thing I really do but I wouldn't care to have something a little bit bigger say three-quarter or 1.1 or 1.3 or something like that and I wouldn't mind you know having the clarity a little bit better the four C's I wouldn't care to have the color just a little bit brighter mine is a j and I'd rather have something a little bit brighter I'd rather have the clarity a little bit and I'd rather have not any inclusion something but Diamonds the way they chart diamonds you understand that mine is an s i one and I'd rather not have that I'd rather just have you know just no inclusions and all to and I I'm not you know and whenever you go to the jewelry store and you talk to your husband said honey let's go into the mall and let's get one of them pretzels you like them pretzels don't you down there tomorrow oh I like them pretzels well let's go down there and he's just as gullible as he can be poor old Feller he don't realize that the jewelry stores right across the hallway there from the Pretzel store hey you ain't got no pretzels on your mind sister you got that big rock playing inside of that have you ever noticed and them jewelry case us how they've got them all lit up have you ever noticed whenever you walk in there I mean ever Sparkle is there I see some of y'all smiling you've done been there done that ain't you and they've got that thing laid up and as soon as they take it out and you put it on your finger but they also got some behind you but I'll tell you what you do you walk out of there into the mall itself and just get under the regular lights and what you're going to notice is a lot of that sparkle is no longer there now the Sparkle is still there but the light is not hitting it in the right way so myself whenever I bought a few of those things in the past and I go in there if I don't happen to have one in my pocket which I don't carry one around I will ask for a Jeweler's loop I mean that's what that is some of y'all know what it is I won't ask for a Jeweler's loot or whenever you do that always impresses them and say oh this old boy knows what he's talking about so I get a Jeweler's Loop and I put it up on my eye like this and I'll start doing the ring this way or whatever it is I'm looking at but calls us a certain distance that you want to get it from the loop to be able to bring out everything that's in it the fire well you see the the natural eye looks at him there's oh it's got maybe it's got two or three inclusions and the color is a is a g and it looks pretty pretty nice but when you go to pulling that Loop up and you go to looking at that ring this way and you find exactly the distance then you say oh my goodness there's that inclusion how is that well that was formed when God made it in the beginning it's carbon is all it is and it's a little bitty thing that's hidden until you get this little Jeweler's Loop now we love preaching long distance don't we preacher preach on me tell me tell me how good I am some of y'all rather I'd be plumbed back younger with you you'd rather I'd be way back maybe he'd rather I was out on the parking lot and preach to you but the Lord by the Holy Ghost will have a man of God anointed by the spirit of God and he's got a Jeweler's Loop and another and then another Lord have Mercy's got a pair of binocular it looks like and say Lord how'd that man know what we was talking about this morning at The Breakfast Table he didn't but the master does so what does it do it brings out our flaws it brings out our carbon our humanity and then God does it not to shame us God does that not to humiliate us God does that to bring it out so we can see what's there and then we can say okay I understand Lord while the temperature's been going up has the temperature been going up on any on your trials and your test of Life I'll tell you one thing it seems like every way you look and everybody you talk to has gone through something is that right and it seemed like the closer we get to the end of the way the more it is it must be going home time it must be going home time and he's cranking and cranking and cranking in order to let all the impurities to be able to boil to the top oh my goodness well I know we ain't going to be standing in line today to see who can be able to be cranked up first but I do want to be in line I don't want God to have to Baby me I don't want God to have to treat me like I'm a little old pansy sort of a fellow well I can't let Donnie go through much poor little Feller he's so weak you know he'll just get all broke down and everything that ain't what I want my reputation to be I'm not the first one today look and be thrown in the fire guarantee you that but if God in his wisdom allows me to go there I'm going to act like a prince I'm going to roar like a lion and I'm going to fight like a king oh man you see God wants us to be able to have peace in the time of such trials when they're going on so God is refining and removing the dross in our lives so we can be vassals for his glory now listen what the prophet said I was standing here not long ago by a big smelter and I noticed how hot that fire was and it just cooked and cooked and cooked now you can tell this is not smells or language what he's talking about but this is the best way he knew to describe it so we're standing there looking at that smelter and and it was just boiling apparently some bubbling and stuff coming out of it like that it cooked and cooked and cooked as a hotter it got and the dross and the metals and the gold he said to come to the top and they skimmed it off and that heat the fire a little hotter in this smelter and then they would make it boil more now a lot of us boil as a matter of fact some of us boil over but it's the kind that don't do us no good we get all anger and all upset and bowl over and lose our temper and then you got to go back and repent for something that you said you shouldn't have said preach brother Donnie but this ain't the kind of boiling that God does when God boils you he does a good job that's right that heat the fire a little hotter in the smelter and then it would boil more and that gets some more different stuff pyrite stuff out of it the first come up was the dirt like dirt and mud the necks come up and say oh I don't know something some quick notice what he calls this some quick silver quick silver that's what a lot of folks want man and they want to get saved tonight they want to preach tomorrow they're ready to pasture Church in three weeks they're ready to go on a singing to her Evangelistic touring missionary tour in about a month they want Quicksilver that only worked for Tom Toad and The Lone Ranger it won't work for you as a child of God God wants rid of quicksilver God wants rid of dirt oh my they come up and skim that off what it went right on down and the last thing they took out of it was pyrite that's Fool's Gold you know there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another ah now we're coming to Fool's goal there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another when you're a Christian or acting like it anyhow but you let that Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and it takes all the fool's gold out of you you see there's no room for foolish virgin gold and the bride I don't want no Fool's Gold any y'all ever seen pyrite so many of you have so your wives you know what it is and yet there's been many a person that thought they struck it rich when they were digging in the hills of Arizona or Nevada or Utah or California or even in Alaska and they thought they had hit the mother lode but what they got was absolutely worthless notice he said you let the Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and takes all the fools gold out of you fools go many people go out west and they find some of it and they think they struck a gold mine it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's goal hasn't got no value to it look for him this is where a Leo to see is hidden laodicea is full of Fool's Gold and they look at their lives and they look at their churches and they look at their jobs and this and that and the other God blesses us don't boy that means he approves of us no it does no such a thing it does no such a thing the children of Israel they have been judged by God and said you'll not go into the land yet they never had to provide their food they never had to buy another pair of shoes never had to buy another change of clothes God blessed them so much and there was already pronounced they was lost don't judge blessings and say well that's God's approval here's God's approval of you God tries you and tests you oh God gives me a new car every now and then God does this God does that well he gives the Sinners their breasts he gives infidels they woke up today and say there is no God and God gave them the Breath of Life God gave them the right mind God gave them food to eat though they never thank him but the whole earth is living under the blessing of God is that right I don't want just His blessings I want this oh my notice dear Jesus it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's Gold hasn't gotten no value to it and now they cook that and they skim it all off and they just keep cooking and cooking it until it's pure gold boil down to nothing but 100 goal and that's the way God does in his church he pours the holy spirit in it and Cooks down here we go Church how many is ready for a cookout y'all invited to Word of Life Church every service we plan on having a cut down well you're serving brother Donnie elk bison you you're what's on the Fire and I'm on the fire with you oh my goodness well praise the lord well that's a sure way to build up her church right we will gain all kinds of people yeah you got to be kidding me people don't want to be cut down notice he says oh Lord till it throws all the worldliness and the differences and selfishness till it just boils it out of every individual that will come to him look at this on the latest in church but there is a gold of God First Peter 1 7 but there is this goal watch this goal now that he's going to parallel it to the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a christ-like character so the gold of God is not working signs the gold of God is Not performing Miracles we believe in that our God is moving Among Us brother Daryl and I have met with the youth here uh the other night on Thursday night David was able to stream the service while they were streaming the service somebody got healed somebody else got healed just by hearing testimonies of healing I love it don't you but that within itself will not get us through the gate if we don't have this kind of goal but never fear the bride will have this God the gold of God is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of flexion you see genuine faith is not just a value to you and I in this life but one day you will trade it for a Visage likened to the Son of God himself notice this Peter says it again and I'll repeat in reading it to you that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory so the trying of your face transfers and changes you and allows you to stand before the Lord Jesus when he comes at his appearing and you won't run you won't be afraid you won't be scared unlike his appearing that when you and I come back with him at the end of the Thousand Years and they will run and scream and holler for the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them but you and I will not run and scream why because we've done been cooked and re-cooked and re-cooked and boiled oh my until the dross of our Humanity our failures our our insignificant vanity that we all have so much of has been cooked to the very top and God allowed the skimmers to come and skim it off and when we stand there we will be a hundred percent pure gold deity deity whom having not seen you love and whom though you have not seen him yet believe him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith notice this is when Faith Comes to its end when you receive the end of your face even the salvation of your souls notice the prophet he said so he told Abraham he's going to try him and give him trials and every Christian has to be tried Peter said thinking not strange beloved one fiery Trials come upon you for it's only done to prove your face that's more precious to you than gold now we realize people can say oh I believe God why sure I believe every word in that Bible until they're Tried by it how many people around our message have said that absolutely I believe I have a word of that until you preach something they didn't know he said or it don't apply to their situation then they don't believe it no more it's amazing how many preachers I'm finding friends it would shock you it would shock you how many preachers that I'm dealing with around the message that you sent them quote after quote after quote after quote I have to quote I have to quote scripture after scripture at the scripture I description and they won't even acknowledge them and say the word is right and I am wrong that's where we are I'm telling you you better get the good stuff you better get the good gold we don't want pyrite we don't want to stand in front of the light and Sparkle and turn around and act like but if it's not real gold it is worthless amen oh but I can sing I can jump I can preach that's good that's wonderful I'm glad you can but I want something inside of you that'll keep you that you'll look at this word remember the Holy Ghost will never lead you or I contrary to his word and if you or I do something wrong and a man of God shows us the word then the Holy Ghost in you or I will make us admit that word is right I did wrong I'm sorry I apologize and if what you've got don't make you do that you ain't got the Holy Ghost oh my listen to this look when you're sick sometime how is it that the righteous suffer wish we had a night to preach on it that how God does it for his own Glory and turns right back around and heals that I don't know if you caught the words in that verse brother Joe Harris sent me that song the other day that Harry and another Caleb just sung and our sanitary because I thought it's a beautiful song but I don't know if you caught the words just hearing at one time but it says if my story is For Your Glory if my story is For Your Glory and somehow it will please you for me to be broken then Lord that's what I want to be how many believe your story is for His glory well your story will contain all types of things ups and downs and ins and outs and you've got draws in you today no doubt your pastor still has dross in him no doubt every preacher sitting here today every Deacon every good sincere saint of God we still have dross but the difference between us and others is we say God get it out of me Lord get it out of me whatever he got to do God if I have to go through the fire and you got to crank her up get it out of me if you've got to keep cranking it up after that and you give me a little bit of a rest and you throw me back in so be it Lord let me be a strong servant of God let me be one that can be a soldier that will stand before the people of God in this last day the children of God don't need to see weak leaders they don't need to see weaklings in the Pulpit ready to quit and ready to give up I'll tell you the kind of man they need to see holy ghost film men that will still preach the word without compromise and say brother sister we can face it no matter what you're going through today I'm here to tell you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world darkness is under your feet cancer is under your fear cigarettes can be put under your feet alcohol can be put under your fear you are more than conquerors foreign that's how God does it for his own Glory turns it right back around and heals that and starts a testimony so God will allow something to come your way and it seems awful it seems so terrible and God will turn right around and heal you and bring the testimony out of that that can affect hundreds of people to God notice God takes his holy spirit takes the Christian the church and beats it with the gospel so let me tell you this today if you're a visitor you go to a church where they're not beating you you better change my brother don't I go I've been for years and years they don't never whoop me you're sitting under a false prophet no one hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth a preacher that ain't beating you don't love you the only beings in this building today that don't need to be beat are the babies that don't don't understand yet and the angels of God that are here all the rest of us need to Target out of us so notice it beats it with the gospel back and forth back and forth until it reflects Jesus and the Holy Spirit can see the works of Jesus going on in the church then things begin to go fine but there's too much Dross in the church today can anybody say Amen Lord I've got too much Dross too much Jaws in the church today too much now we're fine people we're the best in the world we're the cream of the crop but the church needs to make herself ready get ready let me knows it we need to make ourselves ready again how can overcome he that cometh to God must first be tested that only shows a true child then say he's tested when the test comes on you listen you can't overcome unless there's a test give to you wow how many wants a great testimony let's break down the word testimony t e s t i m o n y test I'm only and groanie and complaining oh that's that's what you all do too I say we want a great testimony do we know it do we want a testimony that we come out of this world Lord by your grace and we walk into heaven and them saints are saying where'd you come from I lived in the latest said they say Lord have mercy you mean you lived in that that worse there the worst day it's the worst day that ever human beings ever lived on the earth you live during that time frame I sure did how did you do it brother sister how did you do it by the grace of God oh Mom when we walk in there we don't want no T-shirt we don't want no T-shirt I survive Leo to see it we want to walk in our Overcomers do we not we want to walk in with a testimony by his grace we overcome the worst age that human beings ever lived on the earth we lived in the day can you imagine if some of our forefathers would have heard about television and Internet and pornography and all that stuff on a smartphone where all of that sin would be accessible just at the push of a button can you imagine some of our forefathers said Lord don't let me live in that age I wouldn't want to live in that age but God's got some young people God's got some young men some young women come on somebody preach with me God's got some people on the face of the Earth today are living in the middle of Hell itself there's Darkness all around us friends there's chaos everywhere we are not living in a paradise we are living in the middle of hell but by the grace of God we will overcome every devil the people of God will overcome every evil you young people can overcome you middle-aged people you can overcome us older people we can overcome not only can we shall how cook cook and more cook but brother Donnie I've been cooked my whole life I understand I was 12 when I got saved and I'm 67. you figure the mass I've been cooked my whole Christian Life especially since I come to the message and I'm enjoying it more than I've ever enjoyed it before praise God you know what it gets sweeter I'm getting closer the days are getting closer everyone will be look after there's no hope for this world the No Redemption for this world only the coming of the Lord Jesus where would we be was it not for him was our only hope what can they offer you what can they produce to you that will help you lay down at night and have peace nothing listen this and of course when the test is given it's given to see whether you can overcome or not Jesus said to him that overcometh the test everybody look this way please I want you to see one of the greatest things next to Salvation that is given to any of us the test is the greatest thing that has that ever happened to you can anybody say Amen yet or do you need to grow into that a little bit it don't seem like it does it it don't seem like it you say so because we don't understand how to make good gold we don't understand the process but God understands the process of making 100 percent called so he says I'm going to give Larry one of the best things I could get that boy can play at piano he can tickle them ivories I'm telling you what you don't have to even look at him he he cannot even hear a song before and go down there and play that thing I give him a great talent when I bless him be able to do that but I'm going to give him the greatest thing I could give him for than salvation I'm going to test him I'm going to let him have issues with his heart I'm gonna let the doctors even tell him I didn't hear him you're you're pretty close to dying you realize you could die when he had his episode here not long ago and they said you you could have died no he couldn't God wasn't done with him yet praise the Lord so what did God do that God gave him the test and God let him come on the other side of the test and then God turned the test into a testimony but he wouldn't had that testimony today could you see him sit there and raise his hand and give praise to God he would not have that testimony if the test had not come first don't lose strength Church don't lose your faith in the middle of the test know that God's given it to you so he can have honor and Glory out of your life your story is written for his glory your story has been lived out in this day for the glory of God it's not for us our story is not about us how people can read about our life and think boy they done this or that or the other no it ain't about that our story is written for his glory oh my let my story and your story be written for the glory and mercy of God the sand let me finish this quote Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us listen now when we're tested you see people that aren't being tried and tested there's something wrong our church never has no trouble well we're so happy God bless you enjoy it while you can because if you're a Church of the Living God it won't stay that way I don't care who your pastor is Jesus was the pastor of the 12 disciples he had the office church ever was they had troubles that arguing they had fuss and they had fight it's just goes with having churches and God is going to allow your church to be tested if it's a true church now if it's not if it's a shock church if it's just that type of church he don't even worry about it but if it's a True Church of the Living God he's going to let it be tested it's one good evidence to see that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God or tested and tried let me read the scripture to you and Peter beloved beloved think it not strange concerning what fiery not ashy not ashy fiery look at the meaning of the word a burning the burning by which meddles what a strange meaning of the word are roasted roasted and reduced by a figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire calamities or trials that test praise God praise God I want to be true you only true call me true do we want to be true because we know he and his wisdom will never allow more to come upon us the one he gives us strength to bear it maybe you find yourself there today and I know some of you do because I'm your pastor so I know some of the things that you're going through got a text Carol did yesterday from one of the families in our church and they're dealing with this certain issue and another issue with her son another issue with health and another issue with this and that so sent him a quote that's one of my favorites when I'm going through things it's from invisible Union the prophet said with the law of contrast he talks about how that we go through times in our life and it's seemed like it's a daytime then he said it'll switch on you and it'll be a night time and he said like we say it down south when it rains it pours how many said them days like that and you just say Lord I I can't take another day I don't know what to do Lord what in the world what is going on but remember Noah when it seemed like it couldn't go a day further put a rainbow in the cloud I don't mind telling you it makes me mad I'm so mad right now I could buy the Snicker bar right in the half that's how mad it makes me that the devil and his crowd stole our rainbow side huh and it we're that we're ashamed even refer to the rainbow we're afraid to even have one anywhere because we'll think people will think we're like them and the devil hijacked it he done the same thing to shouting he'd done the same thing about dancing the devil never started dancing the devil never started dancing God told Joe where was you when the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy the prophet said this up for a dancing in heaven before the foundation of the world dancing didn't start with the devil it started with God well come on somebody worshiping and loving and adoring that didn't start for the devil that's the way they do it concerts you probably read it the other day on your smartphone or your newspaper or whatever a Taylor Swift concert was being held out west they got so loud the people now the people got so loud and clapping their hands and screaming and hollering at her concert they caused an earthquake it showed up on the seismograph an earthquake well the devil ain't the originator of that Paul and Silas were Glory we ought not to get in our mind well these people I hear dance we came I'll tell you one thing well I danced out there in the world we'll get saved filled with the Holy Ghost change Partners keep right on Dancing keep right on dancing but you dance to different music now brother sister if anybody ought to have the joy of the Lord it ought to be the people of God it's just about going home time our troubles are almost over our burdens are almost passive oh Hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready the sparrow heads [Music] Heavenly Father you're the only one today who can look down on every individual heart see how much draws how much dirt how much pyrite is still mixed in with the gold may they not leave here today with the wrong picture in their mind it's not like you're trying our flesh and trying to get all the flesh out of our flesh there ain't no hope for our flesh it ain't redeemed it ain't saved it ain't never had the Holy Ghost not one day there's only one hope for our flesh and that is to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye or if we go by the way of the Grave we will raise up with a brand new flesh body what you're trying to separate from is the gold which is our character it's the way we treat people the way we treat your word the way we deal with one another that's our character it's our character I remember when I first come here years ago and I've been here for a couple years and the Lord you remember you placed it on my heart to preach character I don't think I'll ever forget it as long as I live brother Bill Hudson I thought I'd preach that and I was sitting with him and brother Calvin Brother JD some of the brothers he said brother Donnie I don't think I've ever heard that like that before that character as he called it that character of God every time after that if I get to be around him very long he'd bring that up again Lord we know it's an important thing so what you want to do is heat up in order to get flaws out of our character so if people treat us bad then how do we treat them if they're not nice to us how do we treat them back when the word is put to us and we show that we have been behaving wrong or believing wrong will we correct and say God forgive me I'm sorry I didn't know the word said that that's our character or will we just say well I feel that anyway which we know is the direction a lot of people go in this day you can show them what the prophet said show them what the scripture said well I feel led to go this way oh the dross in such a character Lord would you search each of us today and we're not trying to take a pitch for today Lord and say boy I wish so and so had been there today they sure needed to hear that I always so and so was there but Lord God we want to open our hearts and say Lord I was here I heard what was preached father I preached it and I'm opening my heart I want you to look at me Jesus I want you to look at me and see if there's anything in me that displeases you I don't care what it is I've been serving you most of my life preaching most of my life I don't want to miss it Lord I don't want to labor in vain till God look at me today search me help me father if there's any draws any power right any dirt not in my Humanity but in my character oh Jesus cleanse me cleanse me anybody here with me today you want God to do the same thing for you just raise your hand and open your heart to him now Lord help me maybe it's the way you treat your wife maybe it's the way it treats your husband maybe it's the way you treat your neighbor live behind beside you around you in your subdivision and a little loud or whatever mourn boy you just have a real attitude toward them each of us know we know what our weaknesses are our faults don't jump out of the pot friends don't jump out of the kettle when God cranks it up but just say God give me more grace share the other words to this verse of this song God instead of giving healing you gave her it Grace so the author of the song was referring to Saint Paul of course when Paul asks for healing but God didn't give him healing but he said my grace is sufficient so sometimes you ask God for healing and God gives healing other times you ask God for healing and God gives Grace at least for a month or two or six months Maybe and then the healing will come after a while but aren't you glad that he knows exactly what we need and if he's got a prolonged reason for where you are don't lose your face he's testing you he's done testified no doubt to the devil about you you and God's been fellowshipping God's got confidence in you praise the Lord help me Lord that all not falter or fail Lord Jesus help me father Lord God In The Name of Jesus would you move across this building today help each of us Lord May the gold of God be so purified in our lives whatever's lacking in me Lord whatever's lacking in these people some of the Home Folks some visitors Lord would you deal with us help us oh Lord when the temperature increases increases and it becomes hot and we become weary help us not to lose faith oh Grant it Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus May our character please your father hallelujah hallelujah we worship you today Lord God would you just lift your hands with me and just open your heart to him just let him search him praise the Lord praise the Lord we bless your name Lord God we worship you Jesus we don't want to be drunk on the things of the world father sometimes you might let a little financial crisis strike us so it will force materialism to the top of the pot so we can see I didn't realize how much I loved this world and it's things until I got that crunch maybe you'll let something really hit us maybe a cancer maybe a terrible sickness a disease that the doctor sets incurable and once it strikes us fear begins to come to the top of the pot we didn't even realize that fear was there until the doctor gave us that report and then all of a sudden we got afraid you allowed that test to come so it would force the Fear To The Top so you could Deliver Us from the fear oh we love you Lord I mean once after that look at me would you for today brother look at me you want that with all your heart let me tell you what faith for an individual can do also if you know as far as Erica's situation the doctors say they've got maybe one more thing they can try on her as far as they think she's in the last stages no hope this that the other but she told her mama this the other day she said Mama she said I I worry about myself sometimes she said why honey she said I worry because I'm not afraid and I wonder should I worry more because I ain't worried glory to God that's faith brother that's Faith sister so it does so something like with you brother there's something so to you and so changes you and makes you different why aren't we terrified do you understand that Russia has moved nuclear bombs to Belarus do you understand that Russia sent out four of their super bombers su-35s on Friday night the size equivalent to our B-52s which only carry nuclear warheads do you realize we sent one of our nuclear class submarines to South Korea look at Iran look at Israel Hezbollah fixing to attack from the north I like looking at Israel I got the Jerusalem Post app and I look at it every day about because what I see of Israel is they're like us so Israel has Egypt to the bottom they got Jordan over here they got Iraq over here they got Lebanon up here they got the Mediterranean over there they're totally surrounded totally completely surrounded and their estate about the size of New Jersey but do you believe that Israel will be destroyed you don't and why don't you believe that because God's word said it won't but if you've got that much faith for Israel you ought to have that much and more for yourself if God will not allow Israel to be destroyed what about his bride no matter what Satan does he cannot take you under God's purpose is finished Hallelujah what was you playing there singing let's just worship him a little bit can we I hate to take care of this service straight into the kettle so let's just get a little bit of worship in our hearts if you're there today don't be discouraged he loves you he loves you brother Eddie he loves you buddy God knows what you're going through brother Josh he knows what you're going through Lance Michael yes I forgot maybe just some more drugs Hallelujah Hallelujah let's just worship just a little bit changed my heart oh God [Music] let's make it a praise thank you Lord may I be like you oh yes Lord change my heart oh God [Music] change my heart oh God granted Lord God as mothers are more than anything else in the world Hallelujah you are the

be to be at these meetings to be here with you amen and I'm so grateful you know we've have all the the the work that's went into services like these the the the musicians the sound tech the parking crew even parts that are unseen I know it from running Services you have so many moving parts and so I just want to say thank you Amen to all the people that made this meeting possible and I'm so glad that you're here so glad I'm here but most of importantly I'm so glad the Lord Jesus is here amen the Bible says he inhabits you say how do you know brother math that he's here cuz I brought him with me amen he inhabits the Praises of his people and I just want to worship Him how many want to just Worship the Lord amen in spirit and in truth we just want to say Lord have your way amen from the beginning to the end from the front to the back lord I don't want to restrict you any way I just want the Holy Spirit to move freely you believe the Lord H is my mindful of you in your need amen I'm I I'm so aware of that even the the the the holy spirit that is just the the presence of the Lord you feel here the presence of the Lord I felt even before I arrived and I just believe the Lord has something special there's something so special about special meetings and it ain't because of who's there ain't because of who's preaching as good preachers but you know what makes a special meeting special one thing expectation and when you get a lot of Believers in the same room and you have faith and the word of the message of the hour is preached let me tell you friends nothing is impossible nothing's too hard for the Lord put all those licks of fire put them in one big old room amen and everybody pulling on the word of God when Jesus is on the scene nothing is too hard there's no case too hard for him so you just put your faith and confidence in him tonight I believe that he'll speak something special for you amen if you have your Bible let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 2 2 Kings chapter 2 amen I just love the presence of the Lord I realize when I'm in that kind of presence you know this is what I was this is where I was made to be amen I don't fit in out there in the world this is right where I fit in prophet of God said you know you get to church sometimes and you get in the atmosphere and he said you know sometimes you want to cry sometimes you want to shout other times you just want to be quiet he said and he you don't really know what's happening prophet of God said I tell you what's happening you're bumping into another dimension and I say Lord I want to bump into that Dimension tonight let Angels let me bump into an angel a minister in spirit tonight amen we can move from this natural into the supernatural amen from this Dimension to a Heavenly Dimension 2 Kings chapter 2 I want to minister to you and I'm going to title this transferring the Baton and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha D here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to bethl and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl verse four says and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho verse 6 says and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on the prophet of God actually says that the cities of bethl and Jericho and Jordan represented the church moving through the Lutheran age the Methodist age through John Wesley and then Pentecost would represent that Jordan River but notice Elisha it was important to go to justification but he couldn't stay there yeah it was important for him to go to sanctification that was an important step but you can't stay there come on somebody you got to stay with the word where the word moves if you want to cross Jordan you got to come through all three and Elisha says I'm not going to leave you Elijah I'm staying right beside you notice what he says here in verse 8 Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoke the waters and were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee what a powerful thing another word sister Hattie whatever you say whatever you say notice brother bham says Jehovah Gyra he says that when hadie said those words not when she thought those words not when she had it in her heart but when she let what was in her heart come out into her mouth you see your words have the power to change your atmosphere you think it's not important for you to say Amen to the word of God when the word's being preached you got fear swirling around you speak the word of God and watch those words disturb the atmosphere in your life oh Hallelujah brother bham says in another place when she spoke those words and says that's nothing but the truth brother bham amen the prophet said it felt like the room was about to come apart the Bible says he says ask what I shall do for thee now notice this here and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked hard thing now notice it wasn't going to be hard for Elijah he was going home it's surely not hard for God then who is the hard thing for brother bham as Janny Henry says the prophet prophecy says uh you didn't choose this you you I didn't force you I didn't choose this for you but it's your choice because you chose a harder way there's a great portion of Heaven that's awaiting for you nevertheless notice this I want you to notice something so powerful here in your Bible that maybe you've never caught before notice when Elijah says to Elijah he gives them the condition of this double portion and it's actually amazing because he says to him if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so do you know when you actually transliterate what Elijah said is he's actually saying Elijah Elisha I'm going to go and when I go you have to see me as taken from you because if you're standing here still waiting for Elijah to come back and you're still focused on Elijah in other words Elisha you got to see Elijah that he's gone home onto his reward but there's still a work to do there's still a commission that's on the job is still incompleted Elisha you've got to Elijah is gone notice what he says here in the next verse verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirl went into heaven Elijah Elisha saw it said my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ripped them into pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokee the water and said not where is Elijah but where is the Lord God of Elijah Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your divine presence Lord Lord greater than the anything Lord Jesus more father important than how well I speak how Lord the thoughts that I have before me the notes I've laid before me but Lord the most important thing is that we touch Jesus I pray that you would just move by your Holy Spirit God lord I consider myself just the least of anyone to be able to speak Lord but I just pray that you'd come and speak a word may you take control of every Spirit here tonight God and may you send a refreshing from the presence of God grant it Lord Jesus we ask in your name we ask it and the church said it amen amen you can be seated tonight thank you brother Elijah is going home and this is some of the last words God's about to take him I fully believe with all my heart that Elijah knows what's about to take place Elijah is going home and the mantle is about to be passed the Baton is going to be transferred to the Next Generation and notice here that there was a great burden upon Elijah's heart you know the burden that comes upon every generation to the success or the pre preceding generation as they know that they have to transfer the right things to the Next Generation and so he has the burden of moving or transferring this burden to Elisha you're reading some of the last words some of the last things as Elijah's going home God has already told him that as Ministry and that that phase of that Ministry is coming to a to an end and he's going to go home by a whirlwind I fully believe that the prophet of God knew that the Lord was about to take him home that's my own opinion I believe that you could see that in some of the later messages that brother Bron preaches as that God even I believe it dawned on him what was about to take place as he says things and what house will you build me and you come to the last later messages that he preaches and he he says I'm so glad for men like your pastor your young Pastor here who will take these truths and and will sweep it on to the coming of the Lord he he listen friends let me just go ahead and say this now that it was never brother bram's desire to bottle up all of the gifts of God and all of the power of God in his own Ministry but in fact it was his desire to transfer and to move that same Supernatural expectation not just in one many but one member but throughout the entire body there would be gifts and Ministries that would operate and so he comes down to some of the last things these are some of the last things that he's going to say he knows the commission as some of the last words and he takes him very specifically to the these three cities and you're reading what you're reading when you're reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2 is some of the last things he would say these are some of the last moments before he goes home to his reward at some of the last burdens you know you can read the last words of powerful men you can go and read and get books about the last words of Abraham Lincoln and and different men that have lived through time you could read the last words actually in your Bible of David as David begins to bring Solomon into the room and and he begins to say some of his last intent and some of the burdens I I believe it's a very special moment it's a very critical moment as the prophet of God would call it a junction of time where that there was something that was ending but there was something about to begin you know often times things can't begin until things end in fact sometimes God is waiting to pour something out but until there's the end of something the beginning can't start and so now notice as Elisha this is that moment that critical moment and you're reading some of the last words you can go and read the last words of Jacob as he tells them don't leave my bones here and Joseph comes to his end of his life and he's repeating the same words that Jacob mentions and says don't leave my bones here and Egypt these were some of the last desires some of the last moments some of the things that were the most dear to his heart and I believe it's it's so powerful because Elijah felt the burden of this he feels the weight of this moment he knows he can't transfer the wrong things and he knows as in any race when the runner is finishing his course there's no danger of dropping The Paton while the runner is running but the danger comes at the transfer you see more can go wrong at that moment of that transfer of that baton it's not the danger when he's running but when the hand reaches out to take the Baton it's got to be a strong hand of Faith it's got to have a confidence not a it's got to have the right expectation it's got to have the same Faith the same trust the same ver ver fervor the same passion listen friends we're not going to pick up the race the prophet left going slower or or falling behind or or retreating and going the other way and we need to be more intense about the things of God more passionate this isn't a time to go backwards it's a time to go forward in [Applause] Jesus Elisha Elijah knows the moment the critical Junction of this next generation and Elisha prays and Elijah says ask ask me what do you want Elisha and he says that I would take a double portion of your spirit would come upon me now Elisha you know no doubt he's all struck you could imagine he's just all struck by the ministry of this man he knew there was something very special about this Elijah anointing in fact it was so special that Elisha wasn't going to leave him and there was the school of the prophets but notice where Elisha was standing listen friends there was a lot of other Ministries but there was only one Elijah to this generation let me just say it this way there's only one message there's only one message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers thankful for Godly Ministry thankful for God gifts that God uh places into the body but there's one Elijah but let me say there's one people who can receive that Elijah message and I'm so glad that I'm one of them I'm so glad I'm identified by that Elijah anointing and so Elisha says there's something you could imagine he's enamored by this the ministry the Miracles the signs the Wonders the great gifts the great things that he did through that prophet and you can imagine the in insufficiency the inade inadequacy that Elisha could feel about the man to the Baton being passed to him let me just say something here Elisha was not going to be El like part two well Elijah was not just going to replace Elijah Elisha was not going to replace Elijah in the sense that he was just going to do the same things or the same Miracles or hold the same uh you know kind of things listen friends there was one Ministry that fa that came in this generation that was an Elijah and we're not to try to repeat or try to manufacture something you got to realize Elisha you've got challenges that you've got to face and let me say that the the challenge that Elisha faced was very different than Elijah's in fact these three cities that he takes him to bethl Jericho and Jordan at the time of Elijah's Ministry were but bursting with Revival Jericho we know the supernatural Miracles that took place in the city of Jericho with Rahab the Harlot and salmon and the journey of Joshua it was a great Revival it was a great a city of great Revival bethl was the place where Jacob lays down and he sees a vision of a of a ladder going from Heaven to Earth and and he wakes up from that dream and he says surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not and he names the name of that stone bethl the house of God it was a was a place Jordan where Joshua crosses Jericho AC crosses the Jordan and takes those memorial stones and and memorializes what God didn't notice I want you to notice that these cities that Elijah took Elisha to were not just random but but they were all Supernatural cities notice he's wanting to pass down the right thing he's wanting to pass down the right expectation he's wanting to make sure that Elisha I trusted in Jehovah and you can too he never failed me and he'll never fail you Elijah oh he's always faithful Elijah could say to Elisha the same God that that moved in my uh in my Ministry is going to move in your ministry Elish bethl Jordan and Jericho cities of Revival but oh how different are those cities from the beginning of Elijah's Ministry to the end of his ministry now those same cities that were in Revival now at the end of his ministry now there's young people who are mocking the prophet very different it was in brother brenham's Ministry from the beginning of his ministry till when he came to his I'll say it this way his real Ministry and at first everybody wants him at his church at first everybody's inviting him come preach our meetings come over and preach in my tent I'll hold a Revival and everybody all the doors are open and everybody listen friends Miracles will attract anybody that's right Miracles will attract anybody it'll attract uh uh Christians it'll attract non-christians it'll trct Hollywood everybody loves a miracle but the word brings the [Applause] difference and notice here these were great miraculous cities but now when he comes to his true Ministry now he comes to Tucson and he says I I never wanted to start a church here I I sat here for three years and you never invited me to your church I sat in the de I never wanted to have a church here I just wanted you know be part of your your your your meetings and brother Brandon was always about that but that the doors had closed you never invited me you you never you never you never brought I made an invitation what was it now at the end of his ministry when he comes into his true Ministry now the doors are closing nobody wanting didn't it happen the same way in the ministry of Jesus happened in the same Ministry of Jesus and he says that you know that unless you eat the Flesh and the son of man drink his blood you no part with him and even the disciples said this the the the the the the the multitude said this is a hard saying who can bear it listen friends let me just say this with you without the baptism of the Holy Ghost this message is a hard message without the true nature change by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the message is just dos and don'ts and what you can do what you can wear what you can't wear where you can go where you cannot go it's a hard thing oh but when you have the spirit of the message in your heart it's the passion of your life it's victory it's not defeat it's Freedom it's not changed Hallelujah and he says this is a hearted who can bear it disciples my Jesus looks at the disciples after that they had left and says what where you what are you doing here will you go also no Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life let me say it this way you alone have the words that make my life make sense you alone have the word that makes this entire world make sense and I've searched for it out there and I'm not found it you're the only one that makes my life worth living Lord this message is the only thing that makes the world make sense it makes economies make sense it makes sorrow make sense Elisha you got to Terry Elijah says just stay here you know Elijah Elisha you know just stay just stay you know make it you'd make a good pastor you know plan a plan a you know build a home here and put your family here Elijah you know you know this is where you could just stay right here he was testing him and Elisha says as my as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not believe you Elijah there may be a lot of people getting up and walking out there may be a lot of people walking away there may be a lot of people that might find something out there but I want you to know I'm staying right beside the Elijah Ministry listen friends this ain't a time to walk away it's a time to preach it like never before the rest of the world might go but I say to whom would I go Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life there may be a lot of people walking away but I'm not going to walk away there may be a lot of people ashamed of it but I'm not ashamed of it as Paul said I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of Salvation listen friends let me just preach to you for a can I preach here for a moment this ain't the time to try to padic cake around people's feelings and try to modernize the message of the hour this ain't a Time time to try to doctor it up and paint it up and make it more palpable and make it more acceptable socially I say preach the word of God declare the word of God say it like a prophet said it and I believe there's a generation who says give me the message give me the word of God just the way the prophet said it you don't need to doctor it you don't need to dress it up Hallelujah Glory these cities were on fire now from the beginning now to the end down to the end of his ministry and doors are closing now Elisha knew there's something very special there's something very unique about this ministry it's like nothing else I have ever ever seen it's a ministry that's unparalleled it's a Ministry that has no [Music] match you know I think it's so incredible to me how people want to come 30 40 years later and start questioning the ministry of God's Prophet people want to come years later after he's gone and begin to bring up questions well I have this doubt over here and I have this question over here about this and and you know want to say this about this you know it's so amazing because let me tell you let me just read you Lord I'm going to do it let me read you some of what some of the witnesses of that Ministry said Gordon Lindsay said never had we known any preacher calling deaf mutes and blind people to pray for and then to see those people delivered on the spot a Ministry that was beyond any that we had ever before witness James Morris said it was brandom more than any other evangelist who started the postor War 2 fundamentalist hilling Revival falling the counter with an angel on May 7th 1946 word radiated in every direction that all manner of disease and afflictions were healed instantly by the little Indiana preacher even cases of raising the dead were published TL osbor says God has chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants especially those called for dispensational purposes and was branham's call in short the man we know is William brandham was sent to demonstrate God in flesh again FF Bosworth said when the gift is operating brother bam is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Ghost into spiritual realities of any person I have ever known Morris cell says God called this humble man and anointed his ministry with a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle out station wherever you would go in the world you would find the name of this messenger has preceded your arrival The Voice Gospel of the voice of healing gospel magazine says in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all those sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William brandom a prophet and seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of the issue of this issue of full go El men's uh Full Gospel men's voice brandom listen to this has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead but it's funny how people want to come later you know it sort of be like me saying about Mike Tyson you know brother Donnie brother Mike you know Mike Mike Tyson was nothing I could have took Mike I mean I know you got you know I I know y'all talk about how great he was and you know the take TKO and the punch that he that he that he had and how you know how fast his jab was but you know what I I'll be honest here I don't know that I believe all the hype and the hoopla over that all those you know everybody you know I think I could have took you know you know what the problem is is that we have I won't call them uh opponents I'll call them victims we have the victims of Mike Tyson and I guarantee you put one of those victims up here behind this pull pit and they would shut up the mouth of any dummy that wanted to say Mike Tyson's punch was it all that well I got news for the devil why don't you put all these people who want to question the ministry of William Bram I promise you put the victim of cancer and give him a mic put the put the demon of blindness and deafness and give him a mic and I'll tell you what he testify of the same God and Jesus that with me is the same God in the ministry of that Prophet Hallelujah and I'm here to say he's the same God tonight he's that the same power tonight Hallelujah Glory notice this was the ministry he knew there was nothing else quite like it yes sir and so Elisha you can imagine is enamored by the ministry of this man he comes back to these last moments and he's reading some of the last words and he knows the anointing of the supernatural must be passed down he can't pass down the wrong things he can't pass down the wrong type of Faith the wrong expectation but it's got to be the right expectation the right burden the right things he feels the weight of this moment and he knows he's got a said his hope listen friends it was the very same thing the Apostle Paul said when he talked to the Galatians and he says oh fullest Galatians who hath Bewitched you having begun notice having begun in the spirit in other words how did this revival start with the supernatural how did this revival start with the spirit of God listen friends you take the spirit of God out of this message [Applause] if we if we just deduce this thing to good Theology and good doctrines and good stories I'm thankful for all of that I tell you what a prophet said he said you take God out of Israel and they were like any other Nation you take Samson's anointing out of his life and cut his hair he was just any other boy and he said in the church when you take the leading of the Holy Ghost the church is just the the the world with the name of God attached to it but it's the spirit that makes the difference I say more than ever before we need the spirit to make the difference having begun in the spirit are you now Glory are are you now perfected by the Flesh in other words do you think that this changing of your body is going to be by some kind of effort on your part you think that after begun in the Supernatural how did Brother Bam's Ministry begin think about it friends it began with an angel sir breaching the gap between the dimension of the the supernatural into the natural and I say to you if it began in the Supernatural it will finish in the Supernatural Elisha you got to trust the same God you got to trust the same God that was with me and Elijah you got to have your miracles on now you can't depend upon Elijah you've got your Goliath that you've got to slay now all right somebody with me he cannot live under the same stories he cannot live under the past reputation or the memories you know how easy it would have been for Elisha just to say stay here Elijah don't leave okay friends I'll be honest and tell you right now if I was there I would I would be begging God to Lord don't take brother brandham don't take him Lord we need him hear God it had been easy for Elisha to look at Elijah that way but Elijah had to Elisha had to recognize he's got his own battles he's got to face he's got his own challenges and they're actually much worse you say brother Matt Elisha is going to need to have the same Faith as Elijah no he's going to need double I said he's going to need that double portion tell you what a prophet of God said he T that taught that double portion was the was the former and the latter rign and let me tell you what Pentecost ofus in 1906 was not it was not the return of Pentecost can I preach to you here for a moment brother bham said it in the church age book he said at the turn of the 20th century men began to cry out for the spirit of God to move and God poured out his Spirit now that was a part of the restoration but I tell you what a prophet said that was not the return of Pentecost because the former Reign had not even came yet what was that former rain brother Matt the message of the hour it was the teach Mora you get what brother rham says it was Mora the teaching rain the former rain The Barley harvest the spring Harvest you ever notice who caught that and brother Ram types that in the Feast of the trumpets the Feast of Passover the Feast of of of 11 bread the feast the first fruits was fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus do you realize that as the Jews were going into the temple to sacrifice the Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on a cross wow and then the week they they go and offer the F the unleavened bread and as they're offering the unleavened bread Jesus is in the Tomb oh Hallelujah and then there's Jews come and they offer the the fruit of the first fruits and as they're offering in their rituals by their Traditions by the denominations they didn't recognize that at the moment they were trying to make a sacrifice the Lamb of God was coming up on Easter morning amen and they kept on going to church as brother bham said they would they'll keep going to church she'll singing songs not realizing the coming of the Lord has already taken place the prophet of God said in the ministry of Jesus he fulfilled all three of those feasts but then you have the feast seven weeks later seven weeks seven sabbaths plus one day there was coming a sound of a rushing might wind in the upper room when all of God's family was gathered there you know what brother brandham said brother Bram says they were all in one place and one mind and one Accord and they started praising the Lord for something that had not even been sent yet oh did you hear me church I said they were praising God for something you mean you can start praising God before your Miracle shows up you can start worshiping God before he ever shows up in your life and brother bam says when they started doing that the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind filled the house the prophet of God says that that Pentecostal week goes all the way to the Rapture through seven weeks seven Church ages but then in that Feast of trumpets it was not the barley Harvest it was the wheat Harvest Hallelujah I don't know where I'm at but I'm somewhere and brother R says what notice what the Bible says it says that was the that was the latter rain it was the Harvest it was the fall Feast you say then brother Matt if ausa was not Pentecost then what do we have did you hear me friends I said if that wasn't Pentecost then I say this must be oh Hallelujah you're not going to get away from it you're not going to get away from Pentecost the brother ROM says that it was the pattern it is the standard there is no other standard there is only one true church and that true church is identified not with 1906 but with ad33 when God poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah but Hosea I think it's chapter 6 I'll be the as to you as the rain the former and the latter rain now notice this here as we go this a little bit further he notice notice he says you've got to have twice the seal twice the passion twice twice it Elijah brother Brandon's standing there and he wakes up from a dream and he says he sees the Jordan River and the voice says you're 2third of the way there representing that second pool and brother bham crosses going to cross the Jordan River he wakes goes to wakes up goes back out and then he sees that vision of that great mamba snake trying to attack that brother and brother's moving back and forth and and brother bham says a voice says you have power to bind him and power to loose him and then you notice I'm not preaching on that here tonight but the voice as brother Bram begins to describe it there The Voice speaks and brother bham says Lord I want to bind him in Jesus name and and and the voice spoke to brother bandam says You must be more sincere you must be more sincere you say brother Matt are we going to need twice the Zeal twice the passion twice listen friends God has no gear of reverse God is not going backwards he has one gear and it's not staying still either it's Onward Christian Soldiers listen friends this isn't the time to go backwards it's not the time for Less can I say it this way it's the time for more of the spirit of God more of Revival more of the love of God in our in our family it's not time for less it's a time for more and notice here is Elijah's ministry as I fully believe with all my heart what you witnessed in God's Prophet was great miraculous I preached on it Great Signs great wonders great Miracles but I I love the Miracles I love the Miracles but let me just say something to you here tonight I believe that there's more than just Miracles I believe that there's more than just the I'm thankful for the miraculous and I believe we need more of it come on somebody and I believe God wants to do more of it but there was more to that son of man Ministry than just the Messiah sign to discern Hearts friends I'll just tell you and and you can you can take it or leave it but I'll tell you what I believe I believe in God's Prophet we witnessed the very nature of the lamb as the token life was to be the literal life of Jesus Christ Prophet says in one place the very human life of Jesus is to come back on the worshiper and friends can I just say I'm thankful for miracles but if I never see another one in my life but the nature of my lamb comes back upon my life that'll be the greatest Miracle God could ever do in my life is to give me the love of Jesus give me the kindness of Jesus give me the grace of Jesus Oh does somebody feel that way here tonight let the nature of the Lamb come back on the worshiper everybody loves his miracles I do too that loves The Sensational and brother Bram fought against it as I know I've preached this here before fought against it his entire Ministry you'll find it him fighting in one ditch of Armenian ISM and and then one ditches over here in Calvinism you know brother Ram said he said I'm a calvinist as long as Calvin's in the Bible I'm an armenius as long as it's in the Bible brother ROM says but there's always two ditches there's always one side or the other side isn't that amazing how people are there's always us or them or they I'd hide behind this pull pit but there ain't nowhere to hide you can see right through it and brother BR dealt with this listen brother bam can I just preach here for a moment prophet of God dealt with this entire Ministry two sides there's always a ditch on the left and there's always a ditch on the right and he says one side you got the fundamentalist Baptist who's cold and starchy and debt let me tell you how he said in one place he said one's got money in the bank but ain't got the ain't got the faith to sign his name to it the other one has all the faith in the world but he ain't got no money in the bank if you could ever get the two groups together I'm just preaching to what a prophet said and he says notice but the true bride goes down the middle of the rad drawing from both ditches hello hello I notice it's all amazing to me because it's the nature of people everybody loves to emphasize one thing to deemphasize another thing everybody loves to make something pop something up great over here only to lessen you know the fruits of the spirit were just denominational and oh really I'll tell you what a prophet said you might speak in tongues you might not but here's one thing you will have you will have the fruit evident fruits of the spirit in your life says the evidence of the Holy Ghost no brother and thought it was thought it was love the angel told him it wasn't neither is it speaking in tongues you said brother M do you believe in speaking in Tong absolutely I believe anybody who doesn't has never spoken tongues anybody who doesn't love the sensation and the feeling listen friends I love to F the Holy Ghost anybody who don't is just cuz you ain't never felt him before cuz if you ever felt him something in you says I want to feel more of that I want more and more and more and more and more fill my cup Lord but everybody loves to cut one thing out to to raise something else up it's always been that way it's always amazing I've always always found in people that with the message of the hour you'll find people will either deify the prophet or they'll deemphasize the prophet and say you know that's just his opinion brother Amos you know just what a just what brother bam says you know just you know I think brother B wasn't thus say the Lord of here and they always try to split this up and split the listen friends you can't take the messenger away from his message but they want to cut one thing out to cut it to to to to raise something I've some cut out emotion and say it's the word and the word only we don't need any of the gifts of the Spirit in operation anymore then others say we don't need teachers we don't need to teach the word of God it's not important well really that's the Ephesians Ministry pastors prophets teachers evangelists some cut out dancing and say oh that's all Pentecostal well I beg your pardon David danced before the [Applause] Lord what do you think happened on the day of Pentecost was the Fulfillment of everything David prayed for who were in The Upper Room was Jews they don't some say we don't need to dance some say we don't need brotherly love doesn't matter how I treat my brother all right some say we don't need the tapes we got our Bibles other says we don't need our Bible we got the tapes some says we just need tapes we don't need preachers all right somebody help me preach here don't leave me out here hanging on a limb some cut out the message said just give me my Bible others say I don't need my Bible amazing isn't it amazing don't you realize it is the tactic of the devil to kick us into ditches so that he can draw circles and create groups here and groups there groups here and groups there and listen friends I I remind you the prophet of God never drew a circle he only drew the circle bigger see brother the matter you preaching tolerance and and you know just just compromise that ain't what I'm preaching the word will make the separating the word will cut the difference out say well then brother Matt what is it what is it brother Paul what do we need you're confusing me brother Matt do we need the tapes is it not our tapes is it the Bible is it preachers is it t is it EV is it dancing is it emotion is it the word you say which is it brother Matt all of it all of it and I'm here to say give me all of it Lord I need the pastors I need the Evangelist I need a prophet give me my Bible give me the tapes give me the books give me the gifts give me the fruits give me the nature oh do you want to hear tonight church say I want all that God that's given can we go a little further notice this as he comes back to the expectation and he says I want you to make sure that you understand Elisha knew the mantle is nice but it wasn't the stitching it wasn't the Garment it wasn't what it was made of it wasn't the material though the material was very nice but what was special about the mantle was the promis that the mantle carried it was saturated with the anointing the purpose you see that's what an anointing is you ever look up that word it's cha which means to be Oily to smear with oil it's what they would do with the prophet at he was going to be king over Nations they would take that oil and they would break it over that man and pour it down his head as David says that's how well it is to dwell with brethren in in in in in in love it's like the the oil that ran from Aaron's beard it's that oil but what is that oil the purpose of the oil is not so you can get oily people love to get oily but the oil is only representing a purpose and God used that oil to symbolize the trout you realize when we pray for the sick we are taking the words of Jesus and that anointing oil we put upon you is so that the promises of Jesus can come off of this Bible and go into your body and heal you of all manner of diseases it is the transfer of that promise and so he would anoint a man he' take a man like jerem IA and he literally baptize him with his burden and God would have something to say to his people and so God would take a mouthpiece and he would begin to put his thoughts and his words notice friends the words of Jeremiah were not Jeremiah's words the words of Ezekiel it wasn't ezekiel's message it was only a message from the throne Ezekiel was just the Mailman for the message that's why the prophet of God said it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was only standing nearby when he appeared you say brother M what does that mean that means you could mock Jeremiah you could laugh at Jeremiah you could ridicule him question his credibility but you weren't mocking Jeremiah you were mocking Jehovah hello somebody brother bam says oh you say I would have defended Jesus in those days oh if I would have just been there you know I would have stood for him I wouldn't allowed those Roman soldiers I'll tell you what a prophet said a prophet said what you do with the message for your day proves what you would have did back there in the days of [Music] Jesus and when you walk away from this message you're not leaving the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you are rejecting the message from the throne but when you're accepting the message brother Donnie you're not AC accepting the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you're accepting the message from the [Applause] throne oh I'm so glad I could receive the word how many's glad with me I can receive the word from my generation it wasn't his message it wasn't his prise thas the mantle was not about Elijah it was the purpose that God was transferring off of the mantle into the life of Elisha it was the promises it was the faith these are some of the last things I've been scouring the message just scouring thinking what was upon brother brenham's heart before he left the the scene what was what was upon his heart what was so close to him as he's going to go off the scene what is some of the last words if I could just put myself there what is the what is the climate there what is the feeling what is what is he wanting to pass down what is he wanting to transfer I come to what house will you build me in 1965 in November just a month before he goes off the scene and I can hear the words of brother bandam say it brother br says oh if you feel notice that the first slide there brother he says I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it oh I don't know if that resonates with you but it resonates with me oh I want to say I am so hungry for the super Supernatural oh brother I've had enough of this world I've had enough of its depression I've had enough of its anxiety I've had enough of its politics and it's presidents and it's Nations and it's Wars I am so hungry to see the spirit of God move I just can't hardly stand it brother Bron says I get to the place come to a place we sit and see it among us that we're trying sit here in the desert I get to my brethren brother brandom says as it was to see the condition of that brother notice this what he says here go to the next slide brother just if you could brother bam says here in in the token I am looking what were you looking for brother Brandon before you left the scene 1963 I am looking for a time of a breakforth of the spirit of God how many here tonight to say I am looking for a time of the Break [Applause] Forth for another surge so you had surges brother Matt I have but I'm looking for another one tonight another surge of the Holy Ghost into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and I say even so come Lord Jesus even so come the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the the holy ghost that we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down I say God while The Headstone is coming down to the body send the Dynamics back into the church listen friends don't you realize you live in the most bold age there ever was where the lid of hell has been ripped off and Satan doesn't hide in the closet he's not over in a corner somewhere subliminally I tell you what the devil is he's right out in your face amen he's not running he's right there out in the open Spirits manifesting thems themselves well I just happen to believe that if the devil is manifesting himself right out in the open I just happen to believe that the spirit of God wants to manifest itself I say angels I say Angels If Heaven wants to open then I got a church that says open heaven open Heaven open Let it Rain Lord God brother bham says when all hell Cuts loose all Heaven Cuts loose oh how many want to say cut loose Cut Loose angels of God it comes to the this message can I go just a few more minutes I usually have this little button on my watch and it sets a 1 hour timer my church at home church at home loves this little one hour timer it off take it off I forgot to start it what I tell them when the timer goes off we've stepped into [Applause] eternity very funny brother bam says this here I love this we realize if he should anoint us Slide Five if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord Brother R goes to this message and I'm just going to skip on down some of these brothers and brother brandom says just as we know in ver in slide 11 just as We Know as a man asked me a few moments ago this is why Christ speak I love this message about the coming notice and the Rapture and we know we've lived the time out my goodness could we ever say that again no one would have ever imagined that we'd still be here no one what have you imagine even brother bham seen it and ending in in 77 it could can't go much further you say brother matth then what what what's been the what's been the what is God doing I tell you what he's doing he's not doing anything by mistake he's not making any bad choices he's not just up there dding his thumbs he's working something out just as we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture the hope hope of my heart the hope of the nations of the of the ages it's been the hope of every generation oh is it your hope here tonight friend we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture is at hand notice in your Bible you always find that the spirit of God has coming behold I cometh but then when it says it's at hand it means it's within your reach the Baton is within your grasp just as we know the time of the Rapture is at hand and what were you looking for brother brandham and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and get give it some intellectual faith more mechanics more doctrines eighth Messengers come on somebody to give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies and my body said amen amen listen friends you might be young here today and that's wonderful I'm not saying I'm old let me get that straight first but I'm not as young as I used to be and the older you get the older that you get the more that you realize how true how much you need this promise right here the older you get you realize this world is just a world of suffering I'm talking about the world I'm not talking about his promise listen his promises far his his his blessings far outweigh his crosses David said forget not his benefits but listen friends as he says can give it some Supernatural faith when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who could take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that that that what's that something that that man could not do hopeless he says that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people you know that just happened here just a year ago year and a half ago or so back in our hometown and my brother Travis one of my closest friends he he he he he was searching even from the days he was a boy from just a little boy he was searching for the Lord went into his mom and dad raised in the buur Baptist Church had left the church became disillusioned by it his dad was a deacon there the deacons would go out and take a smoke break and his dad left the church but

you know this is the end of my road and didn't want to go this way Travis and what did the doctor saying the doctor saying it's hopeless and there's nothing that could be done and it's you know stage four that tried chemo eight times it failed all eight times go home and he says you know this is this is this is it and this is you know just resign you know sometimes it's very easy to have faith for other people and sometimes it's very hard to have faith for yourself and he had just lost all hope and I sat there and I I never forget as Travis begin to say well Marcus he says I just got to tell you you know Travis is real bold he's a sweetheart but he's got a real tender heart but he's he's real bold when it's when it comes to the word and he says he says Marcus he says I got to tell you he says you know when I came to your church he says I was looking for the Living God the god I read about in the book of Acts Supernatural God he says when I came to your church he says I was looking for him and he says Marcus I want to tell you I found that God and that God's Not Dead that God's still alive he's Jesus the same yesterday today and forever and he's the god of Miracles he can still heal you Marcus and you could see the look in that man and Mary his wife there and she's listening and he says I want to tell you he says I want to tell you Marcus that God is Not in your denominations he's not in your Trinity of gods and and the denominations are condemned and and and and and The Trinity is condemned and and he's and Travis goes on this thing and you know that it's you know you're part I'm not telling you you're bad people but I'm telling you that denominations are of the devil and and and I'm thinking oh my goodness don't Travis afterward of wherever in a fox ho I want to be right behind you buddy he didn't shun to Clare and then Travis got to the end of it and Travis just bowed his head he said Marcus he said I hope I didn't offend you he says I hope I I didn't mean to he said I didn't mean to say anything to you he said I just figured that you know it's very Bleak and it's hopeless I just needed to be honest I never forget Marcus man stood there and he sat there and he bowed his head and he said no no Travis He said you didn't offend me he said in fact when you and your friend knocked on the door a voice spoke to me and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say friends you may not realize it but God's always working take no thought for what you'll say for in that moment Jesus said said a voice spoke to him and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say he said so I was prepared to hear anything you've got to say so I be begin to talk and I said Marcus all I did was take that book healing everything brother bham taught in there and I said Marcus I I want you to know that that that that that that tumor that you have is just a life doctors have given in the name it's cancer and the non Hotchkins L foman they've named it and I said but I want to tell you that that that that that that's a life that's living off of your life it's a demon spirit in Mark n when Jesus prays for the blind man Jesus didn't say death you know give it the doctor's name Jesus says Thou deaf Spirit a living organism living life come out of the man and do not enter him again and I said that life that's living on your life can kill you if the doctors can do everything they can to take it out of your body and that's good that's praise God but listen Marcus that that life wants to kill you and I said I want to tell you today I don't have any bag of doctors tools but I've got a book full of promises in God's word [Applause] and you could feel just the atmosphere of Faith beginning to raise in that b in that little living room you can feel the atmosphere change and I begin to testify to them I said I want to tell you about a little woman if you go to slide 13 I said this little woman I know personally her name is Elena but she lives in Louisiana I said she also was diagnosed with stage four non- Hoskins lymphoma and I said that that little woman I said was diagnosed with the same exact thing and you could see Mary as Mary Mary uh just perked up real quick and I said that little woman was diagnosed with the same exact thing that you've got and I said but I want to tell you a little bit about her testimonial can I read this to you here tonight I found this here sister Elena says it and and she says a week before Christmas I was diagnosed with stage four non- hodkin lyoma two days after Christmas I started the first of 12 chemo treatments they told me that after four treatments they would do a pet scan to see how my body's responding I believe God's A Healer I've told that to anyone who asks what I'm how I'm doing I told them I was looking to him and believe he would heal me on Sunday I leaped and danced before the Lord with joy and victory notice because I realized it was already a finished work you see sometimes you got to do something naturally in order to move something supernaturally oh come on somebody sometimes you got to do something physically naturally to get a supernatural reaction why did nonon have to dip seven times why did Jesus when he prayed for a little blind man didn't just say you're healed he spits on the ground he rolls up some mud what is it the physical brother Bandon would say it this way the natural always runs with the spiritual why did is he standing there with banks woods and he throws a rock up into the air and brother says that Disturbed the atmosphere oh my brother my sister I say it's time if you want to say Amen to the word of God let that word change the atmosphere brother vom said it Disturbed the atmosphere and when it landed it was a tornado our earthquake that almost suck Alaska why did Haddie have to say the right words whatever you say Sister hadie Sister Elena begins to run and dance before the Lord she says I knew it was a finished work even though I didn't know how or when even though there was no proof yet they were singing what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting sister l begins to say oh I have blessedness with my Lord so near that sounds strange to many but in the Bible maram danced for Joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians who had plagued her and enslaved her and bothered her and tormented her when she seen her enemy was dead in the river she began to shout oh my brother my sister when I see the enemy I fought my whole life and when he's cast into the Lake of Fire I believe I'll be dancing and shouting and singing on The Hills of Glory Hallelujah it's a sign and expression of extreme joy and victory I knew my healing would come sooner or later because the Jesus of the Bible the great healer is the same Jesus I served for 27 years yesterday I had my pet scan and today I met my doctor for my fourth treatment go to that next slide he informed me that the cancer is already gone on the left is the cancer on the right is a body that is cancer that's my God that's my Jesus Hallelujah tears begin to well up in Mary she said oh I've always believed in a supernatural God like that I've seen him as a little girl I've seen the supernatural work of God the man put the woman over there say does that mean that God has the H him I said no that's not what it means God has a Divine will it's a sovereign will I don't mean that for a moment but let me tell you what God can do sir God can heal God can save God can set free there's nothing too hard for my God we begin to sit there and i' begin to begin to say just you could see the tears welling up in Mary you could see the atmosphere entire atmosphere change I begin to pray IID never forget that moment as I laid my hands on Marcus here he's full of cancer you could see him in that slide there you can see the cancer just going through his body there he is is with this tumor you can go to the next one the tumor that's about the size of a grapefruit on his neck he had it all down his body down his calves go to the next slide is pet scan full of cancer in the normal pet scan you can see a black spot here for the liver and the in the heart you can't even see anything he's covered he had on his calf he had he had tumors the size of apples ate up and I begin to never forget laying my hands on him I begin to to pray and I said God I'd be reminded of that man in the Bible who couldn't get to Jesus and his condition he had gotten so bad he couldn't get to him you might know somebody like that here tonight that Satan is so tangled up and messed up and you realize they'd never be in a church like this I how God how could you even save my my my child he's so lost and at never even be in a church like this never never even be a meeting like this maybe they're so so torn up with some disease or something in their body and my mind just begin to think of that little man on that bed brother the Daryl and he couldn't get to the Lord but my Bible says that his friends picked up his [Music] bed and they begin to take his body to Jesus and the Bible says that when they got to Jesus he was surrounded by people in a little Hut but that wasn't going to stop the faith of that mother or that father or that Pastor it wasn't going to stop the faith of those friends my Bible says they climbed up on the roof and they ripped the roof off and they lowered him down to Jesus Jesus and Jesus said by your faith this man is made he they may not be here tonight they may be a million miles away but I challenge you to rip the roof off tonight and say God I am lowering them down I'm lowering them down to you Lord Jesus let me give you what the words of the lord gave me just a day before before I came here and God reminded me supernaturally of this God gave me the words and I'll take them I'll give them to you just the way he gave to me I want to tell somebody don't give up on your Miracle you take that from the Lord don't give up on your miracle I don't care if they're not here tonight I don't care if they're in a barroom somewhere where I don't care how lost and how many years it has been don't you let the devil rearrange it and try to rearr it and say it'll be this way and God must have been it this way you hold on to that promise God Made [Applause] You Don't abort it don't abort it I began to pray I said Lord just as Hezekiah asked for years who's going to give a death sentence and ask for years I pray for this man who stood for you he's a preacher God he's he's preached from your Bible he's spoken about you Lord if he was if he was not ashamed of you then God don't be ashamed of him Lord would you heal this man you know what we did after we prayed that prayer you say brother Matt did the room shake no could have I'd have loved it handwriting on the wall could have didn't you know what we did we took our burdens to the Lord and we left them there and that's all you can do and we walked out months go by forget how many months it was months go by Brother Travis just so happens to be in my living room sitting there talking to me where is talking about things you know nothing really important Travis is just in the middle of a sentence I never forget he pulls out his phone and Matt Mary begins to read the text praise God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four non hosin lymphoma he is cancer Hallelujah that's my God I said that's Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Rafa Marcus was supernaturally healed of cancer and I say whatever you need tonight he's the same God in the room what you're looking for ain't down the road it's right here right now whatever you need Reach Out Reach Out say God I accept it in the name of the Lord I accept it in the name of the Lord musicians could you come hallu I accept it in the name of the Lord could you do that here tonight friends don't give up on your miracle thank you Lord he is still Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Raa and he is more than ever before wanting to pour out the supernatural oh thank you Lord God I think of many needs her tonight I think of how many needs we have in this body I think of my brother Ron Spencer there in Virginia and let me tell you something the doctors might say one thing but drct Jesus says another whose report will you believe I said whose report will you believe the report of cancer the the report of what the naysayers say and the doubter I say I choose to believe the words of the Lord that they are yay and amen they are thus saith the Lord it is God's promise not my promise wonder if you take that need raise it up as you byow your heads and say Lord I'm representing behind my hand all the needs in our body the needs of this church those listening online I bring those needs up I believe my Bible told me to to speak them to bring those needs before the Lord it's not just one it's many there's not just one or two friends I know the needs of the body are many many many but I've got a go God who says it's never too late don't you give up on your miracle I don't care how lost I don't care how far away I don't care how distant it looks I don't care how many years it's been don't you give up on that Supernatural God friends if we lose that Supernatural God we are doomed it will take a supernatural Miracle to change your body one day and I say Lord let me not restrict you let me not hinder you let me not hamper you let me say God I give you freedom I give you Reign I give you full control Lord to move to speak to to operate I give it to you God I'm going to lay aside all my ideas I'm just going to come before you nothing in my hands I bring simply to thy cross I clean I give it to God now whatever that need is I wonder if you'd put your hand over on that person beside you I wonder if you'd bind your faith together you call out you call out to God for whatever your need is I believe this church could call the name of a mighty warrior brother Ron Spencer who's Faithfully stood and preached this message in country after country brother man who in in great need stands for the message of the hour not just brother Ron but many names we can name here tonight whatever that need is I wonder if this church would just begin to call on God and say God we've heard about it we've spoken about it we've preached about it but now we're Believers we're going to believe about it God we're going to stand upon the promises the unfailing promises of almighty God I don't care if it's that boy or that girl or that mother who's walked away or that father who's walked away nothing is too late nothing is too hard nothing is too far gone as long as there's breath in the body there's a miracle waiting to happen oh God we raise up our voices here tonight Lord in this room we feel your presence God that Supernatural angel is moving through this building right now wanting to touch lives he's wanting to kill Hearts he's wanting to mend Brokenness he's wanting to restore homes may you move oh God your Prophet told us anybody who's Born Again by the spirit of God is a candidate for the supernatural power anybody who's born of the spirit I say I am a candidate for angels of God to move upon my heart and my life oh let's start this meeting out with a move say God I got I unrestrict you tonight move Holy Ghost move in every heart oh God move in every life Lord Jesus you're still the same yesterday today and forever there is nothing too hard for you God there's nothing too great there's no report too Bleak there's nobody that can go far enough it can outrun your mercy and your grace oh God doesn't matter what's happened yesterday today is a new day Mercy is new Lord

So then back in June, I ended back up in the hospital, my colon acting up. The nurse practitioner said, \"You just had an angry colon.\" And they tested me for uh ulcerated colitis, IBS, and uh Crohn's. And so he was thinking I had Crohn's and everything, but they said I had 10 inches of my colon had come out. So back in uh July, he took 10 inches out. But you know what? I'm still here today and I thank God. And I had another colonoscopy. I had four of them this year. I tell you, I don't wish that on nobody. But anyway, uh had another one just last Friday and he had said, \"I got good news.\" He said, \"I don't have to see you again for a year.\" And I said, \"Well,\" I said, \"Thank God.\" He said, \"Yes.\" I praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I know that God can answer each and every one of these. Amen. It don't matter. Just take him at his word.

Oh, God. How we so feel humbled and small in your presence when you come among us, Lord, and make your way known, your will known to us. And then to see that you have included us in your great program. Father, we just want you to know that we love you and we adore you. We magnify you. &gt;&gt; We cannot wait to finally be able to see you. Lord, we're just happy that it's Wednesday again. I told Carol before church, I said, \"I'm just so glad to be able to be in church again.\" Oh, Father, it's such an honor and a privilege. What a great privilege it is, Jesus. We love you. Help us tonight. Father, speak to us from your word. Father, you see this request that was just turned in. Dear God, Brother Marty McMord and Lord, pastored a little church there in Arkansas. Pray that you'd be with them as well. Granted, dear Father, anoint us tonight, Lord, as we look into your word in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, there was a wasp that flew on my nose and stung me on the hand. So, I say we go ahead and have church while y'all say. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Genesis 24:1. Praise the Lord. And Abraham was old and wellstricken in age. And the Lord blessed Abraham and all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, \"Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom among whom among whom I dwell. But it didn't say he was one of them. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he was just in the same culde-sac &gt;&gt; or the same vicinity. That's the way we are. We are not of this world. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Perventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must thy needs bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, which spake unto me, that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He shall send his angel before thee. He shall send his angel, not a host, not angels and plural, but his angel before thee. and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. The first time that we actually can see that angels appeared in the Old Testament in the relation to man in the scripture is the very last verse of Genesis chapter 3. But it's not a very good setting for the Bible tells us that God drove the man out of the Garden of Eden and that he put cherubams on the east side outside of Eden. And they had a flaming sword and they was turning every way to protect the way back to the tree of life. That's right. And then we go for many years before we see an angelic visitation again that God is bringing down heaven to the constituents of the earth and helping them to be reconciled back. Part of our dowy is going to be our heavenly identification that will strengthen us. Sometimes they will also bring healing. They will bring encouragement. &gt;&gt; They will bring all different kinds of things to us on our journey. And it is a witness to us that we have a heavenly identification that goes beyond just this mortal life. Now, of course, angels appeared many times in the Old Testament. In retrospect, as we we read the New Testament and we start in the Gospels and we can see Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And for us looking at it backwards, it makes the picture so clear. But had we lived in that first century, four, five, 6 AD, something like that, for us to have been there, no doubt we would have not known the great things that were transpiring because there was no social media. There was no printed New Testament for about 50 to 60 years after the Lord Jesus had left from the earth or it would have been probably actually 25 leaving 33 and the first one was around 56. So it would have been 20 20 something years before they had apprented New Testament. So by word of mouth, there might have been a few people that would have heard some talk that angels had been appearing on the earth and there was certain people that these angels was coming to and making things known to them. Now no doubt it would have been very odd and very strange because the angels had not appeared like this at all in this consequence even in the Old Testament. Now they would appear and it would go years before anybody would see another one. And then one would appear again. It would go years. It might be hundreds of years before anyone would see another angel of God. And then it would be restricted many times to prophets that God would send his mighty angels to the common average person. Very very few instances in the scripture. But yet when we look at the New Testament, it was a breaking of what God was fixing to do because the son of man, the ladder from heaven, was fixing to anchor down on the earth and latch a hold of the throne of God in heaven. and the angels would start ascending and descending on the son of man. So before he actually is ever born and brought to the earth, this angelic appearance starts happening. It's phenomenal really. Let's read Luke 1 verse 5. Now, I want you to notice that I I checked it before I came out there just a bit ago that the angel Gabriel, his name is mentioned four times in the Bible. The first time is in the book of Daniel. The second time is the book of Daniel. But the third time is what we're going to read right now in the book of Luke. So, the first two times made known to a prophet. But now God is going to break that pattern that it's not going to be a prophet. It's going to actually be a priest. And the next time it'll be a woman. Luke chapter 1 verse 5. There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias and of the course of Abia. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth. and they both were righteous before God. Now, I want you to remember these portions of this verse. So, they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. So, they are walking before God perfect. But notice what they're walking in. And they're in this stage of what God call righteous and blameless. So both were righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and the ordinances which was thou shalt, thou shalt not, thou shalt, thou shalt not. You can't go here. You cannot mix in your garment woolen and lenon. Don't s sew diverse seed in your garden. Don't do this. Don't do that. And they were blameless when it come to that. But now watch how people can be blameless when it comes to commandments and ordinances and miss it when God does a new thing. &gt;&gt; They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. They had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they both were now wellstricken in years. And it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course. Now notice everything is exact. He would have been a punctual sort of a guy. He would have been a guy that was right on time, everything dressed exactly, pomegranates, garments clean, hands washed, feet washed, everything would been perfect to the dot. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Isn't it strange how God picks certain sides to do certain things? I'm sure you've noticed it that brother Brandon would bring the prayer line from the right side. The right side so much in the scripture was pointed out. Now watch. So the angel appears on the right side of the altar of incense and he appeared at a certain place. Why? Why the altar of incense? Why not the manora, the seven brain candlestick? Why not the ark of the covenant? dispensationally. He appeared at the right place. Why? The people on the outside are praying. What's Zachcharias doing? Offering incense. He appears exactly in the right season. Had he been beyond the veil, Zachcharias would have never seen him. &gt;&gt; So the angel of God, which is Gabriel, came exactly to where he was. And the people couldn't come into there, but they were paralleled that on the outside. They were all praying together. Oh, I wonder what could happen right here tonight if we'd all get in that same attitude. &gt;&gt; And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, \"Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy &gt;&gt; prayer.\" So he appears at the altar of s incense. Remember when the great ornament of furniture that was seen there in heaven and what was it? The prayers of the saints. For thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John, and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. Now, I want you to notice how the angel of the Lord, Gabriel, is going to place John and divide the Elijah mantle of Malachi 4 in two parts. Now, watch what he tells him. many of the children of Israel. He shall turn to the Lord their God. For he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. But Malachi 4 says, \"Turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers.\" wonder why the angel of God didn't quote that latter part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for those of those who have left this message and try to say John the Baptist fulfilled the same thing, you're lying. &gt;&gt; I said you are lying. &gt;&gt; Gabriel said he would fulfill the first part. I'm going to take Gabriel over some beardrinking, shortwearing, backsliding man that's walked away from the end time message &gt;&gt; or some preacher standing up that thinks he knows more about it than a God called prophet and word of life said &gt;&gt; you want to take this one's idea that's idea go ahead and do what you want to do. I'm going to take Gabriel's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take what Gabriel said over some theologian that thinks he knows more about it. No, I figure Gabriel knows much more about it than I do &gt;&gt; or any of you. &gt;&gt; Now notice, he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and leaves out with divine intent and purpose that he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. So he slices that prophecy right in half. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And divided Isaiah 61 by 2,000 years of a prophetic timeline. [crying] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know how blessed you are to see that tonight &gt;&gt; to make uh ready [laughter] a people prepared for the Lord. And Zachchariah said unto the angel, \"Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel said unto him, I am &gt;&gt; Gabriel. that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. Tell me how a sinless, blameless, perfect man. Come on, brother &gt;&gt; could not see such a thing. Can't you see how good people can be totally blind &gt;&gt; as God changes from one dispensation to another? &gt;&gt; Now, this is in your Bible. This man was blameless until this. &gt;&gt; Now, he's no longer blameless. Brother Daryl, the angel of God tells him who he is and tells him because of what you have said. Now, it was not just that he asked a question. It's the attitude he asked it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. All right. &gt;&gt; And Zachariah said unto the angel, \"Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\" And the angel answered and said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee to show thee these glad tidings, and behold, thou shalt be dumb. [clears throat] Well, I'll tell you one thing. It's probably a good thing that Gabriel ain't here today striking everybody that has questions and doubts about the message of the hour. Cuz probably beginning at the pull pit to the back, none of us will be talking for a long time. &gt;&gt; I don't know that might be a good thing sometimes as much as we rattle in much trash as we talk. &gt;&gt; A blameless, perfect man that obeyed the commandments and the ordinances. And thou shalt, and thou shalt not, and thou shalt have this, and thou shalt, and thou shalt. And now God was doing something like he had never done before. And the man missed the present tense angelic visitation. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Behold, thou shalt be done and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed. Now I want you to listen to this. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; my words. &gt;&gt; Now if Zacharias said I'll tell you what I want a scripture. &gt;&gt; I want you to show me a scripture where it mentioned my name and my wife's name and I'll believe it. You ain't got no word where I can trace it back to the Old Testament and prove it. Where is there even a John in the prophecy? &gt;&gt; There ain't no such a name. I I I I'm challenging you by the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Watch it know it all. &gt;&gt; Cuz you'll find out you don't know it all. &gt;&gt; And not only that, you may not be able to speak what you do know. &gt;&gt; The same angel that can open your mouth can shut it, &gt;&gt; can't he? Now watch. Because thou believest not &gt;&gt; whose words? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; So when God sends an angel &gt;&gt; and people refuse &gt;&gt; to accept that angel's message, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Dangerous thing, friends. because thou believest not my words. Now I want you to listen to the perfection of God's word which shall be fulfilled in their season. Now I'm going to say something right now that's going to blow some of you away. There are words that God has allocated in his people's lives that he knew must be on divine sovereign promise whether or not you even believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sarah never did believe. The prophet said she never did believe it. If it was left up to us, us and our weak measly faith, we still wouldn't get off the ground. There ain't no way in the world. You know how there's going to be a bride there? Divine sovereignty of God has already spoke. There is a bride and nothing, including herself, will ever stop her from being here. Because you and I would look at this, well, I don't understand. We have this question. Well, what about that? What about that? What about that? But God says, \"My word will be fulfilled.\" And there ain't nothing going to stop it. Time ain't going to stop it. The world ain't going to stop it. Our fears ain't going to stop it. Our anxiety ain't going to stop it. And that's the way with the allocation of certain divine promises. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough preachers in the pull pit. There ain't enough unbelievers in the world. His word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. I thought that if we didn't believe certain things said about us, it couldn't happen. &gt;&gt; Well, that's true to a degree, &gt;&gt; but there's certain things that God knows how we are, &gt;&gt; and there's certain things that he gives to you, and if you don't believe them, they won't happen. But when it comes to your destiny, it's already been predetermined. For those whom he did forno, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. And the original digot says it this way, for whom he did forno, he did previously mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. previous mark out copies of the likeness of the son of himself. He could not leave my destiny up to my free moral agency. Oh, I know some of us are free will Baptist, but it comes right down to it. Boy, my free will. Glory to God. I went down to the altar and I grabbed a hold of the horns. No, you didn't. God grabbed a hold of your horns and shook the devil out of you and absolutely converted you and smacked you up the side of the head and said, \"You're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. You're not going back to the world, but Lord, I want to.\" He said, \"I said you're not going back no more, but God, I can't do it.\" Yes, you can. But God, I'm too weak. No, you're not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the way [screaming] our God does it. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled. And yet part of those words were words about him, brother Daryl. And he didn't even believe what the angel said about him. How you know that, brother Donnie? That's the very thing that he threw back in the angel's face. I'm [screaming] old. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't do this. There's no way. He was doubting God's word about him and about his wife that it couldn't happen. The angel of God said, \"All right, boy. You're going to be dumb.\" &gt;&gt; There's a lot of dumb folks in the world we're living in. &gt;&gt; And it ain't their tongue. &gt;&gt; It's her supernatural intelligence. Huh? You're going to be dumb because of this. But the word [screaming] I spoke &gt;&gt; shall be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now let us move from Elizabeth and Zachcharias to Luke chapter 1 26. I find this amazing because Luke remember was not actually in the message as we'd say at that time. So Luke was a Jew, but he was raised and cultured in the gentile ways. Speak many, many languages, educated, doctor. So Luke didn't come around till sometime later. Now, according to the Bible, we're not supposed to accept anything without two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; So I'd like the second and third witness &gt;&gt; that Gabriel came to Zacharias. Come on. &gt;&gt; I love it when the Lord does that. I mean, it just I just love it. He loves to fry that devil's hide. I want to know who else said this happened beside Luke. Do y'all believe this is the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do you accept it as holy scripture? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But we've only got one man's word for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that one man wasn't even there. &gt;&gt; So y'all accept it? &gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and read the rest of it then cuz he's also the only one that says this one this way. &gt;&gt; That's why I have no problem when God sends a prophet messenger to the earth and he preaches the seals and says all kinds of things that other people didn't say. I have no problem accepting that myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice Luke 1:26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, and to a city in Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, \"Fear not, Mary.\" Oh, so this angel knew people's names. &gt;&gt; He did not have to ask them their name, did he? &gt;&gt; He could tell them their name. &gt;&gt; Yes, he could. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I've been sharing some this week of some discernments that I found. I'd sure like to share them with the rest of you sometime, too. When God's prophet would call people out, tell them their first name, middle name sometimes and last name. Tell them what was wrong with them. Tell them what their house number was, what street they lived on, what city they were from. And in one of them that I'd sent around, he told them the area because he was singing it in a vision where they were coming from and it was a lake or a body of water and described how it was coming into this country and it was Paduca, Kentucky. Another one was a small place in Missouri and he calls the name of that place Kennet, Missouri. Well, I can tell you even to this day, if you blink your eyes and you go through Kennet, you ain't even going to see it. I can't imagine what it was. Right, brother Daryl. Brother Daryl's been through there many, many times. Uh, but yet God was so particular and the way that he would have Why was this done, friends? So we could recognize the Lord Jesus was here, not William Brandham. the Lord Jesus, it was his ministry on the earth that had come to call out a bride. &gt;&gt; Now, had it been only the signs and the wonders, then we would have known right then there was something wrong. God never sends that type of phenomenon without bringing a message. The phenomenon will come first and the phenomenal events will start happening. It's in order to get the attention of the people and the messenger is baiting the hook. So the hook is hanging there. It's hanging there bare and it's hanging there exposed. And God will send a sign and he will send a miraculous and the supernatural and he will cover the hook so the fish will not see it. And then the spirit of God will launch it out into the water and he'll go to reeling in. Now what's he looking for? a rainbow trout. A rainbow trout. But you see that rainbow trout will run away from a bare hook. So you've got to have bait on that hook. [clears throat] What does the devil try to do? Try to impersonate that supernatural phenomena in order to take away and make the real look smaller. Oh hallelujah. Now watch the angel Gabriel how he deals with a woman. Not a preacher, not an evangelist, not a teacher, but a woman. Oh my. Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David. He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And his kingdom of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, Mary, you're going to question. Now, Zacharias raised a question &gt;&gt; and got in big trouble. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Mary's going to ask a question and ain't going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder what the difference is. Attitude. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She's being honest. She's not asking that question out of unbelief. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Satan loves to do when people go to question the message. Well, I don't understand this. How come that? I can't put that together. and they go to web pages and websites and they go to talking to a bunch of unbelieving devils and won't even talk to their pastor, won't even talk to godly men of God, but they hang around that bunch of garbage out there that's as polluted and hellbound as they can be. Come on, somebody. Let's have church tonight. You're not even doing something sainely by asking men of God who've given their entire life for this message, for this word. and you'll go to websites and go to read this book and that book. Why don't you come and talk to men of God that you've seen God heal the sick through their hands and seen God raise the dead right in this very church building and you'll talk to unbelievers and infidels and agnostics. Come on children. I said come on children. If you're going to have something there and you got a question, come to men of God that God can help lead you in the right way. Mary was not smitten because you had a question because she was asking in sincerity, not in doubt. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when Judas saw the high expensive perfume that was poured on Jesus head and on his feet &gt;&gt; and he looked at it and said, \"How come this waste? This could have been sold for, you know, how muchever it was. It could have been sold and given to the poor.\" And John knew him well by this time. And he said, \"Not that he cared for the poor, but he was a thief.\" So Judas asks his questions too. I like to look at where the question is coming from. A sincere heart that's trying to understand or the heart of an unbeliever, an infidel that only wants to argue and debate. I'm not going to spend too much time answering them kind of questions cuz it's basically a waste of time. &gt;&gt; I'll spend day and night. God knows it's the truth. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to find answers to people's questions. If I feel it's sincere, but if I feel it's not sincere and I pray over them and God just pulls it away from me, I'm not going to waste hardly no time at all. Why should I? I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I get that one answer, they'll give me another. And I become so consumed and trying to answer the questions of people that don't believe in the first place, I take away from those who really do believe, and I could help them. I'm not going to cast my pearls before swine. So go on, Sue. Stay away from me. I'm not interested in feeding hogs. I want to feed sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then said Mary unto the angel, how how shall this be seeing? &gt;&gt; I know not a man. Now look at what Zachcharias said. How can this be? I I'm older. My wife is old. And what's Mary doing coming right back? How can this be? I've never known a man. She's going to the flesh just like Zacharias did. But there was a difference in the heart. And the an angel answered and said unto her, \"Thou shalt be dumb. Two people asked two questions. Neither one of them understood. One of them got smoked dumb for nine months. The other one received the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And the angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month was her who was called barren. For with God nothing &gt;&gt; shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; And Mary said, &gt;&gt; \"Behold the handmade of the Lord. be it unto me. The Bible did not give us her name in Isaiah that she would have to receive by an angelic message and hear her name called through that angel's &gt;&gt; message. Oh yeah. G. &gt;&gt; Now notice, it was not the mighty Elohim himself that come down and call Mary, &gt;&gt; but he sent an angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And the angel messenger called her by name. &gt;&gt; You know, in other words, saying something like this, I'll no longer call you church, &gt;&gt; but I'll call you bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when them word, that seals comes open, then you're hearing your name. Am I hearing Donnie Reagan? Are you hearing Rob Weber? Are you hearing Lance Parker? Harry Reagan, Karen Reagan. Is that what you're hearing? You're hearing your word name. When that word speaks to something that you finally found your true identity, maybe she's always an odd girl, 16 years old. Maybe she's always different and unusual and she didn't know what it was. But when she heard that prophecy, there was something about it. and through that angel's message. Hallelujah. And he told her, \"This is the way it's going to be, Mary. You're not going to work your way into it. You're not going to pray your way into it. You're not going to fast your way into it. The Holy Ghost will come upon you.\" Let me tell you something, little bride. Yes. Pray. Read your Bible. God lays it on your heart to fast. Fast. But you're not going to get it by your works. You know how we're going to leave this world? The Holy Ghost is going to come upon us. The spirit of God will bring the power of the rapture. And it's been given to us by an angel's message. [applause] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, \"Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.\" She trusts him so much. Notice she didn't say the Torah. She didn't even quote Isaiah and say according to the book of Isaiah because Isaiah never personally identified her by name. Jenny, can you see it? &gt;&gt; Can't you see what God has done for you &gt;&gt; by sending you a message in [screaming] the last day that would be so personal to you, you'll never get away from it. I don't care what you do, wherever you ever go. &gt;&gt; It's so personally to you. There's nothing. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. The real bride in this age has it just as powerful as Mary had it then. Brother Daryl, you'll never talk them out of it. You'll never threaten them out of it. You'll never buy them out of it. They can't get out of it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. [applause] Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. And they see all these lights and these saucers, flying saucers they call them, and they wonder what it is. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, little children. One of these days, one of them will drop right down into that &gt;&gt; and change it. It won't be hide or hair nor bones left behind. &gt;&gt; You'll be changed in a moment. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, look with me again in Matthew 1:18. This is after the immaculate conception. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the with this wise one as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together and was she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. That's what I'm wanting everybody in this church this same portion of the word right here can be said about you &gt;&gt; that you're found with child &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man, not willing to make her a public example, but was minded to put her away private. Now remember, they were just engaged, betrothed, but the betroal was law-abbbinding. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream. I want you to notice how different that God comes to him than he did to Zachcharias or to Mary. He still sends an angel, but now it's an angel in a dream. And it's not a dream that needs interpretation. So, we don't look over here and there's three stars over there and there's four donkeys over there and there's five moon pies over here and six RC's and then there's a, you know, a little table that's got Tonka toys and and it's got all these symbols and all that. What did you eat for supper? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You can't believe some of the dreams that people send me sometime and they just know it means something. I know it means something, too. But it ain't got nothing to do with God. Come on, somebody. I know there's some of the people in the message just simply don't believe it. And the further we go, the more I I realize even some of the preachers in the message don't believe what the prophet said. That if it is a dream from God in this day, there is no prophet in the land to interpret it. So it will be a dream like Joseph had. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary, thy wife. &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. They're just engaged. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They've not even met under the tent yet. They've not even drank the last cup of wine. They She's not even been sent for to go to the house that he's built her. But the angel of God recognized betroal on that engagement. Binding? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what Joseph is going to do? Divorce her? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife of that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And then Joseph wakes up and said, \"Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. What she's been telling me is the truth. &gt;&gt; I was having a hard time believing. I I just I just couldn't hardly believe.\" So the angel appeared to a bride. &gt;&gt; He did. And the bride conceived of the word and the bride was telling people about it, but a lot of the people was having a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That the bride had actually become pregnantated by the Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the last call before the birth of the word in flesh will be some of those who struggling and the final voice to the final age will be the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know some of our message folks don't like that quote. None. I love it myself cuz it reads me and you in the script. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're the last actors on the scene. Now watch verse 23. Quoting the scripture, behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus. So God appeared to him in this angel had formed and it was so real to Joseph. He done exactly what the angel said. Now watch in Matthew chapter 2 11. And when they were come, we're talking about the magi now. And they're coming after Jesus has been born. Actually a little while after Jesus had been born. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when they were come into the house, &gt;&gt; not into the cavemen &gt;&gt; where he was born, &gt;&gt; they come into the house, &gt;&gt; they saw the young child, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; not a newborn baby. &gt;&gt; This is what your Bible says. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrr. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And if you ever meet Jesus right and give him the proper gifts, you'll go back to your country another way than when the way you come to him. You come to him lost. You come to him wretched. You come to him in a mess. But when you meet him, oh, glory to God. I feel like preaching a little bit right now. And you give the Lord Jesus your gifts. Amen. He will send you back to your country another way than the way you come. Aren't you glad you're different, friends? You've been changed by the power of God. He's sending us another way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in a dream, saying, \"Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt. and be thou there until I bring thee word. So you imagine now an angel of God is bringing a message for him to flee. But the same angel ain't going to leave him there. The same angel will be sent back from the throne of God to tell him it's time to come back home &gt;&gt; and there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. Now notice after Herod was dead Matthew 21:19. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appearth in a dream. Ain't this something? Joseph has three visitations in his dream. His subconscience and it was an angel every time. We have no record that an angel actually appeared in a visible form. Now, some of you may be terrified of these things I've been preaching on Wednesday night thinking that an angel of God is going to appear before you. Don't worry. God knows exactly how to deal with each one of us. And God knows exactly how to make us. So, we're able to correspond to the supernatural. But this was just as much God as the other instances that happened. But this is the way God called Joseph. And this was his divine channel of communication by which God could speak to him. Praise the Lord. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph and Egypt, saying, \"Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead, which sought the young child's life.\" Now, let's move from from this to Luke 2:8. Look at all the angelic visitations that we've seen in a period of 6 months, a year, a year and a half, two years, one after another after another after another. It's a sign something's fixing to happen at the birth of Jesus. And they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel [sighs] of the Lord came upon them. Now remember what these guys were. Humble, poor peasant shepherds. There was the kings, the potentates, the great high priest, the great holy s Sanhedrin. And God sent an angelic choir in order to sing to humble shepherds. Why? It had to be shepherds. And the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Can you imagine these guys? Nobody's, brother Darl. Absolute nobodies. And yet the angel of the Lord come upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, \"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you.\" Oh, you mean so an angel can tell you things that are to be &gt;&gt; an angel can bring you things that are prophetic. &gt;&gt; This shall be a sign, oh hallelujah, unto you. You shall find the babe. Notice the difference of the terminology here, babe, versus the term in Matthew, child. Look at it in the Greek and you'll find out that the other one is an infant. It's not a baby. So, it's several years old. This shall be a sign unto you, and you'll find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. It don't say about the magi finding him in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. I know, I know, I know this is not tradition. I ain't worried about tradition. I want truth. You ain't going to find this in the manger scene. I've said it many years ago. You know, if I was going to have a modern-day major scene in front of my house, you know what I'd do? I'd get me a blowup mattress and go out there and lay in the yard and say, \"Here it is. Right here is the current manger scene.\" Because deity ain't in heaven. It's in me. Deity ain't in heaven. It's in you. Jesus is no longer in a manger. I'm telling you, he's here in the bride's body. He's here in the blind flesh. But, brother Donnie, we're weak human beings. Yes, we are. And that's what makes it so awesome. That's what makes it so glorious. &gt;&gt; And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swirling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host. &gt;&gt; Praising God. Can you imagine them old boys looking around? Now keep in mind when they would go into town, everybody knew what these guys done cuz they smelled like sheep. They say that them shepherds was around the sheep so much that even when they laughed that their laugh was like a sheep. [laughter] [clears throat] Oh Lord God, can't you see why Jesus come to the earth? He wanted to learn to laugh like him. &gt;&gt; And them shepherds smelled like sheep. &gt;&gt; God in heaven in spirit form did not smell like a sheep. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Jesus wanted to come down to the earth and learn to laugh like us, but also learn to cry like us. Did the world need another carpenter? He who made the worlds? &gt;&gt; Did the world [screaming] need another fisherman? &gt;&gt; Him that would go out and cast a net into the sea and all he would had to have done was spoke to the sea and say, \"Empty out.\" I'm talking about our father that could have put a patent on the seven colors in the rainbow. He could put a copyright on the Robin song. He could put a copyright on the cardinal song. He could put a patent and ownership on this and that and the other cuz it all belongs to him. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. And yet he come down to the earth and didn't even have a place to lay his sin. Had to borrow a womb to be born in. Had to borrow a grave to be buried in. But he ain't having to borrow nothing tonight. We give it to him. Hallelujah. [screaming] We will not make him beg for our heart. We will not make him beg for room. &gt;&gt; We say, \"Come in, Lord Jesus.\" Listen what they were singing now. Glory to God in the highest. On earth peace, good will toward men. It came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, \"Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass.\" Notice how they say it. Is come to pass. It's present tense. It's unfolding. &gt;&gt; It's coming to pass. &gt;&gt; They realized they were part of what was coming to pass. Oh Lord God, may I may we look tonight, Brother Joe, and see we are part of what is coming to pass. Yes, we are part of the past and we're part of the future, but we are part of the present. This is our time. We are the actors on the scene. Friends, &gt;&gt; listen to this. Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. Listen to this. And there's a man can turn on the light. You know, when a king is born, they have seen great carrying on. When the king is born, &gt;&gt; he was so secretly born, born in a stable in a manger where the cattle and the horses were eaten. But yet he was a king. And the angels came down and sang the hymns to the shepherds. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So they didn't go to the temple and to sing to Annus and Capus, Pontius Pilate or Herod or whoever all the great people were of that day, but they went to shepherds. You see, God still believes in shepherds. &gt;&gt; And the angels came down and sang the hymns. I'm sorry. I know I think different, but as I was reading this, I thought, what hymns would it have been? &gt;&gt; You imagine them poor guys that the rich wouldn't even speak to them. They would have nothing to do with them. And they're they're setting being entertained by angels. They were the audience to hear the songs at the king's birth. &gt;&gt; So if there's a choir director in the angelic band and him getting his stick or whatever they did and him said, \"All right, ready everybody ready on a capella now.\" Or they might have harps and horns. I'm not sure. Oh Lord have mercy. That'd kill a church of Christ, wouldn't it? Dear God, to think that instruments up in heaven. But there they say the the the shepherds around said, \"Where's the audience?\" You all are. &gt;&gt; But we've never even been to a concert. Most of the time we're not allowed to go in church cuz we we ain't got very good clothes. But today you are going to be serenated by the angelic host and you will hear hymns which have never been sang before. You imagine I'm just sitting there looking one said ain't this something? Can you believe this? Who we going to tell this to? Who in the world are we going to Nobody ever believe this is happening to us? I kind of feel the same way. Sometimes they'll choose that. Who in the world we going to tell this to? We trying to tell them. They look at us and think, \"Yeah, right.\" You know, like he got five heads. What in the world? You people think y'all Yeah, right. Uh-huh. You know what? What you been drinking? Better watch that guy. He's got that blue Kool-Aid. Oh, no. This is kind of purple. You better watch him. He'll be handing that Kool-Aid. I'm the only one that drinks here. &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't hand out this cup. So, if it's going to kill anybody, it's going to kill me. But they look at us and think, \"Oh, come on now.\" You imagine them guys think, \"Is this happening?\" Right. &gt;&gt; Are are we really invited into the presence of angels? &gt;&gt; Could it be true since it's the very day you took your first breath of life on the earth? God had an angel assigned to you. &gt;&gt; And another one which looks like you before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Remember when Peter was in jail and wrote and went to the door, they prayed that God would set him free and God set him free and then they didn't believe God answered their prayers. &gt;&gt; Remember that in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; So poor Roa goes to the door and Peter knocks on the door and I mean she just about has a spell. She goes back to town. Peter's at the door. They said, \"You're crazy.\" &gt;&gt; She's telling them their prayers are answered. Said, \"God ain't answering our prayers already. Don't tell us that girl.\" But you know what they said? &gt;&gt; It is his angel. &gt;&gt; Because they believed each person had an angel that looked like them. &gt;&gt; Yes. So they thought Peter had died and it was his angel. Listen to this. The angels themselves were lights that had showed the word of God. They had the word of God and told them, \"Today in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior.\" The angels had the word and the word came by light to guide. They followed the word of the angels to eternal life. And I say I may I say unto you tonight, we're getting closer to the Christmas time so-called. And we know the scripture says that they come and said we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. But let me update that. &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the west. And we have come to worship him, &gt;&gt; not the star. &gt;&gt; Anybody that says we worship William Brandham is a liar &gt;&gt; and will go to hell &gt;&gt; if they do not repent of such nonsense. &gt;&gt; We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. We worship the Lord Jesus. You're fixing to see me in a little bit. Baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus. He is our God. But we have seen his star in the west and we come to worship him, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus, not the messenger. [applause] Let me close. You haven't listened to this one in a while. You ought to listen to it. Why it had to be shepherds. Notice God is fixing to make another creation. He's creating mortal earth, mortal life. Angels sing in heaven. But here he's creating a new life, eternal life for man. [laughter] And he's singing to his subjects through angels. Did not the prophet of the Old Testament say, \"I will sing unto you.\" &gt;&gt; Here was God singing to shepherds, through angels. He's singing to his subjects through angels on the earth, not in heaven. Heaven had eternal life. And he's saying, they sang to the heavens. And here the immortal creation is coming in. And now they're singing to earthly people the first time to shepherds. Striking, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He had started a new creation. What was it? A creation of himself. &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us. The Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God, God was created in human form and Jesus Christ his son. God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God with us. He built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that. You know what God is when you see Christ. &gt;&gt; Stand up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] One of these days he'll probably let us look back and see your mother was carrying you in the womb. The doctor said he or she will never live or never survive. There's something going on this is that and the other. You might as well get ready for it. But God had ordained you to be on this earth to express his love. Elelliana sent here tonight when Erica was carrying her and Emma. The doctor gave us all kinds of bad reports. Wasn't sure that Ellie would ever live. the way they were conceived and the way their mama was carrying them. Emma was pulling a lot of the nutrients and things away from Ellie. Wasn't your fault, honey. You wasn't doing it on purpose. But we prayed and we believed and we trusted. No doubt the angel of the god of God come in. How many of you almost had a car wreck? You was heading so and so and something happened in the house and you was delayed five minutes and you got down the road and there was a tractor and trailer and people sprawled all over the road and the angel of God got in your way. &gt;&gt; All of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He sends his angels to prepare the way before us. Hallelujah. Remember this is your identity of who you are. You're more than a carnal man or woman. That's only this part. all night and all day. They watch over you. They care for you. That care doesn't mean they keep you from all trouble. But sometimes that care means they help you through the deepest and darkest trials of life. And in the middle of it, you look at it and think, I'll never be able to get through it. And you are actually talking the truth. But God gives you an angelic visitation. We'll get to it. But I found in setting more on on angels this week that the prophet says that there was actually angels of healing. Angels of healing. And he describes the angel that was sent down to the pool of Saleom. They would go there to the pool and the angel would get down in the water and he would trouble the water. And the word trouble there is bubble. So there's all kind of people laying around it and God would send this maybe the same angel in this certain season. We don't know how often and the first person inside that water would be healed. Aren't you glad we don't have to wait for the seasons to come? Hell &gt;&gt; remember the prophet talking about the two women that come to his meeting &gt;&gt; one of them had a real bad stomach trouble couldn't eat the other one had a tumor both of them was prayed for left off believed God kept having same old symptoms same old symptoms kept confessing the word by a strip some healed &gt;&gt; the one sister got up fixed the breakfast for her kids little oatmeal left over and she just felt She just felt a little something nudge her. Uhhuh. That's what I'm talking about. Eat that oatmeal. She thought if I do, it'll make me sick. It always burn my stomach. But she ate that oatmeal. Give it a little bit of time. Oh, now I It'll probably make me sick again just in a few minutes. It didn't do it. She ate a little more. She had a piece of toast and prophet said she got some eggs and did this and had a gastronomical jubilee. Her sister friend lived right down the road. They live in the same neighborhood. &gt;&gt; She had a tumor. So she went down to tell her sister friend about it. She knocked on the door and she heard that sister screaming and shouting and hollering. She just opened the door and went on in. She said, \"What's wrong? What's going on?\" She said that tumor fell off &gt;&gt; and she was shaking the sheets looking for it. &gt;&gt; And a man who had dealt with angels since he was a boy said the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; was just able to pass through their community that morning. And he said, \"Now what if they would have give up the night before? &gt;&gt; Then the angel would have went somewhere else.\" &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the angel of God having such a busy schedule? That's a faith church. You understand? For some churches, he's got plenty of time. &gt;&gt; They don't believe in miracles. They don't believe God can do that. We want to be the kind of church that we make our angels work overtime. &gt;&gt; They got to work on Sunday. They got to work on New Year's. They got to work on Christmas. They don't never get a holiday. [laughter] They don't never get a day off because we believe God. [screaming] We believe our God does the same thing that he's already done. He can never change. So the angel of the Lord passed by her house, healed her, passed by the other, and healed her, and kept right on going where going where? from one house to another to another looking for faith people, looking for Rahab people, looking for token people, looking for people that had their faith anointed by the spirit of God. And he had to make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Make a stop. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, children? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, thank you for allowing us, Lord, to live in this last day. It would have been an awesome time to live in the days of Noah. And if I'd been one of his sons, I'd have packed the pitch. and I like doing woodworking. So, no doubt I'd been in there working this and cutting that and sharpening that and doing something else. If I'd have lived in the days of Enoch, I'd have no doubt I'd been inside the pyramids and doing something else. And if I'd have lived in the days of Nehemiah, I'd been building the stones and reshaping this and that and the other. But you let me live in this day. I'm still a builder. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I know to try to take your word and help build a character in your people. Lord God, those that you've given to my charge to try to help build them into a stature of a perfect man, Lord. And many of these sons and daughters lived in the days of Noah that had got on board the ark. In the days of Nehemiah, they'd been right there helping. In the days of Luther, they'd believe justification. Days of Wesley, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the days of the Pentecostals. Because no matter what age you would have put us, we'd been believers. No question about it. Because that's who we were before the foundation of the world. Lord God, I pray you'd make us more conscious on the level, Father, that were called to walk into it. I'm not made to be able to deal in that realm that your prophet did. There may be men on the earth today that are called and privileged by you to deal in a realm with the angels of God and the supernatural and that sort of thing that I'll never be able to, Lord. But I want all that I can. I want everything that's in my ordained capacity. Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight, Father. We bless your name tonight, Father. Hallelujah. May the angels of God spread their wings over this place tonight and distill drops of salvation, if there's any that's lost. May those distilled drops of purity and holiness fall upon a heart. Lord, if there's any that's sick, may the heal the healing angels pass by this way tonight. Lord, I know there's so many needs among your children anymore. It becomes overwhelming and it may overwhelm me. It may overwhelm Brother Daryl. It may overwhelm us as mortals, but it don't overwhelm them angels if we'll just be patient. they will show up and they're looking for faith. Lord God, we want to live in the right community. I ain't talking about a certain subdivision here in this life in Johnson City. I'm talking about the community of the saints of God, seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. There's many sick among our people, Lord. Different ones fighting different things. Father, I'm asking you that you'll just be mindful of every one of them. Some streaming tonight, no doubt, have different needs in their body. May the angel of God pass by. Those that are sick at home, couldn't be in service. May the angels of God come this way tonight, Father. That one who troubled the water there that day, no doubt he's still troubling the water and troubling the devil, too, cuz he passes by and makes the tumors fall off. Hallelujah. He passes by and cures that stomach trouble. He takes care of the blood pressure. Whether it's high or low, makes him no difference. We're needy tonight, Father. May the angels of the Lord, I know they're here. It's your promise. It's your promise, Lord. Your prophet said there was something sacred about a church. As a matter of fact, he said it was his favorite place to preach. He preferred preaching in churches because he said around them auditoriums there was wicked angels. Wicked angels that hung around them auditoriums. But he said there was something special about a church. And he said it was his favorite place to be in church. Well, Lord, it's ours, too. &gt;&gt; It's ours, too. Oh, sure. You met us at Walmart. Oh, yeah. You You met us at Lowe's. You met me this morning, Lord. I want to thank you for it. You seen that text I got last night, Lord. And I was so troubled about it, and I didn't know how to answer it, Lord. It's just been weighing on me and weighing on me and I didn't know what to say exactly, but you visited me, Lord, and I thank you for it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Help the people to see this is not just a preacher privilege. You want to visit them as they're driving to work. The sisters as they're making beds and fixing breakfast. It ain't just the preachers that are loved. May each one of them be able to see tonight. The same angel could speak to every child of God here in this place and say, \"You are highly favored. You have found favor with God. We worship you tonight, Jesus. Oh, bless your name, Father. Sing a little something for us, Harris. We worship the Lord. We have a baptism tonight if they'll come and prepare for that. Brother Daryl, maybe you can come, brother, while they sing. And just give me a little bit of time to prepare. Ain't it been good to be in the house of God? [applause] &gt;&gt; How many of me wants to be more conscious of that world around you? Brother Donnie, I I couldn't stand an angel. I couldn't. Don't worry, friends. &gt;&gt; Mary probably thought the same thing. She had to be told, \"Fear not.\" And for most of us, we'll never have that happen to us. And a lot of your angelic visitations, more than likely, they will be invisible. They will come, they will do their work, and they will pull out of your sphere, and you'll be better, and you'll never see them. But I think I think why God is saying these things to us is that he wants us to know what's around us. But brother Donnie, we're no good and we're we're poor and we're Yeah, I understand why it had to be shepherds. We're not rich. We're [clears throat] not famous. We're not No. But you reckon they let that whole thing interrupt that singing? Oh, I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough. I I I can't I can't listen to this. My ears ain't holy enough. No, my hands ain't holy enough. No. No. But they had to accept what the angel said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he went to that cross, somehow God made me pay for my sins in his body. Then that's what your prophet said. Demonology part two, paragraph 199. And I think of how that when Jesus died, God sent him to hell because of his sins. But he never had any &gt;&gt; of his own. &gt;&gt; But he took yours &gt;&gt; and he took mine. And he took them so completely God judged him guilty of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The second Adam come to stand in proxy. The first Adam forfeited your eternal life. The second Adam brought it back to you. Don't you love him? Let's just worship it beloved together. Here we are [music] in your presence. [singing] [music] Lifting holy [singing] hands [music] to you. [music] Here [singing] we are [music] praising [singing] Jesus. [music] for [singing] the things [music] he's brought us through. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [music] Well, let's just worship you. Here [singing] we are [music] in [singing] your presence. We love you. Lifting holy [singing] hands to you. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we are praising [music] Jesus. [singing] for the things [music] [singing] he's brought us through. [music] Hallelujah. What a great honor. &gt;&gt; Our little brother has been so troubled about baptism. He said he couldn't wait till Sunday. He did not want to wait. &gt;&gt; I like it when God so gets a hold of somebody's heart, they can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what's going on? The angels are still working. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, what a great honor it is for us, Father. How we worship you and thank you. Thank you for dealing with our young children. Lord, we hear news all the time of a sevenyear-old, an 8-year-old, a 10year-old, all different ones shooting people, packing guns, doing all kinds of crazy stuff. The devil is going younger and younger to get his. Why would we want to limit you from doing the same thing? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'd deal with my little brother's heart. I can baptize him tonight in water, but only you can take his little soul and fill him with the Holy Ghost. Lord, &gt;&gt; may you be with him, Lord. Keep him by your grace. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus. My little brother, in obedience to his word, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] [applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, just something about a water baptism, it makes you want to do it again. [laughter] Amen. Aren't you glad to be a part of the economy of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you accept and believe what the angel has said about you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Luther's day, not Wesley's day, but your day, your time, your season, your hour, your manifestation of the word of God that's spoken concerning you. Amen. Every word of God will be manifested. &gt;&gt; None of his word will return unto him void. And we're a part of that word. Do you believe that this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can see why the devil tried to sting him with a wasp. Amen. That's some good preaching right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. May the Lord bless our precious brother Donnie and strengthen him and take care of that sting on his finger. We just love him tonight. Let's just sing one more before we go. Can we, brother Harry? Just whatever is on your heart, brother. [music] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints. Let's just sing this D.

Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? [music] Let's just bow our heads. Almighty God, [snorts] we Lord bow in your wonderful presence with thanksgiving in our hearts, oh Lord, for what thou has done for us, Lord. [snorts] And God, we are so grateful, Lord, that we can see [snorts] oursel in your word, Lord.

And oh God, we see, Lord, it's the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word in our bodies. Oh God, how we thank you for it, Lord. We thank you for this word of God that we've heard tonight Lord to see God how you have unfolded under our day dear God and we're so grateful in this age of the darkness of Leosa you have turned the light on dear Lord that we see your word that you have unveiled it unto us God with your children now dear God we pray bless them Lord as they work tomorrow and bring them Lord back safely this weekend we ask God for traveling grace as make our way down towards West Tennessee and Arkansas.

Thank you, Father, once again, for all that you've given us for we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. [snorts] And amen. God bless you, saints. You're dismissed. You know, if you're in the Lord, hasn't it been good to be in the house of God? You cause the sun [music] to rise. You lay it down [singing] to rest. You [music and singing] hold this heart of mine.

Sister Judy Davis asking for prayer. Abdominal abdominal pain uh very severe. She's just asking that we would remember her as we pray tonight. Brother Kirk Sacker says to please pray for a neighbor of ours who is suffering from head to toe with severe pain. Area physicians cannot find the cause. They sent him to Vanderbilt for further tests last Friday. He is waiting for the results from those tests. So they're asking that we would remember that prayer request tonight. Then we have a testimony from Sister Wanda Bman. Says, \"In April of this year, I had gone to the eye doctor to get new glasses. During the visit, I was told that I had cataracts. The doctor said to come back in one year and discuss surgery to remove them. In August, my vision changed again and the eye doctor referred me to a eye clinic for cataract surgery. This past Wednesday night, I went up for prayer to ask the Lord to remove the cataracts. On Thursday morning, I woke up and the cataracts were gone. All praise and honor to the Lord Jesus for his grace and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. You had a good testimony tonight. Amen. Urgent prayer requests for Sister Mary Beth Holloway. The Lord knows all about that need. We just committed unto the Lord. Sister Janet Paynees asking that we would uh pray for two of her grandsons who lost their coworker to suicide and the family uh has really been hit hard and pray for all that's concerned in that. So, we want to remember that prayer request tonight that the Lord would be mindful. Brother Greg Robbins is going to have surgery to remove his eye on Friday. He's been in a lot of pain due to his eye. Please pray that everything goes well. Please remember Sister Shirley in prayer as well. So, we certainly want to pray for those folks tonight. Brother Smith and Sister Diana Ward are not feeling well, unable to be in service. I want to pray for them tonight. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn Gagnan uh sent in a prayer request. She's having some difficulty with her pregnancy and they're just asking without going into a lot of detail, they're just asking that God would be mindful and let everything work out to her good. So, we just commit all that unto the Lord tonight. He's more than able to meet every need among us. Do you believe that tonight with all your heart? And then brother Bisc will be on this coming Sunday. I don't know exact the hour or the time or anything like that, but I I do know that it will be Sunday. So, we certainly want to pray for that family, that church family, that the Lord would just be mindful of all of those folks. And uh, Brother Bisco was a was a great hero of the faith. I believe that with all of my heart. So, we want to just remember all those folks in prayer. Uh, brother Michael says, \"If you want to help with the fall festival, signup sheets are in the library.\" So, remember that. And personal and business changes to the directory will be accepted in the library until Wednesday, October the 15th. So remember that all those announcements tonight. You have an unspoken prayer request tonight you'd like for this group to pray about. Could we stand to our feet? Let's sing that again. The course of that. I'm amazed that you love me. Are you amazed his love for you tonight? Somebody say it's the truth. Anyway, give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight if you love me with all your heart. I'm amazed that you love me.

Appreciate Brother Fred Perry, don't we? &gt;&gt; Good brother. Amen. Dave. Amen. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. No greater place to be than right here at this time. We could have been anywhere, but the Lord chose us and destinated us to be right here. So let's bow our heads and go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we once again we've been given the opportunity to come and sit in the house of God. Oh, it thrills my heart, Lord, to just to be able to say that I could come and sit in the house of God in this day and the hour that we live when such things going on around the world. We can say that we have a king that knelt before a cross in humility, but the father lifted him up in honor. And Lord, we want to do that tonight. We want to lift our hearts to you. Oh, that you could cleanse us, Lord, and help us, Lord, in these times that we have, Lord, our sicknesses and and pains and uh just the way human life is, Lord. But we know we are inheritors of miracles. We've heard one tonight, Lord. And we are inheritors of faith. We are the inheritors of all things only because you went down in humility and raised in honor. And we give you the glory and the power, Lord. We give you our lives, Lord. All things belong to you. And we're not here to fight for anything else. But what we want to fight for, Lord, is our surrender. That we could surrender our hearts and surrender our lives totally for you, Lord. Now, bless the service tonight, Lord. Bless the man of God as he comes. Let wisdom flow from his lips, Lord, that feeds our hearts, Lord, and gives us that uplifting power, Lord, that we need. fill us tonight, Lord. Whatever need we have, Lord, we know that we could come before you and you would answer those things, Lord. We have faith in you, Lord. Now, bless us, Lord, and help us, Lord, as we honor you tonight, Lord, with singing and praise. And let our lips be full of worship and the fruits of our lips be honored before you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come tonight, receive the evening offering, you give us unto the Lord. Once again, if you're a vist, God bless you. Now, what if you knew that tonight was your last night that you ever get to be in church and you'd ever get this opportunity to worship? &gt;&gt; Would you make it a good one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know it ain't? &gt;&gt; Let's sing with everything we got tonight. We want to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth, right? Somebody say, \"Praise the Lord.\" Give him one more good hand clap of praise tonight. Let's sing. After all this life is over. After all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And I stand upon the mountain top topped so tall looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing.

Say that I'm going to take a trip on the old gospel ship. Amen. Now the screens are for whatever reason they're not working. So we're going to sing something that all of you just know.

Now I'm going to take a trip on the old gospel ship. I'm going far beyond the sky. I'm going to shout and sing until the heavens ring while I be this world goodbye. Praise the Lord. You can be seated tonight. Give our singers a nice hand. Sister Adessa, if you want to sing, then the old people will sing. And then brother Caos, you want to sing? [Music] There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. And death it price. And when it fell down from the cross, my sins were gone. My sins for God. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life. And in three days he breathed again and rose to stand. in my defense. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he drives every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves, to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] There is a blood. His side is the blind. [Music] It heals the sick, the lonely fight. [Music] It has the power to free the bound has chains a fall [Music] upon the ground. Oh, pour it out to cleanse my soul and let it liquid. Gloryy flow [Music] because he lives to make me whole high. owe my life. [Music] I owe my all. And so I come to tell you he's alive to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to provail that he's coming back for you. Oh, what can wash away my sins? Nothing. Oh nothing. And what can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood. Nothing but the blood. So I come to tell you he's alive. to tell you that he tries every tear that falls. And so I come to tell you that he saves to shout and to proclaim that he's coming back for you. [Music] Mary is a blood [Music] that cost a life that paid my way. Death price. [Music] [Applause] Here's another song that uh Sister Betty wrote a long time ago. It seemed like the only people that request us to sing is other old people. I just don't get that. But that's the way it is. As long as you old people want to hear us sing, I guess we'll try to sing for you. Hope this song will bless you. It says, \"I'll soon be gone.\" Amen. [Music] When the darkness of this life is filled with sadness and our hearts are often troubled deep within. I stop and think of how our God looked down upon us. And by faith, he's lifted up where I can see. I'll soon be &gt;&gt; I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly till I home in the sky. There'll be no fears. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know the light of his presence is now with us. I have seen the amber light so bright and strong. It's brightest ray out shines the light of morning sunshine. I know is God assuring me I'll soon be gone. &gt;&gt; I'll soon I'll soon be gone. It won't be long till I fly to my home in the sky. There will be no fear. He'll dry my tears. One of these days with faith so strong, I'll soon be gone. One of these days with faith so strong I'll soon be gone. [Applause] I love to hear them sing. &gt;&gt; It's awesome to, you know, I grew up in Kentucky, a little bitty single wide trailer church, and I heard all these songs. Sister Geraldine, Sister Jackie, or Sister Betty. And you know, you you you hear the songs, but when you get to meet the person, you really see the life that made that song. It's just it's it's incredible. I love it. I pray this is a blessing. [Music] It's easy to bless you when the valleyies behind me. It's easy to trust you when my world is not unwinding. But this is the darkest midnight that I have ever seen. So I will stand my ground, lift my hands to you and sing. Before the prayer is answered. Before the battle's won. Before this trial is over. Before the healing comes. I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before in the lonely days of silence. [Music] When the waiting gets old, [Music] I've found a flame of worship. [Music] Keeps my heart from growing cold. You've always been so faithful when I can't do my part. Even in my worn out weakness, nothing changes who you are. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you, Lord. Lord, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before you ever for me. You knew I'd be here on my knees. You're the one who's fighting for me. And you know where this will lead. Before the prayer is answered, before the battle's won, before this trial is over, before the healing comes, I will choose to trust you. I will bless you Lord. I will praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] No, I won't wait to praise you after. I will praise you before. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of praise we want to have, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Not just wait till the prayer is even answered, but give him praise before it ever gets answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read tonight Genesis 24 verse 58. Trust everybody's doing well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Winning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not near as many of you winning. Are you winning? &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That's what we want to hear. Let's read together. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, \"Will thou go with this man?\" And she said, \"I will go.\" And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. Won't you notice the order? Who came first? [Music] &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Ah. And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. So you see the going away is not brother Brandham going to have a private resurrection and then brother Brandham's going to raise all the dead and we're going to have a tent meeting &gt;&gt; and people's going to get the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; that's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the final voice of the final age? &gt;&gt; The bride is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And they blessed Rebecca and said unto her, \"Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\" And Rebecca arose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went his way. I want to speak to you tonight on the bride's dowy. How many like to be remembered as we go before the Lord? Aren't you glad that our God, if there would be millions of people praying at this very instant, some need healing, some need financial blessing, some need a job, some need this, this, this. He could hear all of them at one time. and be sure and get your name on your package and then your neighbor wouldn't have to bring you a package because they delivered your package at their door and you got their package. But our God is so mighty and so wonderful that he can hear all of that at once and send each answer right directly on time to the right individual. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we so so love you tonight. We're just so thankful for everything that you mean to us, Lord. Oh God, as we gather here, Lord, it's not to magnify man, magnify a system, magnify some brotherhood, but we are here to worship and magnify you, Father. And we realize the more that we learn to do that, the more you will pull us into yourself. I find it to be phenomenal that the more we give to you, the more of yourself you give to us. I'm so grateful for that. It's no wonder to me that Satan has so many of the preachers out in religious worlds today just focusing constantly on the people, the people, the people, the people, the people. Because the devil knows if they ever magnify you and ever see who you are, what a thing it does. So I pray we would not be guilty of that. Lord, open our eyes tonight. That we can see you and the magnitude of your love by the gifts and the great treasures that you bestow upon your people. You saw all the hands are uplifted. We're just asking you that you'd be mindful of us tonight, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. The word sill you him. Sill you him. That's a Hebrew word for dowry. For us as westerners, the dowy doesn't really mean much of anything. But let me read it to you so you'll understand it. The dowy was given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life. It's also part of her inheritance. Let me read it to you again. Given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life, part of her inheritance. Now the dowy, the Bible here in Genesis of course doesn't mention it, but Rebecca actually would have been given a dowy not from Abraham, not from Isaac, but from her paternal and maternal parents, of course. And it would have included part of the fortune as far as what they had. It may have included things old and things new. Things that were more of a family inheritance, things that would have been a treasure to them and them only. Other people would look at and say, \"I wouldn't have that piece of junk. I don't know what that even is.\" But to that family, it would have been something very special. Now, she's going to leave with this man and depart. Never come back. Actually, never see them again. And yet they want to give her something from her parents that will be able to identify her in that lineage even though she will be so very far away. So the dowy was very very important. Now it's not just something in the past for some some marriages and some cultures and so on. They still do the same thing today. So they would give that then to the daughter because the daughter did not receive a divided portion of the inheritance when it come to land, cattle, sheep, oxen and so on. It was divided among the sons. And you remember one of the men in the Old Testament whenever Moses was there that they had to have a special hearing because the man had no sons. And then they went to God and God said, \"Well, because there is no sons, let the daughters have a part of it.\" But that was not the norm. The norm was that the sons would get it and the eldest son would get a double portion. So if you had seven sons, the inheritance was divided by eight, which meant the eldest son got two parts. But here now the dowy was something totally for the female only. No bridegroom got a dowy. That was not his. It was for the bride only. You know, as I begin to look at this, I've realized that the bride of Christ also has a dowy, something given to her from who? Not from her husband, but from her father. Now, we're in a very strange relationship as far as when it comes to our relation to deity. Now, let me explain it to you this way. Actually, our father had a son. Now that son was only a human embodiment or a human tabernacle by which the father could get into and create a blood and shed that blood so that he could redeem his people. Now that father is that great being of course that is light and his spirit and he was not a man but he gave to the world. He gave also to us of course his only begotten son. Now remember only begotten at that time. So he was the only begotten son at that time. And what was that? It was a human temple by which the father could dwell in in order to redeem and pay the price to bring us back. So here he plays two parts. So spirit God is our father and then the father himself gives birth to a son when before the foundation of the world but at that time he wasn't even a human he was the logos. So then he condescends from being the logos to becoming a human being. Now but we still have this wonderful relationship with spirit God which is our father. Now remember the body the human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. &gt;&gt; The human body of the Lord Jesus is not your father. As a matter of fact he wasn't his own father. The human body was a body of time that God created and it was his own body and he called it sunship. Now watch in though believers then are given gifts by the father to equip them for their new life and for their journey as they're heading to be able to meet their bridegroom. Read with me in Matthew 7 11. If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father, now notice the position from which these gifts are coming from? They say, \"What difference does it make?\" Oh, it makes all the difference in the world. You see, or if you were here and you were a gentile and you would have called out, \"Son of David, son of David, have mercy on me.\" You know what? you would have got absolutely nothing &gt;&gt; because you were claiming the wrong dispensational title. &gt;&gt; So you could only get from God and remember the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God. So that's why they can scream the name of Jesus in the day we're living in and hardly get nothing out of it. But it will be revealed in what he said the thunders. So when the voice of God makes his message known in every day, it will be the word interpreted for the age that the elect of God live in, they will be caught by that word. The others will pass right on by, join church, join religion, become religious, all that sort of thing, and miss it a million miles. But we don't want to do that, do we? &gt;&gt; Now notice then where the source of these great gifts come from. How much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? How many like to know tonight what your dowy a little bit of it includes? Well, if it's yours, wouldn't you want to know your sisters whenever you got married? Now, if your father would have said, \"Now, honey, whenever you get married, daddy's got something for you.\" I'll tell you what, daddy is going to give you a a surprise. It's going to be a gift. And your daddy was a wealthy man and you know, a man that was equipped to do it. And you'd be anxious, of course, thinking, \"Oh my, what's daddy going to give me? Is he going to give us a house? Is he going to give us $1,000, $10,000? What's dad going to give you?\" Well, let me just share with you tonight what our heavenly father has already given to us. It ain't going to be $1,000. It ain't going to be $10,000. As a matter of fact, it will be riches that you can't even think about without God helping you to do it. There will be so much of it that God will give to us just in this life. If this life contains so many beneficial blessings and great things of what he wants us to do, I cannot imagine what the world that is to come is going to be like. Now, let's look at and we'll start from the basic foundation of where we come to him. And let's look at being forgiven. Oh, aren't you glad you're forgiven tonight? Romans 4:7 saying, \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered, whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.\" Now, think of that old life that you used to live. Now, the downside is that us of human beings that we can still remember the wrongs that we've done. We can remember how bad they were, how terrible they were, how awful we felt when we done them. But there's one great thing I know. Our God remembers none of them against us. Thank God. Ephesians 4:32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ sake hath forgiven you. Now, this is why we are forgiven. It's not because we deserve it. It's not because we held our hands a certain way or we said certain words when we pray. God forgave you for Christ's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Colossians 2:13. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your hearts, has he quickened together not apart from him, but with him? Has he quickened together with him? You mean to tell me that I was already quickened before I was ever even born? You was already identified in the quickening power of God before you ever draw one breast in your human body. How can that be? What if Adam lost my inheritance before I was born? The second Adam regained my inheritance before I was born. Come on, somebody. Now, you realize it's the work of God and the grace of God that's done it. And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all, oh, praise God, all trespasses. Colossians 2:14, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us. Now, I want you to listen to this. I was so curious about these words. So, I've done a little research and got to looking at it and I found the meanings of this verse. I thought it's so awesome. I wanted to share it with you. The burdens, some requirements of the law have been abolished. And of course, it's superseded by the death of our Lord Jesus. But what it leads up to is the word handwriting signifies an acknowledgment signed by us that we owe a certain amount. Now the handwriting that was against us, we actually had to acknowledge it ourself. So here was all this debt. Here was all this that we've done and we had to acknowledge it and we had to take our own handwriting as it were and acknowledge I am guilty of this and this and this and this and this and God in that sense made us acknowledge it. You say, \"When, Brother Donnie, when did that happen?\" When you come to an altar and you begin to acknowledge, \"Lord God, I'm a low down rotten sinner. I've drunk. I've lied. I've stole. I've cheated. I've done this. Don't you understand what you was doing?\" Your own personal handwriting will say, \"I'm a sinner. I'm no good. I'm no count. If God don't help me, there ain't no hope for me.\" And God said, \"All right, now that you've signed it and you admit the bill is too large for you, this is what I am going to do for you in exchange.\" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. So he took all that we did by our personal acknowledgment and he took it from us and he took that oh glory to God that agreement that we said yep I deserve it I ain't no good I ain't worth even living oh my and he said I'll tell you what I'm going to do now I'm going to take that and I'm going to nail it to the cross what a peculiar way to say that remember it was the Lord for Jesus who was nailed to the cross and yet your sins being identified as being lost and wretched and he took that and nailed it to the cross. Why? Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the very righteousness of God in him. Listen little bride, this is part of your gallery. This is something that even after you get saved, it gives you hope because guess what? You're still going to fall flat on your face. You're still going to make mistakes. You're still going to mess up. &gt;&gt; But can't that same God who buried, oh, hallelujah, that died and buried and rose again? Cannot that same God that took that handwriting that was against you forgive you now to your sons and daughters of God? Oh, praise be to God. So, here is this massive sum on the bill that I owed all of this debt. My body, my soul, my temperament, my character, everything that I was was absolutely obligated to that. So, it brought me under the state of condemnation. The only thing he wanted me to do was acknowledge it. Just acknowledge it that you're lost, that you're wretched, that you cannot do it without me. And I will take it for you. I become that for you. But it will not do you any good until you acknowledge that you need a savior. Oh, no matter how great he is, how wonderful he is, he can only save you if you'll let him. He can only heal you tonight if you'll let him. He can only encourage you tonight. I wish somebody would preach with me. He can only encourage you. He can only lift you up. He can only be your peace, your joy, your satisfaction if you'll receive it from him. But if you won't let him, he can't do it. All of heaven, hallelujah, is at your disposal there. If you'll call upon his name and say, \"Lord, I am a member of your bride. It's part of my dowy.\" A dowry is not for you in the millennium. It's not for you at the marriage supper of the lamb. It's given to you for your journey from here to there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having spoiled principalities and powers. Oh, I love this. He made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it. Triumphing over them in it. Right in the middle of it. He triumphed over hell. 1 John 2:12, I wrote unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. Do you understand that? It brings glory to his name for every sinner that will accept him as their savior. Praise the Lord. Now, remember, of course, friends, that many folks will be saved that will not be bribed. Oh, of course there will. There'll be all kinds of people that'll be saved because they're trusting Jesus as their savior. I don't want him just to be my savior. I want him to be my Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people, oh yes, oh Lord, please save me. Save me from hell. But Lord, don't you tell me what I can live now. Don't you tell me what I can wear and I can't wear and I can't go here and I can't go there and now. Lord, don't tell me that. Well, you say they want him as savior, but they don't want him as Lord, but the bride wants him as Lord. I said the bride wants him as her Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice another gift now that the father wanted to impart to his children was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh my, how we appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm not talking about being baptized in your spirit, but I'm talking about your soul becoming illuminated by the very breath of God. The same breath of God that breathed into Adam was the very same breath of God that told the disciples and St. John receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed on them and a few days later the breast come into the upper room. &gt;&gt; So it was a delayed reaction but they caught up with it. Now the same Lord Jesus notice what he says in St. John 14:16. I will pray the father. I here's our Isaac now. I will pray to the father. Abraham in the type. I will pray to the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Now remember the disciples were hearing some of these things for their first time. And they were hearing talking about leaving and going away. I'm not sure they didn't want him to go away. But Jesus tells them here in St. John 14, it is expedient for you that I go away because if I don't go away, the comforter cannot come. What is it another person of the Godhead? No, it's actually the same person of the Godhead but in a different manifestation. One that the church could receive. We could not receive the corporal body of Jesus in our body. &gt;&gt; Well, if I got the corporal body of Jesus in my body, then none the rest you ain't got the Holy Ghost. or if you got it, I ain't got the Holy Ghost. But what's he going to do? Change himself. Now God is a spirit and God gave birth to a spirit son, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now notice Jesus saying that I will pray the father and the father will give you a comforter. Notice even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. So a person that comes up to receive salvation, they cannot receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; According to Jesus, &gt;&gt; I guess he knew more about it than preachers. What do you think? &gt;&gt; The world cannot receive the Holy Ghost, but the world can receive salvation. &gt;&gt; But not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is for a vessel that has come through a process. A sinner comes straight from the world. They come to the Lord Jesus, receive him as their savior. The process starts and many of them never go any further than being saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. So, the Holy Ghost is not just for saved people. It's for people who are saved and sanctified and they're cleansed and they're ready to receive a filling on the inside. So God don't bring a sinner up to the altar and that sinner smoking, drinking, lying, committing adultery, got all them demons inside their body and God filled that person with the Holy Ghost. Are you kidding me? God sharing that soul with demons. &gt;&gt; No way. So that person has to go through a purging, a cleansing, a sanctification process to receive the Holy Ghost. And who's Jesus speaking this to? to men who are finalizing their stage of sanctification, even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him ought not and knowice. Now notice so you mean you can't receive him if you don't know who he is. &gt;&gt; So what if you're taught he's a third person? &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't who he is. And if you don't see him as he is, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Tony, what about you? What about you? I turned Pentecost. Did you have the Holy Ghost? Oh, yeah. I had a baptism, &gt;&gt; but I didn't have the person. &gt;&gt; I shouted. I run. I jumped. I spoke in tongues. I preached. I prayed for sick and watch them get well. All kinds of things. And still preach false doctrine. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I was ignorant to it. I wasn't intentionally doing it. I was blind. Well, if I'd had the Holy Ghost in my soul according to Jesus, wouldn't that spirit of truth led me to the truth? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? The Lord Jesus himself, not his body, the pillar of fire coming back to break itself up. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you one thing, it's quite awesome. If you look in question answers 64, and you'll find the prophet of God saying, \"The same pillar of fire is on the earth today anointing sons of God to bring the word to the bride.\" It's absolutely phenomenal quote. Notice in St. John 14:18, I will not leave you comfortless. I &gt;&gt; will come to you. &gt;&gt; So you mean it's Jesus? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the upper room was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. But the Bible said that they saw tongues of fire. They didn't see the corporal body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What was it? spirit son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice little bride. Oh, let's open our little diary package tonight and see what's on the inside. What do you say? Here's another little thing that God wanted to give to to his daughter, the bride, who's going to be married to his son, the word. You see, the whole family is a word family. And God can designate what portion of the word that he wants the son to fulfill. He designates what portion of the word that he wants the bride to fulfill. And then he also designates the portion of the word that he himself will fulfill as father god. As father god's spirit form he could not die for us because the spirit cannot die. As father god he had no blood. So what did he do? He took that portion of the word and created a son and lived inside that son, that human body. Hallelujah. In order to pay the price, oh that we could be set free. &gt;&gt; Notice St. John again 14:27. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. How many of you all tonight will be honest and say you need more peace in your life? &gt;&gt; I understand we're living in a troubled world, are we not? &gt;&gt; We're living in a world when people will not even disagree politically or on, you know, different values of this and that and the other without trying to kill you. I'm sure you heard again today there was another uh sniper and they uh had shot at some ICE agents and it's it's the time that we're living at. Well, brother Darn, you think about that? Of course I do. My own life's been threatened many times. Do I think about it? Sure I think about it. But you know what I told Carol the other day? We can't live under the spirit of fear and thinking all, you know, oh my goodness, I can't get out. I can't go here. I can't go there. I will not live that way. God does not want me to live that way. How can I not live that way? Peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. I believe he brought me on the earth to serve his purpose. There ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough 30 odd sixes, 270s, whether they're Remington or whether be Magnum. There ain't enough cannons. There ain't enough whatever more to take me out of here until God is done with me. Come on, somebody. If I didn't believe that, I'd be mighty discouraged tonight. The way I look at it, if I'm flying on a 747 or whatever and that thing crashes, if it ain't the will of God for me to go, I'll be the only survivor out in the middle of the Himalayan mountains or wherever it is. And they're thinking, \"How in the world did that man live? I'll tell you how he lived because God wasn't done with him yet.\" And you and I need to get away from the fear that the devil controls our life and the devil numbers our days. No, he don't. He didn't bring me on the earth. He can't take me off the earth until God's done. Hallelujah. I am God almighty son and you are his child, his son or daughter. And the devil has to back off because God is the one who's in control of our lives. &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me tonight. I'm feeling a little Church of Christy. Amen. &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid. So you mean you and I have some control over our heart being troubled &gt;&gt; and being afraid. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romans 1:7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints, grace to you and peace from both Abraham and Isaac, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, to all that be in Rome. I I met a brother, let me share this with you. I met a brother in Switzerland and he come up to me. He couldn't speak English very well, but he had a younger guy there. He spoke English really well and he said, \"This is my this is my pastor and he he wants to invite you to Rome.\" So, I got a church in Rome. So, this this pastor, big tall guy, he told him, he said, \"Tell him to come and preach where Paul preached Rome.\" Well, I may never go to Rome to preach, but this scripture right here, even though I'm not a Roman, it's got my name wrote all over it. &gt;&gt; What about us? Some of you Indiana people, Tennessee people, Arkansas people, is this scripture just good for the Roman brothers and sisters, or is it good for us as a people of God? to all that be in Rome. Notice how he directs to beloved. Beloved of God, not just loved, not just love. Beloved is a higher degree of love, special one who is worthy of grace. Chew on that a while. Oh my. Beloved of God, called to be saints. You're not just called to be saved. You're not just called to come up through the tribulation period. You're called to be saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace, amen, with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not peace from God now in this application, but peace with God. Why would he say it that way? Cuz we were born at war with God. &gt;&gt; We were born at war. Oh my. Aren't you glad you ain't at war with God no more? Oh my. I'd rather be at war with this world. I'd rather be at war with the devil. I'd rather be at war with demons every day of my life than to be at war with God. At one time, I was at war with God. All of you were too. You might as well say, \"Amen.\" But how in the world did I ever make peace? It was not me that made peace. It was my Isaac. It was my Isaac that paid the price. And he said, \"You don't have to no longer be at war with my father. I will make and tear down the middle wall of petition. And I will bring you both together, Father God and man. &gt;&gt; And I will be your shalom.\" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 15:13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Wow. Fill you with all joy and peace. I'm a believer. I'm a believer. Well, do you have joy and peace and you're believing? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the happiest person in the world. Well, let your face know about it. Rest of us, too. Okay. Oh, I'm so glad I'm saved. Thank God. I hope I die today. I'm so sick of this life. I'm so sick of it. And you got all joy and peace. You sorry dog. You ain't telling the truth. The devil's robbed you. Your diary is sat there. I mean, you got gold and riches and treasures and saffron and you've got needles of purple and blue and all kinds of things piling out of your diary chest. And you're sitting there all puffed up like a bullfog eating buckshot. And you're sitting there sad and down and depressed and weary. It's time that we rise up pride and say, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy. I'm sick of the devil stealing my children. I'm sick of the devil interrupting our home. Oh, hallelujah. I am grateful tonight that we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Now, the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. Brother Mike, I just seen you. That's the sneakiness preacher right there I've ever seen in my life. that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. Oh, Philippians 4:7. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The peace of God which passeth all understanding. Notice what's going to keep your hearts and your mind. The peace of God, brother Malca. That's your ability to quote scripture. Well, I I pay my tithes and and I go to church and and I pray for brother Donnie once every every now and then whenever I think about it and and I do kind deeds and I do this and no Lord, I ain't got no peace. That's not what that's not what does it. It's the power of God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Colossians 3:15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Look at the meaning of this word &gt;&gt; to be an umpire. to decide, determine, direct, &gt;&gt; control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You mean peace? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peace. The peace of God can be like an umpire. All right. So, the picture gets ready. &gt;&gt; He's doing them finger and all that whatever they do back there. Boy, he ready on. He whining her up. He's getting ready on. Boy, he sold that thing today. He boy said bow and the devil I I mean the pitcher said why he he struck out I that old boy it ain't in him to to hit a home run. Oh but it is. You see it's in us to hit a home run. Every member of the bride has a built-in mechanism to have a home run. Why? We come from home and we're going back and we're running on the way back. So we are doing a home run. We're not squatting. We're not sitting. We're not going to be pushed in a wheelchair. And they ain't going to roll us in on a stretcher somewhere. But the bride's doing a home run. So get out of our way, devil. And the peace of God is going to be the umpire in my heart. I may feel down, but the umpire says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory, but I don't feel it. You sure it wasn't a strike? I mean, I'm going to sit down if you want me to. I think I struck out. I think I I think I struck out. He said, \"You knucklehead you didn't ain't had but one throw at you. I don't know where you figured you struck out.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So the devil winds up another one. &gt;&gt; Boy, here comes that ball at 100, whatever it is. And you just know for get I'm struck out. I'm struck out now. And you're saying, \"Wow, you mean I'm still saved? Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wish we could let the umpire rule in our hearts.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you get up in the morning and you check your phone, you go look at all the texts and all the emails and, you know, all this and that and other all filled with all that negative stuff. Sometimes I wish uh some of us didn't even have a smartphone cuz it sure don't make us too much smarter, does it? Before we ever leave the house, we're so down and wore out and depressed and so much going on in this crazy world that we're living in and we let our phone control our hearts instead of the peace of God. You let your phone be your umpire. You let Fox News be your umpire. You let CNN be your umpire. I'll tell you one thing, you're letting the devil rob you, friends. Let the peace of God be your umpire. And listen to what he's saying. If he says walk, walk. [Applause] Well, the umpire is truthful. And the truth of it is tonight, he's telling us, some of us, that we're close to striking out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you done struck twice. You better listen to what the umpire is saying. He said, \"Boy, you better let me have control of your life. You better let me have control of your emotions. You better let me have control of your life. And let me be the umpire. I'll make the calls for you. And it's not dry calls. It's calls with power. &gt;&gt; If he says you're happy, well, I guess you ought to act like it. &gt;&gt; Let the peace of God rule &gt;&gt; in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body. And be ye &gt;&gt; sad and depressed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. What? &gt;&gt; Thankful. &gt;&gt; Thankful. Ain't that awesome? Now, if that wasn't enough, well, let me look over there. What is that? Oh my goodness. Let me reach down in there and pull out of that dowy box. Oh my goodness. Can that be true? Yeah. This little this little item in your diary is called we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10, for we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe God makes junk? &gt;&gt; Does God specialize in trash? Does God specialize in good for nothings? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All of us are known by our works. &gt;&gt; A sister that can bake and cook and you know, no matter what, if it's a country cook or whatever it is, she know that. Oh yeah, we're having a dinner. Be sure now and get sister so and so's beans. I'm telling you what, them beans are to die for. If Sister Angel Smith makes that chocolate cake, you stand right there in line. You get your cake. Somebody's going to bring that delish stuff and this and that and the other. Why? You're identified. If Sister Barbara brings some of them black cookies, oh man, alive. Them no bakes. I mean, get up there and get it. Boy, whenever we go to heaven, our fall festival here in a little bit. And some of y'all get in line. Boy, I'm going here. I'm going there. Oh yeah, brother so and so does that. They make them deer nuggets and they cut that up and they wrap that in that bacon. I'll tell you what, I'm slobbering right now thinking about it. Why? Because the worst. Now, what if it tasted like tar? What if it tasted like tarpentine with a little bit of sulfur and a little bit of apples, you know, asphalt on the side and you dip it over an oil? You know, you'd say, \"Don't never go to that booth. That stuff will make you sicker than a dog.\" You're identified by your works. You're identified by what you put out. Almighty God's reputation. If he does not produce a bride that is like himself, &gt;&gt; he is an absolute liar and failure. But I ain't worried about that happening. Are you? My God don't make no junk. He don't make no trash. He don't make hallelujah something that he cannot trust. My God will complete his work. [Applause] You see that stone column right there? That's my workmanship. You see this one? That's brother Dave Swanson's workmanship. Now, you study the way they're laid and you'll see I've got a style and he has a style. The sign out on the road, my style. Simon in the in the the fireplace over there, mine and his together. So you see, God is identified by his workmanship. So on the day of Pentecost, the great contractor come down himself and he said, \"Boy, I'm tell you one thing. Now these old boys, they're they're something. These boys are something, but just wait till I get done with them. Just wait till I get work done working on Peter. He is going to make me a fire brand like the devil ain't never heard nothing about it before. You wait till John gets the Holy Ghost. Him and James. I mean, they're the sons of thunder. I named them that. But boy, wait till they get the Holy Ghost. It'll turn John from a son of thunder into love itself. It'll totally transform John. It'll change Thaddius. It'll even change Mary. It'll change them all. Why? Because they are going to Lord have mercy. They're going to be my workmanship. And when I get done with them, even the angels of God will circle the earth with their heads bowed as they look at my work. [Music] So the astronomers say that there's over one setillion stars in the visible universe. So that's a one with 21 zeros. That's quite impressive, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I mean, I know y'all know the word septanian all the time. That's how much money you've got, right? &gt;&gt; If you're playing Monopoly, maybe. But that was not the height of his creation. The height was when he said, \"Let us make man in our image.\" And the prophet tells us that God wanted a world filled with sons and daughters. Now, he knew when he made this little blue dot and put it out in this Milky Way, and he knew that it would be one of the smallest. Had it been just a bit closer to the sun, it been too hot for life to survive. &gt;&gt; Had it been just a little farther away, it would have been too cold. But he placed it right in what they call the habitable zone. Habitable zone. So, they're spending all kinds of money trying to find another planet like this one. I I'll go ahead and tell them. I mean, NASA won't listen to me anyway, you know, but they're not going to find one. &gt;&gt; The Earth is the only planet whose name is in the book of life, &gt;&gt; which is the Bible. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Saturn, none of them are there. Why don't God throw this earth away and make another one? He cannot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this earth is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And remember, he come on the earth and took his own body out of the 16 elements &gt;&gt; of this earth. And the Lord God never had a permanent flesh body until Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now that body sits at the right hand of the spirit thrown universe there to make intercession for us. For we are his workmanship created. I was at the stone yard Monday getting some stone for a little bit of landscaping I've been doing over here at the church. And the guy there that he knows me and I bought quite a bit from him and he said, ' Do you know this man? I said, 'N no. And I I was over there picking up rocks one at a time. So this guy, they picked up a pallet and scooted it through on his truck and loaded it on the truck. Well, the guy that owned that truck, he come over to me and he said, \"I was going to tell you they do load them up. I said, \"Yeah, sir.\" And I was going to ask you, \"Was you holding your breath the whole time that's loading them up in the back of that brand new Ford truck of yours?\" And then the guy suddenly has said, \"Oh, he comes here all the time talking about me.\" He said, \"He's one picky fell. He goes out there in that yard and he picks them up one at a time and looks at him.\" Well, you see, I have something in my mind &gt;&gt; that I want it to look like. So, I finished most of it for the most part today. So, I was up here taking pictures of it and sending it to Carol. So, I get my phone down like this. I get as people pass by and said, \"That's the preacher.\" You imagine how the people are that go to church there. He's out there taking pictures of dirt. So this one had little green specks and that one had little silver and this one had this and that one had that. And I sent Carol a little caption down at the bottom of it. Handpicked rocks. And she answered back, \"That's the best kind.\" So you see that is a mirror of my work. That's my workmanship. Each of you are known by your word. Then how would we ever believe that God would have to settle for a faulty, flawed church that barely makes it to church once every now and then, and they can't quit overcoming sin and lying and all kinds of filthy habits. And the great creator has to settle for that. Well, I guess I just have to settle for that. &gt;&gt; No, sir. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. We are his making. And these virtues that we've been talking about for several several weeks, that's the creation unfolding in our lives. You see, we are his making. We are created by him and for him. Now, it's more than just the general sense of rocks and trees and cattle and all that sort of thing. But this is a new creation. Now, look at the word created. I about had a spell when I looked at this. We're created in Christ Jesus. And it means to make habitable. habitable to people, a place, a region, an island. Hence to found a city, a colony, a state, to form, shape, to completely change or transform. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for what? What? &gt;&gt; Good works. You see, this is why a person that really has the Holy Ghost, it's it's just as easy for them to do good works as it is an an evil person to do bad works. &gt;&gt; That's just their nature. Because their old nature has been annihilated and the workmanship of the almighty God has been recreated in their soul. You're quite something. You know that if you are born again, you are quite something. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Oh my. God ordained you and I to live a holy life. And the church said God ordained us to live a life of holiness &gt;&gt; and purity and separation. &gt;&gt; Now the word here that that Paul used to means to prepare beforehand is to predestinate or to appoint before it. It includes the idea of a previous determination or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. &gt;&gt; Ah, so if you want a certain result and you're dealing with old dirt bags, you better predetermine. &gt;&gt; There ain't no telling what you'll come out if you don't. So God said, \"Now this is going to be the greatness and the height of my creation. I will put my sons and daughters in mortal flesh. I will put them in that oil. I I I will put them in that and I will predestinate them. It is in my being. It is in my being to give me a purpose, a reason to be.\" I'll let you think on that for a minute. The previous preparation of the divine intention. You see, and Paul said that we should walk in them. Watch again. Ephesians chapter 2:1. Wherefore remember that ye being in time past, Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision, that at that time ye were without Christ. Oh my, remember that. I don't ever want to go back to that again. &gt;&gt; Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Oh my. and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to preach to you sometime on these two words, but now that's what I was, but now. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, &gt;&gt; who has made both one Jew and Gentile, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us. He is our peace. So the Lord Jesus died for both Jew and Gentile to make in them one new man. The new man, the new creation is what? The church. They could never do it under the Abrahamic covenant of the flesh. They could never do it under the covenant with Isaac, the covenant of Jacob. So it had to be a new covenant. A star would arise out of Jacob. A star would arise out of Jacob. not a man, not that would come down through Isaac's lineage, but a star from heaven would arise out of Jacob and he would have the scepter cuz the scepter would come and it would be whatever he would bring forth. Oh, glory to God. And he would come forth from between the feet. And what would he do? He would make in one new man. One new man called what? Jew, Gentile, the church. Oh Jesus became our shalom who has made both one form one church out of two different types of people Jews and Gentiles by abolishing the law of the covenant that was given by Moses which is only temporary only to last for a while. Notice in verse 15, chapter 2, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man. So here he comes to take within himself the Jewish law, the Jews take within himself and merge the Gentiles in himself. And then once they come in him, the product out of that the two become one &gt;&gt; called what? The church. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. For to make it himself of twain one new man, so making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in the one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace to you who were a far off, and to them that were nigh, Jew and Gentile. And through him we both have access. Here you go, little bride. Here are some more of your little dowy. Access the act of bringing to approach to God. That relationship with God whereby we are acceptable to him and have assurance that he is favorably disposed towards him, &gt;&gt; permitted to approach God through his name. Aren't you glad tonight? So here the Greek word here relates the word that Paul chose to use was someone seeking an audience of a great personage and an officer would go between the person seeking the audience and the one they're seeking the audience from. It was a person that was greatly trusted and one that had authority. And this deputy, this magistrate, this person mediator in our state would go between them and say, \"Sir, he wants to see you. He wants to see you.\" And I I want to sue you and say that I I think that you should see him. I think you should take time with him or with her and to help him that I I think that that they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. Oh, children, they are worthy of it. They are worthy of it. You imagine the book of Revelation, the worthy one saying to the church, \"For ye will walk with me in white, for ye are worthy.\" &gt;&gt; So here we come to the approach, not to a stern, angry God. And you've heard me tell it before when I was a trinitarian and I didn't know how to pray. And I'd pray to the father and I'd pray to the son. I'd pray to the holy ghost. And I go back, forget which one I'd prayed to. &gt;&gt; You think, \"Well, that's pretty far out.\" Well, brother Brandham said he used to think that God hated him and Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; He said till he found out that's the same person. &gt;&gt; So the wrath of God was swallowed up in the heart of the Lord Jesus. And he settled my account. My signature was on there. I said I was guilty. I agreed. I lied. I agreed. I'd done wrong. I agreed. I validated it with my own signature. He said, \"Sign it, Donnie, and let me have it.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ephesians 2:19. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers, alien from a person or a thing, without the knowledge of, without a share in, oh no. Oh my. Unheard of. One who receives and entertains, another hospitably, and who stays or lodges. You're no longer strangers and foreigners. One who lives in a place without the right of citizenship. That was me. Metaphorically without citizenship in God's kingdom. one who lives on earth as a stranger, a souljourer on earth of Christians whose fatherland is in heaven. You were strangers and foreigners, but now fellow citizens possessing the same citizenship with others. A fellow citizen of Gentiles is received into the communion of the saints of the people consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice this. fellow citizens with the saints and the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. Fitly framed together was a carpenter term. It meant to join together as a carpenter would join together the framework of a building. Oh, praise God. So, the materials are exactly cut by whom? God himself. So, we have some of the church that'll be like this. We'll have some preachers that'll preach this way, some that are preached that way, some that are preached the other way. Thank God for it. He knows exactly what to make. Is that right? So he does the same in your life as a lay person and God will take that and bring it all together. And what Paul identified in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth. Wow. What a strange building. This building is a growing building. growing high in faith and virtue and knowledge. &gt;&gt; Whoa. As far as number wise and all that close we get to the end, we ain't going to grow so much in number. I figure we're going to get smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; There'll be more and more that'll turn away. Not only that, we're getting more on the other side than we got left here. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But the building is growing. growing in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. The growth of the church is not measured by how many new people you get. &gt;&gt; I mean, go out and knock on people's doors and try to bring them to the message. We try to hand out, you know, doctrinal things and this and that. No, this this growth here, it's not so much the natural. In whom also ye are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit. In the book of Genesis, God walked with his people. But in Exodus, he decided to dwell with his people. Exodus 25:8 in the tabernacle also chapter 40:34 until Israel's sin caused the glory of God to leave the tabernacle. But then once again God appears on the earth in the body of Jesus, his own personal human temple, that the spirit of God could dwell in that structure. Let's read and I'll close your just momentarily. Ephesians 3:1, \"For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to youward, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four and few words, whereby that when you reach you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. Now, no doubt there were Christians in that day that was not concerned about the mystery of Christ. They just wanted to be saved, &gt;&gt; saved from hell, go to church, you know, do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Now, we know that had to be there because that church had already started riding. The white horse rider had already started riding and made a twin to the real identified church. So, they just thought, \"All you got to do is believe. You just believe and you accept it and that's it. But Paul said, \"Oh, no, no, no. There's much, much more. There's many mysteries here that if you're part of that elect, you'll enter into that great place with God, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. It is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body.\" Can you imagine now some of them Jews sitting there? &gt;&gt; Now Paul wrote this to the church in Ephesus which is mainly Gentiles. &gt;&gt; You imagine some of them Jews struggling but they ain't them. They ain't fit to sit with us. Wow. They men ain't even circumcised. Somebody told me they seen them eating barbecue pork. Lord have mercy. They eat eggs. Ah, I I can't believe they they they say they got the same thing we do. You imagine some of them had the office time ever was. And you hear Paul telling them, \"Look, brothers, they're heirs just like you are.\" Oh, don't you tell me that God spoke to Moses and God spoke to Abraham and God said, \"This is an everlasting covenant. How you going to break an everlasting covenant, Paul? You're a false prophet.\" He said, \"I'm telling you, brothers, it's a mystery. Will you show me where Moses said them Gentiles would come in? Paul, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let's take Paul to the Torah. Now, Paul, I want you to show me one scripture in the Torah that said he'd have a gentile bride and divorce Israel. Now, what would you done? You're first century believers. &gt;&gt; Some of you Jews, some of you Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And y'all come to Word of Life Church. And I stand up here to preach and I'm reading from Paul's books. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And putting it up on the screen. &gt;&gt; But now remember in that day to a lot of those people, they did not consider those books scripture. or sacred. &gt;&gt; But some of them did. &gt;&gt; They saw it and they realized Paul had things that Peter couldn't touch. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; Paul preached things James didn't understand one thing about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? It was given to a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So has it been in this day, and I thank God for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints. In this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unarchable riches of Christ. This word uncarchable means astonishing and boundless treasures of grace which God has given to us and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So in the heart of God was this secret counsel to make a people like himself. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; How many is grateful for your dowy? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Praise God. He is our peace. PE who has broken down every wall. Here our peace. His peace. He is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Let's sing it together now. Cast all your cares. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. Do you believe this tonight, children? He is our peace. Yes, he is. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. [Music] He is our peace. [Music] Check. He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down. Can we stand our feet now as we worship him together? Oh, thank you, Lord. He is our peace. [Music] He is our peace. Oh, he is our peace. who has broken down every wall. He is our Jesus. [Music] Whatever you need tonight, children, cast your cares on him. You're sick, you're weary, you're oppressed. Cast it on him. He bore it. He bore it for you. He is our king. Oh, cast all your cares on him. Lord, he cares for you. Oh, is our peace. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just close our eyes now. Can we just raise our hands? Play it, brothers. Let's just worship him now in your own way. Remember, you were one time without the Commonwealths of Israel. You were at war against God. Oh, but now not only are you just saved, but your bride called by him, chosen by him. You got a treasure box of a dowy filled with all kinds of good things. Gifts to encourage you along your way. Healing when you're sick. Oh, it's not little dime store trinkets that you'll pull out of there. He didn't go to big lots and catch it on special, but it cost him so much. Oh, hallelujah. Along your way this journey. Oh, cast all your cares on him. I know he cares for you. [Applause] He is our peace. My Lord, you are our king. [Applause] Oh, cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. He is our peace. He is our peace. I wonder how many you are tonight sick, got a need in your body, maybe a sickness, an affliction, something you're dealing with as believers, you're commissioned by God to lay hands on one another. Was down in the meetings in Kentucky with Brother Larry Hara this past weekend. Brother John Andy's did a great job. had some singing and a brother from India also there and I spoke a couple of services and at the end of the service I had the saints of God to lay their hands on one another. The anointing of God swept in that place. It was just wonderful what the Lord did. Brother Le calling me yesterday telling me of this one that was delivered. This one was healed. That one was delivered. Not not a preacher come up run them through a prayer line. Well, this famous preacher prayed for me. But saints of God lay their hand on one another. He said, \"Brother Donnie, I believe that's just going to be the the beginning of great things we're going to hear that our God's doing.\" You know what? You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; So, if you expect a Wednesday night service, well, we ain't going to do much. I guess we'll just kind of go to church and hang out a little bit. You can hang out if you want to. I come here to worship God. &gt;&gt; And where my God is, supernatural is always made manifest. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to lay hands on one another right now, would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, these are his words. These signs shall follow them that believe. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. Brother Daryl, come up here and pray for the people. Hallelujah. [Music] Lord God, we believe you, Father. Hallelujah Jesus. It's in your dowy children. You can take it to the bank as we say. It will not bounce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; this is who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we lay hands up on one another tonight, God, We exercise our God-given rights as believers, Lord. Believing, dear God, that heavens and earth will pass away, yet your word shall never fail, Lord. And Father God, it's written, they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And tonight, as sons and daughters of God, Lord, we exercise this right, God, to lay hands upon our brothers and upon our sisters, God. And we pray, God, in the name of Jesus, oh lamb of God, by that anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave. Hallelujah. And may it move, dear God, upon every need, upon every situation, God. Lord, may back trouble leave, may anxiety leave, may fear leave, may depression leave tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May every sickness leave the people tonight. For you are our portion, dear God. You are our healer, God. You are our sustainer tonight. And we receive it, dear God. The ABCs of our healing is to accept it and to believe it and confess it. And we confess tonight, you are our healer, Satan, by the authority given to us as sons and daughters of God. We rebuke you tonight. Come out of the people. You're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. We cast you down tonight by the power of the Holy Ghost that dwells within the hearts of the believers tonight. We receive it tonight. We accept it tonight. We confess it tonight. We are overcomers. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We are sons and daughters of God. And every devil, every demon, sickness, death, hell itself is under the feet of the believer. And we triumph with Christ tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. We are free. The blood of the lamb of God has made us free. I accept it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Boy, if you believe it tonight, raise your hand and accept it tonight. Raise your hand and reach. I challenge you to believe it in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.

Hallelujah. Let back pain leave. Let nerve pain leave. Let Hallelujah. Let cataracts leave the people's eyes. Let leave the people tonight. We're free. Lift up your hearts. Lift up your heads.

Oh, do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Daryl, I don't feel one thing. He never said, \"Did you feel it?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; But he said, \"Did you believe it?\" Yeah. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight? &gt;&gt; What an hour he's been given to us &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We've seen it so much, friends. We've seen it so much. You've seen God. You know, Jessica came through the house one time. She's about six years old. She got that feeding tube scar in her stomach and always told her she's special cuz she looks like a belly button. She has two belly buttons. I said, \"You're special. You got two belly buttons.\" And she went on through the house playing, just playing, you know, just six-year-old, something like that. And I was sitting at the table praying and studying Genesis 24. And I said, 'Lord, if you've done so much for her, it would be a sin for me to doubt that you couldn't take that scar off of her body. And friends, he has done so much for us, this body of believers. Is that not true? &gt;&gt; It would be a sin for us to doubt that God couldn't touch something in my life. &gt;&gt; I said, I know you could take that scar from her. And this anointing, just this warm feeling come over me. voice spoke to my heart said, \"I could take that scar from her, but I left it so that every time you see it, it'll remind you of where I brought her from.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad where he's brought us from tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; He don't remember that you ever done it, but you remember. But I wonder sometimes if we don't remember, is that to remind us of where he brought us from? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Have you enjoyed the word of God tonight? Amen. Praise the Lord. Me and Sher's leaving in the morning for Galina, Missouri for some meetings starting out there tomorrow night and have to be at the airport at 5:00. So, we desire your prayers, the Lord, just give us traveling grace and bless the meetings. We'll have a prayer line, I think, on Saturday night. So, we certainly appreciate your your prayers and we certainly appreciate brother Donnie, don't we? What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man of God. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the close of a another service, Lord, once again, oh God, have you come, Lord, and stirred our hearts. Once again, Lord, have you anointed your servant, Brother Donnie, to bring us precious words of life. And we are so grateful and we are so thankful. And Lord, tonight as a body of believers, we laid hands upon one another. And Father, I'm reminded of what your prophet told us, Lord, that if angels laid hands upon us, it would do us no good unless we accepted it. Accepted what you done. And Lord, tonight in the name of Jesus, we accept dear God that this means the way Lord of your anointing to flow from one to the other as believers laying hands. And Father, we accept that tonight as your word, Lord, and you said your word will not fail. So Lord, we accept tonight as our brothers and our sisters laid hands up on us that it was thy will being done in our lives, Lord. and we accept that which we have need of in the name of Jesus. Lord, go with your people now. Give them traveling grace and be with us tomorrow as we travel, Lord, and keep our family safe at home till we return. And we love you, Lord. We thank you once again for all that you've done for us, Lord. Be people now, Father. Renew the strength of Brother Donnie. We pray others, Lord, who was streaming tonight, not here. We pray, oh God, may the anointing go just where they're at right now, Lord, and lift that affliction off of them in the name of Jesus. That Lord, by the rising of three sons, may they know that they have been in your presence, that you have done that work in their life. Grant it, Lord, we pray as we commit these things into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. You're dismissing the fear of the Lord. Remember the service this weekend.

I'm just a sign [music and singing] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; It's easy [music] to see I'm a simple man that fits the glove [music] of a wondering soul that just didn't know about God's love. But now I've seen the light [music] because he's opened my eyes from the darkness. I've been set free. Now for the rest of my days, I [music] just want to stay kneeling at my Savior's feet. I'm [music and singing] just a sign of the cross. Not [music and singing] perfect, just redeemed. You see, I once [music] was lost, but God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I've done, it's all God's son hanging [music and singing] on Calvar's tree. Jesus made my call. I'm just a sign of the cross. Nothing I've done. [singing] It's all [music] God's son hanging on Calvar's tree. Jesus paid my cost. I just decided [music] the cross. Yeah, he [singing] paid my cost. I'm just a side [music] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, &gt;&gt; you remember the little boy coming down the street one day and he went inside the bar and he told the owner. He said, \"Sir, your sign's down.\" So he walks out there and looks at it and said, \"Sunny.\" Took his rag and polishes his sign. He said, \"You must be mistaken. My sign's not down.\" He said, \"But I mean your best sign.\" And the drunk was laying in the gutter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody's a sign today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sign of grace. Sign of mercy, sign of forgiveness. I want to be a sign of God's love and mercy. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a baby dedication today. Brother Jake and Sister Lydia, if they'll bring a little baby girl, we'll dedicate her to the Lord today. Praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Bring them [singing] in.

Oh, ain't that a beautiful little thing? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great gift that you've given to my brother and sister. With it comes such an awesome responsibility. I believe they are willing today to assume that responsibility to be able to take their little daughter to raise her in a way the best to their ability that would please you. We know that our children much of what they will become in life is greatly affected by us as parents and adults that affect them. So I pray Lord Jesus that your grace would be upon her. Lord if time should get should have enough time and get old enough. May her heart be surrendered to you when she's young before the evil days come upon her. I pray for her mother the fifth gospel. Help her Lord Jesus to be able to influence her. I pray for her father. May she be able to see a godly man, a man that loves Jesus. May she be able to hear prayers and music and all sorts of godly input in her life. Keep her from the evils of the day and the darkness of the hour that we're living in. Lord Jesus, I dedicate her life to you today for a life service in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Congratulations. [applause] Can we stand together? Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Let's bow our heads together as we pray over the word today. Heavenly Father, we believe what we have read here today are your great words. You inspired men that they would be able to write the Bible. We know and are able to hear as we turn from page to page, chapter to chapter, book to book that these words are not the words of mere mortal men. their thoughts from a great creator, the only one who could put such things together. Then we call on you today to help us. It'll take your same inspiration to help us to believe it. And then once we believe it, to listen to it and to accept it and live it. For we know that our lives need to be daily sermons, constant sermons after we become Christians, that we're living a life that is pleasing to you. Speak to us today once again from your word. Father, we ask in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. [clears throat] So happy we could be together today. Aren't you glad to be able to come to church? &gt;&gt; What a great privilege it is for us as the people of God. And what an honor it is to be able to assemble ourselves together in in his in his presence. But not only in his presence, but actually in one another's presence. What a great thing it is for people to understand. I realize for a lot of people, church is just going to church. It's a social thing. they don't really get that much out of it. Uh they go to see one another, visit one another, exchange their business ideas and different things like that of what they've done during the week. But I'm so grateful that God is God of people who understand why we go to church and the reason of it. And well, you know, we've been looking at it and I want to go back that way just a little bit today on the attribute and the aspect of godliness. And God loves to go to church himself. God loves to be where his children are, where his people are that he can be able to assemble together with them in order to do things for them. Because the way God looks at it, there's always been special places on the earth that have been set aside for his honor and his glory. The most fought over city on the face of the earth. Jerusalem been taken over and over again. Conquered by every man, every potentate that was coming to take the east. They always wanted Jerusalem as a prize. Still is today. The most sought out place that has ever been on the face of the earth. Why? Because God loves it so much. And we know then that there's a spiritual answering to that, a parallel to that of us being able to come together in the house of God. Whether it's a place like this, this size, whether it be this size over here, u God does not so much impressed by whether there's stained glass windows and gold on the altar, whether there's fine fancy woodwork. What what really gets God's attention is when people come together with a divine purpose, that is to worship him. to worship him and to hear from him that they can see their shortcomings and find out how to be better people. How many came for that reason today? And we know the Lord Jesus himself actually went to church whenever he was here on the earth. And he never found an actual ideal church whenever he was here. You can imagine living now in the first century. So they had synagogues. So Jesus went to the synagogue at Capernium and I told you Carol and I stood there several years ago and they had dug down several feet and found that original Roman era synagogue and they just recently found another city there called Basadia where Peter and Andrew and them different ones are from and it's quite an amazing thing when you think that the Lord Jesus would have went to such a place that was far from imperfect. Nobody ever got saved. Nobody ever got healed. Nobody ever got delivered. But Jesus went to church anyhow, which is a pretty good example, I think, for us as his children. I don't mind telling you before we go further into this today that there would that would be a real difficult time for me to go to some churches and make that my home church. If there was churches that was teaching ideology that was contrary to the word of God, it would be very hard for me to go there. I I don't mind. I'll go a little farther. It would be hard for me to go to some message churches and make them my home church because some of them are so far off of the beaten paths of the word of God. But I will say this, and I was thinking about it earlier this morning. I'm just so grateful that God has allowed us to be able to have a place where we can come together, worship him, see God, not only read about what God did, but see God doing the same things that he's always done. And I trust that we always count that a great honor. In Luke 4:1 16, speaking of Jesus, he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and as his custom was. Now, Luke wasn't actually there, of course, at the birth of the Lord Jesus. And Luke wasn't one of the original 12. Luke actually came in years afterwards. So, Luke must have found this out. Part of it by divine inspiration, but part of it by going around and talking to people that was around Jesus. So Luke had found this out somehow that it was the custom of the Lord Jesus to go to church. So it wasn't something that Jesus visited, you know, twice a year, three times a year, but a custom was something that you do over and over and over again. Now, can you imagine going to church over and over and over and over and over again? You saw nobody healed, nobody saved, nobody delivered, but you kept on going anyhow. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Now, you see, Jesus went because he knew there was one good thing that he could get out of the service. He heard the word being read. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, would that be worth it to us to get up, get ready, and drive to church just to hear the word be read? &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, you see what that shows me? It shows me that Jesus had a reverence and an honor and a sacredness for church that most of us don't have. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; The sacredness was knowing God's word was going to be there and that it was going to be read. But many folks go to church out of selfish ideas. What am I going to get? What am I going to take from the service? How am I going to be helped? Are they going to sing my songs? My favorite preacher going to preach? And church really ain't about God. And it's not really about them ministering to others. It's about will the service suit them &gt;&gt; and will their favorite people and I hope sister so and so is wearing that dress and I hope brother Donnie wears that suit I like. And you know is brother Donnie preaching today? Oh, I hope he is because if he ain't there, I'm not sure I can get anything. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is going to be read and the preacher, you may not get five five words out of what he has to say, but if he reads one scripture, you ought to be saying, \"Boy, wasn't that scripture awesome? Wasn't them quotes he read, wasn't that absolutely awesome? Wasn't it wonderful to shake the saints of God's hands? Wasn't it something to be there?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I think sometimes we need a little bit instruction maybe on church. Now, I want you to listen to this. I love the way the prophet said this. He says, \"And I say you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets her soul on fire. There's no signing cards. God's in their heart. God, he loves to worship.\" Amen. God's in their heart. God goes to church. He loves to worship. Now, I read this one and the next one I'm fixing to read you the last time we spoke on this, but it's so good. Now, you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline of the church, how we behave oursel in the church of God. But of course this quote cannot apply to you if you don't come to church &gt;&gt; because the tapes was not on how to behave yourself in your house &gt;&gt; but how you behave yourself in church. So this is one quote that a lot of the message people will never have to worry fulfilling will they since they don't come to church &gt;&gt; and they see no need in it. &gt;&gt; Oh my praise the Lord. Now watch this. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we got to come together here together and set together in heavenly places. Got to Got to &gt;&gt; don't stay home. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me how people say they believe this is the voice of God on these tapes. And I'll tell you what, they are liars. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about people that ain't got a church in their community to go to. I ain't talking about people that are invalid and people that are sick that their desire is to be in the house of God. I'm talking about people that could go and won't go. &gt;&gt; They're liars. &gt;&gt; I do not care what their name is. I don't care how long they've been in the message. And they say this is the voice of God. They are liars. And all liars go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. and word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, tell us the truth. Brother Donnie, if God is in your heart, you see that's the problem. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can you imagine if you get into sports, baseball, basketball, whatever your deal is about sports and all that. My goodness, in Tennessee is playing, we'll say Tennessee is playing against Kentucky AND BOY, YOU'RE THERE for Tennessee and and then the Mayo, you get a free ticket. You and your wife and your youngans all get free tickets and you don't know how you got them. and you get free tickets and you've got the best place in the building or coliseum or whatever it is. I don't know anything about all that stuff, but you get all that and you're say, \"Well, should we go? Honey, what do you think? I hate to go there. There ain't no telling how many homosexuals will be there. There ain't no telling how many perverts, how many liars, how many people drinking beer, smoking cigarette, chewing tobaca, cursing, lying. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to go, do you, honey? But it's Tennessee against Wildcats, you know, and they said this is the biggest game of the year and and they give us these free tickets, but it would be an ungodly atmosphere for us to go. Some of y'all as guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all's blushing. I ain't seen you blush in a while. Would you let the homosexuals, the adulterers, the liars, the perverters keep you from that ball game? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, you do let them keep you from going to Walmart, right? &gt;&gt; So, all of you now, you order your groceries from Walmart cuz it's such an ungodly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And yet, if people won't speak to us, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; We don't like this, we don't go to church. We don't like that, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it. And the Lord Jesus purchased tickets for every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be held accountable for not using your ticket. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder to get in there and fellowship with your brother. So you see, going to church is not just about God in the sense of you hearing the word and you just worshiping him and you just singing to him. It's also about fellowship &gt;&gt; with your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time you got to praying. Cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Notice this message entitled the token. &gt;&gt; We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. &gt;&gt; Notice the title token. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. &gt;&gt; Not just with you and God, &gt;&gt; but with you and your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been missing brother Louie and Sister Glenda Sabath. &gt;&gt; Weren't y'all glad to see him up here today? [applause] There ought to be something in us godly. Notice again in who is Jesus, we should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not of forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. It'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you and your strengths will strengthen the church. Can't you see why Satan don't want people to go to church? &gt;&gt; So, your strengths will strengthen me. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you rob me. And you rob those around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not only robbing yourself, you're robbing us. &gt;&gt; How many robbers will there be in heaven? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Wow, man. This makes me want to have a church revival. All right. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this in question answers. You see, when the prophet went to Arizona, there was a bunch of the message people that moved out there with him. But he didn't start a church. &gt;&gt; So, the people had the tapes, they had the books, but they also had the prophet himself. but they didn't have a church to go to. Now, a lot of people would think that was the ideal setting, but I want you to listen what happened to those message people that were in that setting. Now, I know a lot of times I speak of the Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think that that lets you loose to do anything you want to do. A fellow the other day, I said, \"Did you go to church?\" He said, \"I went hunting. The man's wife come to me and she's coming from the laundromat on Sunday. I said, \"Why didn't you go to church?\" She said, \"I done my washing.\" I said, \"You shouldn't have done that.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is supposed to be the voice of God on tape. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, she said, \"I'm not an old legalist.\" I said, &gt;&gt; \"But I saw you were a Christian.\" &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice this is a message woman &gt;&gt; and they're there around the prophet himself. But because they didn't have a church to go to, it started working on their attitude. &gt;&gt; Now watch, when you lose the sacredness of church and you lose the sacredness of his presence, you also start losing the sacredness of the resurrection. You see, don't never forget one of the reasons that we come to church on Sunday is to honor the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So when you don't do that and you see no need to do it, you start actually dishonoring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it goes to losing its value. Now he said, \"But I thought you were a Christian.\" She see I said, \"Do you know you're putting a stumbling block in somebody's way?\" &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe this and I don't have to do those things. I'm not a legalist. Well, but look, my brother, sister, look here. Paul said, \"If eating meat puts a stumbling block in my brother's way, I'll eat meat no more as long as the world stands.\" Right. &gt;&gt; And I think that'd be a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Now watch. So brother Perry Green and many of you know the history of the message, how it come about there in the west. Brother Perry Green went there and there was assembly of God church and they merged together with another church. So it left this building vacant and empty. Brother Green goes in there and starts a church. Now brother Brandham comes and he wants him in the dedication part. So this is his subject that he deals with and notice his title. What house will you build for me? And now that brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service and take every place that we can. I wonder why brother Brandham didn't turn it into a tape only church. Now, if that was the perfect way and that was God's provided way, as we're hearing it said over and over and over again now, that this is God's way for us to hear tapes only, then wonder why Brother Brandham was not the founder of that move. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't. &gt;&gt; The founding of that was not God's prophet, &gt;&gt; cuz he was a scriptural prophet. And if this message come to turn our hearts back to the original faith, do you think they sat at home and read Paul's books? &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Donnie. Do you think they sat at home and looked one another, you know, and just said, \"What are you going to do today?\" Well, I'm going over to the coliseum to watch the games. &gt;&gt; I'm going here. I'm going there. They went to church. &gt;&gt; Even though in the first century it could have cost them their life. But they went anyway, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that he's encouraging the messaged people at that time what to do about this church. If we are asked and called on to pray, to seek, to do, let's be soldiers. Let's be anxious to do it. Keep the message &gt;&gt; honorable. &gt;&gt; Amen. and live the right kind of life. Don't let no smut. &gt;&gt; It's sad a lot of message people never read this quote &gt;&gt; or they never believed it after they read it. Don't let no smut come upon it. We're living too late now. We're too late in the hour. Let's live it clean. Anybody agree with that today? &gt;&gt; My life, your life, all of our lives need to be picked up before God. Now watch. He's going to tell us what the message people had got into in that Tucson area with no church to go to. &gt;&gt; Our young people just ride around from place to place, show to show, &gt;&gt; right? message people &gt;&gt; and they had not just the tapes, not just the books, the prophet of God was there with them, too. &gt;&gt; And this is what they had got into. Why church didn't mean nothing. Well, brother Brandham made a preaching. I ain't going I ain't going that old ASSEMBLY OF GOD. I AIN'T going here. I ain't going there. And little did they know, Satan was taking the preciousness of honoring the resurrection away from them. &gt;&gt; So the women went to the laundromat. The men went hunting on Sunday. The kids rode around on their bicycles and went from show to show to show. And they're trying to tell everybody, \"YOU WANT WHAT I GOT? Y'ALL are blind. Y'all a bunch of leans. You got to come AND FOLLOW US.\" WELL, WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH? WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GOING TO CHURCH. WE GO TO the laundromat. And you think you're a light &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my young people just ride around from place to place, from show to show and drifting further and further away &gt;&gt; from God. Notice he didn't say from the tapes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say from the prophet. &gt;&gt; From God. Now that's the truth. I see it in my children. &gt;&gt; So you mean the Brandom family was not exempt from drifting &gt;&gt; because they didn't have a church? &gt;&gt; Oh, you ain't going to hear this preached by very many. I know you're certainly not going to hear this promoted from headquarters, but I'm called to preach all the message. [applause] I ain't cutting no corners for nobody. It's time that we fess up. Do we believe this is the truth or are we a bunch of rotten, sorry hypocrites? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many message preachers run across across this very quote and they will not read it cuz they don't want to cause nobody hurt feelings? Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings either, but I'd rather hurt your feelings now than for you to go to hell and you point your finger at me and God say, \"You're guilty, preacher.\" [applause] Mhm. Oh my. I see it in my children. COME ON, PROPHET OF GOD, BE HONEST WITH US. &gt;&gt; I see it &gt;&gt; myself. You mean brother Brandham needed Harry to go to church? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? Praise God. Does this sound like a hypocrite to you? Does this sound like a guy that's trying to hide things from you? This guy exposed his own family and exposed himself. &gt;&gt; I can follow such a man. You've got to assemble yourselves together TO WORSHIP GOD. THE BIBLE said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see this day approach and that much more come together. If there's only two people there, &gt;&gt; you be one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we come together and worship together, then we're just something another about it. Jesus said, \"Well, there's two or three gathered in my name, there I am in their midst.\" &gt;&gt; Trying to do God a service. He's in Freeport now. But this time, people had already began to misunderstand things that Brother Random had said. So he he was calling the people out from from systems and denominations and people were taking quotes that he said remember this is about a year after what he said in question answer 64 and you're in 3 months something like that four months so he had already picked up on it that it was starting to follow the followers of the message that the followers of the message thought well they don't need to go to church they don't have to go to church so they were isolating quotes and pulling them out and saying Well, brother Brandham said, \"Come out of church. Come out of church.\" Now, watch what God's having him to say. This is just a month and a half or so, or a month actually before he he's taken from the earth. The handwriting is on the wall. The second coming is at hand. The bride is being chosen, watered out. Now, that don't mean draw out from church. Now, watch. It's amazing that now he's going to insert this just a little while before he leaves the earth. Why? The spirit of God has already brought his attention to it that some of the message people are taking these quotes and they're making it sound like you don't need to go to church no more. So the Holy Ghost said, \"Let's go ahead and take care of this before you leave.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Not draw out from church. That means draw out from denominationalism. &gt;&gt; You must go to church. Everybody read this together with me now on three. One, two, three. You must go to church. &gt;&gt; Now, your own voice is on God's recording. &gt;&gt; Now, it just won't be me you'll hear at the day of judgment, but you'll hear yourself. I can quit now if y'all want me to, but I got a lot more [applause] &gt;&gt; now. YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH, BUT DON'T JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION. JESUS WENT &gt;&gt; all the organizations, &gt;&gt; but he never joined a one of them, &gt;&gt; MODERN EVENTS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE CHURCH. WOW. I want you to go to church. Don't forsake to assemble yourself together. But what I'm trying to tell you to do is press into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; now let's change. In order to be godly, we have to love what God loves and we have to hate what God hates. Now, this is a little bit, you know, this this would be a little bit difficult maybe for some people, but there are things that God absolutely hates. &gt;&gt; He despises. Now before we go on into this, let me reassure you that God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. &gt;&gt; God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. But there are some things that God detests, and it's actually an abomination to him. Read with me in Psalms 45:6. And this is a messianic psalm of the [clears throat] Old Testament. Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. I'd like to preach these couple of verses to you sometime on a separate thing. But thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. This is a messianic psalm. And David is actually calling the Messiah God. This is one of the scriptures that the rabbis use. And when they believe that the Messiah will be God himself. So he said, \"Thy throne, oh God.\" So he's calling the Messiah God. Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. Therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. So the Messiah hates wickedness. I mean believes he hates sin. He hates ungodliness. All right. Now then if we are going to be like God, we must also be like God in love and in hatred. But we cannot hate upon our feelings being hurt by this certain individual or that individual and then we express hatred toward them out of hurt feelings or disappointment. There's only one source by which hatred can be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's from a godly heart. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. The only way you and I can hate sin in the right way is when our heart is right before God. Because if we're not careful every time, we will lump the sin with the sinner and we'll throw the baby out with the bathwater and we will develop something against the individual. And even though they may repent and make the situation right, we will never let it go in our mind. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought going to church quotes was tough? You ain't heard nothing yet. But see, God is able and has the capability of being able to hate the sin. Oh, it's so vile in his sight. And yet, if the sinner repents of that sin, then God no longer holds that past against them. We need help to be able to do likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, watch. This is part of God's character, not dealing with angels, but dealing with humans. And we need to be godly, not only dealing with God, but godly dealing with our brothers and sisters and godly dealing with the lost world. Read with me in Proverbsap 6:1 16. Now I want you to listen to these things carefully. [snorts] These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an abomination unto him. It do you good to keep these verses real close to you. &gt;&gt; A proud look. &gt;&gt; It might be safer for me to go back in my office and finish this sermon. &gt;&gt; So, six things that God hates. Yay. Seven are an abomination. Now, it's one thing for God to hate a thing and then for it to move into the abominable aspect of God looking at it as an abomination. So, God hates a proud look, &gt;&gt; a lying tongue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll pay everybody a penny a piece for amens from this point on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all must not have no lunch money. These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay. S seven are an abomination unto him. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's more than one way you can kill people. And you don't kill them necessarily in this day with a knife or a gun, but you kill their influence. You tell lies on them. You tell things to bring down their character. &gt;&gt; Oh my. A proud look, a lying tongue. I want you to notice he's not mentioning anything about homosexuality. &gt;&gt; And yet homosexuality is an abomination. Do you understand? A lying tongue is an abomination. Just like two men getting married, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; An abomination. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; an heart that devisth wicked imagination. So then a heart, notice he doesn't say a mind, but a heart. Why? Because out of the heart, Jesus picks this up in the New Testament. Out of the heart proceedth wicked, evil imaginations and on and on and on. You remember the the scripture. So a heart that would devise wicked imagination. So they think and they ponder over snares and over difficulties and over things that will cause people to to stumble. Now this is an abomination to God. Feet that be swift in running to mischief. So people then that they're fast. They're not slow held back by. They're just quick and doing what they can to to bring trouble and cause all kinds of heartaches and difficulties. That is an abomination to God. And you know what's difficult about it is some of these people right here might have long hair. They may wear long dresses. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are here as message preachers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Any of you business brothers hiring this week? I might lose my job after today. Ah, a false witness that speaketh lies. So, A PERSON SAYING, \"BROTHER DAVE SWANSON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE THIS AND brother Maddie, he done that and that.\" And boy, brother Dave Swanson. Oh my. I'll tell you one thing. Do you understand? If you are bearing lies. &gt;&gt; Now, you might not have even made up the lie, &gt;&gt; but you're carrying somebody else's lie. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible tells us to be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. A lot of our motor mouths &gt;&gt; need to shut up. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; a false witness that beareth wise, and he that sweth discord among brethren, &gt;&gt; an abomination to God. God actually hates these things. &gt;&gt; So a person that would try to go amongst our church or go amongst a a family and so discord, &gt;&gt; do you understand the way God feels about that? &gt;&gt; He hates it. &gt;&gt; Let you know wherever church splitting preacher stands then. &gt;&gt; Now I guess the question is how do you feel about him? So we love we love abominations if we love these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'd say the fell down at the Baptist church down the road got more amens than I got this morning. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 1:14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hatest. They are a trouble. This is God talking now. Unto me. I am weary to bear them. And yet the new moons and the feast were things he gave them. &gt;&gt; So they were doing things that God gave them to do. But now God says, \"I hate it. I HATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\" WHY, LANCE? You imagine they could come back and say, \"But God, it's in your word. Your prophet said at the new moon and the Sabbath and and the feast to have a feast and dance before me and do what?\" How could you do that? &gt;&gt; Because they lost the sacredness of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just become ritual and routine. &gt;&gt; I don't want church to become that for us. I know some of you have wondered for years and years and other preachers have even asked me about it. Brother Donnie, why don't you have communion once a month? Cuz I've been to some of the churches who have communion once a month and I've seen the way they take it and it's no more than a ritual. &gt;&gt; It's like picking up a peanut butter cracker and drinking a glass of Kool-Aid to some of them. I do not want that. I am not going to have it in our church. I'll have it three times a year, four times a year, every other year. And if it gets to a spot to where that it's just common and ritual, we don't understand how sacred this is. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THE PROPHET SAID, I just finished a study this week. 342 times that the prophet uses the word sacred. 40some different times. Sacredness. Ah, I was overwhelmed by the things that I found. sacred desk, sacred pullpit, sacred word, sacred moment, sacred gifts, all the things that he said was sacred. As I studied them, I realized how that that element of sacredness is leaving our ranks. Oh, may God help us. That going to church will ALWAYS BE SACRED. THAT SINGING, clapping our hands, hearing the word read, oh my, living a Christian life, honoring the resurrection WILL ALWAYS BE SACRED. BECAUSE IF NOT, IF IN TIME GOES ON, GOD WILL SAY TO SOME OF THE MESSAGE PEOPLE, I HATE I HATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. &gt;&gt; I HATE YOUR DEDICATING BABIES. I HATE THE WATER BAPTISMS. I HATE YOUR COMMUNION SERVICES. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU ARE DOING IT WITH no feeling, no love. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God even told him, \"Your sacrifices are going to stink &gt;&gt; and my nose.\" &gt;&gt; Zechariah 8:1 17. Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath. For all these things that I hate, sayeth the Lord. Malachi 2:15, therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. Now remember marriage and divorce is very rampant at the end of the Old Testament age. The Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away. You know how God feels about divorce? He hates it. &gt;&gt; But in the age we live in. Yeah. Whatever. I made a mistake. I changed my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Lord of mercy. If you get any choir, the seats is going to start crying out. My my. For one coverth violence with his garments, sayaith the Lord of hosts. Therefore, take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously. Now, hate is a it's a difficult subject in studying. It's a difficult subject in bringing it together. AND YET, GOD WANTS HIS children to hate certain things. Notice my words. Things. Certain things. In Revelation 2:6, but thou but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Now notice how that this church that this is written to in the church age that they were displaying godliness and God wanted to make note of it because it meant so much to him. I can tell by the look of most of you on your face that you're puzzled by this. You think why? Why would that matter? Because to be like God is more than just hair and dress and jumping up and down and shouting. It's loving what God loves, hating what God hates. &gt;&gt; And God God wanted these people to know he was proud of them because they had moved into this attribute which very few ever will that they hate what God hates. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOTICE God amened their godly attribute. HERE IS GOD SAYING back to them, \"Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE DOING RIGHT. YOU HATE NOTICE GOD DOESN'T say they hated the nickelans.\" Now remember this was people in this first church age which had already got under this thing and the prophet says they wanted to get away with that fanatical bunch of Christians speaking in tongues and all that sort of thing. BUT IT WAS ALSO THE ministry the CLERGY THAT WAS TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF God out of the people and make them the big man. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. BUT GOD WANTED EVERY PERSON in the church to HAVE HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT IT TODAY IN THIS MESSAGE FOR THE PASTORS AND THE PREACHERS to be the only one that God hears and the only one that God loves. God loves you and God wants to dwell IN YOU. GOD WANTS TO HEAR YOUR PRAYER. GOD WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR soul just AS REAL AS HE DOES THE GREATEST preacher in this message. &gt;&gt; SO NOTICE GOD amens now hate. Ain't that strange? [snorts] But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Verse 15. SO HAST THOU ALSO THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. NOW NOTICE we move to another church age. So it went from deeds. So they just kind of started among the people trying to divide them and separate them and pull them off to their little agenda. &gt;&gt; And God called it deeds. But already the saints of God, full of the Holy Ghost, THAT'S OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT ain't right. That's off the word. They're trying to pull people off the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this verse, God didn't comment them because they loved. But God commented because they hated, &gt;&gt; not people. &gt;&gt; So hast thou also THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. So now it moves to the doctrinal stage of the nicicoatans which thing I hate. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice in this church age by the time it comes to them, God don't say to this bunch of overcomers that you all hate it too. But God said, \"So hast thou also them that hold.\" So now by this church age they had let some of them people come among them. &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT AMEN THEIR ACTION. BUT GOD IS TELLING THEM HIS GODLY VIEW. I HATE THIS THING. HOW CAN YOU all tolerate it &gt;&gt; and put your arm around their neck and hug them and oh praise God. God said I hate this thing. But you all have it among you. &gt;&gt; So God hated their deeds AND THEIR DOCTRINE. YOU SEE, GOD HATES [snorts] THE character and the ways of the wicked. And the feelings OF ALL OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUS, godly people are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:3. AND I HATED ESAU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Romans 9:13. AS IT IS WRITTEN, JACOB HAVE I LOVED, but Esau have I hated. Now you see the problem is that we when we read such scriptures we evaluate this word by the way we understand hate. &gt;&gt; So we think God hates like me. Uh-uh. No he does not. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not hate the way humans hate. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even mean what you think it does. &gt;&gt; Genesis 29:29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilha his handmade to be her maid. And he Jacob went in also unto Rachel. And he loved also Rachel more &gt;&gt; than Leah. and served him yet seven other years. But notice the key now to verse 30 is in actually verse 31. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated. Now wait a minute. Verse 30 didn't say that Jacob hated her. &gt;&gt; It said that he loved Rachel more. Now, I want you to keep in mind now the way God had Moses to write it. SO, WITH A GODLY hatred in the way that God looks at people and God say, \"I love you. I hate you. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I HATE YOU.\" GOD CAN SAY, \"I LOVE YOU.\" But then God can look at others and say, \"But I love you more.\" Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And God noted this in Genesis and said, let me read it to you again. And he went also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, or in other words, loved less, &gt;&gt; there you go, friends. Godly hatred does not hate like humans. It does not corrupt the heart. It is never reacting out of selfishness and vindictiveness at all. IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THE HEART OF the recipient, the one who has it. When they hate evil, it actually burdens them. It actually breaks the HEART FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE bound in wickedness and idolatry and sin. Now, we've all no doubt heard preachers preach from the pull pit. And ain't a question in my mind, some of them have preached out of hatred. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they ain't no question about they've been flat mad. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't mad at the devil. Sometimes it's mad at me. sometimes is mad at you. Sometimes he's mad at somebody else. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you know it as well as I know it that a preacher can stand up there and burn your hide. But you know that if that man loves you, he's doing that because of the love of God in his heart. You know that, right? You've experienced that. And then you've known others and you just felt like they throw this at you and throw that at you and you just felt some ain't right about that. Some just ain't right about it. And a lot of times it ain't right. They may be saying the truth, BUT IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE. THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT OF human anger, human vindictiveness. AND WHENEVER GOD SAYS, \"I HATE THIS AND I HATE THAT.\" IT'S NOT FROM A HUMAN anger that God is mad. You are you broke MY WORD. YOU STEPPED ON MY WORD. I WANT TO GET BACK AT YOU. NO, THAT'S THE WAY US HUMANS DOES. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS, \"I hate,\" he says, \"I want you to be better.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be changed. So God loved Jacob more than he did Esau. Now watch this. In Luke 14 26, the words of the Lord Jesus himself. If any man will come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters. So you mean the requirement to be a Christian is to hate your daddy, hate your mother, hate your wife, hate your children. Oh, I saw the light come over some of you. Praise the Lord. You're smiling now, Brother Danny. Thank God. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If any man COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS FATHER, NOW LET'S TAKE IT LITERALLY JUST LIKE JESUS said it. In order to be a Christian, YOU GOT TO HATE EVERYBODY around you. I know some people that sure would fulfill that easy enough. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And they ain't a Christian a bit more than the devil is. &gt;&gt; You know why? They can't do it from a godly heart. Jesus is not teaching us to hate OUR FATHER. JESUS IS NOT TEACHING TEACHING US TO HATE OUR MOTHER. HE'S teaching us to love them less. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God's word. Don't you? Oh my. &gt;&gt; If any man come to me AND HATE NOT HIS father and mother and wife and children and BRETHREN AND SISTERS, YAY, AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO, he cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Matthew 10:37, he that loveth father or mother. You see, this is one of the great things about God having four gospels. &gt;&gt; For those of you that never really studied your Bible that much, you'd be surprised how many of these same instances are written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And all four of them will say it a little bit different way. and they're recalling the same story. &gt;&gt; Well, come on now. Folks have left the message for doing that. And I've sent quotes to a bunch of them in scriptures and told them if they don't quit believing the Bible, they're a bunch of hypocrites. Cuz the Bible is wrote the exact same way. &gt;&gt; Now, here, I want you to notice this. Now, Matthew is writing the same instance, but notice how he phrases it. He that loveth father or mother more [groaning] &gt;&gt; than me. &gt;&gt; How many love yourself here today? DIDN'T YOU ALL HEAR WHAT I SAID ABOUT LYING TONGUES? How many love yourself? I'm putting my hand up cuz I do. There ain't nothing wrong with ME LOVING MYSELF &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I DON'T LOVE ME more than I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS ME TO LOVE MY SISTERS, my brothers, my family. I love my MOTHER AND MY FATHER AND both of them are gone. I still love them. I love people that don't love me. And there's nothing wrong with that. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE WANTS ME TO. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO LOVE ANYONE more than him. SO WE SAY, WELL, I HATE MYSELF. AND THE TRUTH of that is yes. And in our language of scriptural meaning and understanding, it simply means I love myself less. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SAY GOD HATES EVERYBODY BUT THE BRIDE. THAT'S contrary to the Bible. The Lord Jesus, the very heart of God in John 3:16 says this, \"God so &gt;&gt; loved, &gt;&gt; not hated. &gt;&gt; GOD so loved the bride, [screaming] the world, THE WORLD. GOD HATES THEIR SIN. HE HATES THEIR FAIL.\" But God loves them. IT'S NOT EVEN HIS WILL THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, BECAUSE OUR MESSAGE IS SUCH A MESSAGE OF SEPARATION AND ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD, WE WILL NOT EVEN LET OUR LIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. I AIN'T GETTING AROUND THAT BUNCH OF DEVILS. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF Baptists and men wear shorts. THEY DO THIS, THAT, THE OTHER. WELL, LET YOUR LIGHT SOUL SHINE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR LIFE. BROTHER DONN, IS IT OKAY TO LOVE THEM? BY [screaming] ALL MEANS, LOVE THEM. LOVE THE DRUNK ON THE STREET. LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOST WITHOUT GOD. LET THEM KNOW THE REAL LOVE of God. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, devil. Thank you. Notice Psalm 139:22. I hate them with perfect hatred. Praise the Lord. Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; All of our nurses standing post supposed to do now. I HATE THEM WITH PERFECT HATRED. I count them mine enemies. YOU SEE, A perfect hatred of evil can only proceed from a heart which loves those that are in that sin and filth and debauchery. AND YET HUMANS WILL TRY TO USE THIS scripture and justify their hatred for people who've hurt them &gt;&gt; and say, \"Well, David said he had a perfect hatred. I HATE THIS BROTHER.\" I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE LEFT my church. This man done this. THIS WOMAN DON'T I I HATE HIM. IT'S A perfect hatred. Don't sound perfect to me. I mean, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have thought perfect hatred would cause you to bust your teeth with your goodness. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It cannot be perfect if it doesn't proceed from a heart filled with love &gt;&gt; for those people who've done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many has been hurt by people? &gt;&gt; This is the most honest y'all have been all morning. I figured I'd get you somewhere. How many's been hurt by people? So, you're going to ride all people off then, right? &gt;&gt; What? How many's been hurt by preachers? I put my leg up, too. Yep. I do the other one, too, but I can't spread ride that part. OH, HOW MANY BEEN HURT, LET DOWN, DISAPPOINTED? WE ALL HAVE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SHALL NEVER BE HURT AGAIN. AND you realize who you're robbing the most by that attitude? Yourself. &gt;&gt; SURE, WE'VE BEEN HURT BY PEOPLE. SURE, WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN BY PEOPLE. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME GOOD, GODLY people left in this world. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN HURT BY PREACHERS, LET DOWN BY PREACHERS. SO HAVE I. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME MEN OF GOD IN THIS WORD THAT STILL LOVES THE LORD JESUS WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS. BUT KEEP IN MIND, EVERY PREACHER, I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE IS A work in progress. Amen. &gt;&gt; Read with me in Galatians 5:1 19 and we'll start closing down. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred. So you mean God would put human hatred right next to witchcraft? &gt;&gt; Yeah. and idolatry and emulation and wraths and strife and seditions and hearsay. So God cannot hate with this kind of hate. &gt;&gt; Can y'all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's see if you can amen this. Then God don't want you to. &gt;&gt; It's not godly. to hate people &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; It's ungodly. &gt;&gt; Our hair, our dress, we don't go here, we don't go there, we don't do that. Oh, that's well and good. But what good does all of that do if you've got a heart full of hate? Amen. &gt;&gt; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, reings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a terrible thing &gt;&gt; to go to church for years of your life and have a heart full of this type of hatred &gt;&gt; and wind up being lost. &gt;&gt; This is serious. Yes. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9, he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; is in darkness even until now. &gt;&gt; He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother. So there is a way apparently that a person can absolutely hate their brother and be convinced that they're right with God. He that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness. So he behaves his mannerism is in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. You see it's the type of hatred that Satan wants in our hearts. It would be a similar hatred that Iran has for Israel. &gt;&gt; Just in the last six months, they have sent over a billion dollars to Hezbollah in the country of Lebanon to build up their arms to try to destroy Israel. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS sending it to Hamas, to the other in Fatada, the other different groups. Why? Because they hate Israel so bad. And yet Iran is fixing to have to evacuate their capital city of Thrron, which holds millions of people, because they have no water. Look, I I realize I'm not the smartest kid on the block, but you think, why didn't they take some of that money and figure out how to do desalination plants or pump water from here to there to there? But it's like they are obsessed &gt;&gt; with destroying Israel. And I like what I heard Marco Rubio say a little while back as he was standing under a portion of the Temple Mount where archaeologists have put big Ibeams of steel and dug down and found the original steps where the people would come from the pool of Sylum and go up to the temple. AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD THERE AND he said, \"Where are all those nations who tried to destroy Israel?\" &gt;&gt; The Romans, he said, \"Their kingdom has been annihilated. THE ASSYRIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. THE BABYLONIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. &gt;&gt; And there's one people left, the people of Israel.\" Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; But you see WHAT HATRED WILL DO? HATRED WILL DRIVE people to annihilate themselves &gt;&gt; because they hate this entity OR THIS GROUP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOT NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF THOSE who've left the message, they have such a hatred FOR GOD'S PROPHET. THEY HAVE SUCH A HATRED FOR THIS MESSAGE AND SUCH A HATRED for you who follow it and a hatred for the preachers. Some of them hate me so terribly. They would kill me &gt;&gt; if they could get BY WITH IT. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU THIS WAY. IF I WAS THINKING ABOUT leaving the message, and I ain't, I certainly wouldn't go to none OF THEM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE more of God in their lives. I see less than what they had when they was among us. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE PREACHERS that have left and preaching and saying and doing the things they're doing and they want to win me. They want to win you. THEY WANT US TO FOLLOW THEM. AND WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET SO UNDER HATRED, YOU LOOK AT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ARE UNDER THIS HATRED. for the Jews and they can hate him till they burn turn blue in the face and bury every one of them. And when there is no more Iran, Israel is still the chosen nation of God. AND WHEN OH MY ALL THE MESSAGE FIGHTERS AND ALL THE MESSAGE HATERS DIE, GO MY TO THEIR PLACE WHEREVER THAT WILL BE AND THEY STAND BEFORE GOD. DON'T WORRY LITTLE CHILDREN. ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORD WILL CATCH YOUR SOUL OUT OF HERE. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF HATRED. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF VARIANCE AND STRIFE, BUT out of love. &gt;&gt; The stand [applause] first John 3:15, \"Whosoever hateth his brother &gt;&gt; is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 20. And if a man say, [snorts] \"I love God,\" and hateth his brother, he is a &gt;&gt; liar. &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? How many wants to be godly? &gt;&gt; Love the things God loves &gt;&gt; and hates the things that God hates. &gt;&gt; And look at things that are sin and evil and wrong and out of a heart of love. Brother Malachi, not vengeance, vindictiveness, but out of a heart of love. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today, Lord, I realize this has not been a sermon that made us all probably really happy and they just want to get up and run around the building. Probably most of us wanted to crawl out. Father, we we want to thank you for truth. &gt;&gt; We desire, Lord Jesus, that we can be godly. I'm sure like me, these people have been overwhelmed, all this that we've looked at under the attribute of godliness. But we thank you for it, Father. For truly we desire to be godly. Lord Jesus, I ask you that you'd help each man, woman, boy, and girl. May we search our hearts. I know some of them, Lord, have been so hurt by people and disappointed and let down, and they've been through so many things. as I sat back in the office and whenever I counsel them and hear the terrible things that many of them have been through, not only these people, but ones I've had to talk to around the world, they've experienced heartbreaking things. But yet, Lord Jesus, we believe that your power can so come into our lives that it helps us instead of being harsh, mean, full of hatred, vindictive, we can be forgiving, loving, gentle, and kind. Father, we want to hate the deeds of the nickelans, but yet love them. We don't want to be like that church age as time went on into another church age. And then when it become doctrine, God could not say to the people of that age, you hate it cuz I hate it. But God said, you have. So they had allowed the doctrine of the nickelans. And God had to separate himself from where the church was standing. And God let them know, I hate that thing, but it's easy to see you don't. You've embraced it. Maybe under the disguise of love. But how can it be true love when we love something that you hate? You hate discord. You hate division, telling lies, spreading gossip. You hate all these things, Lord. So, how can we embrace them and say, \"Well, it's the work of God. Oh, yes, God is doing this and doing that.\" When God himself says, \"Don't identify me with that. I hate that.\" So, how is it, Lord, that we can embrace so many this compromising spirit comes in the ranks of our message? And like Israel, we'll let the Amorites live and the Hittites live and the Jebusites live. It started with just one of the small tribes and then it grew from one to the other to the other until before long in their ranks were unbelievers, infidels, agnostics, marrying among them. What a sad thing. It won't be but a few more settings of the sun. We can already see it, Lord. As I see preacher friends of mine that they don't believe this that the prophet taught and some don't believe that that he taught and some don't believe this that he taught. Well, this this was just an idea in the 50s and the 60s and brother Brandham was under this influence of this and that and the other. I never thought I'd ever live to hear such words comes out of message men's mouths, but here we are. So, Father, we pray you'd help us &gt;&gt; to stay true. And then, Lord, we we admit we need your help. How do we treat those brothers who say such things? How do we treat them? When we see the prophet teaching this, this, this, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, and they do it and they bless it and say it's of God, then how do we treat them? Do we shun them? Do we stay away from them? Do we not speak to them anymore? Or do we disagree with what they're doing and still pray for them and love them from our heart? We need you, Lord. David faced the same thing. It's easy to stand when a bear is charging against you and and raise up against him and take his life. A lion charges against you and you pick up a piece of armament and you take his life. But how do you deal with King Saul? A man who is the anointed of the Lord. A man who is a king chosen by God himself. Teach us, Lord. We know David slipped into the cave and just cut a small piece of his garment off just to let Saul know how close it got to him. And the Bible says his heart smoteed him. &gt;&gt; We need help, Lord, to know how to deal with the times that we're in. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't mind telling you, Lord, I'm shocked and surprised by some of the things I hear some of the message preachers saying and doing. We just need your help cuz we don't want to compromise, Lord God. Neither do we want to get to a spot we think we're the only just us and four more and no more. That's all. No, Lord. We don't want that old ecclesiastical thing. &gt;&gt; Teach us, Jesus. We love you, Father. with all of our hearts, praise the Lord. I wonder how many of you today would just with your heads still bowed, please raise your hand to the Lord and say, \"Lord, I I I need help. I I realize, Lord, maybe I've been I've been supporting things and standing with things just that you hate. It makes me feel awful, Lord. makes me feel awful. I want to be right. Lord, teach us. God bless you. Now, I'm going to pray for pray for each of you. Also, we got this prayer request here. Please pray for Lincoln Hornyak. He's been taken to the ER for continued vomiting that is recurring. Heavenly Father, we pray for Brother Lincoln today. Lord, you see this need in his body, Lord Jesus. What's causing this vomiting? In the name of Jesus, I resent this thing from our brother. May the spirit of God move forward. Lord, we join our faith together as your believing children. Lord, we know this is one of the many reasons why we don't want hatred in our hearts. For we know if we hide sin or we've got things in our heart, you won't hear us when we pray. And Lord God, we've got so many needs among us in the day and hour that we live. We don't want our prayers hindered. The husbands and wives don't need to argue and fuss and debate and so on in their home. Peter wrote about it lest their prayers would be hindered. We need each other so desperately in this hour. Father, help us Lord. It's easy for me to see, Father, why the very last attribute before going up into your love is brotherly kindness. Is it that it will be the hardest to achieve? It will be the very capping stone by which divine love sets on top of the closest connection to God himself. brotherly love. Teach us, Jesus. Teach us, oh God. Teach me as a minister. Help me, Father. Help me to know how to deal with issues. Father, help me. I pray, Lord. Oh God, we love you today with all of our hearts. Jesus, come near us now, Lord. If you see anything in my heart, Lord God, that I'm identified with that you hate, make it known to me, Jesus. May you search every heart. Begin here on the platform with me first. Then Lord, while you're here, go to the musicians, song leaders, deacons, trustees, all of us. Father, go to the mezzanine in the back. Go to the sound room up in the top the audio brothers there in the internet. Go out on the streaming. Father, may every heart be searched today. What a heartbreaking thing to know that we love something you hate or we hate something or someone that you love. Saul developed a hatred in his heart against a man who was after your heart. It shows us what hatred can do. And Saul's love changed from the love the way a father would love as a son to way an enemy would hate another enemy. Keep me from such Jesus. Keep our church from hatred. Keep us Lord God from the evil of rottness and corruption in the last day. Father grant it Lord Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing something for us. Hey. Oh my. Let's just allow before we go here. I won't keep you much longer. The presence of God just to come by our way now in this cleansing, scouring type of service. Let him look down deep in us. Remember, you're a triune being. your outward being, your flesh, your spirit, imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection, and then your soul. May the spirit of God search every avenue of every one of us right here today and see if he finds anything that displeases him. Are you willing to let go of it? Are you willing to let go if he finds something? Would you just raise your hand to him and say, \"Lord, take it from me, Jesus. You have my permission. Oh God, hallelujah. We worship you, Lord. We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to be [singing] like Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; like Jesus on [singing] earth like &gt;&gt; help us Lord from the front to the back Lord God to be [music] like him &gt;&gt; godly like him all through [music] life's journey [singing] from earth to [music] glory my own.

right ways us so Lord keep her from the evils of the day and diseases and sicknesses Lord God would you watch over father would we dedicate our little life to you today in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen I'll tell you one thing she's a grer ain't she bless you a lot of people do that when they're around me I don't know why Stand Together are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today it's a great privilege for us to be gathered together again in the house of God um before we read the word I wanted to say again how much I appreciate all the work and all the effort that everybody's doing in our uh flood relief I'd asked brother Michael earlier this morning before we came to church kind of give me a list of states that he was aware of that people have been sending help from just so everybody will know it would be totally impossible for us to do what has been done so you listen to the list Virginia West Virginia Pennsylvania Georgia Arkansas Kentucky North Carolina Louisiana Oklahoma Arizona and all over the United States of people sending Amazon packages so nered daily sometimes more than one trip a day Amazon is coming and dropping stuff off it gives you hope for Humanity you know you thank God is there anybody left that even loves that even cares for people but there really are there really are I want to say to U all of those of our church that have done all that they're doing daily how much we appreciate it so very much with that being said said a lot of the places where we're taking the stuff that we found so far um we're probably going to slow down to maybe two days a week as far as being able to make the deliveries so brother Michael want me to announce that to you that they will be posting it on Facebook when volunteers can come over and and help them sort through it all and um we so appreciate every hour that you're spending and giving of your time some of our brothers have t taken off work uh to be able to do this our sisters have come brought their children sitting over there in the cafeteria and it's just been it's been wonderful and I want you to know I appreciate it I took her of the I said you know I think it's good myself that I enjoy seeing our youth also coming and helping we need as as the people of God to realize our life is not our own a person that lives a life to themsel lives a very selfish life aelf self-centered life after all eternal life is living for others and doing for others and most of this that we are doing we will never see these people that we're doing it for but we don't have to that's not the reason we're doing it in the first place now myself and the brothers has been able to make some of these deliveries we're seeing the people and some of them we've seen some of them we've been able to see as they come and get food and come and get generators and gasoline and so on and so on but a lot of them that's getting it we will never see and we're not doing it for that anyway we're doing it to help and once again I want to say how appreciative I am for the facility that the Lord has given us to where we can be able to do all that from our place over here can you imagine trying to do this from our old church I told some of the people the other day in North Carolina that they would have died literally died had they been waiting for the federal government to get to them cuz some of the places were going to the federal government still hasn't showed up so they're backs in the hollers and the sticks and all that sort of thing and I told Brother Daryl a while ago I guess one reason that means something special to us going to those places is that's where he found us he didn't find us in the big halls or the great big Cathedrals but he found some of us on bar stools and some of us was in the offest shape that ever was but he and his Mercy aren't you glad glad he's that kind of a God so we're that kind of people so again I can't say enough and I I just want you to know Carol and myself were so proud of each of you of what you're doing some have given time lots have given money there's been thousands and thousands of dollars that's come from businesses and just all kinds of of people that's doing that and we say to them they probably never come to church here never hear me say it but I I would like to acknowledge that as well I want to thanked them for doing it many of the things that's been given have been given because of people here in the church as their business associates and they basically trust them so we want to be able to handle it in of course in such a way that'll please the Lord one day when we all stand before him according to the Bible there is a book I know the name of it it's called The Book of remembrance so everything we do not just in time of flood but everything we do to help anyone the Lord Jesus keeps a record so when these people finally get are able to Res resolve many of their problems and get to a stage of normaly whatever that will be for some of them who's lost absolutely everything and our church will get out of this mode of doing this I'd say we don't stop all the good works I'd say we don't stop being kind as a matter of fact for most of us we didn't just start doing it we've just just never quite done it in this scope before don't you love the Lord for giving us the opportunity to not be able to go around the world you see because I'm the type of person that I am a quiet individual I don't let people know what we're doing people look at our church they wow you know that big church big this big that they're so selfish they don't do this well people don't have a clue but for one time people can be able to look and see oh they're reaching out to the local community they're they're doing something that's just the first time they've saw it in a scope or they can see it but I think there's a reason in all that so I appreciate each one of you everybody understand me every one of you men women boys girls the sisters some grandmothers just coming watching their kids while their their children can be able to help about we just want you to know we're grateful and there's been people of the community or friends of the people that don't even come to church here that want to come in and help so if you find somebody that's not quite dressed up to par you know what's going on but they want to help you know what if they want to help I'm going to let them come and help cuz who knows it might get around us woo something might change their lives praise the Lord let's turn the scripture today in the book of fimon one the smallest books of the New Testament but filled with all types of wonderful nuggets from the word of God we've been speaking about the brides Bill of Rights and today I want to speak to you about the right to a position in Christ the right to a position in Christ fimon just of course the chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints you see people think they can love God with all their heart and not really love his children that's totally impossible if you love the Lord Jesus right you will love all of his children even those you don't agree with even those that you may not humanly ever have that contact and be close friends with them there's people like that and they may feel the same way about you but you still love them you may not like their ways and like certain things about them that's not even the same thing now look at this verse six that the communication of thy faith communication how in the world do you communicate faith that the communication and the word that Paul uses here is is coia so it's fellowship and being able to ajoin yourself that the communication of thy face may become or come to pass and be effectual that the communication so your your Fai is talking your faith is expressing itself how does faith talk how does faith communicate now what she says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual so a person can have faith in God and an element of his word and believe it's a truth and yet it needs to rise to another level to where the communication of their faith will become so it's not like the communication of your faith initially receives the full impact of all it can be but God gives to every one of of us a Measure of Faith then as we grow that measure can grow with us we will be able to endure more be able to accomplish more and it can also become effectual look at the word here that he used energus which of course you're familiar with the word energy powerful active so the communication of your faith may become powerful and active how just by hearing the word no just by going to church no just by doing good deeds no by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so you mean that makes our faith more active more powerful more energous has more energy to it I love this word acknowledging you know I'm a meaning guy and I look I like to look up the meanings of these words eposis we've looked at it before precise and correct knowledge used of the knowledge of things ethical and divine so this is how that our faith becomes more effectual by the acknowledging precise knowledge by acknowledging not every good thing that's in our flesh and believe me most of us are professionals at doing that but that's actually not what makes our faith effectual it's by acknowledging with a precise knowledge of what we are in Christ Jesus of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:8 finally bre Brethren whatsoever things are true now in order not to take up too much time today yesterday when I was studying I took every one of these words and looked up the meaning of them and I don't have some type of special concordance and some type of special bible program all you got to do is go to the Lexicon or the strong concordance you don't have one you can do it online and you click on every one of these words it'll change your life finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things well I can say amen and we can go home if we could get what I've read already this morning will be changed towards the world can I give you the meaning of one more word think on these things I may not say this correctly it's a qu a long long word longed zi to take into account to make an account of now probably most of you here today have a pretty good idea of how much is in your checking account or if you've got a savings account pretty much how much is in there you know how many outstanding checks that you may have and so on so you're not going to write a check for a million dollars if you ain't got but 75 cents in the bank because I'll be coming ministering to you in the jail if you do now this is what people you laugh at that but this is what a lot of times people do spiritually whenever they think above them what they really are so they think they have all this in their account of what they can do who they are so on and so on and so on but the word that Paul uses is absolutely phenomenal read me me hear the meaning of this this word deals with reality if I log isi or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself this word refers to facts not supposition so then a person with honesty with loyalty with truth with all the great things that we read there then think think on these things so you look at yourself and say am I truly honest am I honest with God am I honest with my wife my husband my brothers my pastor my church am I loyal am I Royal am I true am I faithful and then you can think on that and then you look at the account in your life and you say yeah I think I've got $25 worth of honesty yep there it is on my account I've got $25 so we think on what is factual according to where we are and the church said amen let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus thank you so much for your word today I pray father you would help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I know it's a miracle every time that you're able to get a human being into your hands if it's for five minutes or an hour and they can be able to speak words that have value of eternal life because we as Mortals cannot do that so once again I'm asking for a supernatural event to take place in this service today that you would anoint that part of yourself and my life which is a gift help me Lord that I can step aside I pray also for my brothers and sisters that you would anoint them that they would be able to lay aside their duties of the day and whatever they're going through their anxieties frustrations of life that they may be able to tap into the anointing and grab a hold of what you're saying Lord in this hour that we live we will be blessed and helped father I also pray over this prayer cloth laying before me Lord you see this need of this individual dear God they they need your help Lord they realize without without Supernatural intervention they will die not live and they're fearing death dear God I pray in the name of Jesus you would move on their hearts father may they come to a saving knowledge they requested a prayer call Father May the Holy Ghost go to them today I pray we commit the word the people the speaker and the hearer into your care in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated things that are to be the word made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him and you are risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I read all that to get to this all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see our self positionally placed in Jesus Christ so if we have been given the right to have a position in Christ Jesus no doubt it will be one of the greatest battles of our life to be able to get to that spot and then after we are there to be able to maintain it like the children of Israel the historian Usher says the book of of Joshua covers a span of about 26 years so they start in the South SL when they cross the Jordan and they start moving they're moving northward moving northward as they do they're conquering cities they're taking kingdoms they're defeating Kings they leave an element of people behind them so the enemy won't rout around behind them and regain what they took away from them eventually they go to the north up toward the Galilee up to the Northern Heights that the where close to Syria is now and they finally conquer the land now the fighting men are able to go back if their inheritance was down in the South close to Hebron they would go back down there if it was in Ephraim they'd go there manessa Jerusalem wherever they were and whenever they come back now they have to change their mentality they're not fighting to get the land they're no longer running into these masses of Philistines and great Giants and all that by the grace of God they've been able to defeat the masses of them but what they've got is little tiny pockets of these people that are still hid little tiny Pockets here and there and there and it was I'm I'm thinking Joseph that the tribe of Joseph that they they begin to let this certain element of people live and they no longer started killing them well once it started with them it went from there to Dan from Dan to naftali from naftali to Reuben and it was like a move that started moving in the message of that day so instead of slaying the enemy they start letting the enemy live so they're living here they're living there they're living there and the next thing you know then these Jewish men are marrying these women which according to the law they were forbidden to do but now it enters into the element of compromise and God said because you have done this I will leave them here and I will make them to be a thorn in your side now that's a terrible thing because it was not the will of God but it was the people that did that because maybe they figured they had more Love by letting the enemy live remember God is not a cruel God he was not telling them to kill the amorites jebusites Hittites Philistines and so on and so on even their children because God is mean and cruel but he knew a baby amalekite grows up to be an adult amalaki if you'll remember that when you go to letting in little sins and little bitty things that start out as a little tiny baby in your life in your home remember that little tiny sin many times grows up to become a giant how many knows it's a truth from your own life so then they have to change their sinking now they're entering into spot that they're not trying to get more no more property no more boundaries although they never got exactly all the property that God told them but they change their mentality so they're fighting to keep what they've got well it's the same with us we're out there in the world we're lost decrepit blind we don't know anything about God God gets a hold of us saves us sanctifies us and calls us into his body then we find a church hopefully we get into that part of of a Ministry and we go to finding our slot where God wants us to be then why happens the battle changes many of you years ago you battled and struggled so hard with this Habit in your life and that habit you said Lord I'll never get over this but by the grace of God you can look back today and say praise God I'm delivered of that and yet God in a mighty way delivered you well that don't bother me no more and that don't bother me no more but don't think because you're free from those things Satan stops he simply comes in another way sometimes even with some of those things same things to trying to pull you out now of your new inheritance which you've received now it is a spiritual inheritance in that it is a new birth a quick and Seed Gene by the presence of God something you never had before something you never even knew was there so it becomes quickened by the Breath of God then maybe God gives you a wife if you're a man God gives you children so your inheritance is expanding those children grow up now it's a whole lot easier when they're three or four or five years old now son don't you do that don't you do that I'll smack you if you do boy I'm telling you one thing but when you deal with that boy whenever he's 18 or 20 it's a lot different than when he's five is that right so what are you doing your inheritance is expanding and it takes the spirit of God for us as parents to know how to be able to deal with them whenever they get older but what are you doing you're still trying to keep everything that God has given you and it will be a battle from the time that you're born again until you leave this world either by the way of the Grave or by a body change now perfect Fai in our position enables us to be able to see where we are then we can take what what God had Paul to write here in the book of fimon and a the people of God to see and know by the account that they take of themselves do y'all do that to yourself all the time do you ever you know like you balance your checkbook and whether you've got it online and you can pull up your account and you know show your face or whatever and open it up you can see the outstanding accounts or if you still get them in the mail and you do that why so that you'll know where you are just know where you are so you got this working balance or you ain't got that working balance and you're trying to figure out what's going on we ought to do the same thing spiritually okay I'm a Child of God I'm a word believer I believe this I believe that I believe that that's only the as aspect of your account that you're showing on your paper form as we would say but you've always got on the other side it's amazing that when we write those checks that the bank actually takes that out of our account wow why do they do that life would be so much more funner if they wouldn't right if they would just say okay well we're going to do you this favor for the whole year whenever these checks come through we're not going to take it from your account we're actually going to pay it for you wow let me know where you Bank okay but they're not going to do that and it's the same way with trials and tests and sometimes differences that come between us God saying oh Lord I love my brothers that's what the word tells me to do Lord I do I love my brothers and then God will force you to write a check on brotherly love and brotherly love will run through the account and boy the spirit of God knows what he's going to do and he's going to come up and I don't mind telling you there's many times we find our check bouncing on brotherly love I've never had any to bounce on those that get along with me of you oh my goodness those Little Darlings that think the sun rose and set in me I got plenty of money in my account to take care of them saints it's them ones that don't like me it's them ones that don't care for me now I use myself as a big example I got broad shoulders I'm a little man but I got broad shoulders if I do this to some of you it hurts your feelings but sometimes I get tried and I really have to struggle to love folks that don't like me oh Lord brother Donnie not you just like the rest of all you rotten low down mortal sitting you're hearing me today and what happens it's my check runs through the bank and I get a you know it's flagged and I get an acknowledgement as it was I can say on my phone in an app that you're overdown we're going to charge you $35 or whatever your bank personally charge it because you don't have the money to cover that well how in the world is that I'm a Christian I love the Lord I believe the Lord but you've not been monitoring your account properly you see you don't have the right amount of forgiveness that you need for others and you're holding grudges and you're not able to override this and override that and it'll always be those that God knows you struggle with are the ones that push your buttons and you saying how do they know me that well how do they know me to push the combinations of my a and Y and c and Z buttons and that brings me to the peak not of explosion in the Holy Ghost but in your Humanity cuz God wants you to check your account and the church said now watch if we then would be able to walk every day of our life constantly checking our accounts monitoring where we are God help me if I'm short in any Avenue please help me Lord that if there's if there's a check that runs through that it don't come up and fles that I'm short on what needs to happen now when the Lord Jesus come to the Earth we know we preached on this for years and years that he so condescended to our level that he laid aside this this stupendous Glory that was there and he become one of us and he laid aside all his robes and his dim and everything that was there and stepped into a body of Flesh and become a human being that he might be able to feel the way we feel so no doubt the Lord Jesus there was people that he really really could feel close to we know there's even certain disciples he was closer to than others and yet no doubt there was also people that he just you know he grieved and he sigh the scripture tells us that he did and he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and tipped it in all points like as we are so the Lord Jesus must have as a human become frustrated sometimes with the people that he loved the most and those that said they loved him the most and said they understood him and believing you imagine James and John when they come to him and they want a great exalted position and how Jesus reprimands them and he uses this instance in a way I'd imagine old James and John their face got as red as blood because they felt like that Jesus was publicly humiliating them and to be honest with you they needed it because they wanted themselves they thought themselves Superior over the rest of the brothers I hope you understand we still got a few jameses and John's around the message but the key about James and John at that time was they didn't have the Holy Ghost we never find James and John ever doing that again and the church said so you see without the Holy Ghost and our soul we will never have the proper Measure of Faith to be able to communicate the faith that we have to give us confidence in our position now whether or not you understand this the Lord Jesus even though he was the word and the fullness thereof made flesh he condescended Beyond a spot even though he knew he pre-existed now pre Jesus stage he was Christ listen pre human body stage he was Christos logos thought fullness of God attributes of everything God was pre Jesus now remember Jesus was not existing in the Old Testament what is Jesus human body of redemption but it was Christ the Bible does not say Moses chose to suffer the reproach of Jesus but the reproach of Christ what is Christ the anointed one the anointed Ed word so he must condens sin then when he becomes Jesus to a place that he's not living operating thinking overcoming doing all that with the fullness of Christos in his soul because how can you and I be compared to him so if we would be compared to him him was all of that great power and that's the way he overcome and then he' turn and tell us be of good Comfort I've overcome the world you said well sure you could because you've got the fullness of God in you well and yet that gives you a great Advantage but he overcome as a man with the Holy Ghost he did not overcome The Temptations of Matthew 4 as God he did not die on the cross as God but as a man so Jesus himself actually allowed himself to to be deprived of the dependency to depend on and overcome by this preexistence thought of Christ so he overcomes as Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost now in order to accomplish this you say why in the world would he do that so he could come back to the state of perfect faith in who he was now remember he was not born of the Virgin with that state remember they they they never called him Jesus Christ at his birth but Thou shalt call his name why he was not Christos at his birth that did not happen to 30 years later then the father come in Him Praise the Lord now then becomes Jesus Christ as a matter of fact you'll never even find him being referred to in the four gospels as the Lord Jesus Christ he never gained that title till after the resurrection Lord father Jesus man Christ Christo anointed word so he allows himself to be on this Earth for this period of time and he actually steps apart from these great attributes and he allows himself to be grown into a measure of perfect Faith so it's not like that he looked at it and said oh I know who I am I know everything about me I know all my trials are over I know all my tests is over I knew I pre-existed I knew I was the word I am the one who created all things all things were made by me and for me and without anything made that was made but he actually stepped back from that him himself and allowed himself to grow Luke 2:52 he grew in wisdom and understanding before God and man so the Lord Jesus would have to read the word and whenever he read the word about scriptures pertaining to himself and actually gave him face wow yes sir the very author of Faith himself had to grow in faith notice this oh my I love this perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him and he said now and my I can do nothing I can do nothing but it's my facei in God and God was in him and the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you amen it's made manifest for you are a Believer listen this this is why I do not believe every person that says they are a Believer is this kind of believer believer and a Believer is the Fai of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that's a real believer you like that you like that I like I like like the teaching of where we can see what faith really is now turn with me if you would to Genesis 3:1 let's let's look back at the Garden of Eden now and whenever Satan come against the first human being on the earth now remember they were positionally placed in the Garden of Eden Adam was placed first years later years and years and years after God had stopped creating he brings Eve into existence now watch the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I want you to notice this is not a talking rattlesnake this is not a talking Copperhead or a talking gardener snake or a black snake it was a two-legged snake that's the kind you really got to watch most of us are scared to death copperheads and rattlesnakes and boy constrictors and all kinds of things like that and set under a two-legged snake that's leading you Soul To Hell Amen Brother D now what did happen Moses breaks into this and and he he doesn't go in to what had happened prior to this in order to make Genesis 3:1 able to say what it does but what happened of course we know was that Satan had a soul but the serpent did not have a soul but he had a place for a soul and Satan is wanting to inject himself into the human race he's wanting the Earth he's wanting a domain by now the Angels had already fallen and Satan had went over on the north side of heaven and preached to the angels and exalted himself above them and so many of them pulled away from the kingdom of Michael which was Christ and they joined over there where were they what Dominion what domain I I don't know I'm not sure that any of us know but I'm sure that the Angels fa the prophet tells us that God created to the Earth and brought it into existence after the Angels had already fallen so this was a Heavenly dispensation where they were so when God started creating the M the millions and millions or trillions maybe it is now of planets that they have found there was this one little tiny Speck of dust that God put out in the middle of this tremendous culdesac I'll call it called our galaxy and God put it in so many miles away from the the center of the universe and God gave it a moon and God gave it a sun and God placed it in exact proximity of where it needed to be to be able to produce what is called the habitable zone now our our planet rotates approximately being where it is to our our greatest sour of Light which is the sun approximately an average of 93 million miles from the Sun now if it was several thousand miles closer then the temperature would be so hot none of us could live if it was several thousand miles farther away it would be colder than it would be like Pluto or Mars so God placed it exactly in the right Zone where life could come upon it and uh our next main object of light of course being the moon on an average of I'm thinking maybe 237,000 miles now not million but Thousand Miles then our closest neighbors all around and we look out in the night sky and we see them so they they were placed there positionally in what is called the horizontal rainbow and then there's the ecliptical view which is what we can see from the Earth but what's amazing is I've been in South Africa and different continents of the earth and when you look at the night sky in South Africa it looks different than what it does here in the hills of Tennessee now being to Canada and seeing the northern lights and when you look at it from there it looks different from there so I'm told from being out in outer space whenever they look at it they see it totally different so if a person was on another planet and looking this way and look toward the Stars you'd never be able to read the same images of Leo the Lion the Virgin Urus you'd never be able to see it so it's like whoever put the Earth where they did they put it in such a spot that they could look at the night sky and read the story of redemption reconciliation the fall of the Dragon amen Aras so on and so on so God works and operates off of position you follow me so far or dilute some off the horizontal rainbow position is very important to God our spiritual position and also our natural position so the devil had had embodied The Serpent and the serpent could already talk of course he was the next one closest to man on the earth so God creating every form of life and he come right up right before he made his son he made this beast and he give him a futuristic image by that I mean he was the closest one that looked like man so if God made man in his own image and God is invisible well where do we get this image at then God is invisible right and yet the Bible said I to the image of God made he them male and female created he them where was that image Christ Christ so God places him in the garden and and oh my what a paradise it must have been and God simply gave them the a very simple command and God just told Adam I remember at this stage Adam was not planting So Adam wasn't going out digging holes you know and planting it and Miracle growing it and mulching it and all that sort of thing he all all that was already done for Adam but what God told Adam to do is just d dress it and keep it that's all you got to do just go out there and dress it you see anything needs to be done just dress it keep it so every day he would just go out in his dominion and he would dress it and keep it and all my just lived a beautiful wonderful life but there was one sad part about that life in that he had no one to share it with so he lived it by himself and then God opens up his side and brings out this rib and and then God divides his spirit and pulls out this feminist part because she was in him and places this inside this body that God has made which is not in the original creation and then when he when he woke up maybe God would have said to her now go over there and stand by just take him by the hand I've done it many a time with our Saints some sitting here and some that's gone on I'd be the first face they would see after a surgery well I can imagine that'd be frightening but I'm there with them patting them on the shoulder you know or holding their hand or whatever and you imagine when Adam went to sleep he went to sleep by himself but he woke up with someone her long blonde hair hanging down her back maybe real long beautiful hair her blue eyes as blue as they could be the azur skies that the Lord God had created and when he goes to batting his eyes as the Divine anastesia goes to wearing off and he comes to himself and he feels something he had never felt before it was a small dainty hand he actually felt two cuz one was under his and another one was on top of his It's A peculiar feeling within his humanity and he finally comes to him he opens his eyes and he looks there and something was in him struck his being and all of a sudden the revelation of God flooded his soul and he said you are is shy because you came from ish ish is our English word man Isa is the word woman the devil watching in the operating room or from the outside doorway at least seeing a suff thises it this is my way my entrance into the human race the Angels his Fallen Angels standing around him imagine him turning around saying mark it down I will get her by getting her I don't really want him he's Original Seed I can't mix myself with him but I can mix myself with her she is only a channel to accomplish the means I desire I want his domain so now I catch you up to verse two and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die now let's look again carefully at verse three but of the fruit of the tree Hebrew words are unlike our English words they can mean have two different meanings that are so opposite look at this word per this is what the word Moses used for fruit produce of the ground or offspring uhoh Offspring children progeny of the womb oh I mean I thought was talk about an apple tree oh was it a cherry tree maybe a pomegranate mango why are we talking about progyny or children or offspring of the womb from a tree in the Garden of Eden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst Toc middle among a number of persons so there is a middle ground of a number of persons between of things arranged by TW so we've got a man tree a woman tree if the man tree will come to the woman tree the progyny will be Christ but it's arranged by twos so if the right is arranged by twos there must also be another person on the other side of the dark side so it cannot be Eve alone because the middle can only be an arrangement between two persons well I believe this is about the quietest I ever heard y'all mou life children it's okay to breathe I mean it don't scare me you can there you go everybody now on three breathe in and out now listen this oh my my and the serpent said into to the woman you shall not surely die now what are we talking about position so what's it trying to do talk her out of her position I just it just because you find the word the message of the hour I should say it finds you by the grace of God and leads you to it don't mean that you won't fight all hell after you find the truth because Satan will do his best to try to talk you out of your place the way to did Eve in the Garden of Eden same might with every God called preacher every God called Deacon every trustee you know whoever you are just La member if God leads you here at our church we welcome everyone that God calls here that's as a matter of fact that's all I want here is those that God wants I'm not interested in having a big church I personally prefer a small church but I want everyone here that God wants but just because God leads you here don't mean that you won't fight to stay here until you get here so the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die now he's saying exact opposite of what God Said her position will be determined by her response will she say what the word says about her by his stripes I am already healed oh wish she said well the doctor said it was a hopeless case well you know what the doctor he may been perfectly honest but until the Lord says otherwise we believe what the Lord says now once he's going to explain the reason why he's already opened the womb of her mind now for God does know that in the day you eat thereof you're going to be blind lost wretched thrown out of the Garden of Eden you'll never have peace again another day in your life you're going to cause every blind child you're going to cause every man every woman he's not going to tell her the truth but God knows in the day you eat thereof oh wow then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes now let me just say this before I go into the meanings of this words I've eat a lot of apples in my life and like you I've got my favorites but I ain't never in my life eat no apple no Peach no apricot I've eat fruits in China fruits in Egypt fruits in Israel fruits in different parts of the world where I've been I ain't never had no fruit to do to me what we're fixing to read about so then I have to question maybe it's a different type of fruit and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant desire wish longings of one's heart lust so if any of you all ever went to Kroger and you see those honey crisp or those Macintosh or Gayla or and you're just standing there lusting oh I can't control myself I'm lusted I'm lusted Lord have mercy honey send me after church I'll buy you one if that's what so if any of you ever lusted after an apple like that you mean an apple does that to you well you starving to death you ain't never had no fruit in your life or what notice the mean's words now as I said you look at where I'm getting this Hebrew lexicon longing of one's heart lust appetite covetousness in a bad sense thing desired object of Desire oh I want that pump no I want it so bad I just can't take it I got come on be realistic and it was Pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired covet take pleasure in Delight to be desirable to Delight greatly desire greatly now maybe you've ate of an apple I've never tasted before to make one wise I am familiar with an apple today keeps a doctor away but I ain't never found one that can make you wise so she's standing there with this apple said oh oh if I could get that Apple I would be a PhD an lldd A Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science a bachelor of chemistry a oh if I could just get that Apple if I could get it I'd become so wise thank God for the evening light a tree to be desired to make one wise to

this has he he's never illuminated you he's never enlightened you can't you see how tricky the devil is so this whatever this is is going to give her wisdom about herself it's going to illuminate her about herself what she is her potential friends cannot you see the political stance of our day she's he's trying to get her to doubt her god-given position and convince her she's another can't you see why politics in our nation and around the world is identity politics have you wondered and not understood why the homosexual agenda the transgender agenda look look how go sex this sex that sex something else why it started with sex in the beginning and it will end up in the same way so then what do they do they feed this and they started years ago of course not with so much the children but now it's aim right toward the children and trying to put image and slded seeds in their mind even though biologically they were born a girl but try to convince them you're not really a girl you're not really a girl you're a boy and try to tell a boy I mean I ain't too smart but you ought to be able to look at certain parts about you that ought to be the answer unless you're a knucklehead or you're under the influence of this agenda of the last day which is going to bring this world into destruction so what do they do they crossdress and some of these perverted abominable denominations churches bringing all this into their churches and showing it out before the little children why sewing a seed in their mind they not really a boy you're not really a girl what do they want to do change them from what God made him God made you to be a holy ghost filed child of God don't you let the devil talk you out of your place oh my oh my goodness so the word wise on the meaning of this word I would advise you to buckle up your seat belt cuz it may be a bumpy right to look at have insight to have Insight have comprehension apparently all the apples that I've got they must have been stripped of all these abilities I just get the plain old plain old apples you know that tastes good to have comprehension to lay yes sir crosswise some of you people that think you're so polished I ain't talking about you I'm talking about some of Renegades that like to listen to me to pick every word I got to say I challenge you you look it up in your Bible and you'll find the same meanings and let me say it again I put the challenge forth several years ago some of you that's pulling away from this word of this hour I make the challenge again if you're so right and we're so wrong meet me somewhere and we'll go to an insane institution and I'll pick the worst one in there and you pick the second one and let's see your God work don't give me your words don't give me your words you're not known by words you're known by power and demonstration so if we're wrong and we're Hellbound and let's see you do the works of God then if it don't shut your mouth a YouTube channel ain't nothing oh come on somebody don't sit there and get all scared to death act like a bunch of chickens come on put your wings in the air act like eagles this morning I'm not afraid to say that if you're right and we're wrong let God speak for you let God speak on your behalf YouTube Don't Count Google don't count the power of God is what counts and testifies [Applause] dear Jesus girl told me Wednesday night she said it sound like John the Baptist is at the church tonight oh my notice here in verse seven the eyes NOW Watch What Happens let me let me breathe the light part of this verse six let me goad and start the STP again when the woman saw the tree was good forfill that it was pleasant to the eyes in the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her gave unto her husband with her and he did it I see some of you is getting because your face is red as blood oh oh my this is how oh my that Satan injected himself this is what brings floods this is what brings storms I tell you some of the stuff I've seen the last few days I come home telling Carol said you know what I saw today is I looked across the Earth and I saw ravaged by these floods and all these things I told her I said some of these things that I saw we they will never they'll never be changed until the coming of the Lord trees 100 years old trees 50 years old 75 years old this Earth shall still still be bearing the scars in the tribulation period from this hurricane to come up to here but one of these days when the son of David comes on the earth she'll be healed of all of her wounds hallelujah oh children we want to be a part of a kingdom which will never end and the only way we can do it is get in our place and stay there oh dear God verse seven the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked I quote the prophet in saying this right if eating apples it makes you realize you're naked we better pass the apples around again so whatever it was they partook of open their senses that never felt fear that never felt anxiety heartache trouble you imagine the moment that they realized we have been lied to what a horrible thing it's going to be one day when people are judged before the white throne and they hear those words depart from me you workers of iniquity and as a man had a dream many many years ago he was in the regions of the lost and he would reach down and pick up a man and look at him drop him back down and go pick up another and look at him drop him back down go look pick up another drop him back down and someone in the dream said what's he looking for and a voice answered back for that man who sent that preacher that preached him into hell Being A God Called man can be one of the greatest honors of life but to be a preacher that don't tell the truth you couldn't hardly have any worse thing ever happen to you I know you pray for the ministry but pray for him like never before Oh my God and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's the English word the Hebrew word is loin cloth well if they ate an apple why was not it the first sign of human beings wearing masks that's what they told us we're supposed to do right we found out there lying so why didn't Adam and Eve go out there and then they get why get a fig Leaf I mean get one of these little video guys and just s them together and come out of the garden of e and got your Hello Lord how you doing well God I tell you one thing we realize that we uh we ate this apple here and we got we disobeyed the word so we decided that we'd make a we'd make a mask and we'll wear a mask around why would they cover thems with a loin cloth Lucifer got out of his position talk the serpent out of his position he talked Eve out of her position she talked Adam out of his then when God comes down in the Garden of Eden that day and search for his children it was their custom to go to church every day so God showed up a church and they wasn't there so he goes through the garden of Edom Adam Adam where are you he knew where he was but he's waiting for Adam to cry out here I am father I'm lost help me oh my so God kills a lamb and takes the skin off of it throws it in behind the bush and Adam says I'm hid I was afraid I was afraid and I hid myself who told thee that thou was naked and stop partaking the fruit of which I forbid me the woman that thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the fruit so the Lord God calls them to come out here walks the serpent God looks at him and says because you have done this thing on your belly you will go and dust will be your meat all the days of your life and somebody please remind me what have our human bodies made out of can't you see why he gets a thrill out of tormenting you why he gets a thrill out of trying to make you sick so he lost his legs his punishment is bowing down and on your belly you'll go he wasn't on his belly before that's in your Bible right but if you notice he offers No Redemption then the Lord says unto the man and you remember the story and the woman and you imagine they heard a harshness in God's voice that never heard before and it frightened them sometimes the way we get scared in church y'all ever hear that in the voice of God you say oh Jesus oh Jesus I'm sorry why it's it's the laziness of humanity that sometimes he has to raise his voice above a whisper and yet people don't like a preacher like that a lot of preachers that shows and not preaching with the voice of God CU sometimes God gets angry with us and upset with us and he use a man to express and God must have raised his tenor of his voice and changed and and my Adam was looking at him but oh I never heard talk before Oh and evil Stander shake it and oh Adam Adam ad what have we done and as much as it broke his heart he said leave get out get out the prophet said I can see him little Eve lays her head over on his chest she starts crying his tears out of his eyes come down and mingle with her tears and they run down his body and that sheep skin slapping against his leg the tears and the blood merge together God showing the tears of a repentant sinner mixing with the blood of the Lamb will produce the Covenant and the pillar of fire come down and got in front of him and said wait a minute I promise you I will bring you back you see friends before there can ever be a resurrection in this last day the bride must come to her position it will be so powerful whenever member of the the bride that's on the earth comes to their position it will cause a resurrection and a Rapture look at how powerful position is so when Jesus dies and raised again Jesus could not he could not call the General Resurrection before he went to the Cross but when he raised and he told John in the Book of Revelation I am he that was dead and I have the power of death hell and the grave he did not have the keys and his hands when he raised liers from the grave he did not have the keys in his hands when he raised the wiow from name son that didn't happen to do he went down on the door of hell and he snatched it now he's got the voice of the entire resurrection and when his bride comes to her place the bride in China the bride in Japan the bride in Guam the bride all over Africa the bride all over India the bride all over the United States when they come to their place they may not have to be there but an hour but all over the Earth the bride will arise and she will say I'm where he wants me to be and your wife will be send it and your children will be S and others will be saying it and all over the Earth they'll be sing it at the same time I'm where he wants me and he can answered back and said sweetheart sin you're worri I want you I'm going to be where you want me come home come on oh God help us Romans 12:5 Paul says so we being many or one body in Christ and everyone members of one another 1 Corinthians 1:2 and to the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence verse 30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the face of Jesus Christ not faith in him but by the facei of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ this is the way a True Believer believes in Jesus Christ not a nominal Fai not a nominal belief but a believer's belief let bu it hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah many of you know the Exodus walk as God called us out of where we were from Egypt as it were we've experienced the mult multitude that fell away we've experienced the Mana we've experienced the water from the rock we've experienced those wonderful things that God did for us but could it be that we've moved into the Book of Joshua remember the hand that God showed the prophet whenever he led him into the dream of the vision and he come down the hand and pointed to this in Joshua remember Joshua repres represents not some certain preacher but the holy ghost that is going to lead every believer into their position many of you are already there it's not like you're going to wake up after a while and oh praise God I'm finally going to get straightened out all 60 years of my life has been in vain absolutely not all it is is just being able to recognize that you're there and then once you get there by the communication of your face you can have the acknowledgement and allow it to grow and become energized and be God what God wants you to be because of your confession in Christ Jesus I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost brother Donnie will we always be human always until the body change that's right but Paul didn't say acknowledge what you are in your flesh but acknowledge what you are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I may would just raise your hand to the Lord today and say Lord help me to be that Give Me Faith in who I am Give Me Faith so the Lord Jesus read the word and it gave him Faith about who he was no doubt it helped him when he read about Moses no doubt it helped him when he read about Joshua and many of the Old Testament characters but it done something different for him when he read what was written about himself remember when it when he went to the church at Nazareth several years ago we stood on that that little place there and they reconstructed a little small community there in Nazareth and it's a it's a steep place it's kind like almost a brow that's on a head it kind of juts out a little bit and they they LED Jesus to this place after he reads the scripture when he read the scripture the anointing is upon me cuz he's anointed me to preach the gospel and Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfill so what did he do he read the scripture pertaining to himself and it gave him face I just can't keep on wondering if he didn't have an Enlightenment an understanding of what they were fixing to do and they led him to that that precipice am I going to kill him but the father give him that something and the Bible says he passed right among them just turned and walked away how did he do that by faith in his position cannot you have faith in who you are I'm a Christian I'm an heir to Healing I'm an heir to Deliverance well brother Donnie I've got my mistakes and my faults you're always going to have that that is nothing to do with your new birth and your inheritance both of my daughters made mistakes and I had to correct them and had to deal with them they were still my daughters even when they didn't did what I want them to do they were still my daughters even whenever I had had to correct them and you'll always be a son or daughter of God if you're born of his presence can we stand our feet praise the Lord Jesus I love this in Ephesians 1:1 I know you know it Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful am in Christ Jesus that's me that's you Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Ephesians 2:6 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them a predestinated seed will have a predestinated walk and this is it right here good works and the saints of God said how many wants it with all your heart I need more of you let's just sing it together now and let's just meditate for a few minutes before we go on the things that we've heard I know friends there's so much trouble going on and so much stuff going around us and it's hard for us to keep our mind but remember the scripture gives us the direction on what to think about whatsoever thing are lovely and honest and of a good report all of that don't don't let us become so sidetracked with just things of life that

Lord your grace and mercy by sending us a a message in this hour Lord transformed our hearts changed our lives Lord and we're here tonight not because of anything that we had done any Merit of our own but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let it get done right next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts and cut it down and that's my next job is get all my frustrations away can we just for a few minutes tonight get all of our frustrations away get all the cares of today in this week behind us and say God I'm going to cut my way through all the doubts cut my way through all the unbelief cut my way through all the Affliction cut my way through all the nonsense Lord I'm going to C my way through tonight and receive from your [Applause] word see my senses tell me Well you feel bad come on Word of Life well I just don't feel like it well poor you man you look at brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer brain lungs throughout his body that man gets up there and un pukes his guts up the night before and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel like you never been sick and you say well I got a toothache I got a headache I broke my fingernail oh come on somebody it's is time that we get in and we lay into this word and we attend the services and let the new man or the inward man be renewed service after service after service with with a more determination to serve God like never before cut your way through the doubts right you know young people you got to cut your way through some things got to cut your way through some family strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight Church somebody will take that word and believe it's for me it's for my young person it's for my child it's for my grandchild that word is saved today church if it could sa re ball it can save your child oh it ain't got to end that way God is still on the throne he's still full of Mercy he's still full of grace brother Reed where are you tonight yes sir sir I Ed your testimony about 3 weeks ago and I preached the message believe are have faith and believe and I want to tell you this I wanted to tell you in the back but I'm going to tell you right now in front of everybody I showed your

said brother Jose this is my third chance so re don't you think your testimony didn't reach somebody already it's done Touch Somebody Satan said he was going down Satan said it was over Satan said he took his family out of the house of God say that he'll never amount to anything he's going down in destruction but by somebody's testimony of a god who's rich in Mercy that young man came and fell on my shoulders and begin to cry his way back to Calvary and he's now serving serving God I'm telling you it ain't got to end the way the devil think and it ain't going to end the way the devil thinks God is rich in Mercy he's still on the throne he's still saving he's still delivering he's still healing he's still oh Hallelujah he's still setting free tonight and he wants you to know Church no matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he

your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed sometimes we we don't know which way to go but the truth is we're not in despair the facts is we're persecuted but the truth is we're not forsaken the facts are that we're cast down and many of us been cast down many of time but the truth is we're not destroyed we're still here Church we're still believing we're still plugging the law let me just tell you this when the devil is all gone and he's defeated you'll still be standing you'll still be here when when that healing is happened and Satan is defeated he's cast into that Lake of Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll still be praising God what did God tell job job where were you when I hung the foundations of the world where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Jo he was reminding job before the first Affliction before he lost his family before he lost his well that job you were in my thoughts and if you was in my thoughts there you will be in my thoughts now nothing can destroy you Jo this ain't the end of it I'm going to restore more and more unto you and I'm going to take Word of Life Church that God is the same today he's the same yesterday today and for forever church and whatever you have need of He's Able tonight to do it he's able tonight to meet your need He's Able tonight to heal your body He's Able tonight to save your prodical son he's able tonight to deliver He's Able tonight to do whatever you have need of it's not the end of the [Applause] story amen yes sir amen let's get back to the painting as we bring this to a close Grandmaster standing there he's looking at this picture and he's staring at it and he's looking at it and all of a sudden somebody may want to take that cell phone call Satan may be wanting to tell you something he's looking at this picture and he's in the L Museum and all of a sudden he says wait hold up a minute it's all wrong the curator of the museum came over there what's all this excitement about why are you so emotional he said the painting is wrong it's wrong get a hold of the author of the painting because it's title wrong the King has one more move what am I telling you tonight Church of God it may look like you're in Checkmate it may look like you're going down in the fet it may look like you can't be healed it may look like your finances are a mess it may appear that your marriage is in Shel but the king the king he has one more move

mic trouble somewhere amen the mic's not be too great but our God certainly is tonight isn't he what a wonderful privilege it is to serve the Living God count it an honored to be with you and appreciate the opportunity to stand before you tonight and Trust something will be said to help you and encourage you along the way and battling just a wee bit of a cold and I just trust that my voice don't sound like I'm in a barrel too bad but we pray the Lord to just help us tonight but if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of 2 Corinthians want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 sorry not working again well praise the Lord amen I'm telling you if I cross the river and somebody hands me a mic I did not make it it happens everywhere I go praise the Lord praise the Lord God is good all the time amen anyway we we're going to read second made myself laugh we're going to read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 5: 7 and also from 2 Corinthians chap 6 uh verse 16 do you love him yes amen the Bible says this very familiar scripture to us all says for we walk by faith and not by sight for we walk by faith and not by sight now you can walk by one or the other but you can't walk for both at the same time so you're either going to walk by what you see with your eye or you're going to walk by what you see with the eyes of your heart amen amen now 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen oh myall what a wonderful statement that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth said that you would be his people amen that ought to make you shout tonight good amen do you love him you know in order to walk with God we have to agree with God for the Bible says can two walk together except they be agreed and the prophet of God said this and I thought it was so good he said when a man will walk for God and walk with God then God will walk with that man amen when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man amen let us bow our heads Hallelujah Heavenly Father Thy word is true thank you Lord for loving us for it's written that while we were yet sinners you loved us Lord father I pray tonight that you would just take this simple thought and encourage the hearts of your people Lord for truly we're living in such a time of great Darkness but yet Lord you promised in this evening time that there shall be light God we are so grateful that we're a people that's been called out of the darkness to walk in this Marvelous Light bless your children tonight Lord those that are sick and Afflicted maybe those that are weary may you move among them Lord a great way we pray with thy Healing Touch tonight knowing Lord that you're both Creator and sustainer of Our Lives we commit every need into your hands For Your Glory bless your children tonight bless the little bride around the world we pray every Minister ministering tonight use them for thy Glory we ask as we commit oursel and this congregation into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated this evening you know inspiration for a message can come in so many ways sometimes someone can make a comment to you and it'll just something will just strike your heart and it'll inspire you to start looking in a certain direction or you can be going down the road and you see a just a a a a billboard on the side of the road and something on that billb billboard will strike your heart and you'll start looking at a certain thought you know like brother Brenham who was walking through the woods and uh he he's seen a cigarette pack and laying there in the woods and he stopped and looked at the at the cigarette pack and on the side of it was a was a slogan a slogan on the on the cigarette pack and the prophet got an inspiration from that cigarette pack and he preached a powerful sermon on a thinking man's filter and the other day Aiden my grandson was over at the house and after he left I was coming through the bedroom and I bumped into one of his toys that he had left out while he was there and we had it out for him to play with and as I bumped into it it spoke to me and it said let's walk together let's walk together and when it said that something just struck my heart so tonight for a few minutes I'd like to speak on let's walk together Walking with God in the season of transition for you see transition means a period of changing from one state or condition to another and I believe that we can prove tonight by the Bible and by the message of the hour and by the conditions of the world that we are now living in that we are in the season of transition now in our scripture reading we find that the sons and daughter Daughters of God they walk by faith and not by sight and the prophet said a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they will never please God so if you try to walk after the world and try to walk after the message you will never please God and a person that never pleases God will never take a Rapture amen I said if we never please God we will never take a Rapture for the Bible said that Enoch pleased God and he was not because God took him amen but a man woman that will not look at the things of the world but will go according to the leading of the spirit you will find those kind of people are usually in the will of God Amen and that's the great fight tonight and it's always been the fight that Satan took the eyes of a man's head to control him by his head but God never chose the eyes of your head he chose your heart God wants to lead men so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man could be led by the spirit of God Amen and if there's something in you tonight thirsting for more of God if there's something in you tonight thirsting for a deeper walk with God anybody here like that tonight say you know brother I really desire a deeper walk with God then there's something in you that thirst that's in you for a deeper Walk Of God is the evidence that there's a deeper Walk Of God for you to attain to because if it wasn't there then you would never have that thirst and I want you to know that the thirst that's in your heart for a deeper walk with god did not come from you it came from from God he put that thirst on Hallelujah he put that thirst in your heart oh do you love you tonight it was put there by God now one of the greatest examples in the Bible that we have of a man walking with God is Enoch is Enoch and the Bible says this that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him oh God let that be said about me one day let that be said about you one day that he walked with God and he was not because God took him by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen Faith we're talking about faith we've got to have faith we've got to have it in such a place till we'll be translated like Enoch was we of me you all of us tonight we must come to that kind of faith that we can be translated like Enoch was that's right he had a testimony of faith that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God so you you've got to have the same kind of faith that you believe and that you know but you see this faith is that this knowing is not a head knowledge you don't know it well I've read a few good you don't know it by head knowledge but it's a revelation that God has given to you God has revealed this thing to you amen and that's how we know we can have faith in it not because of a head knowledge but because of a revelation what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God for your life amen and so when the Revelation comes we can have faith that God revealed this thing to us because we are a part of what God is doing in this hour amen Jesus himself said I do always that which pleases the father that's keep his word for to please God we must believe his word and keep his word and so is it today every son and daughter of God in order to please God must keep God's word not the part you want to keep but all of it all of it God is not known by sensation come on somebody well I got a goosebump you can get that from an air conditioning God is not known by sensation he is not known by education amen well I can read the Bible well I know the Bible from cover to cover that's just being able to read amen God's not known by education God's not known by sensation but God is known by faith amen faith in his word that's the only way he's recognized faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's how it comes by the hearing of the word of God Enoch walked with God it was a walk by faith so Enoch must have heard something from God while he was walking there was something that God was revealing to Enoch while he was walking for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen now we know that Enoch believed God you say how do you know he believed that because he acted on what he believed he walked with God that was the evidence that he believed God we know that Noah believ God you say how do you know Noah beli God because he built the ark before one drop of rain ever fell amen you see when you believe anything when you say you believe anything you've got to put it into action or do you believe oh I believe brother Daryl so does the devil but you got to put it into action amen hallelujah Abraham was commanded to separate himself from unbelief and walk with God Alone instead of getting weaker he got stronger and when he was 100 year old and Sarah was 99 they had the baby amen because Abraham believed God and he walked with God believing that he would have that child out because God said so he never looked at his body he never looked at it come on somebody he wasn't looking with the eyes of his head he was believing with the eyes of his heart and because he didn't look at his body he looked to the promise he never got weaker he got stronger stronger amen he knew he would have the child because God said he would have the child and he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise became flesh he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise was made flesh amen I thought that was pretty good you get me amens but oh my to the promise of the word became flesh whose flesh My Flesh your flesh the message of the hour not just in book form not just in tape form not just in CD form not just computer uh computer format but the message of the hour made flesh in you and I that we are the [Applause] message Hallelujah manifested on the earth making him the same yesterday today and forever so let's look at Enoch for a few minutes and look at his walk and see this walk that was so pleasing to God that God translated him now I don't know about you and I but that's the kind of walk that I want tonight that my walk would be so pleasing to him that he would say Daryl just come on home with me buddy amen so when we look at Enoch's walk we start to see some things that are laying in the message that the prophet said about Enoch and one of the things the prophet said about Enoch was that Enoch was a type he was a type Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the flood came that he had to give an example now where did that Revelation come from amen how did he know that he was the type that everything his life was doing was an antitype of a type that's right where did that Revelation come from so one afternoon it'd be coming to him to take a walk notice not one morning not one morning he didn't take a walk one morning but it was an evening walk amen Enoch was translated just before the tribulation let me say that again Enoch was raptured just before the tribulation and he was took up and he was not found because God took him the type of the going forth of the church the type of the going forth of the church Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power and transforming means the ability to bring about a dram dramatic change amen we serve a god tonight who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change hallelujah oh I'm so glad tonight someone on the other day that God don't heal no more these Church of Christ people believe God don't heal no more I'm sorry if you're God suity he can't heal I feel sorry for you but my God my God still heals he still open blinded eyes he still makes the come on somebody we serve a god tonight who has the ability to raise the dead and to change our bodies brother Jackie back to young men again Hallelujah by the transforming power of the almighty God hallelujah you know was translated by transforming power why did God do that what did God do that for why did God change his body that he wouldn't have to see death yeah the prophet said for a type of the rapturing church that's coming for the rapturing church that's coming God done it for a type of the rapturing church that's coming well Glory Elijah was the same Jesus body the prophet said was quickened after it was dead in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transform him from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet said in Psalms 16:10 if you want to put it down I will not suffer his sold in hell I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I'll not leave his sold in hell I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that word has to come to pass why God spoke it God's word planted in your heart the prophet said if you want to go in a Rapture anybody here want to go in a Rapture oh yeah if you want to go into Rapture plant the word in your heart if you want to be a Christian genuine place this word in your heart and believe it as it was Ezekiel said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet and the word became the self-same the prophet and the word became the selfs same did not John the Baptist John on the alatus was not he the type of the bride and what did he do he took the book out of the hand of he that descended and what did he do with the book he ate the book and John was a type of the bride and the book became one yes sir you take and eat the revealed word of this hour and you and that word becomes [Applause] one every promise has to manifest in your flesh it's not just for the preachers to lay hands on the sick these signs shall follow them that believe every promise must manifest in our flesh hallelujah hallelujah would you let some educated Theologian try to pump it out of you just let him spray you with some of this carnal science and knowledge and education you believe what God said well brother D I don't really understand it you don't have to understand it just believe it he'll reveal it to you when you have need of it amen I'd rather be found believing it than debating it because debating it will never produce nothing but believ in it Hallelujah believe in it will open blinded eyes believe in it will make the L walk believe in it we'll take a drunk and make a preacher out of them by believe in what the word said it'll change our bodies [Applause] amen hallelujah Enoch was the type of the church he also typed the seventh Church age what age are you in what what seventh seventh anoch typed the seventh Church age Enoch walked as a reflector Enoch the prophet said was God's perfect reflector and type when God was through with him he just translated him he took him up the mechanics that he had reflected become the Dynamics with the spirit and took him up the mechanics of the word that he reflected became the Dynamics with the Holy Spirit and it just took him the word that Enoch believed Walking with God the mechanics of the word one God water baptism reing the Holy Ghost forgiveness of sins as though you never done to justification all these Mysteries lay in there the mechanics of the word became Dynamics he reflected that word I was listening to a man the other day talking about leaving the message they said he'd come out of the brandom cult and they let him speak a little bit and this man said I believe in one God I believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I believe in signs and wonders and visions and miracles and healings I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in one God I believe in the Rapture of the church and I'm thinking where did the prophet miss it you walked away from something that you said you you believed think about that friends think about that everything he said he believed was what the prophet preached oh God he was a reflector the mechanics that he reflected became the Dynamics with the spirit that took him up and we are flesh and bone of him amen amen listen to me there's sometime in your life you're going to have to start amening what the prophet said there sometime in your life you've got to start acknowledging what the prophet said well I don't understand it he didn't say did you understand it he said did you believe it and there comes a time that we have to start confessing come on friends we all the time feeding our enemy well I'm no good God don't love me you know what shamgar did every year every year at Harvest Time When they'd come in they'd slap him around and they'd take his his grain away from him take his Goods away from him and leave him with just enough to plant for the next season you know what chevard was doing he was feeding his enemy and I am convinced that many of us feed our enemy with our negative talk well I'm no good God don't love me nobody cares for me it'd be better if I just die you're feeding your enemy why don't you shut that stuff up and start saying what the word said I am an overcomer I am a Son of God I come on somebody I'm predestinated I was born for the rapture and every year they come in but one time this particular season there was another seed that came to maturity Shamar said I am the Seed of Abraham and God promised my daddy his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy that year he killed 600 Philistines with a nox goat because he came to his position he started saying what the word said about him amen we are flesh and bone of him oh that's much better thank you we are you see we're not a church we're not a building we're a body when the when the when the cloud appeared in Arizona what was it was it a block was it a steeple it was a head what do heads go to bodies we are flesh and B we are his body represented on the earth amen a many membered body that's why he said the works I do shall you do and greater that greater means more because what he did was one body but now it's a universal body signs of Wonders being done everywhere because his body is on the earth flesh and Bone amen as long as we are the bride of Christ amen it's his word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what it was that's what it was with Moses that's what it was with Jacob that's what it was with the rest of them sparking off that word of God the reflector God was reflecting himself and come to the perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him so I say to you tonight what are you reflecting an organization a denomination or are we reflecting him once more the world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen Voice Hallelujah God reflected himself come to a perfect Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him Enoch was reflecting the word that God was revealing to him as he walked with him God said Enoch let's walk together now didn't that happen sometime in our age when brother bam spoke to a storm and Reb buuk the storm and the sun came up and dried up the snow and God spoke to him and said how would you like to walk with me he said oh God I would love nothing more to take a stroke with my Creator you he's given every one of us in this hour an invitation this message of the hour is his invitation walk with me let's walk walk together amen Enoch walked in the light in the light amen oh my someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with the testimony that everything God said he did he didn't displease him for what the Lord said to do Enoch done it Enoch just kept walking in the light till one day his feet kept getting off the ground he just kept walking He Walked on into Glory without even dying that's right God took him away because God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God he just kept walking he just kept walking oh friends never put a period behind what you believe always put a comma I believe this and this and this and whatever else God in his grace would revealed to me walking the prophet said Brothers It's time we make Footprints we can't stay here in this same camp the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience walking in the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold it's like that Roman Candle you light it in the fuse if you walk away you never see the end of it when that first one comes out that's the beginning of the end but you've got to stay there until all of them it just keeps poof poof poof poof continues has the seals been open yes but it continues to unfold what do you see in the seals is it just a sermon is it just a series of meetings or do you see yourself there's a man I believe I think I've told you this before but it just comes to my heart there's a man by the name of bur from New Jersey raised in the Jewish Family wore the cap did all the things that the all the ceremonies he's an award-winning Native American flute player now why would a Jew from New Jersey be an award-winning Native American flute player that don't make no sense think he'd play a harp or something you know some kind of horn why a flute why brother Fred would a New Jersey Jew been an award-winning Sue flute player playing Sue music because one day somebody come to his door with an open book and they told him you're not a Jew you're a sue Indian adopted adopted as a child from the rosebud Indian reservation and when he found out who he was when he found out his genetics you see the ability the play of the flute laid within his genetics and when he realized who he was he surrendered to what he was and he went back to the red path and the sacred way and the elders why that's what he was and one day they told me I was a drunk because my papa was cuz my uncle was cuz Uncle Harold was CU a Francis was they told me I was a drunk but one day somebody came with an open book and said that's not who you are that's not who you are you're my son while you was yet in your mother's W I called you I set you aside for such a time as this the open book revealed to us who we really are walking into the light amen the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold from glory to glory to glory Enoch walked has an eagle all these were the things the prophet said I just dug through the message all these are things brother brim said about Enoch Enoch walked as an eagle he walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day that's pretty good he was an eagle who had been called to that day you know the Bible talks about four living creatures is that right a man an ox a lion and a flying eagle now those four living creatures three of them are Earthbound creatures the only way that they could ever cross a Chasm is either build a bridge take a boat an airplane but not the eagle the eagle was born with the ability to lift off the Earth and God never said Enoch was a lion or an ox or the face of a man he said he was an eagle who had been called to this day oh glory to God hallelujah that just stirs my soul to know that I was born oh the devil tried to put me in a the cage he tried to lock me up but Christ come and opened the door and said you're an eagle you can fly Enoch walked with God whatever God said to do he never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle who had been called to that day to that day you B talked about an eagle that he saw in a blowdown remember the story was out there and said he's just praising God and said he knows said he was looking at him he said at first I thought it was me but he said I noticed it wasn't me he was looking at it was an old ground squirrel chipmunk or something said ch ch ch ch chatter chatter chatter chatter said I a't going just his head look at him said after a while he just got tired of the chatter all the political correct transgender he got tired of all the chatter got tired of all the stupidity come on somebody what was it Forest Gump one time said it's stupid is the stupid does that's about where it's at right now some of the stupidest things they do well amen well you ain't supposed to get political I'm just telling the truth I'm sorry come on somebody amen he said he got tired of all the chatter said he just gave a flop just one big jump and he just flopped his wings one time and S them said he trusted his wings he didn't fought from one meat to to the other from one Church to another he just made one big flop and set his wings in the power of God like the Holy Ghost and he carried him away on and on and on and on he got away from that little old chipmunk that Earthbound chipmunk that ain't got no wings that don't know how to fly that don't know anything about the supernatural that don't know anything about God but all they know to do is run their mouth he got tired of it and he realize I am an eagle I don't have to listen to that I can set my wings I Can Fly [Applause] just set your wings in the power of God let the Holy Ghost rise you above it go on and on and on do you don't hear the Chipmunks No More the ground squirrels he got tired of the chatter oh if the church one of these days will get tired of that they'll know how to set their wings they'll take a walk with God and they'll go home they'll go home one they they'll just set their wings they'll get tired of it and they'll just set their wings they'll go home you see the most wonderful thing about Enoch's walk cuz I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I was hoping some of you would get it I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I'm talking about you I'm talking about you Enoch's walk was typing you God was showing through Enoch what he was going to do through you he was a reflector he was the light of his age reflecting the mechanics of the word the evening light is not the name of the church I'm sorry it's you Jesus said I'm the light of the world and then he turned and said you're the light of the world did he suffer from Amnesia did he forget what he said no he was giving you a revelation I'm the light of the world but you are the light of the world because I'll be in you reflecting myself through you and you shall be my people and I shall be your God and I'll walk in you Hallelujah I'll reflect myself through you that the world in 2024 will know that Jesus Christ lived lives he lives in young people he lives in Grandma he lives in Grandpa he lives in that come on somebody he lives in me he lives in you if that's true let's just look at it for a minute that let look at Enoch's walk in the season of his transition now the prophet said God is just loosening up the church everywhere getting it in order now so they can get into the Rapture he's got to give it Rapture in faith before it can go in the Rapture he's just loosing up the church everywhere getting it in order so they can get into the Rapture so that he can get into the Rapture he's got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go in the Rapture the people that are in the spirit of the last days just like they were in the days of Noah eating and drinking marrying in marriage unconcerned don't care walk around anything else as it was in the days of Noah and if you understand it right the prophet of God said that Enoch and Noah was preaching at the same time so the days of Noah when the world was in that condition it was in that season that Enoch translated it was in that season of drinking and marriage and giving in marriage and unconcerned and self-love take the place of the true love of God and earthquakes in diverse places rest unrest between nations wars and rumors of wars pestilence famines it was Enoch's day it was in his season of transition it was in that time it was in that time that uniting times and signs took place sound familiar it was during that time the prophet says you see that time that Nimrod had brought all the confederations together and made people come to Babylon and come into this great Confederation and at that time of all the evil going on between the women sexually and so forth it's at that same time that God had a witness on the earth Enoch who walked with God blameless it was during that time that this evil was on the earth when God said I'll destroy man for his heart is continually evil it was during that time that there was someone on the earth who was found blameless as though they never done [Music] it Hallelujah more than what Luther preached come on somebody a greater understanding of the word walking in the light as he reveals the light Hallelujah was in the season of transition that they were uniting herself amen he was found blameless he was found blameless and that that same time evil was appearing Angels appeared on the earth Angelic beings moved into men a very beautiful type of today as evil is appearing so is good appearing also notice back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man a humble man not very much of the world but a man who had a heart to listen to God a man who had a heart to listen to God how can two walk together except they agree and there's only one thing that you and God can agree on and that's his word amen and you see we know that as it was in the days of Enoch so will it be in our day you say how do you know that because when Jesus was here he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming and he even gave us an understanding of what was to take place he actually prophesied of what was to take place in this day that we're living in now you'll find it in Luke 21 and they asked him saying Master when shall these things be and what shall be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass when will these things happen and what will be the sign that it's happening and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draw near go ye not therefore after them but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is Not By and By then he said unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places many places and famines and pestilence and fearful SES yeah ain't it something that all of a sudden our government is so interested in UFOs and brother Bon said they don't know what they are they don't know what they are but he told us what they were he said they were investigating angels amen oh god oh Hallelujah fearful signs Great Signs there shall be from heaven and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity and the Sea waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud not clouds cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass give up quit coming to church go to Dollywood every other weekend when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your hands for your Redemption draweth n and he spake unto them a parable saying behold the Fig Tree and all trees and all trees not just the Fig Tree and all trees when they shoot forth you see you know of yourself that summer is now at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away to it be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away it shall not pass away I don't know if you noticed or not have you seen all the buds coming out on the trees the Bradford peirs are all turning white what's that telling us it's a law of God's nature that's telling us summer is on its way huh you see when the leaves come out the leaves don't come out in the winter time no first the buds come out and they start budding forth and it tells us spring is on its way spring is here it's sprung we say and then what does that tell us when the leaves begin it tells us that summer is n amen so you can tell what season you're in by looking and at the trees budding in the spring leaves are on the trees in the Summer Leaves begin to change color and fall in the fall and when there's no leaves on the tree it's winter but as brother Lind wrote that song there'll be another spring amen learn the parable the Fig Tree when it's young it put forth its branches and all the other trees you know summer is n likewise when you see this come to pass know the time is now even at the door when you see what the Fig Tree buding and all the other trees begin to Bud no the time is near speaking of the second coming of Christ that that time would be at hand that time would be at hand at the budding of the trees at the budding of the trees nations are breaking the fig trees putting forth his Bud all of the trees are putting forth its Bud the wicked ones are putting forth their buds romanism is putting forth its Bud communism putting forth it but and your church is putting forth its but springtime's coming oh great master of Life rise with healing in your wings Lord give your servants all power and signs to stretch forth the hand of th holy Child Jesus to perform Miracles and do signs and to preach the gospel to the ends of the world when all the trees begin to bud when everything begins to come into its own amen amen they manifesting who they really are and so are we the trees are budded amen Jesus seeking said father the time has come there are seasons for everything do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there are seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen yeah season is right for things to happen you see it couldn't happen in' 65 we wern't ready but when that last one comes in remember say she may be in Florida tonight when that last one comes in he'll close the book and call for his bride thank you amen so when the season is right he'll come with the season when the times comes it's right for things to happen he said do you believe that the time came one time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment the time came for Noah to go in the ark look Noah could not go into the ark before God was ready for him to go but when the season came for go for Noah to go into the ark God shot shut the door behind Noah he couldn't go in until the season was right but when the season was right he could go and he never shut the door God did God did so Prophet said you see we find that Enoch was a seventh from Adam and the seventh Church age is a seventh from the alpha BR the first church age Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam which is a type of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh so it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture now there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture all other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him but Enoch raptured was the type of all the rest of them dying but at the end time bride will be called out the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age and we are now bearing record of that age we are now bearing record of that age as it was in the days of Enoch so is it in the days of the Bride right we are now bearing record of that age as Enoch was a seven from Adam took a Rapture he did not die so the seventh Church age will take a Rapture there'll be people on the Earth by the transforming power of of God will become about a dramatic change and in a moment and the twinkling of an eye will'll be young again hallu Hall the season of transition the season of transition stand up there where Enoch did my he took a stroll one afternoon with God and walked on home with him don't just to come back Hallelujah not one morning one evening the Rapture of the Resurrection he had a testimony that he pleased God because he believe God and that's what we need and that's what we want and that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but it's time we get away from this fear and from this scar BR B said I didn't come out I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and from the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God it's time we get away from this fear and from this skar and start saying what he said about us come on somebody there's nothing wrong with saying what the word said as a matter of fact everything else is true he said let every man's lie let every man's word be a lie but let mine be true amen let every man's word be alive but let my word be true heavens and earth will pass away but my word word shall not pass away that's what we need that's what we want that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but I say do not be afraid to exercise your god-given rights after all this is the age of people's rights I did who you going to preach with me I don't one a predestinated word for the season a predestin ated word for the season that God would hold a word back for a certain season before he would let it be released that's why Paul never mentioned the seals it wasn't the season but in a predestinated time God would give a predestinated word to a predestinated people that they would take that word and eat that word and become that word and manifest that word and the word would be Flesh on the earth once again which would be Jesus Christ Hallelujah in his bride fulfilling the promise of the last day when he said a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you Enoch was translated 500 years he had a testimony that he pleased God and he was a type of the raptured church amen Enoch after walking 500 years with God God told him Enoch you're not going to have to die he walked walk with God and one day God revealed to Enoch you don't have to die I bet if he told you that you wouldn't be sitting there but he did if you believe it I wish he told me that he already has if you believe it amen he told Enoch after walking 500 years he said Enoch you're not going to have to die you're not going to have to die there come a more sure word of Prophecy a predestinated word for a predestinated season and Enoch believed everything God told him Enoch said I don't have to die I can go where he goes I don't have to die I don't have to die who told you that he did he said Enoch he said Enoch you want to come home are you homick Enoch and Enoch said yes Lord I'm homesick so just before the translation of Enoch he got homesick and I'm telling you friends I've been preaching for 30 some years evangelizing 30 some years I have never seen in all the years of being on the field as many people saying they're homesick and they want to go home and even so Lord come quickly as I have in the last two years I'm just telling you friends everywhere you go people even so Lord come quickly they're posting it on Facebook they're posting it on come on somebody you know it's the truth and God said Enoch are you homesick and Enoch said yes Lord I'm so homesick I don't fit in here anymore I don't belong here no more amen I want to go home he said yes Lord I'm homesick in a season of transition Enoch became homesick he said you walked in this pest I've done here long enough he said yes sir he said all right Enoch just start walking and the prophet said Enoch needed a ladder but God gave him a highway it's a highway Heaven none can go up there but the F in heart hallelujah amen notice God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season hry now how could Martin Luther know about the message today how could the Presbyterians how could Martin or the Catholic Church know Martin Luther's message how could John Wesley know Luther's message how could Wesley know the Pentecostal message or how could the Pentecostals know this message see he reveals it in his Seasons because it's a seed and it grows and matures and he reveals himself Enoch was a type of the church he was a type of the seven Church age can you think of that the seven Church ages there was seven watches and all six watches they slept but in the seventh watch there came a morer word of Prophecy and it said behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and they awoke and trimed their limbs in the seventh watch and Enoch was a type of the seventh watch amen it's the seventh watch that gets the revelation behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Putin's threaten of nuclear war I saw it today in the news said he's not afraid of nuclear war but I got news for Putin he can't push the button until the last one comes in and if he does push the button said one day they'll drink too much vodka Russia push too much vodka when that bomb passes through the radar when it goes through there there'll be others go the other way and you'll know what'll take place the world can't stand it the gospel's been preached Christ been made manifest to the people just before the Rapture the taken away of the church before that can happen before that can happen the church will be gone I ain't worried about Putin pushing if he pushes we'll be gone before it ever hits he said we know that that could happen before morning it could happen before morning and if it could happen before morning and its capabilities are there the things are there that it could happen before morning but if it does this will be the last message you ever hear the trans position oh God's people hallelujah before that happens the church will be gone not one drop of rain fell Noah was in the ark before one Speck of fire fell from the heavens lot was out of Sodom and before that pic bomb the Nations the church will be gone to Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love you we're walking in the season of Transitions and I say to you as we close tonight is there an Enoch in in the house is there an OK in the building tonight amen then I say edok let's stand to our feet tonight and say we will not walk by sight but we will walk by faith come brother Harry come musicians let me close tonight we will walk tonight by an unconscious Faith standing on what the word says you are you see faith is unconscious B said I'm going to say something faith is unconscious faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know if that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm the gals knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth and the word must be fulfilled and he know that his life was here to fulfill it and that's you you're here to fulfill you're here to fulfill the word that's spoken for this hour God never placed us here to fail he placed us here to fulfill the predestinated word for a predestinated season for a predestinated people and we will walk unconscious a fear from the world come on somebody a fear from communism from fear from the Democrats or the Republicans a fear of missing the Rapture a fear of not being no good because the word's done said who we are he's done revealed to us who we are as we walk in Christ we walk in him not paying attention to the left or to the right just keep on moving just keep on walking walking in the light as he reveals the light from glory to glory to glory if we spent more time praising him than we did worrying we would be so much better off amen hallelujah hallelujah and I say to you that little bride if you're sick walk with God if the doctor says you can't get well walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die don't listen to that just walk with God just keep walking with God hallelujah if you got depression walk with God if your neighbors don't like you walk with God if they laugh at you at Walmart just keep walking with God just keep walking get your eyes on him Hallelujah keep your eyes on him he will change our bodies one day just like Enoch he walked with God till he walked all the way home Hallelujah you can't get well walk with God for God has promised us God has promised us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you said brother I feel so alone I don't have a friend in the world that's simply not true you got a great friend he said I'll never leave you I forsake you I'll be with you I'll be with you even to the end of the world oh little bride let's walk together as we walk with him you see it's an individual walk but we walk together individually as a body you see it's Christ in me helping you and it's Christ in you helping me that's the way God orchestrated it to me that I may not have faith for my family but I can have faith for yours and you may not have faith for your family but I can have it for yours and it's you helping me and me helping you and that's the body on the earth operating making him the same yesterday today and forever like the eagle in the blowdown he knew he knew he could lift above the chatter it was an unconscious Faith he knew he could do it because his genetics said he could do it you know somebody told me the other day you look more like your daddy every day and somebody said as long as you're living your mom will never be dead some people say I look like my daddy most people say I look like my mama everybody says Aiden looks like me but you know when I did my DNA I found out you get 50% of your DNA comes from your daddy and 50% of your DNA comes from your mama that's why some people see your mama other people they see your daddy in you and that's the natural DNA you know that's like why I could have so much well like like I'm I'm 5% Italian like so much seven 8% Southwest Asia 4 and a half% Native American got all this and then my brother he would have maybe something else I'll be 40% Irish and he might be 40% English but we're brothers because he got more of bomas it lean more to her than you know how and then when I got to looking at I thought the natural types of spiritual so 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from God my father and then I found a quote where brother B said we drink from the breast of Eli and we're birthed by the Breath of God so he said you see God is your mama so I get 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from my daddy and 50% of it come from a mama then what does that make us his seed do you love do you love what an agreement that the temple of God have with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them he doesn't want just to walk above us or with us he wants to walk in us that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me God in his people manifesting himself God walking in his people in the season of transition are you glad to be a part of that tonight amen how many here so brother Dar you know I I want that more than anything a deeper Walk Of God I want to know him more than I've ever known him before friends I'm trying to tell you tonight that thirst in your heart for more of God was not put there by you it was put there by him and the evidence that we desire that tonight we know that we can obtain it because that desire is there if you didn't want that if there was no way to obtain that the desire wouldn't be there but the very fact that each of us stand there tonight and say these things these quotes look 99% of this message is quote you know that but the things the prophet said to us we should take these we should eat this and become a part of this amen and to know him and the power of his resurrection to hear him say how would you like to walk with me is God more than anything Lord more than anything is that your Des it's just about listen just lay your hands on one another tonight will you just reach over you can brother to brother sister sister family however it would be tonight am you're not heavy you're my brother you're my sister amen Heavenly Father we come before you tonight God I don't to believe these things were just somebody's ideal but I believe the prophet spoke these things as they come from the mind of God through the open of the word to show us dear God the season that we're living in Dear God that we are the people on the Earth people in this building tonight that will not see death but there'll be change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and father God As We Lay hands on one another because we have the authority to do that as Sons and Daughters of God the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay their hands upon one another oh God we exercise our god-given right tonight as Sons and Daughters of God
