[singing] God, you [music] always you always keep [singing] me safe and [music] give me peace that holds me [singing] when I'm broken. Sweet peace [music] pass [singing] his understanding. When the whole wide world is crashing down, [singing] I fall [music] to my knees and breathe [singing] in your peace. [music] When the whole wide world is crashing [music] down, [singing] I fall to my knees and breathe [singing] in. Breathe [singing] in. Breathe in your [singing and music] peace. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; How many's glad you're a sign of the cross and that Calvary was a success? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If you would have known me way back [music and singing] then and how I used to live, [music] it would be easy to See, it was all about me. I [singing] had nothing to do. But I [music] remember the day [singing] I found grace and a hole in my heart was filled. Now [music] I'm a [singing] brand new man because of nail pierced hands hanging on Calvar's [music] hill. I'm just a sign of the cross. Not perfect, just [music] dreaming. You see, I once was lost. But God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I done, it's all God's [music and singing] son hanging on Calvary Street. Jesus [singing] paid my call. I'm just a sign [music and singing] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; It's easy [music] to see I'm a simple man that fits the glove [music] of a wondering soul that just didn't know about God's love. But now I've seen the light [music] because he's opened my eyes from the darkness. I've been set free. Now for the rest of my days, I [music] just want to stay kneeling at my Savior's feet. I'm [music and singing] just a sign of the cross. Not [music and singing] perfect, just redeemed. You see, I once [music] was lost, but God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I've done, it's all God's son hanging [music and singing] on Calvar's tree. Jesus made my call. I'm just a sign of the cross. Nothing I've done. [singing] It's all [music] God's son hanging on Calvar's tree. Jesus paid my cost. I just decided [music] the cross. Yeah, he [singing] paid my cost. I'm just a side [music] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, &gt;&gt; you remember the little boy coming down the street one day and he went inside the bar and he told the owner. He said, \"Sir, your sign's down.\" So he walks out there and looks at it and said, \"Sunny.\" Took his rag and polishes his sign. He said, \"You must be mistaken. My sign's not down.\" He said, \"But I mean your best sign.\" And the drunk was laying in the gutter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody's a sign today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sign of grace. Sign of mercy, sign of forgiveness. I want to be a sign of God's love and mercy. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a baby dedication today. Brother Jake and Sister Lydia, if they'll bring a little baby girl, we'll dedicate her to the Lord today. Praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Bring them [singing] in. Bring them in [music] from the [singing] fields of sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. Bring [music and singing] them in. Bring the [music] little ones to Jesus. [singing] Wow. Oh, ain't that a beautiful little thing? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great gift that you've given to my brother and sister. With it comes such an awesome responsibility. I believe they are willing today to assume that responsibility to be able to take their little daughter to raise her in a way the best to their ability that would please you. We know that our children much of what they will become in life is greatly affected by us as parents and adults that affect them. So I pray Lord Jesus that your grace would be upon her. Lord if time should get should have enough time and get old enough. May her heart be surrendered to you when she's young before the evil days come upon her. I pray for her mother the fifth gospel. Help her Lord Jesus to be able to influence her. I pray for her father. May she be able to see a godly man, a man that loves Jesus. May she be able to hear prayers and music and all sorts of godly input in her life. Keep her from the evils of the day and the darkness of the hour that we're living in. Lord Jesus, I dedicate her life to you today for a life service in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Congratulations. [applause] Can we stand together? Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Let's bow our heads together as we pray over the word today. Heavenly Father, we believe what we have read here today are your great words. You inspired men that they would be able to write the Bible. We know and are able to hear as we turn from page to page, chapter to chapter, book to book that these words are not the words of mere mortal men. their thoughts from a great creator, the only one who could put such things together. Then we call on you today to help us. It'll take your same inspiration to help us to believe it. And then once we believe it, to listen to it and to accept it and live it. For we know that our lives need to be daily sermons, constant sermons after we become Christians, that we're living a life that is pleasing to you. Speak to us today once again from your word. Father, we ask in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. [clears throat] So happy we could be together today. Aren't you glad to be able to come to church? &gt;&gt; What a great privilege it is for us as the people of God. And what an honor it is to be able to assemble ourselves together in in his in his presence. But not only in his presence, but actually in one another's presence. What a great thing it is for people to understand. I realize for a lot of people, church is just going to church. It's a social thing. they don't really get that much out of it. Uh they go to see one another, visit one another, exchange their business ideas and different things like that of what they've done during the week. But I'm so grateful that God is God of people who understand why we go to church and the reason of it. And well, you know, we've been looking at it and I want to go back that way just a little bit today on the attribute and the aspect of godliness. And God loves to go to church himself. God loves to be where his children are, where his people are that he can be able to assemble together with them in order to do things for them. Because the way God looks at it, there's always been special places on the earth that have been set aside for his honor and his glory. The most fought over city on the face of the earth. Jerusalem been taken over and over again. Conquered by every man, every potentate that was coming to take the east. They always wanted Jerusalem as a prize. Still is today. The most sought out place that has ever been on the face of the earth. Why? Because God loves it so much. And we know then that there's a spiritual answering to that, a parallel to that of us being able to come together in the house of God. Whether it's a place like this, this size, whether it be this size over here, u God does not so much impressed by whether there's stained glass windows and gold on the altar, whether there's fine fancy woodwork. What what really gets God's attention is when people come together with a divine purpose, that is to worship him. to worship him and to hear from him that they can see their shortcomings and find out how to be better people. How many came for that reason today? And we know the Lord Jesus himself actually went to church whenever he was here on the earth. And he never found an actual ideal church whenever he was here. You can imagine living now in the first century. So they had synagogues. So Jesus went to the synagogue at Capernium and I told you Carol and I stood there several years ago and they had dug down several feet and found that original Roman era synagogue and they just recently found another city there called Basadia where Peter and Andrew and them different ones are from and it's quite an amazing thing when you think that the Lord Jesus would have went to such a place that was far from imperfect. Nobody ever got saved. Nobody ever got healed. Nobody ever got delivered. But Jesus went to church anyhow, which is a pretty good example, I think, for us as his children. I don't mind telling you before we go further into this today that there would that would be a real difficult time for me to go to some churches and make that my home church. If there was churches that was teaching ideology that was contrary to the word of God, it would be very hard for me to go there. I I don't mind. I'll go a little farther. It would be hard for me to go to some message churches and make them my home church because some of them are so far off of the beaten paths of the word of God. But I will say this, and I was thinking about it earlier this morning. I'm just so grateful that God has allowed us to be able to have a place where we can come together, worship him, see God, not only read about what God did, but see God doing the same things that he's always done. And I trust that we always count that a great honor. In Luke 4:1 16, speaking of Jesus, he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and as his custom was. Now, Luke wasn't actually there, of course, at the birth of the Lord Jesus. And Luke wasn't one of the original 12. Luke actually came in years afterwards. So, Luke must have found this out. Part of it by divine inspiration, but part of it by going around and talking to people that was around Jesus. So Luke had found this out somehow that it was the custom of the Lord Jesus to go to church. So it wasn't something that Jesus visited, you know, twice a year, three times a year, but a custom was something that you do over and over and over again. Now, can you imagine going to church over and over and over and over and over again? You saw nobody healed, nobody saved, nobody delivered, but you kept on going anyhow. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Now, you see, Jesus went because he knew there was one good thing that he could get out of the service. He heard the word being read. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, would that be worth it to us to get up, get ready, and drive to church just to hear the word be read? &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, you see what that shows me? It shows me that Jesus had a reverence and an honor and a sacredness for church that most of us don't have. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; The sacredness was knowing God's word was going to be there and that it was going to be read. But many folks go to church out of selfish ideas. What am I going to get? What am I going to take from the service? How am I going to be helped? Are they going to sing my songs? My favorite preacher going to preach? And church really ain't about God. And it's not really about them ministering to others. It's about will the service suit them &gt;&gt; and will their favorite people and I hope sister so and so is wearing that dress and I hope brother Donnie wears that suit I like. And you know is brother Donnie preaching today? Oh, I hope he is because if he ain't there, I'm not sure I can get anything. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is going to be read and the preacher, you may not get five five words out of what he has to say, but if he reads one scripture, you ought to be saying, \"Boy, wasn't that scripture awesome? Wasn't them quotes he read, wasn't that absolutely awesome? Wasn't it wonderful to shake the saints of God's hands? Wasn't it something to be there?\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I think sometimes we need a little bit instruction maybe on church. Now, I want you to listen to this. I love the way the prophet said this. He says, \"And I say you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets her soul on fire. There's no signing cards. God's in their heart. God, he loves to worship.\" Amen. God's in their heart. God goes to church. He loves to worship. Now, I read this one and the next one I'm fixing to read you the last time we spoke on this, but it's so good. Now, you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline of the church, how we behave oursel in the church of God. But of course this quote cannot apply to you if you don't come to church &gt;&gt; because the tapes was not on how to behave yourself in your house &gt;&gt; but how you behave yourself in church. So this is one quote that a lot of the message people will never have to worry fulfilling will they since they don't come to church &gt;&gt; and they see no need in it. &gt;&gt; Oh my praise the Lord. Now watch this. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we got to come together here together and set together in heavenly places. Got to Got to &gt;&gt; don't stay home. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me how people say they believe this is the voice of God on these tapes. And I'll tell you what, they are liars. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about people that ain't got a church in their community to go to. I ain't talking about people that are invalid and people that are sick that their desire is to be in the house of God. I'm talking about people that could go and won't go. &gt;&gt; They're liars. &gt;&gt; I do not care what their name is. I don't care how long they've been in the message. And they say this is the voice of God. They are liars. And all liars go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. and word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, tell us the truth. Brother Donnie, if God is in your heart, you see that's the problem. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can you imagine if you get into sports, baseball, basketball, whatever your deal is about sports and all that. My goodness, in Tennessee is playing, we'll say Tennessee is playing against Kentucky AND BOY, YOU'RE THERE for Tennessee and and then the Mayo, you get a free ticket. You and your wife and your youngans all get free tickets and you don't know how you got them. and you get free tickets and you've got the best place in the building or coliseum or whatever it is. I don't know anything about all that stuff, but you get all that and you're say, \"Well, should we go? Honey, what do you think? I hate to go there. There ain't no telling how many homosexuals will be there. There ain't no telling how many perverts, how many liars, how many people drinking beer, smoking cigarette, chewing tobaca, cursing, lying. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to go, do you, honey? But it's Tennessee against Wildcats, you know, and they said this is the biggest game of the year and and they give us these free tickets, but it would be an ungodly atmosphere for us to go. Some of y'all as guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all's blushing. I ain't seen you blush in a while. Would you let the homosexuals, the adulterers, the liars, the perverters keep you from that ball game? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, you do let them keep you from going to Walmart, right? &gt;&gt; So, all of you now, you order your groceries from Walmart cuz it's such an ungodly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And yet, if people won't speak to us, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; We don't like this, we don't go to church. We don't like that, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it. And the Lord Jesus purchased tickets for every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be held accountable for not using your ticket. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder to get in there and fellowship with your brother. So you see, going to church is not just about God in the sense of you hearing the word and you just worshiping him and you just singing to him. It's also about fellowship &gt;&gt; with your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time you got to praying. Cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; \"Amen.\" &gt;&gt; Notice this message entitled the token. &gt;&gt; We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. &gt;&gt; Notice the title token. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. &gt;&gt; Not just with you and God, &gt;&gt; but with you and your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been missing brother Louie and Sister Glenda Sabath. &gt;&gt; Weren't y'all glad to see him up here today? [applause] There ought to be something in us godly. Notice again in who is Jesus, we should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not of forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. It'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you and your strengths will strengthen the church. Can't you see why Satan don't want people to go to church? &gt;&gt; So, your strengths will strengthen me. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you rob me. And you rob those around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not only robbing yourself, you're robbing us. &gt;&gt; How many robbers will there be in heaven? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Wow, man. This makes me want to have a church revival. All right. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this in question answers. You see, when the prophet went to Arizona, there was a bunch of the message people that moved out there with him. But he didn't start a church. &gt;&gt; So, the people had the tapes, they had the books, but they also had the prophet himself. but they didn't have a church to go to. Now, a lot of people would think that was the ideal setting, but I want you to listen what happened to those message people that were in that setting. Now, I know a lot of times I speak of the Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think that that lets you loose to do anything you want to do. A fellow the other day, I said, \"Did you go to church?\" He said, \"I went hunting. The man's wife come to me and she's coming from the laundromat on Sunday. I said, \"Why didn't you go to church?\" She said, \"I done my washing.\" I said, \"You shouldn't have done that.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is supposed to be the voice of God on tape. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, she said, \"I'm not an old legalist.\" I said, &gt;&gt; \"But I saw you were a Christian.\" &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice this is a message woman &gt;&gt; and they're there around the prophet himself. But because they didn't have a church to go to, it started working on their attitude. &gt;&gt; Now watch, when you lose the sacredness of church and you lose the sacredness of his presence, you also start losing the sacredness of the resurrection. You see, don't never forget one of the reasons that we come to church on Sunday is to honor the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So when you don't do that and you see no need to do it, you start actually dishonoring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it goes to losing its value. Now he said, \"But I thought you were a Christian.\" She see I said, \"Do you know you're putting a stumbling block in somebody's way?\" &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe this and I don't have to do those things. I'm not a legalist. Well, but look, my brother, sister, look here. Paul said, \"If eating meat puts a stumbling block in my brother's way, I'll eat meat no more as long as the world stands.\" Right. &gt;&gt; And I think that'd be a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Now watch. So brother Perry Green and many of you know the history of the message, how it come about there in the west. Brother Perry Green went there and there was assembly of God church and they merged together with another church. So it left this building vacant and empty. Brother Green goes in there and starts a church. Now brother Brandham comes and he wants him in the dedication part. So this is his subject that he deals with and notice his title. What house will you build for me? And now that brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service and take every place that we can. I wonder why brother Brandham didn't turn it into a tape only church. Now, if that was the perfect way and that was God's provided way, as we're hearing it said over and over and over again now, that this is God's way for us to hear tapes only, then wonder why Brother Brandham was not the founder of that move. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't. &gt;&gt; The founding of that was not God's prophet, &gt;&gt; cuz he was a scriptural prophet. And if this message come to turn our hearts back to the original faith, do you think they sat at home and read Paul's books? &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Donnie. Do you think they sat at home and looked one another, you know, and just said, \"What are you going to do today?\" Well, I'm going over to the coliseum to watch the games. &gt;&gt; I'm going here. I'm going there. They went to church. &gt;&gt; Even though in the first century it could have cost them their life. But they went anyway, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that he's encouraging the messaged people at that time what to do about this church. If we are asked and called on to pray, to seek, to do, let's be soldiers. Let's be anxious to do it. Keep the message &gt;&gt; honorable. &gt;&gt; Amen. and live the right kind of life. Don't let no smut. &gt;&gt; It's sad a lot of message people never read this quote &gt;&gt; or they never believed it after they read it. Don't let no smut come upon it. We're living too late now. We're too late in the hour. Let's live it clean. Anybody agree with that today? &gt;&gt; My life, your life, all of our lives need to be picked up before God. Now watch. He's going to tell us what the message people had got into in that Tucson area with no church to go to. &gt;&gt; Our young people just ride around from place to place, show to show, &gt;&gt; right? message people &gt;&gt; and they had not just the tapes, not just the books, the prophet of God was there with them, too. &gt;&gt; And this is what they had got into. Why church didn't mean nothing. Well, brother Brandham made a preaching. I ain't going I ain't going that old ASSEMBLY OF GOD. I AIN'T going here. I ain't going there. And little did they know, Satan was taking the preciousness of honoring the resurrection away from them. &gt;&gt; So the women went to the laundromat. The men went hunting on Sunday. The kids rode around on their bicycles and went from show to show to show. And they're trying to tell everybody, \"YOU WANT WHAT I GOT? Y'ALL are blind. Y'all a bunch of leans. You got to come AND FOLLOW US.\" WELL, WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH? WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GOING TO CHURCH. WE GO TO the laundromat. And you think you're a light &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my young people just ride around from place to place, from show to show and drifting further and further away &gt;&gt; from God. Notice he didn't say from the tapes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say from the prophet. &gt;&gt; From God. Now that's the truth. I see it in my children. &gt;&gt; So you mean the Brandom family was not exempt from drifting &gt;&gt; because they didn't have a church? &gt;&gt; Oh, you ain't going to hear this preached by very many. I know you're certainly not going to hear this promoted from headquarters, but I'm called to preach all the message. [applause] I ain't cutting no corners for nobody. It's time that we fess up. Do we believe this is the truth or are we a bunch of rotten, sorry hypocrites? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many message preachers run across across this very quote and they will not read it cuz they don't want to cause nobody hurt feelings? Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings either, but I'd rather hurt your feelings now than for you to go to hell and you point your finger at me and God say, \"You're guilty, preacher.\" [applause] Mhm. Oh my. I see it in my children. COME ON, PROPHET OF GOD, BE HONEST WITH US. &gt;&gt; I see it &gt;&gt; myself. You mean brother Brandham needed Harry to go to church? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? Praise God. Does this sound like a hypocrite to you? Does this sound like a guy that's trying to hide things from you? This guy exposed his own family and exposed himself. &gt;&gt; I can follow such a man. You've got to assemble yourselves together TO WORSHIP GOD. THE BIBLE said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see this day approach and that much more come together. If there's only two people there, &gt;&gt; you be one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we come together and worship together, then we're just something another about it. Jesus said, \"Well, there's two or three gathered in my name, there I am in their midst.\" &gt;&gt; Trying to do God a service. He's in Freeport now. But this time, people had already began to misunderstand things that Brother Random had said. So he he was calling the people out from from systems and denominations and people were taking quotes that he said remember this is about a year after what he said in question answer 64 and you're in 3 months something like that four months so he had already picked up on it that it was starting to follow the followers of the message that the followers of the message thought well they don't need to go to church they don't have to go to church so they were isolating quotes and pulling them out and saying Well, brother Brandham said, \"Come out of church. Come out of church.\" Now, watch what God's having him to say. This is just a month and a half or so, or a month actually before he he's taken from the earth. The handwriting is on the wall. The second coming is at hand. The bride is being chosen, watered out. Now, that don't mean draw out from church. Now, watch. It's amazing that now he's going to insert this just a little while before he leaves the earth. Why? The spirit of God has already brought his attention to it that some of the message people are taking these quotes and they're making it sound like you don't need to go to church no more. So the Holy Ghost said, \"Let's go ahead and take care of this before you leave.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. Not draw out from church. That means draw out from denominationalism. &gt;&gt; You must go to church. Everybody read this together with me now on three. One, two, three. You must go to church. &gt;&gt; Now, your own voice is on God's recording. &gt;&gt; Now, it just won't be me you'll hear at the day of judgment, but you'll hear yourself. I can quit now if y'all want me to, but I got a lot more [applause] &gt;&gt; now. YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH, BUT DON'T JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION. JESUS WENT &gt;&gt; all the organizations, &gt;&gt; but he never joined a one of them, &gt;&gt; MODERN EVENTS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE CHURCH. WOW. I want you to go to church. Don't forsake to assemble yourself together. But what I'm trying to tell you to do is press into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; now let's change. In order to be godly, we have to love what God loves and we have to hate what God hates. Now, this is a little bit, you know, this this would be a little bit difficult maybe for some people, but there are things that God absolutely hates. &gt;&gt; He despises. Now before we go on into this, let me reassure you that God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. &gt;&gt; God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. But there are some things that God detests, and it's actually an abomination to him. Read with me in Psalms 45:6. And this is a messianic psalm of the [clears throat] Old Testament. Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. I'd like to preach these couple of verses to you sometime on a separate thing. But thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. This is a messianic psalm. And David is actually calling the Messiah God. This is one of the scriptures that the rabbis use. And when they believe that the Messiah will be God himself. So he said, \"Thy throne, oh God.\" So he's calling the Messiah God. Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. Therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. So the Messiah hates wickedness. I mean believes he hates sin. He hates ungodliness. All right. Now then if we are going to be like God, we must also be like God in love and in hatred. But we cannot hate upon our feelings being hurt by this certain individual or that individual and then we express hatred toward them out of hurt feelings or disappointment. There's only one source by which hatred can be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's from a godly heart. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. The only way you and I can hate sin in the right way is when our heart is right before God. Because if we're not careful every time, we will lump the sin with the sinner and we'll throw the baby out with the bathwater and we will develop something against the individual. And even though they may repent and make the situation right, we will never let it go in our mind. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought going to church quotes was tough? You ain't heard nothing yet. But see, God is able and has the capability of being able to hate the sin. Oh, it's so vile in his sight. And yet, if the sinner repents of that sin, then God no longer holds that past against them. We need help to be able to do likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, watch. This is part of God's character, not dealing with angels, but dealing with humans. And we need to be godly, not only dealing with God, but godly dealing with our brothers and sisters and godly dealing with the lost world. Read with me in Proverbsap 6:1 16. Now I want you to listen to these things carefully. [snorts] These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an abomination unto him. It do you good to keep these verses real close to you. &gt;&gt; A proud look. &gt;&gt; It might be safer for me to go back in my office and finish this sermon. &gt;&gt; So, six things that God hates. Yay. Seven are an abomination. Now, it's one thing for God to hate a thing and then for it to move into the abominable aspect of God looking at it as an abomination. So, God hates a proud look, &gt;&gt; a lying tongue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll pay everybody a penny a piece for amens from this point on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all must not have no lunch money. These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay. S seven are an abomination unto him. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's more than one way you can kill people. And you don't kill them necessarily in this day with a knife or a gun, but you kill their influence. You tell lies on them. You tell things to bring down their character. &gt;&gt; Oh my. A proud look, a lying tongue. I want you to notice he's not mentioning anything about homosexuality. &gt;&gt; And yet homosexuality is an abomination. Do you understand? A lying tongue is an abomination. Just like two men getting married, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; An abomination. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; an heart that devisth wicked imagination. So then a heart, notice he doesn't say a mind, but a heart. Why? Because out of the heart, Jesus picks this up in the New Testament. Out of the heart proceedth wicked, evil imaginations and on and on and on. You remember the the scripture. So a heart that would devise wicked imagination. So they think and they ponder over snares and over difficulties and over things that will cause people to to stumble. Now this is an abomination to God. Feet that be swift in running to mischief. So people then that they're fast. They're not slow held back by. They're just quick and doing what they can to to bring trouble and cause all kinds of heartaches and difficulties. That is an abomination to God. And you know what's difficult about it is some of these people right here might have long hair. They may wear long dresses. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are here as message preachers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Any of you business brothers hiring this week? I might lose my job after today. Ah, a false witness that speaketh lies. So, A PERSON SAYING, \"BROTHER DAVE SWANSON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE THIS AND brother Maddie, he done that and that.\" And boy, brother Dave Swanson. Oh my. I'll tell you one thing. Do you understand? If you are bearing lies. &gt;&gt; Now, you might not have even made up the lie, &gt;&gt; but you're carrying somebody else's lie. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible tells us to be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. A lot of our motor mouths &gt;&gt; need to shut up. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; a false witness that beareth wise, and he that sweth discord among brethren, &gt;&gt; an abomination to God. God actually hates these things. &gt;&gt; So a person that would try to go amongst our church or go amongst a a family and so discord, &gt;&gt; do you understand the way God feels about that? &gt;&gt; He hates it. &gt;&gt; Let you know wherever church splitting preacher stands then. &gt;&gt; Now I guess the question is how do you feel about him? So we love we love abominations if we love these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'd say the fell down at the Baptist church down the road got more amens than I got this morning. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 1:14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hatest. They are a trouble. This is God talking now. Unto me. I am weary to bear them. And yet the new moons and the feast were things he gave them. &gt;&gt; So they were doing things that God gave them to do. But now God says, \"I hate it. I HATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\" WHY, LANCE? You imagine they could come back and say, \"But God, it's in your word. Your prophet said at the new moon and the Sabbath and and the feast to have a feast and dance before me and do what?\" How could you do that? &gt;&gt; Because they lost the sacredness of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just become ritual and routine. &gt;&gt; I don't want church to become that for us. I know some of you have wondered for years and years and other preachers have even asked me about it. Brother Donnie, why don't you have communion once a month? Cuz I've been to some of the churches who have communion once a month and I've seen the way they take it and it's no more than a ritual. &gt;&gt; It's like picking up a peanut butter cracker and drinking a glass of Kool-Aid to some of them. I do not want that. I am not going to have it in our church. I'll have it three times a year, four times a year, every other year. And if it gets to a spot to where that it's just common and ritual, we don't understand how sacred this is. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THE PROPHET SAID, I just finished a study this week. 342 times that the prophet uses the word sacred. 40some different times. Sacredness. Ah, I was overwhelmed by the things that I found. sacred desk, sacred pullpit, sacred word, sacred moment, sacred gifts, all the things that he said was sacred. As I studied them, I realized how that that element of sacredness is leaving our ranks. Oh, may God help us. That going to church will ALWAYS BE SACRED. THAT SINGING, clapping our hands, hearing the word read, oh my, living a Christian life, honoring the resurrection WILL ALWAYS BE SACRED. BECAUSE IF NOT, IF IN TIME GOES ON, GOD WILL SAY TO SOME OF THE MESSAGE PEOPLE, I HATE I HATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. &gt;&gt; I HATE YOUR DEDICATING BABIES. I HATE THE WATER BAPTISMS. I HATE YOUR COMMUNION SERVICES. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU ARE DOING IT WITH no feeling, no love. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God even told him, \"Your sacrifices are going to stink &gt;&gt; and my nose.\" &gt;&gt; Zechariah 8:1 17. Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath. For all these things that I hate, sayeth the Lord. Malachi 2:15, therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. Now remember marriage and divorce is very rampant at the end of the Old Testament age. The Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away. You know how God feels about divorce? He hates it. &gt;&gt; But in the age we live in. Yeah. Whatever. I made a mistake. I changed my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Lord of mercy. If you get any choir, the seats is going to start crying out. My my. For one coverth violence with his garments, sayaith the Lord of hosts. Therefore, take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously. Now, hate is a it's a difficult subject in studying. It's a difficult subject in bringing it together. AND YET, GOD WANTS HIS children to hate certain things. Notice my words. Things. Certain things. In Revelation 2:6, but thou but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Now notice how that this church that this is written to in the church age that they were displaying godliness and God wanted to make note of it because it meant so much to him. I can tell by the look of most of you on your face that you're puzzled by this. You think why? Why would that matter? Because to be like God is more than just hair and dress and jumping up and down and shouting. It's loving what God loves, hating what God hates. &gt;&gt; And God God wanted these people to know he was proud of them because they had moved into this attribute which very few ever will that they hate what God hates. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOTICE God amened their godly attribute. HERE IS GOD SAYING back to them, \"Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE DOING RIGHT. YOU HATE NOTICE GOD DOESN'T say they hated the nickelans.\" Now remember this was people in this first church age which had already got under this thing and the prophet says they wanted to get away with that fanatical bunch of Christians speaking in tongues and all that sort of thing. BUT IT WAS ALSO THE ministry the CLERGY THAT WAS TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF God out of the people and make them the big man. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. BUT GOD WANTED EVERY PERSON in the church to HAVE HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT IT TODAY IN THIS MESSAGE FOR THE PASTORS AND THE PREACHERS to be the only one that God hears and the only one that God loves. God loves you and God wants to dwell IN YOU. GOD WANTS TO HEAR YOUR PRAYER. GOD WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR soul just AS REAL AS HE DOES THE GREATEST preacher in this message. &gt;&gt; SO NOTICE GOD amens now hate. Ain't that strange? [snorts] But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Verse 15. SO HAST THOU ALSO THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. NOW NOTICE we move to another church age. So it went from deeds. So they just kind of started among the people trying to divide them and separate them and pull them off to their little agenda. &gt;&gt; And God called it deeds. But already the saints of God, full of the Holy Ghost, THAT'S OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT ain't right. That's off the word. They're trying to pull people off the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this verse, God didn't comment them because they loved. But God commented because they hated, &gt;&gt; not people. &gt;&gt; So hast thou also THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. So now it moves to the doctrinal stage of the nicicoatans which thing I hate. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice in this church age by the time it comes to them, God don't say to this bunch of overcomers that you all hate it too. But God said, \"So hast thou also them that hold.\" So now by this church age they had let some of them people come among them. &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT AMEN THEIR ACTION. BUT GOD IS TELLING THEM HIS GODLY VIEW. I HATE THIS THING. HOW CAN YOU all tolerate it &gt;&gt; and put your arm around their neck and hug them and oh praise God. God said I hate this thing. But you all have it among you. &gt;&gt; So God hated their deeds AND THEIR DOCTRINE. YOU SEE, GOD HATES [snorts] THE character and the ways of the wicked. And the feelings OF ALL OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUS, godly people are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:3. AND I HATED ESAU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Romans 9:13. AS IT IS WRITTEN, JACOB HAVE I LOVED, but Esau have I hated. Now you see the problem is that we when we read such scriptures we evaluate this word by the way we understand hate. &gt;&gt; So we think God hates like me. Uh-uh. No he does not. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not hate the way humans hate. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even mean what you think it does. &gt;&gt; Genesis 29:29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilha his handmade to be her maid. And he Jacob went in also unto Rachel. And he loved also Rachel more &gt;&gt; than Leah. and served him yet seven other years. But notice the key now to verse 30 is in actually verse 31. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated. Now wait a minute. Verse 30 didn't say that Jacob hated her. &gt;&gt; It said that he loved Rachel more. Now, I want you to keep in mind now the way God had Moses to write it. SO, WITH A GODLY hatred in the way that God looks at people and God say, \"I love you. I hate you. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I HATE YOU.\" GOD CAN SAY, \"I LOVE YOU.\" But then God can look at others and say, \"But I love you more.\" Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And God noted this in Genesis and said, let me read it to you again. And he went also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, or in other words, loved less, &gt;&gt; there you go, friends. Godly hatred does not hate like humans. It does not corrupt the heart. It is never reacting out of selfishness and vindictiveness at all. IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THE HEART OF the recipient, the one who has it. When they hate evil, it actually burdens them. It actually breaks the HEART FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE bound in wickedness and idolatry and sin. Now, we've all no doubt heard preachers preach from the pull pit. And ain't a question in my mind, some of them have preached out of hatred. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they ain't no question about they've been flat mad. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't mad at the devil. Sometimes it's mad at me. sometimes is mad at you. Sometimes he's mad at somebody else. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you know it as well as I know it that a preacher can stand up there and burn your hide. But you know that if that man loves you, he's doing that because of the love of God in his heart. You know that, right? You've experienced that. And then you've known others and you just felt like they throw this at you and throw that at you and you just felt some ain't right about that. Some just ain't right about it. And a lot of times it ain't right. They may be saying the truth, BUT IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE. THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT OF human anger, human vindictiveness. AND WHENEVER GOD SAYS, \"I HATE THIS AND I HATE THAT.\" IT'S NOT FROM A HUMAN anger that God is mad. You are you broke MY WORD. YOU STEPPED ON MY WORD. I WANT TO GET BACK AT YOU. NO, THAT'S THE WAY US HUMANS DOES. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS, \"I hate,\" he says, \"I want you to be better.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be changed. So God loved Jacob more than he did Esau. Now watch this. In Luke 14 26, the words of the Lord Jesus himself. If any man will come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters. So you mean the requirement to be a Christian is to hate your daddy, hate your mother, hate your wife, hate your children. Oh, I saw the light come over some of you. Praise the Lord. You're smiling now, Brother Danny. Thank God. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If any man COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS FATHER, NOW LET'S TAKE IT LITERALLY JUST LIKE JESUS said it. In order to be a Christian, YOU GOT TO HATE EVERYBODY around you. I know some people that sure would fulfill that easy enough. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And they ain't a Christian a bit more than the devil is. &gt;&gt; You know why? They can't do it from a godly heart. Jesus is not teaching us to hate OUR FATHER. JESUS IS NOT TEACHING TEACHING US TO HATE OUR MOTHER. HE'S teaching us to love them less. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God's word. Don't you? Oh my. &gt;&gt; If any man come to me AND HATE NOT HIS father and mother and wife and children and BRETHREN AND SISTERS, YAY, AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO, he cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Matthew 10:37, he that loveth father or mother. You see, this is one of the great things about God having four gospels. &gt;&gt; For those of you that never really studied your Bible that much, you'd be surprised how many of these same instances are written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And all four of them will say it a little bit different way. and they're recalling the same story. &gt;&gt; Well, come on now. Folks have left the message for doing that. And I've sent quotes to a bunch of them in scriptures and told them if they don't quit believing the Bible, they're a bunch of hypocrites. Cuz the Bible is wrote the exact same way. &gt;&gt; Now, here, I want you to notice this. Now, Matthew is writing the same instance, but notice how he phrases it. He that loveth father or mother more [groaning] &gt;&gt; than me. &gt;&gt; How many love yourself here today? DIDN'T YOU ALL HEAR WHAT I SAID ABOUT LYING TONGUES? How many love yourself? I'm putting my hand up cuz I do. There ain't nothing wrong with ME LOVING MYSELF &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I DON'T LOVE ME more than I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS ME TO LOVE MY SISTERS, my brothers, my family. I love my MOTHER AND MY FATHER AND both of them are gone. I still love them. I love people that don't love me. And there's nothing wrong with that. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE WANTS ME TO. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO LOVE ANYONE more than him. SO WE SAY, WELL, I HATE MYSELF. AND THE TRUTH of that is yes. And in our language of scriptural meaning and understanding, it simply means I love myself less. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SAY GOD HATES EVERYBODY BUT THE BRIDE. THAT'S contrary to the Bible. The Lord Jesus, the very heart of God in John 3:16 says this, \"God so &gt;&gt; loved, &gt;&gt; not hated. &gt;&gt; GOD so loved the bride, [screaming] the world, THE WORLD. GOD HATES THEIR SIN. HE HATES THEIR FAIL.\" But God loves them. IT'S NOT EVEN HIS WILL THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, BECAUSE OUR MESSAGE IS SUCH A MESSAGE OF SEPARATION AND ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD, WE WILL NOT EVEN LET OUR LIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. I AIN'T GETTING AROUND THAT BUNCH OF DEVILS. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF Baptists and men wear shorts. THEY DO THIS, THAT, THE OTHER. WELL, LET YOUR LIGHT SOUL SHINE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR LIFE. BROTHER DONN, IS IT OKAY TO LOVE THEM? BY [screaming] ALL MEANS, LOVE THEM. LOVE THE DRUNK ON THE STREET. LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOST WITHOUT GOD. LET THEM KNOW THE REAL LOVE of God. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, devil. Thank you. Notice Psalm 139:22. I hate them with perfect hatred. Praise the Lord. Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; All of our nurses standing post supposed to do now. I HATE THEM WITH PERFECT HATRED. I count them mine enemies. YOU SEE, A perfect hatred of evil can only proceed from a heart which loves those that are in that sin and filth and debauchery. AND YET HUMANS WILL TRY TO USE THIS scripture and justify their hatred for people who've hurt them &gt;&gt; and say, \"Well, David said he had a perfect hatred. I HATE THIS BROTHER.\" I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE LEFT my church. This man done this. THIS WOMAN DON'T I I HATE HIM. IT'S A perfect hatred. Don't sound perfect to me. I mean, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have thought perfect hatred would cause you to bust your teeth with your goodness. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It cannot be perfect if it doesn't proceed from a heart filled with love &gt;&gt; for those people who've done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many has been hurt by people? &gt;&gt; This is the most honest y'all have been all morning. I figured I'd get you somewhere. How many's been hurt by people? So, you're going to ride all people off then, right? &gt;&gt; What? How many's been hurt by preachers? I put my leg up, too. Yep. I do the other one, too, but I can't spread ride that part. OH, HOW MANY BEEN HURT, LET DOWN, DISAPPOINTED? WE ALL HAVE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SHALL NEVER BE HURT AGAIN. AND you realize who you're robbing the most by that attitude? Yourself. &gt;&gt; SURE, WE'VE BEEN HURT BY PEOPLE. SURE, WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN BY PEOPLE. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME GOOD, GODLY people left in this world. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN HURT BY PREACHERS, LET DOWN BY PREACHERS. SO HAVE I. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME MEN OF GOD IN THIS WORD THAT STILL LOVES THE LORD JESUS WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS. BUT KEEP IN MIND, EVERY PREACHER, I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE IS A work in progress. Amen. &gt;&gt; Read with me in Galatians 5:1 19 and we'll start closing down. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred. So you mean God would put human hatred right next to witchcraft? &gt;&gt; Yeah. and idolatry and emulation and wraths and strife and seditions and hearsay. So God cannot hate with this kind of hate. &gt;&gt; Can y'all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's see if you can amen this. Then God don't want you to. &gt;&gt; It's not godly. to hate people &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; It's ungodly. &gt;&gt; Our hair, our dress, we don't go here, we don't go there, we don't do that. Oh, that's well and good. But what good does all of that do if you've got a heart full of hate? Amen. &gt;&gt; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, reings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a terrible thing &gt;&gt; to go to church for years of your life and have a heart full of this type of hatred &gt;&gt; and wind up being lost. &gt;&gt; This is serious. Yes. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9, he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; is in darkness even until now. &gt;&gt; He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother. So there is a way apparently that a person can absolutely hate their brother and be convinced that they're right with God. He that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness. So he behaves his mannerism is in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. You see it's the type of hatred that Satan wants in our hearts. It would be a similar hatred that Iran has for Israel. &gt;&gt; Just in the last six months, they have sent over a billion dollars to Hezbollah in the country of Lebanon to build up their arms to try to destroy Israel. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS sending it to Hamas, to the other in Fatada, the other different groups. Why? Because they hate Israel so bad. And yet Iran is fixing to have to evacuate their capital city of Thrron, which holds millions of people, because they have no water. Look, I I realize I'm not the smartest kid on the block, but you think, why didn't they take some of that money and figure out how to do desalination plants or pump water from here to there to there? But it's like they are obsessed &gt;&gt; with destroying Israel. And I like what I heard Marco Rubio say a little while back as he was standing under a portion of the Temple Mount where archaeologists have put big Ibeams of steel and dug down and found the original steps where the people would come from the pool of Sylum and go up to the temple. AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD THERE AND he said, \"Where are all those nations who tried to destroy Israel?\" &gt;&gt; The Romans, he said, \"Their kingdom has been annihilated. THE ASSYRIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. THE BABYLONIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. &gt;&gt; And there's one people left, the people of Israel.\" Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; But you see WHAT HATRED WILL DO? HATRED WILL DRIVE people to annihilate themselves &gt;&gt; because they hate this entity OR THIS GROUP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOT NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF THOSE who've left the message, they have such a hatred FOR GOD'S PROPHET. THEY HAVE SUCH A HATRED FOR THIS MESSAGE AND SUCH A HATRED for you who follow it and a hatred for the preachers. Some of them hate me so terribly. They would kill me &gt;&gt; if they could get BY WITH IT. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU THIS WAY. IF I WAS THINKING ABOUT leaving the message, and I ain't, I certainly wouldn't go to none OF THEM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE more of God in their lives. I see less than what they had when they was among us. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE PREACHERS that have left and preaching and saying and doing the things they're doing and they want to win me. They want to win you. THEY WANT US TO FOLLOW THEM. AND WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET SO UNDER HATRED, YOU LOOK AT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ARE UNDER THIS HATRED. for the Jews and they can hate him till they burn turn blue in the face and bury every one of them. And when there is no more Iran, Israel is still the chosen nation of God. AND WHEN OH MY ALL THE MESSAGE FIGHTERS AND ALL THE MESSAGE HATERS DIE, GO MY TO THEIR PLACE WHEREVER THAT WILL BE AND THEY STAND BEFORE GOD. DON'T WORRY LITTLE CHILDREN. ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORD WILL CATCH YOUR SOUL OUT OF HERE. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF HATRED. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF VARIANCE AND STRIFE, BUT out of love. &gt;&gt; The stand [applause] first John 3:15, \"Whosoever hateth his brother &gt;&gt; is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 20. And if a man say, [snorts] \"I love God,\" and hateth his brother, he is a &gt;&gt; liar. &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? How many wants to be godly? &gt;&gt; Love the things God loves &gt;&gt; and hates the things that God hates. &gt;&gt; And look at things that are sin and evil and wrong and out of a heart of love. Brother Malachi, not vengeance, vindictiveness, but out of a heart of love. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today, Lord, I realize this has not been a sermon that made us all probably really happy and they just want to get up and run around the building. Probably most of us wanted to crawl out. Father, we we want to thank you for truth. &gt;&gt; We desire, Lord Jesus, that we can be godly. I'm sure like me, these people have been overwhelmed, all this that we've looked at under the attribute of godliness. But we thank you for it, Father. For truly we desire to be godly. Lord Jesus, I ask you that you'd help each man, woman, boy, and girl. May we search our hearts. I know some of them, Lord, have been so hurt by people and disappointed and let down, and they've been through so many things. as I sat back in the office and whenever I counsel them and hear the terrible things that many of them have been through, not only these people, but ones I've had to talk to around the world, they've experienced heartbreaking things. But yet, Lord Jesus, we believe that your power can so come into our lives that it helps us instead of being harsh, mean, full of hatred, vindictive, we can be forgiving, loving, gentle, and kind. Father, we want to hate the deeds of the nickelans, but yet love them. We don't want to be like that church age as time went on into another church age. And then when it become doctrine, God could not say to the people of that age, you hate it cuz I hate it. But God said, you have. So they had allowed the doctrine of the nickelans. And God had to separate himself from where the church was standing. And God let them know, I hate that thing, but it's easy to see you don't. You've embraced it. Maybe under the disguise of love. But how can it be true love when we love something that you hate? You hate discord. You hate division, telling lies, spreading gossip. You hate all these things, Lord. So, how can we embrace them and say, \"Well, it's the work of God. Oh, yes, God is doing this and doing that.\" When God himself says, \"Don't identify me with that. I hate that.\" So, how is it, Lord, that we can embrace so many this compromising spirit comes in the ranks of our message? And like Israel, we'll let the Amorites live and the Hittites live and the Jebusites live. It started with just one of the small tribes and then it grew from one to the other to the other until before long in their ranks were unbelievers, infidels, agnostics, marrying among them. What a sad thing. It won't be but a few more settings of the sun. We can already see it, Lord. As I see preacher friends of mine that they don't believe this that the prophet taught and some don't believe that that he taught and some don't believe this that he taught. Well, this this was just an idea in the 50s and the 60s and brother Brandham was under this influence of this and that and the other. I never thought I'd ever live to hear such words comes out of message men's mouths, but here we are. So, Father, we pray you'd help us &gt;&gt; to stay true. And then, Lord, we we admit we need your help. How do we treat those brothers who say such things? How do we treat them? When we see the prophet teaching this, this, this, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, and they do it and they bless it and say it's of God, then how do we treat them? Do we shun them? Do we stay away from them? Do we not speak to them anymore? Or do we disagree with what they're doing and still pray for them and love them from our heart? We need you, Lord. David faced the same thing. It's easy to stand when a bear is charging against you and and raise up against him and take his life. A lion charges against you and you pick up a piece of armament and you take his life. But how do you deal with King Saul? A man who is the anointed of the Lord. A man who is a king chosen by God himself. Teach us, Lord. We know David slipped into the cave and just cut a small piece of his garment off just to let Saul know how close it got to him. And the Bible says his heart smoteed him. &gt;&gt; We need help, Lord, to know how to deal with the times that we're in. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't mind telling you, Lord, I'm shocked and surprised by some of the things I hear some of the message preachers saying and doing. We just need your help cuz we don't want to compromise, Lord God. Neither do we want to get to a spot we think we're the only just us and four more and no more. That's all. No, Lord. We don't want that old ecclesiastical thing. &gt;&gt; Teach us, Jesus. We love you, Father. with all of our hearts, praise the Lord. I wonder how many of you today would just with your heads still bowed, please raise your hand to the Lord and say, \"Lord, I I I need help. I I realize, Lord, maybe I've been I've been supporting things and standing with things just that you hate. It makes me feel awful, Lord. makes me feel awful. I want to be right. Lord, teach us. God bless you. Now, I'm going to pray for pray for each of you. Also, we got this prayer request here. Please pray for Lincoln Hornyak. He's been taken to the ER for continued vomiting that is recurring. Heavenly Father, we pray for Brother Lincoln today. Lord, you see this need in his body, Lord Jesus. What's causing this vomiting? In the name of Jesus, I resent this thing from our brother. May the spirit of God move forward. Lord, we join our faith together as your believing children. Lord, we know this is one of the many reasons why we don't want hatred in our hearts. For we know if we hide sin or we've got things in our heart, you won't hear us when we pray. And Lord God, we've got so many needs among us in the day and hour that we live. We don't want our prayers hindered. The husbands and wives don't need to argue and fuss and debate and so on in their home. Peter wrote about it lest their prayers would be hindered. We need each other so desperately in this hour. Father, help us Lord. It's easy for me to see, Father, why the very last attribute before going up into your love is brotherly kindness. Is it that it will be the hardest to achieve? It will be the very capping stone by which divine love sets on top of the closest connection to God himself. brotherly love. Teach us, Jesus. Teach us, oh God. Teach me as a minister. Help me, Father. Help me to know how to deal with issues. Father, help me. I pray, Lord. Oh God, we love you today with all of our hearts. Jesus, come near us now, Lord. If you see anything in my heart, Lord God, that I'm identified with that you hate, make it known to me, Jesus. May you search every heart. Begin here on the platform with me first. Then Lord, while you're here, go to the musicians, song leaders, deacons, trustees, all of us. Father, go to the mezzanine in the back. Go to the sound room up in the top the audio brothers there in the internet. Go out on the streaming. Father, may every heart be searched today. What a heartbreaking thing to know that we love something you hate or we hate something or someone that you love. Saul developed a hatred in his heart against a man who was after your heart. It shows us what hatred can do. And Saul's love changed from the love the way a father would love as a son to way an enemy would hate another enemy. Keep me from such Jesus. Keep our church from hatred. Keep us Lord God from the evil of rottness and corruption in the last day. Father grant it Lord Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing something for us. Hey. Oh my. Let's just allow before we go here. I won't keep you much longer. The presence of God just to come by our way now in this cleansing, scouring type of service. Let him look down deep in us. Remember, you're a triune being. your outward being, your flesh, your spirit, imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection, and then your soul. May the spirit of God search every avenue of every one of us right here today and see if he finds anything that displeases him. Are you willing to let go of it? Are you willing to let go if he finds something? Would you just raise your hand to him and say, \"Lord, take it from me, Jesus. You have my permission. Oh God, hallelujah. We worship you, Lord. We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to be [singing] like Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; like Jesus on [singing] earth like &gt;&gt; help us Lord from the front to the back Lord God to be [music] like him &gt;&gt; godly like him all through [music] life's journey [singing] from earth to [music] glory my own.

that they're doing daily how much we appreciate it so very much with that being said said a lot of the places where we're taking the stuff that we found so far um we're probably going to slow down to maybe two days a week as far as being able to make the deliveries so brother Michael want me to announce that to you that they will be posting it on Facebook when volunteers can come over and and help them sort through it all and um we so appreciate every hour that you're spending and giving of your time some of our brothers have t taken off work uh to be able to do this our sisters have come brought their children sitting over there in the cafeteria and it's just been it's been wonderful and I want you to know I appreciate it I took her of the I said you know I think it's good myself that I enjoy seeing our youth also coming and helping we need as as the people of God to realize our life is not our own a person that lives a life to themsel lives a very selfish life aelf self-centered life after all eternal life is living for others and doing for others and most of this that we are doing we will never see these people that we're doing it for but we don't have to that's not the reason we're doing it in the first place now myself and the brothers has been able to make some of these deliveries we're seeing the people and some of them we've seen some of them we've been able to see as they come and get food and come and get generators and gasoline and so on and so on but a lot of them that's getting it we will never see and we're not doing it for that anyway we're doing it to help and once again I want to say how appreciative I am for the facility that the Lord has given us to where we can be able to do all that from our place over here can you imagine trying to do this from our old church I told some of the people the other day in North Carolina that they would have died literally died had they been waiting for the federal government to get to them cuz some of the places were going to the federal government still hasn't showed up so they're backs in the hollers and the sticks and all that sort of thing and I told Brother Daryl a while ago I guess one reason that means something special to us going to those places is that's where he found us he didn't find us in the big halls or the great big Cathedrals but he found some of us on bar stools and some of us was in the offest shape that ever was but he and his Mercy aren't you glad glad he's that kind of a God so we're that kind of people so again I can't say enough and I I just want you to know Carol and myself were so proud of each of you of what you're doing some have given time lots have given money there's been thousands and thousands of dollars that's come from businesses and just all kinds of of people that's doing that and we say to them they probably never come to church here never hear me say it but I I would like to acknowledge that as well I want to thanked them for doing it many of the things that's been given have been given because of people here in the church as their business associates and they basically trust them so we want to be able to handle it in of course in such a way that'll please the Lord one day when we all stand before him according to the Bible there is a book I know the name of it it's called The Book of remembrance so everything we do not just in time of flood but everything we do to help anyone the Lord Jesus keeps a record so when these people finally get are able to Res resolve many of their problems and get to a stage of normaly whatever that will be for some of them who's lost absolutely everything and our church will get out of this mode of doing this I'd say we don't stop all the good works I'd say we don't stop being kind as a matter of fact for most of us we didn't just start doing it we've just just never quite done it in this scope before don't you love the Lord for giving us the opportunity to not be able to go around the world you see because I'm the type of person that I am a quiet individual I don't let people know what we're doing people look at our church they wow you know that big church big this big that they're so selfish they don't do this well people don't have a clue but for one time people can be able to look and see oh they're reaching out to the local community they're they're doing something that's just the first time they've saw it in a scope or they can see it but I think there's a reason in all that so I appreciate each one of you everybody understand me every one of you men women boys girls the sisters some grandmothers just coming watching their kids while their their children can be able to help about we just want you to know we're grateful and there's been people of the community or friends of the people that don't even come to church here that want to come in and help so if you find somebody that's not quite dressed up to par you know what's going on but they want to help you know what if they want to help I'm going to let them come and help cuz who knows it might get around us woo something might change their lives praise the Lord let's turn the scripture today in the book of fimon one the smallest books of the New Testament but filled with all types of wonderful nuggets from the word of God we've been speaking about the brides Bill of Rights and today I want to speak to you about the right to a position in Christ the right to a position in Christ fimon just of course the chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints you see people think they can love God with all their heart and not really love his children that's totally impossible if you love the Lord Jesus right you will love all of his children even those you don't agree with even those that you may not humanly ever have that contact and be close friends with them there's people like that and they may feel the same way about you but you still love them you may not like their ways and like certain things about them that's not even the same thing now look at this verse six that the communication of thy faith communication how in the world do you communicate faith that the communication and the word that Paul uses here is is coia so it's fellowship and being able to ajoin yourself that the communication of thy face may become or come to pass and be effectual that the communication so your your Fai is talking your faith is expressing itself how does faith talk how does faith communicate now what she says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual so a person can have faith in God and an element of his word and believe it's a truth and yet it needs to rise to another level to where the communication of their faith will become so it's not like the communication of your faith initially receives the full impact of all it can be but God gives to every one of of us a Measure of Faith then as we grow that measure can grow with us we will be able to endure more be able to accomplish more and it can also become effectual look at the word here that he used energus which of course you're familiar with the word energy powerful active so the communication of your faith may become powerful and active how just by hearing the word no just by going to church no just by doing good deeds no by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so you mean that makes our faith more active more powerful more energous has more energy to it I love this word acknowledging you know I'm a meaning guy and I look I like to look up the meanings of these words eposis we've looked at it before precise and correct knowledge used of the knowledge of things ethical and divine so this is how that our faith becomes more effectual by the acknowledging precise knowledge by acknowledging not every good thing that's in our flesh and believe me most of us are professionals at doing that but that's actually not what makes our faith effectual it's by acknowledging with a precise knowledge of what we are in Christ Jesus of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:8 finally bre Brethren whatsoever things are true now in order not to take up too much time today yesterday when I was studying I took every one of these words and looked up the meaning of them and I don't have some type of special concordance and some type of special bible program all you got to do is go to the Lexicon or the strong concordance you don't have one you can do it online and you click on every one of these words it'll change your life finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things well I can say amen and we can go home if we could get what I've read already this morning will be changed towards the world can I give you the meaning of one more word think on these things I may not say this correctly it's a qu a long long word longed zi to take into account to make an account of now probably most of you here today have a pretty good idea of how much is in your checking account or if you've got a savings account pretty much how much is in there you know how many outstanding checks that you may have and so on so you're not going to write a check for a million dollars if you ain't got but 75 cents in the bank because I'll be coming ministering to you in the jail if you do now this is what people you laugh at that but this is what a lot of times people do spiritually whenever they think above them what they really are so they think they have all this in their account of what they can do who they are so on and so on and so on but the word that Paul uses is absolutely phenomenal read me me hear the meaning of this this word deals with reality if I log isi or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself this word refers to facts not supposition so then a person with honesty with loyalty with truth with all the great things that we read there then think think on these things so you look at yourself and say am I truly honest am I honest with God am I honest with my wife my husband my brothers my pastor my church am I loyal am I Royal am I true am I faithful and then you can think on that and then you look at the account in your life and you say yeah I think I've got $25 worth of honesty yep there it is on my account I've got $25 so we think on what is factual according to where we are and the church said amen let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus thank you so much for your word today I pray father you would help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I know it's a miracle every time that you're able to get a human being into your hands if it's for five minutes or an hour and they can be able to speak words that have value of eternal life because we as Mortals cannot do that so once again I'm asking for a supernatural event to take place in this service today that you would anoint that part of yourself and my life which is a gift help me Lord that I can step aside I pray also for my brothers and sisters that you would anoint them that they would be able to lay aside their duties of the day and whatever they're going through their anxieties frustrations of life that they may be able to tap into the anointing and grab a hold of what you're saying Lord in this hour that we live we will be blessed and helped father I also pray over this prayer cloth laying before me Lord you see this need of this individual dear God they they need your help Lord they realize without without Supernatural intervention they will die not live and they're fearing death dear God I pray in the name of Jesus you would move on their hearts father may they come to a saving knowledge they requested a prayer call Father May the Holy Ghost go to them today I pray we commit the word the people the speaker and the hearer into your care in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated things that are to be the word made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him and you are risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I read all that to get to this all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see our self positionally placed in Jesus Christ so if we have been given the right to have a position in Christ Jesus no doubt it will be one of the greatest battles of our life to be able to get to that spot and then after we are there to be able to maintain it like the children of Israel the historian Usher says the book of of Joshua covers a span of about 26 years so they start in the South SL when they cross the Jordan and they start moving they're moving northward moving northward as they do they're conquering cities they're taking kingdoms they're defeating Kings they leave an element of people behind them so the enemy won't rout around behind them and regain what they took away from them eventually they go to the north up toward the Galilee up to the Northern Heights that the where close to Syria is now and they finally conquer the land now the fighting men are able to go back if their inheritance was down in the South close to Hebron they would go back down there if it was in Ephraim they'd go there manessa Jerusalem wherever they were and whenever they come back now they have to change their mentality they're not fighting to get the land they're no longer running into these masses of Philistines and great Giants and all that by the grace of God they've been able to defeat the masses of them but what they've got is little tiny pockets of these people that are still hid little tiny Pockets here and there and there and it was I'm I'm thinking Joseph that the tribe of Joseph that they they begin to let this certain element of people live and they no longer started killing them well once it started with them it went from there to Dan from Dan to naftali from naftali to Reuben and it was like a move that started moving in the message of that day so instead of slaying the enemy they start letting the enemy live so they're living here they're living there they're living there and the next thing you know then these Jewish men are marrying these women which according to the law they were forbidden to do but now it enters into the element of compromise and God said because you have done this I will leave them here and I will make them to be a thorn in your side now that's a terrible thing because it was not the will of God but it was the people that did that because maybe they figured they had more Love by letting the enemy live remember God is not a cruel God he was not telling them to kill the amorites jebusites Hittites Philistines and so on and so on even their children because God is mean and cruel but he knew a baby amalekite grows up to be an adult amalaki if you'll remember that when you go to letting in little sins and little bitty things that start out as a little tiny baby in your life in your home remember that little tiny sin many times grows up to become a giant how many knows it's a truth from your own life so then they have to change their sinking now they're entering into spot that they're not trying to get more no more property no more boundaries although they never got exactly all the property that God told them but they change their mentality so they're fighting to keep what they've got well it's the same with us we're out there in the world we're lost decrepit blind we don't know anything about God God gets a hold of us saves us sanctifies us and calls us into his body then we find a church hopefully we get into that part of of a Ministry and we go to finding our slot where God wants us to be then why happens the battle changes many of you years ago you battled and struggled so hard with this Habit in your life and that habit you said Lord I'll never get over this but by the grace of God you can look back today and say praise God I'm delivered of that and yet God in a mighty way delivered you well that don't bother me no more and that don't bother me no more but don't think because you're free from those things Satan stops he simply comes in another way sometimes even with some of those things same things to trying to pull you out now of your new inheritance which you've received now it is a spiritual inheritance in that it is a new birth a quick and Seed Gene by the presence of God something you never had before something you never even knew was there so it becomes quickened by the Breath of God then maybe God gives you a wife if you're a man God gives you children so your inheritance is expanding those children grow up now it's a whole lot easier when they're three or four or five years old now son don't you do that don't you do that I'll smack you if you do boy I'm telling you one thing but when you deal with that boy whenever he's 18 or 20 it's a lot different than when he's five is that right so what are you doing your inheritance is expanding and it takes the spirit of God for us as parents to know how to be able to deal with them whenever they get older but what are you doing you're still trying to keep everything that God has given you and it will be a battle from the time that you're born again until you leave this world either by the way of the Grave or by a body change now perfect Fai in our position enables us to be able to see where we are then we can take what what God had Paul to write here in the book of fimon and a the people of God to see and know by the account that they take of themselves do y'all do that to yourself all the time do you ever you know like you balance your checkbook and whether you've got it online and you can pull up your account and you know show your face or whatever and open it up you can see the outstanding accounts or if you still get them in the mail and you do that why so that you'll know where you are just know where you are so you got this working balance or you ain't got that working balance and you're trying to figure out what's going on we ought to do the same thing spiritually okay I'm a Child of God I'm a word believer I believe this I believe that I believe that that's only the as aspect of your account that you're showing on your paper form as we would say but you've always got on the other side it's amazing that when we write those checks that the bank actually takes that out of our account wow why do they do that life would be so much more funner if they wouldn't right if they would just say okay well we're going to do you this favor for the whole year whenever these checks come through we're not going to take it from your account we're actually going to pay it for you wow let me know where you Bank okay but they're not going to do that and it's the same way with trials and tests and sometimes differences that come between us God saying oh Lord I love my brothers that's what the word tells me to do Lord I do I love my brothers and then God will force you to write a check on brotherly love and brotherly love will run through the account and boy the spirit of God knows what he's going to do and he's going to come up and I don't mind telling you there's many times we find our check bouncing on brotherly love I've never had any to bounce on those that get along with me of you oh my goodness those Little Darlings that think the sun rose and set in me I got plenty of money in my account to take care of them saints it's them ones that don't like me it's them ones that don't care for me now I use myself as a big example I got broad shoulders I'm a little man but I got broad shoulders if I do this to some of you it hurts your feelings but sometimes I get tried and I really have to struggle to love folks that don't like me oh Lord brother Donnie not you just like the rest of all you rotten low down mortal sitting you're hearing me today and what happens it's my check runs through the bank and I get a you know it's flagged and I get an acknowledgement as it was I can say on my phone in an app that you're overdown we're going to charge you $35 or whatever your bank personally charge it because you don't have the money to cover that well how in the world is that I'm a Christian I love the Lord I believe the Lord but you've not been monitoring your account properly you see you don't have the right amount of forgiveness that you need for others and you're holding grudges and you're not able to override this and override that and it'll always be those that God knows you struggle with are the ones that push your buttons and you saying how do they know me that well how do they know me to push the combinations of my a and Y and c and Z buttons and that brings me to the peak not of explosion in the Holy Ghost but in your Humanity cuz God wants you to check your account and the church said now watch if we then would be able to walk every day of our life constantly checking our accounts monitoring where we are God help me if I'm short in any Avenue please help me Lord that if there's if there's a check that runs through that it don't come up and fles that I'm short on what needs to happen now when the Lord Jesus come to the Earth we know we preached on this for years and years that he so condescended to our level that he laid aside this this stupendous Glory that was there and he become one of us and he laid aside all his robes and his dim and everything that was there and stepped into a body of Flesh and become a human being that he might be able to feel the way we feel so no doubt the Lord Jesus there was people that he really really could feel close to we know there's even certain disciples he was closer to than others and yet no doubt there was also people that he just you know he grieved and he sigh the scripture tells us that he did and he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and tipped it in all points like as we are so the Lord Jesus must have as a human become frustrated sometimes with the people that he loved the most and those that said they loved him the most and said they understood him and believing you imagine James and John when they come to him and they want a great exalted position and how Jesus reprimands them and he uses this instance in a way I'd imagine old James and John their face got as red as blood because they felt like that Jesus was publicly humiliating them and to be honest with you they needed it because they wanted themselves they thought themselves Superior over the rest of the brothers I hope you understand we still got a few jameses and John's around the message but the key about James and John at that time was they didn't have the Holy Ghost we never find James and John ever doing that again and the church said so you see without the Holy Ghost and our soul we will never have the proper Measure of Faith to be able to communicate the faith that we have to give us confidence in our position now whether or not you understand this the Lord Jesus even though he was the word and the fullness thereof made flesh he condescended Beyond a spot even though he knew he pre-existed now pre Jesus stage he was Christ listen pre human body stage he was Christos logos thought fullness of God attributes of everything God was pre Jesus now remember Jesus was not existing in the Old Testament what is Jesus human body of redemption but it was Christ the Bible does not say Moses chose to suffer the reproach of Jesus but the reproach of Christ what is Christ the anointed one the anointed Ed word so he must condens sin then when he becomes Jesus to a place that he's not living operating thinking overcoming doing all that with the fullness of Christos in his soul because how can you and I be compared to him so if we would be compared to him him was all of that great power and that's the way he overcome and then he' turn and tell us be of good Comfort I've overcome the world you said well sure you could because you've got the fullness of God in you well and yet that gives you a great Advantage but he overcome as a man with the Holy Ghost he did not overcome The Temptations of Matthew 4 as God he did not die on the cross as God but as a man so Jesus himself actually allowed himself to to be deprived of the dependency to depend on and overcome by this preexistence thought of Christ so he overcomes as Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost now in order to accomplish this you say why in the world would he do that so he could come back to the state of perfect faith in who he was now remember he was not born of the Virgin with that state remember they they they never called him Jesus Christ at his birth but Thou shalt call his name why he was not Christos at his birth that did not happen to 30 years later then the father come in Him Praise the Lord now then becomes Jesus Christ as a matter of fact you'll never even find him being referred to in the four gospels as the Lord Jesus Christ he never gained that title till after the resurrection Lord father Jesus man Christ Christo anointed word so he allows himself to be on this Earth for this period of time and he actually steps apart from these great attributes and he allows himself to be grown into a measure of perfect Faith so it's not like that he looked at it and said oh I know who I am I know everything about me I know all my trials are over I know all my tests is over I knew I pre-existed I knew I was the word I am the one who created all things all things were made by me and for me and without anything made that was made but he actually stepped back from that him himself and allowed himself to grow Luke 2:52 he grew in wisdom and understanding before God and man so the Lord Jesus would have to read the word and whenever he read the word about scriptures pertaining to himself and actually gave him face wow yes sir the very author of Faith himself had to grow in faith notice this oh my I love this perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him and he said now and my I can do nothing I can do nothing but it's my facei in God and God was in him and the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you amen it's made manifest for you are a Believer listen this this is why I do not believe every person that says they are a Believer is this kind of believer believer and a Believer is the Fai of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that's a real believer you like that you like that I like I like like the teaching of where we can see what faith really is now turn with me if you would to Genesis 3:1 let's let's look back at the Garden of Eden now and whenever Satan come against the first human being on the earth now remember they were positionally placed in the Garden of Eden Adam was placed first years later years and years and years after God had stopped creating he brings Eve into existence now watch the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I want you to notice this is not a talking rattlesnake this is not a talking Copperhead or a talking gardener snake or a black snake it was a two-legged snake that's the kind you really got to watch most of us are scared to death copperheads and rattlesnakes and boy constrictors and all kinds of things like that and set under a two-legged snake that's leading you Soul To Hell Amen Brother D now what did happen Moses breaks into this and and he he doesn't go in to what had happened prior to this in order to make Genesis 3:1 able to say what it does but what happened of course we know was that Satan had a soul but the serpent did not have a soul but he had a place for a soul and Satan is wanting to inject himself into the human race he's wanting the Earth he's wanting a domain by now the Angels had already fallen and Satan had went over on the north side of heaven and preached to the angels and exalted himself above them and so many of them pulled away from the kingdom of Michael which was Christ and they joined over there where were they what Dominion what domain I I don't know I'm not sure that any of us know but I'm sure that the Angels fa the prophet tells us that God created to the Earth and brought it into existence after the Angels had already fallen so this was a Heavenly dispensation where they were so when God started creating the M the millions and millions or trillions maybe it is now of planets that they have found there was this one little tiny Speck of dust that God put out in the middle of this tremendous culdesac I'll call it called our galaxy and God put it in so many miles away from the the center of the universe and God gave it a moon and God gave it a sun and God placed it in exact proximity of where it needed to be to be able to produce what is called the habitable zone now our our planet rotates approximately being where it is to our our greatest sour of Light which is the sun approximately an average of 93 million miles from the Sun now if it was several thousand miles closer then the temperature would be so hot none of us could live if it was several thousand miles farther away it would be colder than it would be like Pluto or Mars so God placed it exactly in the right Zone where life could come upon it and uh our next main object of light of course being the moon on an average of I'm thinking maybe 237,000 miles now not million but Thousand Miles then our closest neighbors all around and we look out in the night sky and we see them so they they were placed there positionally in what is called the horizontal rainbow and then there's the ecliptical view which is what we can see from the Earth but what's amazing is I've been in South Africa and different continents of the earth and when you look at the night sky in South Africa it looks different than what it does here in the hills of Tennessee now being to Canada and seeing the northern lights and when you look at it from there it looks different from there so I'm told from being out in outer space whenever they look at it they see it totally different so if a person was on another planet and looking this way and look toward the Stars you'd never be able to read the same images of Leo the Lion the Virgin Urus you'd never be able to see it so it's like whoever put the Earth where they did they put it in such a spot that they could look at the night sky and read the story of redemption reconciliation the fall of the Dragon amen Aras so on and so on so God works and operates off of position you follow me so far or dilute some off the horizontal rainbow position is very important to God our spiritual position and also our natural position so the devil had had embodied The Serpent and the serpent could already talk of course he was the next one closest to man on the earth so God creating every form of life and he come right up right before he made his son he made this beast and he give him a futuristic image by that I mean he was the closest one that looked like man so if God made man in his own image and God is invisible well where do we get this image at then God is invisible right and yet the Bible said I to the image of God made he them male and female created he them where was that image Christ Christ so God places him in the garden and and oh my what a paradise it must have been and God simply gave them the a very simple command and God just told Adam I remember at this stage Adam was not planting So Adam wasn't going out digging holes you know and planting it and Miracle growing it and mulching it and all that sort of thing he all all that was already done for Adam but what God told Adam to do is just d dress it and keep it that's all you got to do just go out there and dress it you see anything needs to be done just dress it keep it so every day he would just go out in his dominion and he would dress it and keep it and all my just lived a beautiful wonderful life but there was one sad part about that life in that he had no one to share it with so he lived it by himself and then God opens up his side and brings out this rib and and then God divides his spirit and pulls out this feminist part because she was in him and places this inside this body that God has made which is not in the original creation and then when he when he woke up maybe God would have said to her now go over there and stand by just take him by the hand I've done it many a time with our Saints some sitting here and some that's gone on I'd be the first face they would see after a surgery well I can imagine that'd be frightening but I'm there with them patting them on the shoulder you know or holding their hand or whatever and you imagine when Adam went to sleep he went to sleep by himself but he woke up with someone her long blonde hair hanging down her back maybe real long beautiful hair her blue eyes as blue as they could be the azur skies that the Lord God had created and when he goes to batting his eyes as the Divine anastesia goes to wearing off and he comes to himself and he feels something he had never felt before it was a small dainty hand he actually felt two cuz one was under his and another one was on top of his It's A peculiar feeling within his humanity and he finally comes to him he opens his eyes and he looks there and something was in him struck his being and all of a sudden the revelation of God flooded his soul and he said you are is shy because you came from ish ish is our English word man Isa is the word woman the devil watching in the operating room or from the outside doorway at least seeing a suff thises it this is my way my entrance into the human race the Angels his Fallen Angels standing around him imagine him turning around saying mark it down I will get her by getting her I don't really want him he's Original Seed I can't mix myself with him but I can mix myself with her she is only a channel to accomplish the means I desire I want his domain so now I catch you up to verse two and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die now let's look again carefully at verse three but of the fruit of the tree Hebrew words are unlike our English words they can mean have two different meanings that are so opposite look at this word per this is what the word Moses used for fruit produce of the ground or offspring uhoh Offspring children progeny of the womb oh I mean I thought was talk about an apple tree oh was it a cherry tree maybe a pomegranate mango why are we talking about progyny or children or offspring of the womb from a tree in the Garden of Eden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst Toc middle among a number of persons so there is a middle ground of a number of persons between of things arranged by TW so we've got a man tree a woman tree if the man tree will come to the woman tree the progyny will be Christ but it's arranged by twos so if the right is arranged by twos there must also be another person on the other side of the dark side so it cannot be Eve alone because the middle can only be an arrangement between two persons well I believe this is about the quietest I ever heard y'all mou life children it's okay to breathe I mean it don't scare me you can there you go everybody now on three breathe in and out now listen this oh my my and the serpent said into to the woman you shall not surely die now what are we talking about position so what's it trying to do talk her out of her position I just it just because you find the word the message of the hour I should say it finds you by the grace of God and leads you to it don't mean that you won't fight all hell after you find the truth because Satan will do his best to try to talk you out of your place the way to did Eve in the Garden of Eden same might with every God called preacher every God called Deacon every trustee you know whoever you are just La member if God leads you here at our church we welcome everyone that God calls here that's as a matter of fact that's all I want here is those that God wants I'm not interested in having a big church I personally prefer a small church but I want everyone here that God wants but just because God leads you here don't mean that you won't fight to stay here until you get here so the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die now he's saying exact opposite of what God Said her position will be determined by her response will she say what the word says about her by his stripes I am already healed oh wish she said well the doctor said it was a hopeless case well you know what the doctor he may been perfectly honest but until the Lord says otherwise we believe what the Lord says now once he's going to explain the reason why he's already opened the womb of her mind now for God does know that in the day you eat thereof you're going to be blind lost wretched thrown out of the Garden of Eden you'll never have peace again another day in your life you're going to cause every blind child you're going to cause every man every woman he's not going to tell her the truth but God knows in the day you eat thereof oh wow then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes now let me just say this before I go into the meanings of this words I've eat a lot of apples in my life and like you I've got my favorites but I ain't never in my life eat no apple no Peach no apricot I've eat fruits in China fruits in Egypt fruits in Israel fruits in different parts of the world where I've been I ain't never had no fruit to do to me what we're fixing to read about so then I have to question maybe it's a different type of fruit and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant desire wish longings of one's heart lust so if any of you all ever went to Kroger and you see those honey crisp or those Macintosh or Gayla or and you're just standing there lusting oh I can't control myself I'm lusted I'm lusted Lord have mercy honey send me after church I'll buy you one if that's what so if any of you ever lusted after an apple like that you mean an apple does that to you well you starving to death you ain't never had no fruit in your life or what notice the mean's words now as I said you look at where I'm getting this Hebrew lexicon longing of one's heart lust appetite covetousness in a bad sense thing desired object of Desire oh I want that pump no I want it so bad I just can't take it I got come on be realistic and it was Pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired covet take pleasure in Delight to be desirable to Delight greatly desire greatly now maybe you've ate of an apple I've never tasted before to make one wise I am familiar with an apple today keeps a doctor away but I ain't never found one that can make you wise so she's standing there with this apple said oh oh if I could get that Apple I would be a PhD an lldd A Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science a bachelor of chemistry a oh if I could just get that Apple if I could get it I'd become so wise thank God for the evening light a tree to be desired to make one wise to look upon have Insight so whatever this fruit is is going to illuminate her and what's it going to illuminate her about herself oh you were made for this you see your husband's never told you about this has he he's never illuminated you he's never enlightened you can't you see how tricky the devil is so this whatever this is is going to give her wisdom about herself it's going to illuminate her about herself what she is her potential friends cannot you see the political stance of our day she's he's trying to get her to doubt her god-given position and convince her she's another can't you see why politics in our nation and around the world is identity politics have you wondered and not understood why the homosexual agenda the transgender agenda look look how go sex this sex that sex something else why it started with sex in the beginning and it will end up in the same way so then what do they do they feed this and they started years ago of course not with so much the children but now it's aim right toward the children and trying to put image and slded seeds in their mind even though biologically they were born a girl but try to convince them you're not really a girl you're not really a girl you're a boy and try to tell a boy I mean I ain't too smart but you ought to be able to look at certain parts about you that ought to be the answer unless you're a knucklehead or you're under the influence of this agenda of the last day which is going to bring this world into destruction so what do they do they crossdress and some of these perverted abominable denominations churches bringing all this into their churches and showing it out before the little children why sewing a seed in their mind they not really a boy you're not really a girl what do they want to do change them from what God made him God made you to be a holy ghost filed child of God don't you let the devil talk you out of your place oh my oh my goodness so the word wise on the meaning of this word I would advise you to buckle up your seat belt cuz it may be a bumpy right to look at have insight to have Insight have comprehension apparently all the apples that I've got they must have been stripped of all these abilities I just get the plain old plain old apples you know that tastes good to have comprehension to lay yes sir crosswise some of you people that think you're so polished I ain't talking about you I'm talking about some of Renegades that like to listen to me to pick every word I got to say I challenge you you look it up in your Bible and you'll find the same meanings and let me say it again I put the challenge forth several years ago some of you that's pulling away from this word of this hour I make the challenge again if you're so right and we're so wrong meet me somewhere and we'll go to an insane institution and I'll pick the worst one in there and you pick the second one and let's see your God work don't give me your words don't give me your words you're not known by words you're known by power and demonstration so if we're wrong and we're Hellbound and let's see you do the works of God then if it don't shut your mouth a YouTube channel ain't nothing oh come on somebody don't sit there and get all scared to death act like a bunch of chickens come on put your wings in the air act like eagles this morning I'm not afraid to say that if you're right and we're wrong let God speak for you let God speak on your behalf YouTube Don't Count Google don't count the power of God is what counts and testifies [Applause] dear Jesus girl told me Wednesday night she said it sound like John the Baptist is at the church tonight oh my notice here in verse seven the eyes NOW Watch What Happens let me let me breathe the light part of this verse six let me goad and start the STP again when the woman saw the tree was good forfill that it was pleasant to the eyes in the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her gave unto her husband with her and he did it I see some of you is getting because your face is red as blood oh oh my this is how oh my that Satan injected himself this is what brings floods this is what brings storms I tell you some of the stuff I've seen the last few days I come home telling Carol said you know what I saw today is I looked across the Earth and I saw ravaged by these floods and all these things I told her I said some of these things that I saw we they will never they'll never be changed until the coming of the Lord trees 100 years old trees 50 years old 75 years old this Earth shall still still be bearing the scars in the tribulation period from this hurricane to come up to here but one of these days when the son of David comes on the earth she'll be healed of all of her wounds hallelujah oh children we want to be a part of a kingdom which will never end and the only way we can do it is get in our place and stay there oh dear God verse seven the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked I quote the prophet in saying this right if eating apples it makes you realize you're naked we better pass the apples around again so whatever it was they partook of open their senses that never felt fear that never felt anxiety heartache trouble you imagine the moment that they realized we have been lied to what a horrible thing it's going to be one day when people are judged before the white throne and they hear those words depart from me you workers of iniquity and as a man had a dream many many years ago he was in the regions of the lost and he would reach down and pick up a man and look at him drop him back down and go pick up another and look at him drop him back down go look pick up another drop him back down and someone in the dream said what's he looking for and a voice answered back for that man who sent that preacher that preached him into hell Being A God Called man can be one of the greatest honors of life but to be a preacher that don't tell the truth you couldn't hardly have any worse thing ever happen to you I know you pray for the ministry but pray for him like never before Oh my God and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's the English word the Hebrew word is loin cloth well if they ate an apple why was not it the first sign of human beings wearing masks that's what they told us we're supposed to do right we found out there lying so why didn't Adam and Eve go out there and then they get why get a fig Leaf I mean get one of these little video guys and just s them together and come out of the garden of e and got your Hello Lord how you doing well God I tell you one thing we realize that we uh we ate this apple here and we got we disobeyed the word so we decided that we'd make a we'd make a mask and we'll wear a mask around why would they cover thems with a loin cloth Lucifer got out of his position talk the serpent out of his position he talked Eve out of her position she talked Adam out of his then when God comes down in the Garden of Eden that day and search for his children it was their custom to go to church every day so God showed up a church and they wasn't there so he goes through the garden of Edom Adam Adam where are you he knew where he was but he's waiting for Adam to cry out here I am father I'm lost help me oh my so God kills a lamb and takes the skin off of it throws it in behind the bush and Adam says I'm hid I was afraid I was afraid and I hid myself who told thee that thou was naked and stop partaking the fruit of which I forbid me the woman that thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the fruit so the Lord God calls them to come out here walks the serpent God looks at him and says because you have done this thing on your belly you will go and dust will be your meat all the days of your life and somebody please remind me what have our human bodies made out of can't you see why he gets a thrill out of tormenting you why he gets a thrill out of trying to make you sick so he lost his legs his punishment is bowing down and on your belly you'll go he wasn't on his belly before that's in your Bible right but if you notice he offers No Redemption then the Lord says unto the man and you remember the story and the woman and you imagine they heard a harshness in God's voice that never heard before and it frightened them sometimes the way we get scared in church y'all ever hear that in the voice of God you say oh Jesus oh Jesus I'm sorry why it's it's the laziness of humanity that sometimes he has to raise his voice above a whisper and yet people don't like a preacher like that a lot of preachers that shows and not preaching with the voice of God CU sometimes God gets angry with us and upset with us and he use a man to express and God must have raised his tenor of his voice and changed and and my Adam was looking at him but oh I never heard talk before Oh and evil Stander shake it and oh Adam Adam ad what have we done and as much as it broke his heart he said leave get out get out the prophet said I can see him little Eve lays her head over on his chest she starts crying his tears out of his eyes come down and mingle with her tears and they run down his body and that sheep skin slapping against his leg the tears and the blood merge together God showing the tears of a repentant sinner mixing with the blood of the Lamb will produce the Covenant and the pillar of fire come down and got in front of him and said wait a minute I promise you I will bring you back you see friends before there can ever be a resurrection in this last day the bride must come to her position it will be so powerful whenever member of the the bride that's on the earth comes to their position it will cause a resurrection and a Rapture look at how powerful position is so when Jesus dies and raised again Jesus could not he could not call the General Resurrection before he went to the Cross but when he raised and he told John in the Book of Revelation I am he that was dead and I have the power of death hell and the grave he did not have the keys and his hands when he raised liers from the grave he did not have the keys in his hands when he raised the wiow from name son that didn't happen to do he went down on the door of hell and he snatched it now he's got the voice of the entire resurrection and when his bride comes to her place the bride in China the bride in Japan the bride in Guam the bride all over Africa the bride all over India the bride all over the United States when they come to their place they may not have to be there but an hour but all over the Earth the bride will arise and she will say I'm where he wants me to be and your wife will be send it and your children will be S and others will be saying it and all over the Earth they'll be sing it at the same time I'm where he wants me and he can answered back and said sweetheart sin you're worri I want you I'm going to be where you want me come home come on oh God help us Romans 12:5 Paul says so we being many or one body in Christ and everyone members of one another 1 Corinthians 1:2 and to the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence verse 30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the face of Jesus Christ not faith in him but by the facei of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ this is the way a True Believer believes in Jesus Christ not a nominal Fai not a nominal belief but a believer's belief let bu it hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah many of you know the Exodus walk as God called us out of where we were from Egypt as it were we've experienced the mult multitude that fell away we've experienced the Mana we've experienced the water from the rock we've experienced those wonderful things that God did for us but could it be that we've moved into the Book of Joshua remember the hand that God showed the prophet whenever he led him into the dream of the vision and he come down the hand and pointed to this in Joshua remember Joshua repres represents not some certain preacher but the holy ghost that is going to lead every believer into their position many of you are already there it's not like you're going to wake up after a while and oh praise God I'm finally going to get straightened out all 60 years of my life has been in vain absolutely not all it is is just being able to recognize that you're there and then once you get there by the communication of your face you can have the acknowledgement and allow it to grow and become energized and be God what God wants you to be because of your confession in Christ Jesus I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost brother Donnie will we always be human always until the body change that's right but Paul didn't say acknowledge what you are in your flesh but acknowledge what you are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I may would just raise your hand to the Lord today and say Lord help me to be that Give Me Faith in who I am Give Me Faith so the Lord Jesus read the word and it gave him Faith about who he was no doubt it helped him when he read about Moses no doubt it helped him when he read about Joshua and many of the Old Testament characters but it done something different for him when he read what was written about himself remember when it when he went to the church at Nazareth several years ago we stood on that that little place there and they reconstructed a little small community there in Nazareth and it's a it's a steep place it's kind like almost a brow that's on a head it kind of juts out a little bit and they they LED Jesus to this place after he reads the scripture when he read the scripture the anointing is upon me cuz he's anointed me to preach the gospel and Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfill so what did he do he read the scripture pertaining to himself and it gave him face I just can't keep on wondering if he didn't have an Enlightenment an understanding of what they were fixing to do and they led him to that that precipice am I going to kill him but the father give him that something and the Bible says he passed right among them just turned and walked away how did he do that by faith in his position cannot you have faith in who you are I'm a Christian I'm an heir to Healing I'm an heir to Deliverance well brother Donnie I've got my mistakes and my faults you're always going to have that that is nothing to do with your new birth and your inheritance both of my daughters made mistakes and I had to correct them and had to deal with them they were still my daughters even when they didn't did what I want them to do they were still my daughters even whenever I had had to correct them and you'll always be a son or daughter of God if you're born of his presence can we stand our feet praise the Lord Jesus I love this in Ephesians 1:1 I know you know it Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful am in Christ Jesus that's me that's you Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Ephesians 2:6 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them a predestinated seed will have a predestinated walk and this is it right here good works and the saints of God said how many wants it with all your heart I need more of you let's just sing it together now and let's just meditate for a few minutes before we go on the things that we've heard I know friends there's so much trouble going on and so much stuff going around us and it's hard for us to keep our mind but remember the scripture gives us the direction on what to think about whatsoever thing are lovely and honest and of a good report all of that don't don't let us become so sidetracked with just things of life that we lay aside our wonderful thoughts that God's given us hallelujah I need [Music] more sing it with minute that's the way it's got to [Music] I need more of [Music] you till there's no room left in

but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let it get done right next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts and cut it down and that's my next job is get all my frustrations away can we just for a few minutes tonight get all of our frustrations away get all the cares of today in this week behind us and say God I'm going to cut my way through all the doubts cut my way through all the unbelief cut my way through all the Affliction cut my way through all the nonsense Lord I'm going to C my way through tonight and receive from your [Applause] word see my senses tell me Well you feel bad come on Word of Life well I just don't feel like it well poor you man you look at brother Ron Spencer stage four cancer brain lungs throughout his body that man gets up there and un pukes his guts up the night before and yet he's standing there preaching the gospel like you never been sick and you say well I got a toothache I got a headache I broke my fingernail oh come on somebody it's is time that we get in and we lay into this word and we attend the services and let the new man or the inward man be renewed service after service after service with with a more determination to serve God like never before cut your way through the doubts right you know young people you got to cut your way through some things got to cut your way through some family strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight Church somebody will take that word and believe it's for me it's for my young person it's for my child it's for my grandchild that word is saved today church if it could sa re ball it can save your child oh it ain't got to end that way God is still on the throne he's still full of Mercy he's still full of grace brother Reed where are you tonight yes sir sir I Ed your testimony about 3 weeks ago and I preached the message believe are have faith and believe and I want to tell you this I wanted to tell you in the back but I'm going to tell you right now in front of everybody I showed your testimony yours and your brothers talk to your dad beforehand to get the permission I said he's a bigger boy than I am I got to get permission he mean he said he likes to do Waits I'm like woo I know how big your daddy is told the church he can bench press our church but I showed your testimony at our church and I was preaching on have faith and believe a young man came up at the end of service he said brother Jose this is my third chance so re don't you think your testimony didn't reach somebody already it's done Touch Somebody Satan said he was going down Satan said it was over Satan said he took his family out of the house of God say that he'll never amount to anything he's going down in destruction but by somebody's testimony of a god who's rich in Mercy that young man came and fell on my shoulders and begin to cry his way back to Calvary and he's now serving serving God I'm telling you it ain't got to end the way the devil think and it ain't going to end the way the devil thinks God is rich in Mercy he's still on the throne he's still saving he's still delivering he's still healing he's still oh Hallelujah he's still setting free tonight and he wants you to know Church no matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he

your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed

good all the time amen anyway we we're going to read second made myself laugh we're going to read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 5: 7 and also from 2 Corinthians chap 6 uh verse 16 do you love him yes amen the Bible says this very familiar scripture to us all says for we walk by faith and not by sight for we walk by faith and not by sight now you can walk by one or the other but you can't walk for both at the same time so you're either going to walk by what you see with your eye or you're going to walk by what you see with the eyes of your heart amen amen now 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen oh myall what a wonderful statement that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth said that you would be his people amen that ought to make you shout tonight good amen do you love him you know in order to walk with God we have to agree with God for the Bible says can two walk together except they be agreed and the prophet of God said this and I thought it was so good he said when a man will walk for God and walk with God then God will walk with that man amen when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man amen let us bow our heads Hallelujah Heavenly Father Thy word is true thank you Lord for loving us for it's written that while we were yet sinners you loved us Lord father I pray tonight that you would just take this simple thought and encourage the hearts of your people Lord for truly we're living in such a time of great Darkness but yet Lord you promised in this evening time that there shall be light God we are so grateful that we're a people that's been called out of the darkness to walk in this Marvelous Light bless your children tonight Lord those that are sick and Afflicted maybe those that are weary may you move among them Lord a great way we pray with thy Healing Touch tonight knowing Lord that you're both Creator and sustainer of Our Lives we commit every need into your hands For Your Glory bless your children tonight bless the little bride around the world we pray every Minister ministering tonight use them for thy Glory we ask as we commit oursel and this congregation into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated this evening you know inspiration for a message can come in so many ways sometimes someone can make a comment to you and it'll just something will just strike your heart and it'll inspire you to start looking in a certain direction or you can be going down the road and you see a just a a a a billboard on the side of the road and something on that billb billboard will strike your heart and you'll start looking at a certain thought you know like brother Brenham who was walking through the woods and uh he he's seen a cigarette pack and laying there in the woods and he stopped and looked at the at the cigarette pack and on the side of it was a was a slogan a slogan on the on the cigarette pack and the prophet got an inspiration from that cigarette pack and he preached a powerful sermon on a thinking man's filter and the other day Aiden my grandson was over at the house and after he left I was coming through the bedroom and I bumped into one of his toys that he had left out while he was there and we had it out for him to play with and as I bumped into it it spoke to me and it said let's walk together let's walk together and when it said that something just struck my heart so tonight for a few minutes I'd like to speak on let's walk together Walking with God in the season of transition for you see transition means a period of changing from one state or condition to another and I believe that we can prove tonight by the Bible and by the message of the hour and by the conditions of the world that we are now living in that we are in the season of transition now in our scripture reading we find that the sons and daughter Daughters of God they walk by faith and not by sight and the prophet said a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they will never please God so if you try to walk after the world and try to walk after the message you will never please God and a person that never pleases God will never take a Rapture amen I said if we never please God we will never take a Rapture for the Bible said that Enoch pleased God and he was not because God took him amen but a man woman that will not look at the things of the world but will go according to the leading of the spirit you will find those kind of people are usually in the will of God Amen and that's the great fight tonight and it's always been the fight that Satan took the eyes of a man's head to control him by his head but God never chose the eyes of your head he chose your heart God wants to lead men so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man could be led by the spirit of God Amen and if there's something in you tonight thirsting for more of God if there's something in you tonight thirsting for a deeper walk with God anybody here like that tonight say you know brother I really desire a deeper walk with God then there's something in you that thirst that's in you for a deeper Walk Of God is the evidence that there's a deeper Walk Of God for you to attain to because if it wasn't there then you would never have that thirst and I want you to know that the thirst that's in your heart for a deeper walk with god did not come from you it came from from God he put that thirst on Hallelujah he put that thirst in your heart oh do you love you tonight it was put there by God now one of the greatest examples in the Bible that we have of a man walking with God is Enoch is Enoch and the Bible says this that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him oh God let that be said about me one day let that be said about you one day that he walked with God and he was not because God took him by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen Faith we're talking about faith we've got to have faith we've got to have it in such a place till we'll be translated like Enoch was we of me you all of us tonight we must come to that kind of faith that we can be translated like Enoch was that's right he had a testimony of faith that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God so you you've got to have the same kind of faith that you believe and that you know but you see this faith is that this knowing is not a head knowledge you don't know it well I've read a few good you don't know it by head knowledge but it's a revelation that God has given to you God has revealed this thing to you amen and that's how we know we can have faith in it not because of a head knowledge but because of a revelation what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God for your life amen and so when the Revelation comes we can have faith that God revealed this thing to us because we are a part of what God is doing in this hour amen Jesus himself said I do always that which pleases the father that's keep his word for to please God we must believe his word and keep his word and so is it today every son and daughter of God in order to please God must keep God's word not the part you want to keep but all of it all of it God is not known by sensation come on somebody well I got a goosebump you can get that from an air conditioning God is not known by sensation he is not known by education amen well I can read the Bible well I know the Bible from cover to cover that's just being able to read amen God's not known by education God's not known by sensation but God is known by faith amen faith in his word that's the only way he's recognized faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's how it comes by the hearing of the word of God Enoch walked with God it was a walk by faith so Enoch must have heard something from God while he was walking there was something that God was revealing to Enoch while he was walking for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen now we know that Enoch believed God you say how do you know he believed that because he acted on what he believed he walked with God that was the evidence that he believed God we know that Noah believ God you say how do you know Noah beli God because he built the ark before one drop of rain ever fell amen you see when you believe anything when you say you believe anything you've got to put it into action or do you believe oh I believe brother Daryl so does the devil but you got to put it into action amen hallelujah Abraham was commanded to separate himself from unbelief and walk with God Alone instead of getting weaker he got stronger and when he was 100 year old and Sarah was 99 they had the baby amen because Abraham believed God and he walked with God believing that he would have that child out because God said so he never looked at his body he never looked at it come on somebody he wasn't looking with the eyes of his head he was believing with the eyes of his heart and because he didn't look at his body he looked to the promise he never got weaker he got stronger stronger amen he knew he would have the child because God said he would have the child and he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise became flesh he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise was made flesh amen I thought that was pretty good you get me amens but oh my to the promise of the word became flesh whose flesh My Flesh your flesh the message of the hour not just in book form not just in tape form not just in CD form not just computer uh computer format but the message of the hour made flesh in you and I that we are the [Applause] message Hallelujah manifested on the earth making him the same yesterday today and forever so let's look at Enoch for a few minutes and look at his walk and see this walk that was so pleasing to God that God translated him now I don't know about you and I but that's the kind of walk that I want tonight that my walk would be so pleasing to him that he would say Daryl just come on home with me buddy amen so when we look at Enoch's walk we start to see some things that are laying in the message that the prophet said about Enoch and one of the things the prophet said about Enoch was that Enoch was a type he was a type Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the flood came that he had to give an example now where did that Revelation come from amen how did he know that he was the type that everything his life was doing was an antitype of a type that's right where did that Revelation come from so one afternoon it'd be coming to him to take a walk notice not one morning not one morning he didn't take a walk one morning but it was an evening walk amen Enoch was translated just before the tribulation let me say that again Enoch was raptured just before the tribulation and he was took up and he was not found because God took him the type of the going forth of the church the type of the going forth of the church Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power and transforming means the ability to bring about a dram dramatic change amen we serve a god tonight who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change hallelujah oh I'm so glad tonight someone on the other day that God don't heal no more these Church of Christ people believe God don't heal no more I'm sorry if you're God suity he can't heal I feel sorry for you but my God my God still heals he still open blinded eyes he still makes the come on somebody we serve a god tonight who has the ability to raise the dead and to change our bodies brother Jackie back to young men again Hallelujah by the transforming power of the almighty God hallelujah you know was translated by transforming power why did God do that what did God do that for why did God change his body that he wouldn't have to see death yeah the prophet said for a type of the rapturing church that's coming for the rapturing church that's coming God done it for a type of the rapturing church that's coming well Glory Elijah was the same Jesus body the prophet said was quickened after it was dead in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transform him from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet said in Psalms 16:10 if you want to put it down I will not suffer his sold in hell I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I'll not leave his sold in hell I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that word has to come to pass why God spoke it God's word planted in your heart the prophet said if you want to go in a Rapture anybody here want to go in a Rapture oh yeah if you want to go into Rapture plant the word in your heart if you want to be a Christian genuine place this word in your heart and believe it as it was Ezekiel said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet and the word became the self-same the prophet and the word became the selfs same did not John the Baptist John on the alatus was not he the type of the bride and what did he do he took the book out of the hand of he that descended and what did he do with the book he ate the book and John was a type of the bride and the book became one yes sir you take and eat the revealed word of this hour and you and that word becomes [Applause] one every promise has to manifest in your flesh it's not just for the preachers to lay hands on the sick these signs shall follow them that believe every promise must manifest in our flesh hallelujah hallelujah would you let some educated Theologian try to pump it out of you just let him spray you with some of this carnal science and knowledge and education you believe what God said well brother D I don't really understand it you don't have to understand it just believe it he'll reveal it to you when you have need of it amen I'd rather be found believing it than debating it because debating it will never produce nothing but believ in it Hallelujah believe in it will open blinded eyes believe in it will make the L walk believe in it we'll take a drunk and make a preacher out of them by believe in what the word said it'll change our bodies [Applause] amen hallelujah Enoch was the type of the church he also typed the seventh Church age what age are you in what what seventh seventh anoch typed the seventh Church age Enoch walked as a reflector Enoch the prophet said was God's perfect reflector and type when God was through with him he just translated him he took him up the mechanics that he had reflected become the Dynamics with the spirit and took him up the mechanics of the word that he reflected became the Dynamics with the Holy Spirit and it just took him the word that Enoch believed Walking with God the mechanics of the word one God water baptism reing the Holy Ghost forgiveness of sins as though you never done to justification all these Mysteries lay in there the mechanics of the word became Dynamics he reflected that word I was listening to a man the other day talking about leaving the message they said he'd come out of the brandom cult and they let him speak a little bit and this man said I believe in one God I believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I believe in signs and wonders and visions and miracles and healings I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in one God I believe in the Rapture of the church and I'm thinking where did the prophet miss it you walked away from something that you said you you believed think about that friends think about that everything he said he believed was what the prophet preached oh God he was a reflector the mechanics that he reflected became the Dynamics with the spirit that took him up and we are flesh and bone of him amen amen listen to me there's sometime in your life you're going to have to start amening what the prophet said there sometime in your life you've got to start acknowledging what the prophet said well I don't understand it he didn't say did you understand it he said did you believe it and there comes a time that we have to start confessing come on friends we all the time feeding our enemy well I'm no good God don't love me you know what shamgar did every year every year at Harvest Time When they'd come in they'd slap him around and they'd take his his grain away from him take his Goods away from him and leave him with just enough to plant for the next season you know what chevard was doing he was feeding his enemy and I am convinced that many of us feed our enemy with our negative talk well I'm no good God don't love me nobody cares for me it'd be better if I just die you're feeding your enemy why don't you shut that stuff up and start saying what the word said I am an overcomer I am a Son of God I come on somebody I'm predestinated I was born for the rapture and every year they come in but one time this particular season there was another seed that came to maturity Shamar said I am the Seed of Abraham and God promised my daddy his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy that year he killed 600 Philistines with a nox goat because he came to his position he started saying what the word said about him amen we are flesh and bone of him oh that's much better thank you we are you see we're not a church we're not a building we're a body when the when the when the cloud appeared in Arizona what was it was it a block was it a steeple it was a head what do heads go to bodies we are flesh and B we are his body represented on the earth amen a many membered body that's why he said the works I do shall you do and greater that greater means more because what he did was one body but now it's a universal body signs of Wonders being done everywhere because his body is on the earth flesh and Bone amen as long as we are the bride of Christ amen it's his word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what it was that's what it was with Moses that's what it was with Jacob that's what it was with the rest of them sparking off that word of God the reflector God was reflecting himself and come to the perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him so I say to you tonight what are you reflecting an organization a denomination or are we reflecting him once more the world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen Voice Hallelujah God reflected himself come to a perfect Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him Enoch was reflecting the word that God was revealing to him as he walked with him God said Enoch let's walk together now didn't that happen sometime in our age when brother bam spoke to a storm and Reb buuk the storm and the sun came up and dried up the snow and God spoke to him and said how would you like to walk with me he said oh God I would love nothing more to take a stroke with my Creator you he's given every one of us in this hour an invitation this message of the hour is his invitation walk with me let's walk walk together amen Enoch walked in the light in the light amen oh my someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with the testimony that everything God said he did he didn't displease him for what the Lord said to do Enoch done it Enoch just kept walking in the light till one day his feet kept getting off the ground he just kept walking He Walked on into Glory without even dying that's right God took him away because God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God he just kept walking he just kept walking oh friends never put a period behind what you believe always put a comma I believe this and this and this and whatever else God in his grace would revealed to me walking the prophet said Brothers It's time we make Footprints we can't stay here in this same camp the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience walking in the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold it's like that Roman Candle you light it in the fuse if you walk away you never see the end of it when that first one comes out that's the beginning of the end but you've got to stay there until all of them it just keeps poof poof poof poof continues has the seals been open yes but it continues to unfold what do you see in the seals is it just a sermon is it just a series of meetings or do you see yourself there's a man I believe I think I've told you this before but it just comes to my heart there's a man by the name of bur from New Jersey raised in the Jewish Family wore the cap did all the things that the all the ceremonies he's an award-winning Native American flute player now why would a Jew from New Jersey be an award-winning Native American flute player that don't make no sense think he'd play a harp or something you know some kind of horn why a flute why brother Fred would a New Jersey Jew been an award-winning Sue flute player playing Sue music because one day somebody come to his door with an open book and they told him you're not a Jew you're a sue Indian adopted adopted as a child from the rosebud Indian reservation and when he found out who he was when he found out his genetics you see the ability the play of the flute laid within his genetics and when he realized who he was he surrendered to what he was and he went back to the red path and the sacred way and the elders why that's what he was and one day they told me I was a drunk because my papa was cuz my uncle was cuz Uncle Harold was CU a Francis was they told me I was a drunk but one day somebody came with an open book and said that's not who you are that's not who you are you're my son while you was yet in your mother's W I called you I set you aside for such a time as this the open book revealed to us who we really are walking into the light amen the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold from glory to glory to glory Enoch walked has an eagle all these were the things the prophet said I just dug through the message all these are things brother brim said about Enoch Enoch walked as an eagle he walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day that's pretty good he was an eagle who had been called to that day you know the Bible talks about four living creatures is that right a man an ox a lion and a flying eagle now those four living creatures three of them are Earthbound creatures the only way that they could ever cross a Chasm is either build a bridge take a boat an airplane but not the eagle the eagle was born with the ability to lift off the Earth and God never said Enoch was a lion or an ox or the face of a man he said he was an eagle who had been called to this day oh glory to God hallelujah that just stirs my soul to know that I was born oh the devil tried to put me in a the cage he tried to lock me up but Christ come and opened the door and said you're an eagle you can fly Enoch walked with God whatever God said to do he never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle who had been called to that day to that day you B talked about an eagle that he saw in a blowdown remember the story was out there and said he's just praising God and said he knows said he was looking at him he said at first I thought it was me but he said I noticed it wasn't me he was looking at it was an old ground squirrel chipmunk or something said ch ch ch ch chatter chatter chatter chatter said I a't going just his head look at him said after a while he just got tired of the chatter all the political correct transgender he got tired of all the chatter got tired of all the stupidity come on somebody what was it Forest Gump one time said it's stupid is the stupid does that's about where it's at right now some of the stupidest things they do well amen well you ain't supposed to get political I'm just telling the truth I'm sorry come on somebody amen he said he got tired of all the chatter said he just gave a flop just one big jump and he just flopped his wings one time and S them said he trusted his wings he didn't fought from one meat to to the other from one Church to another he just made one big flop and set his wings in the power of God like the Holy Ghost and he carried him away on and on and on and on he got away from that little old chipmunk that Earthbound chipmunk that ain't got no wings that don't know how to fly that don't know anything about the supernatural that don't know anything about God but all they know to do is run their mouth he got tired of it and he realize I am an eagle I don't have to listen to that I can set my wings I Can Fly [Applause] just set your wings in the power of God let the Holy Ghost rise you above it go on and on and on do you don't hear the Chipmunks No More the ground squirrels he got tired of the chatter oh if the church one of these days will get tired of that they'll know how to set their wings they'll take a walk with God and they'll go home they'll go home one they they'll just set their wings they'll get tired of it and they'll just set their wings they'll go home you see the most wonderful thing about Enoch's walk cuz I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I was hoping some of you would get it I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I'm talking about you I'm talking about you Enoch's walk was typing you God was showing through Enoch what he was going to do through you he was a reflector he was the light of his age reflecting the mechanics of the word the evening light is not the name of the church I'm sorry it's you Jesus said I'm the light of the world and then he turned and said you're the light of the world did he suffer from Amnesia did he forget what he said no he was giving you a revelation I'm the light of the world but you are the light of the world because I'll be in you reflecting myself through you and you shall be my people and I shall be your God and I'll walk in you Hallelujah I'll reflect myself through you that the world in 2024 will know that Jesus Christ lived lives he lives in young people he lives in Grandma he lives in Grandpa he lives in that come on somebody he lives in me he lives in you if that's true let's just look at it for a minute that let look at Enoch's walk in the season of his transition now the prophet said God is just loosening up the church everywhere getting it in order now so they can get into the Rapture he's got to give it Rapture in faith before it can go in the Rapture he's just loosing up the church everywhere getting it in order so they can get into the Rapture so that he can get into the Rapture he's got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go in the Rapture the people that are in the spirit of the last days just like they were in the days of Noah eating and drinking marrying in marriage unconcerned don't care walk around anything else as it was in the days of Noah and if you understand it right the prophet of God said that Enoch and Noah was preaching at the same time so the days of Noah when the world was in that condition it was in that season that Enoch translated it was in that season of drinking and marriage and giving in marriage and unconcerned and self-love take the place of the true love of God and earthquakes in diverse places rest unrest between nations wars and rumors of wars pestilence famines it was Enoch's day it was in his season of transition it was in that time it was in that time that uniting times and signs took place sound familiar it was during that time the prophet says you see that time that Nimrod had brought all the confederations together and made people come to Babylon and come into this great Confederation and at that time of all the evil going on between the women sexually and so forth it's at that same time that God had a witness on the earth Enoch who walked with God blameless it was during that time that this evil was on the earth when God said I'll destroy man for his heart is continually evil it was during that time that there was someone on the earth who was found blameless as though they never done [Music] it Hallelujah more than what Luther preached come on somebody a greater understanding of the word walking in the light as he reveals the light Hallelujah was in the season of transition that they were uniting herself amen he was found blameless he was found blameless and that that same time evil was appearing Angels appeared on the earth Angelic beings moved into men a very beautiful type of today as evil is appearing so is good appearing also notice back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man a humble man not very much of the world but a man who had a heart to listen to God a man who had a heart to listen to God how can two walk together except they agree and there's only one thing that you and God can agree on and that's his word amen and you see we know that as it was in the days of Enoch so will it be in our day you say how do you know that because when Jesus was here he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming and he even gave us an understanding of what was to take place he actually prophesied of what was to take place in this day that we're living in now you'll find it in Luke 21 and they asked him saying Master when shall these things be and what shall be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass when will these things happen and what will be the sign that it's happening and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draw near go ye not therefore after them but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is Not By and By then he said unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places many places and famines and pestilence and fearful SES yeah ain't it something that all of a sudden our government is so interested in UFOs and brother Bon said they don't know what they are they don't know what they are but he told us what they were he said they were investigating angels amen oh god oh Hallelujah fearful signs Great Signs there shall be from heaven and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity and the Sea waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud not clouds cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass give up quit coming to church go to Dollywood every other weekend when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your hands for your Redemption draweth n and he spake unto them a parable saying behold the Fig Tree and all trees and all trees not just the Fig Tree and all trees when they shoot forth you see you know of yourself that summer is now at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away to it be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away it shall not pass away I don't know if you noticed or not have you seen all the buds coming out on the trees the Bradford peirs are all turning white what's that telling us it's a law of God's nature that's telling us summer is on its way huh you see when the leaves come out the leaves don't come out in the winter time no first the buds come out and they start budding forth and it tells us spring is on its way spring is here it's sprung we say and then what does that tell us when the leaves begin it tells us that summer is n amen so you can tell what season you're in by looking and at the trees budding in the spring leaves are on the trees in the Summer Leaves begin to change color and fall in the fall and when there's no leaves on the tree it's winter but as brother Lind wrote that song there'll be another spring amen learn the parable the Fig Tree when it's young it put forth its branches and all the other trees you know summer is n likewise when you see this come to pass know the time is now even at the door when you see what the Fig Tree buding and all the other trees begin to Bud no the time is near speaking of the second coming of Christ that that time would be at hand that time would be at hand at the budding of the trees at the budding of the trees nations are breaking the fig trees putting forth his Bud all of the trees are putting forth its Bud the wicked ones are putting forth their buds romanism is putting forth its Bud communism putting forth it but and your church is putting forth its but springtime's coming oh great master of Life rise with healing in your wings Lord give your servants all power and signs to stretch forth the hand of th holy Child Jesus to perform Miracles and do signs and to preach the gospel to the ends of the world when all the trees begin to bud when everything begins to come into its own amen amen they manifesting who they really are and so are we the trees are budded amen Jesus seeking said father the time has come there are seasons for everything do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there are seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen yeah season is right for things to happen you see it couldn't happen in' 65 we wern't ready but when that last one comes in remember say she may be in Florida tonight when that last one comes in he'll close the book and call for his bride thank you amen so when the season is right he'll come with the season when the times comes it's right for things to happen he said do you believe that the time came one time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment the time came for Noah to go in the ark look Noah could not go into the ark before God was ready for him to go but when the season came for go for Noah to go into the ark God shot shut the door behind Noah he couldn't go in until the season was right but when the season was right he could go and he never shut the door God did God did so Prophet said you see we find that Enoch was a seventh from Adam and the seventh Church age is a seventh from the alpha BR the first church age Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam which is a type of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh so it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture now there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture all other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him but Enoch raptured was the type of all the rest of them dying but at the end time bride will be called out the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age and we are now bearing record of that age we are now bearing record of that age as it was in the days of Enoch so is it in the days of the Bride right we are now bearing record of that age as Enoch was a seven from Adam took a Rapture he did not die so the seventh Church age will take a Rapture there'll be people on the Earth by the transforming power of of God will become about a dramatic change and in a moment and the twinkling of an eye will'll be young again hallu Hall the season of transition the season of transition stand up there where Enoch did my he took a stroll one afternoon with God and walked on home with him don't just to come back Hallelujah not one morning one evening the Rapture of the Resurrection he had a testimony that he pleased God because he believe God and that's what we need and that's what we want and that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but it's time we get away from this fear and from this scar BR B said I didn't come out I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and from the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God it's time we get away from this fear and from this skar and start saying what he said about us come on somebody there's nothing wrong with saying what the word said as a matter of fact everything else is true he said let every man's lie let every man's word be a lie but let mine be true amen let every man's word be alive but let my word be true heavens and earth will pass away but my word word shall not pass away that's what we need that's what we want that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but I say do not be afraid to exercise your god-given rights after all this is the age of people's rights I did who you going to preach with me I don't one a predestinated word for the season a predestin ated word for the season that God would hold a word back for a certain season before he would let it be released that's why Paul never mentioned the seals it wasn't the season but in a predestinated time God would give a predestinated word to a predestinated people that they would take that word and eat that word and become that word and manifest that word and the word would be Flesh on the earth once again which would be Jesus Christ Hallelujah in his bride fulfilling the promise of the last day when he said a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you Enoch was translated 500 years he had a testimony that he pleased God and he was a type of the raptured church amen Enoch after walking 500 years with God God told him Enoch you're not going to have to die he walked walk with God and one day God revealed to Enoch you don't have to die I bet if he told you that you wouldn't be sitting there but he did if you believe it I wish he told me that he already has if you believe it amen he told Enoch after walking 500 years he said Enoch you're not going to have to die you're not going to have to die there come a more sure word of Prophecy a predestinated word for a predestinated season and Enoch believed everything God told him Enoch said I don't have to die I can go where he goes I don't have to die I don't have to die who told you that he did he said Enoch he said Enoch you want to come home are you homick Enoch and Enoch said yes Lord I'm homesick so just before the translation of Enoch he got homesick and I'm telling you friends I've been preaching for 30 some years evangelizing 30 some years I have never seen in all the years of being on the field as many people saying they're homesick and they want to go home and even so Lord come quickly as I have in the last two years I'm just telling you friends everywhere you go people even so Lord come quickly they're posting it on Facebook they're posting it on come on somebody you know it's the truth and God said Enoch are you homesick and Enoch said yes Lord I'm so homesick I don't fit in here anymore I don't belong here no more amen I want to go home he said yes Lord I'm homesick in a season of transition Enoch became homesick he said you walked in this pest I've done here long enough he said yes sir he said all right Enoch just start walking and the prophet said Enoch needed a ladder but God gave him a highway it's a highway Heaven none can go up there but the F in heart hallelujah amen notice God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season hry now how could Martin Luther know about the message today how could the Presbyterians how could Martin or the Catholic Church know Martin Luther's message how could John Wesley know Luther's message how could Wesley know the Pentecostal message or how could the Pentecostals know this message see he reveals it in his Seasons because it's a seed and it grows and matures and he reveals himself Enoch was a type of the church he was a type of the seven Church age can you think of that the seven Church ages there was seven watches and all six watches they slept but in the seventh watch there came a morer word of Prophecy and it said behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and they awoke and trimed their limbs in the seventh watch and Enoch was a type of the seventh watch amen it's the seventh watch that gets the revelation behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Putin's threaten of nuclear war I saw it today in the news said he's not afraid of nuclear war but I got news for Putin he can't push the button until the last one comes in and if he does push the button said one day they'll drink too much vodka Russia push too much vodka when that bomb passes through the radar when it goes through there there'll be others go the other way and you'll know what'll take place the world can't stand it the gospel's been preached Christ been made manifest to the people just before the Rapture the taken away of the church before that can happen before that can happen the church will be gone I ain't worried about Putin pushing if he pushes we'll be gone before it ever hits he said we know that that could happen before morning it could happen before morning and if it could happen before morning and its capabilities are there the things are there that it could happen before morning but if it does this will be the last message you ever hear the trans position oh God's people hallelujah before that happens the church will be gone not one drop of rain fell Noah was in the ark before one Speck of fire fell from the heavens lot was out of Sodom and before that pic bomb the Nations the church will be gone to Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love you we're walking in the season of Transitions and I say to you as we close tonight is there an Enoch in in the house is there an OK in the building tonight amen then I say edok let's stand to our feet tonight and say we will not walk by sight but we will walk by faith come brother Harry come musicians let me close tonight we will walk tonight by an unconscious Faith standing on what the word says you are you see faith is unconscious B said I'm going to say something faith is unconscious faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know if that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm the gals knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth and the word must be fulfilled and he know that his life was here to fulfill it and that's you you're here to fulfill you're here to fulfill the word that's spoken for this hour God never placed us here to fail he placed us here to fulfill the predestinated word for a predestinated season for a predestinated people and we will walk unconscious a fear from the world come on somebody a fear from communism from fear from the Democrats or the Republicans a fear of missing the Rapture a fear of not being no good because the word's done said who we are he's done revealed to us who we are as we walk in Christ we walk in him not paying attention to the left or to the right just keep on moving just keep on walking walking in the light as he reveals the light from glory to glory to glory if we spent more time praising him than we did worrying we would be so much better off amen hallelujah hallelujah and I say to you that little bride if you're sick walk with God if the doctor says you can't get well walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die don't listen to that just walk with God just keep walking with God hallelujah if you got depression walk with God if your neighbors don't like you walk with God if they laugh at you at Walmart just keep walking with God just keep walking get your eyes on him Hallelujah keep your eyes on him he will change our bodies one day just like Enoch he walked with God till he walked all the way home Hallelujah you can't get well walk with God for God has promised us God has promised us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you said brother I feel so alone I don't have a friend in the world that's simply not true you got a great friend he said I'll never leave you I forsake you I'll be with you I'll be with you even to the end of the world oh little bride let's walk together as we walk with him you see it's an individual walk but we walk together individually as a body you see it's Christ in me helping you and it's Christ in you helping me that's the way God orchestrated it to me that I may not have faith for my family but I can have faith for yours and you may not have faith for your family but I can have it for yours and it's you helping me and me helping you and that's the body on the earth operating making him the same yesterday today and forever like the eagle in the blowdown he knew he knew he could lift above the chatter it was an unconscious Faith he knew he could do it because his genetics said he could do it you know somebody told me the other day you look more like your daddy every day and somebody said as long as you're living your mom will never be dead some people say I look like my daddy most people say I look like my mama everybody says Aiden looks like me but you know when I did my DNA I found out you get 50% of your DNA comes from your daddy and 50% of your DNA comes from your mama that's why some people see your mama other people they see your daddy in you and that's the natural DNA you know that's like why I could have so much well like like I'm I'm 5% Italian like so much seven 8% Southwest Asia 4 and a half% Native American got all this and then my brother he would have maybe something else I'll be 40% Irish and he might be 40% English but we're brothers because he got more of bomas it lean more to her than you know how and then when I got to looking at I thought the natural types of spiritual so 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from God my father and then I found a quote where brother B said we drink from the breast of Eli and we're birthed by the Breath of God so he said you see God is your mama so I get 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from my daddy and 50% of it come from a mama then what does that make us his seed do you love do you love what an agreement that the temple of God have with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them he doesn't want just to walk above us or with us he wants to walk in us that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me God in his people manifesting himself God walking in his people in the season of transition are you glad to be a part of that tonight amen how many here so brother Dar you know I I want that more than anything a deeper Walk Of God I want to know him more than I've ever known him before friends I'm trying to tell you tonight that thirst in your heart for more of God was not put there by you it was put there by him and the evidence that we desire that tonight we know that we can obtain it because that desire is there if you didn't want that if there was no way to obtain that the desire wouldn't be there but the very fact that each of us stand there tonight and say these things these quotes look 99% of this message is quote you know that but the things the prophet said to us we should take these we should eat this and become a part of this amen and to know him and the power of his resurrection to hear him say how would you like to walk with me is God more than anything Lord more than anything is that your Des it's just about listen just lay your hands on one another tonight will you just reach over you can brother to brother sister sister family however it would be tonight am you're not heavy you're my brother you're my sister amen Heavenly Father we come before you tonight God I don't to believe these things were just somebody's ideal but I believe the prophet spoke these things as they come from the mind of God through the open of the word to show us dear God the season that we're living in Dear God that we are the people on the Earth people in this building tonight that will not see death but there'll be change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and father God As We Lay hands on one another because we have the authority to do that as Sons and Daughters of God the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay their hands upon one another oh God we exercise our god-given right tonight as Sons and Daughters of God to lay our hands upon our brother and upon our sister and tonight God I'm not praying for myself I'm praying for them they're praying for me we're praying for each other and we're asking tonight God let my brother let my sister let him have a closer walk with you let him have a deeper walk with you let them know you in the power of your Resurrection let them know you from glory to glory from light to light oh God that they might be a reflection of the word in this end time oh God let the world see Christ in them let it see him Lord walking down the street that they would see Jesus Christ tonight oh God I pray for my brother I pray for my sister tonight that that Logan in their heart would be satisfied God that you would enter that thirst of their soul tonight oh God Ray down upon them
