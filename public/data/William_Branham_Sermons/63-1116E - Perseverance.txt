--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thanks. Thank you, Brother Joseph. "Now I believe." Now I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe; Now I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe.

L-2 Let us bow our hearts now in His Presence. Our Heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee again, tonight, because that You have been with us through the day, and have guided our steps. And we are assembled together again, tonight, in the Name of the lovely Lord Jesus. And we are here under great expectations. We are looking now for the time that You will give us the climax of this gathering together, that when You will heal the sick, all the afflicted people tonight. May there not be a feeble person left among us tonight. May their faith move up, Lord, from... and don't look at their troubles any more, but to the One Who is the remedy, or the cure, for their troubles. And, God, we pray that You will break the Bread of Life to us, afresh, from Thy Word, that will encourage us. "For faith cometh by hearing, and that the Word of God." And we will praise Thee, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. [Romans 10:17]

L-3 You be seated. So glad to be back here tonight. I just passed by the door out there, a few moments ago, and there was a great multitude of people milling around, walking up-and-down the streets. And the--the bus driver said that, or the... Pardon me. The cab driver said, "Them people didn't come to church, did they?" I said, "Yes, sir. They can't get in," I said. The people has claimed that people don't like to go to church. See? But they--they... I believe that the Gospel yet is the--is the greatest drawing power there is on earth, yet in Its simplicity.

L-4 Had a great time at the Full Gospel Business Men's breakfast this morning. The Lord did bless us. He met with us there in a great way. They had sold, I believe they said, seventeen hundred tickets, and they let in three hundred more, and then they couldn't let no one in no more, and they stood in the aisles and around the doors. And--and the Lord, when we made the altar call, gave us many, to rise, to receive Eternal Life. So that we're very thankful for.

L-5 And--and then I want to thank some brother. He couldn't get in out there, I don't think. And he--he gave Billy, a while ago, a carton of.22 bullets, for me. And I got them back here. I'll enjoy them, sure. Thank you very much, if you're outside and can hear it, or inside, whichever it is. I certainly...

L-6 That's been a great blessing to me, sometimes, target shooting. And, now, you have to have something to kind of let off the pressure. And so that's the way I do it, sometime when I get a chance, and can, why, I run out to the range and shoot a little while, just merely to let off the steam. You... I believe Jesus said, "Let's come apart into the wilderness a while." [Mark 6:31]

L-7 Now, we love you so much! And tomorrow is Sunday, and everyone wants to go to church on Sunday. And I know, or pretty sure, you all know where the--the (I try to say stone church, it's) Rock Church is. That's the church that's sponsoring this meeting, I guess, and others are visiting here. And you strangers that's out of town, that's come in to the meeting, and if you don't... Now if you have a post of duty, you go there. That's what you're supposed to do. Always stand at your post of duty. That's your--that's your duty to God and to your pastor, to the rest of the congregation. But if you don't have any place to go, I'm sure you would be certainly welcome at the Rock Church, for the... I guess they've announced the services.

L-8 And--and you people that get saved in these meetings, we never know. Now, we usually make an altar call, what we call an altar call, see, and that's--that's all right. I have nothing against that. That's good. But I believe, if you'll remember the Scripture, they--they didn't have an altar call. "As many as believed, see, they were added to the church." Believers! [Acts 5:14]

L-9 And--and if you don't have a church, well, I'm sure that Brother Vick would welcome you to his church, or any of 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min these other men around here. If you haven't had Christian baptism yet, consult them. And don't stop. Just keep on going, just keep pressing on.

L-10 We never know, never even know how many is healed. And you pastors, brethren, just remember, when the meeting is over, maybe weeks, somebody come up to you, like a little lady, and say, "You know, I used to have a lady's trouble. It isn't there no more." Somebody, "I--I, you know, all at once, I just didn't want no more cigarettes. It just all left me." See? They, they're healed, so many, you can't call them. See, it's just everywhere. And I've never had a meeting yet but what that was the results afterwards, where the Lord healed the people and they wasn't conscious of it right then, but they--they got all right. And first thing you know, they was, they just get up and walk away, and it's all over. But maybe they don't understand it right then, but, it's, by-and-by it's over.

L-11 I remember, in Finland, long ago. I guess there is Finnish people here. There was a little boy had been raised from the dead. You probably read--read the book of it. The news went in, all into Russia. But I saw it in a vision before it happened, two years, and told it across the nation.

L-12 I remember that little Finnish girl, that night standing out there in the hall, and she had one leg was about six or eight inches shorter than the other one. She had a big built up shoe, with a--a strap around her, and one in her toe, a little hook. And she had the--the belt over her shoulder, and come across this way and down into the toe of her shoe. She had two crutches. And poor little ragged-looking fellow. And every time she would go to move, she'd have to lift that foot up with her shoulder, that strap; and then shove it out like that, and set it down, and then put the crutch down. And we had to...

L-13 We was at what they call (now the Finnish brother, sister here, I--I don't pronounce this right) Messuhalli, and it run all the alphabets. And they would let about twenty thousand come in, or whatever it was; and then had them go out, and then let me speak to another twenty thousand.

L-14 And the little boy had been raised from the dead, at Kuopio, had been killed by an automobile. And, oh, my! They don't broadcast rock-and-roll and things there, it's just news and things, so this got on the news. And they come all the way from Russia, up in there.

L-15 And, I seen, that night. That was right after the war, about five years, I guess, after the war. And I seen Russian soldiers and Finnish soldiers, with their arms around one another, loving each another, patting each other on the back. Anything will make a Russian pat a Finn, will settle wars, that takes the love of Jesus Christ to do that.

L-16 But those great big communistic soldiers standing there! We passed by a group of little Finnish soldiers, little fellows had never shaved yet, just slickfaced, with them big boots on, coming down the street, watching the people. They was just crowded on both sides, for city blocks. And those soldiers standing at attention, the tears run off their cheeks. They said, "We'll receive a God that can raise the dead." See? They're human beings like we are.

L-17 But what it is, thing that professes Christianity and doesn't produce any results, they lay it aside. They want some reality. See, that's the reason communism has raised up, because the let down of the church. The church is guilty of communism, because it was the one who let down. And now just think, only one percent of Russia now is communist, one percent. Ninety-nine percent of the people are still Christian. What they need is a real on Fire, with a prophet with THUS SAITH THE LORD. That, see, that would drive the communistic force into the sea. What we need, is, they need the real Christianity.

L-18 And these Russian soldiers standing there that night, I come into a little vestibule and into a little hall. And this little girl, I'll never forget her, she was--she was little ragged hair and little skirts ragged. And she had come out of the--the ladies' room. And they were told not to bother me.

L-19 I'd get out on the street and buy candy. I--I have children, myself, and I--I like children. I think anybody that doesn't like children, there is something wrong with them. And so these little fellows, I'd have a string a half a block long, following me. I'd give them candy. They would give me some of that money there, and it was no good here, great big bills like that, and I'd buy candy. I don't know what I was buying, but I give it to them. And then they asked them on the streets, you know, if I walked around, just kind of go ahead and ignore me, I guess, so get a little exercise. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-20 And then when I come in that night, that little girl thought she had done something wrong, and I know she had ducked her little head. And she looked up out of her little blue eyes, and she was going to see what I was going to say.

L-21 And the two soldiers in front of me, had went on to the door. And they were singing Only Believe. Two more was behind me. I motioned to them, "stop."

L-22 I wanted to see what that child would do. She was about, I guess, about eight years old, ten. I learned later, she was a little, Finnish, war orphan. Her father and mother had been killed in the Russian war. And so I--I looked at the little fellow, and--and she had these crutches. And she thought that I'd... she had done something wrong, you know.

L-23 And I looked at her. I said, "You want to see me?" And, course, she couldn't understand English. And I motioned my finger to her, come over there. And she raised up her head and looked kind of childish like. She put these little crutches out, and raised her little limb up, kind of like that. And here she come, walking over.

L-24 I thought, "I'll just see what the child does." And I just stood there like that. And she got real close to me, and she looked at me; and looked up like that, and looked down. I thought, "I'll just see what she does." And she picked up my coat, looked at it in her hand, and kissed my coat pocket, and put her hand down.

L-25 I was going to say to her, "my little sister," I didn't know how to talk. And I looked out in front, I seen her running down the street, just as normally as any child. And I said now, I couldn't talk to her, I said, "Honey, Jesus Christ makes you well."

L-26 And she pulled her little skirt out, typical little Finnish, and said, "Kiitos." That means, "thank you," see, for kissing the pocket. I--I believe, if I'd have been the biggest hypocrite in the world, God would have honored that child's faith.

L-27 And so she, I thought, "Well, she'll find it out, after a while, anyhow. See, it'll go on, she'll be all right, 'cause I done seen her in the vision." It has to be! What I tell, it just it has to be.

L-28 So that night, there had been so many things the Lord had did, and I was just about ready to leave. And I said, "Well, just call a few more."

L-29 And my brother said, "No," said, "you're..." And Brother Baxter said, "You're worn out now, Brother Branham." Said, "Now, you just--you just quit now, come on, 'cause we got to go somewhere else." And said, "You just..."

L-30 I said, "Well, I just feel maybe to have about four or five more, there is so many here."

L-31 And so the next one in the prayer line was that little girl. The Lord just knows how to work things just right. So I said, "Mrs. Isaacson..." She may be here now. She was my voice of Finland. And so I said, "Now you just say the words that I say." She said, "All right."

L-32 And I said, "Honey, the Lord Jesus healed you, rewarded you out there, for that what you did." I said, "Now you go over there and have some of the men to take those braces off. Just watch what happens." And she hobbled across the platform. And I kept on with the rest of them.

L-33 In a few moments, here she come with the shoes, braces over her head; just as normal, both limbs as good as could be, and running up-and-down the steps. See, faith, faith, love finds its place. That's right.

L-34 I had a little experience today, and just show you what fellowship means. I, the last time here in New York, or I was over here to Brother Hudson, I think, in... That one, I don't think that was in New York. That's, I don't know which is New York around here. And just all New York, to me, all the way from Tucson here, looks to be.

L-35 So then I used to come here with Sister Brown and Brother Berg. I'm sure many of you know them. And I've been trying to get a hold of that dear old saint, for the last day or two. And there was no one in church, and then today I got her on the phone. I got a hold of the janitor. And, well, I thought I was talking to a sixteen-year-old girl, she's got so much spring in her voice. I said, "Sister Brown, you would never guess, in a--in a month of Sunday's, who this is." And she said, "Bless your heart, I sure wouldn't."

L-36 And just as happy as she could be. I said, "Brother Branham," and she just started screaming; just such a sweet old 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min thing.

L-37 And she is eighty-three years old, and preaches twice a week. And just think, she entered the ministry before I was born. And I was about ready to give up; I thought I was getting so old, you know. I took new courage.

L-38 And I told her I was here with Brother Vick over here. And the nice things that she said about Brother Vick! I tell you, that--that makes... That's real Christianity. Both of them big churches, right here in New York, no competition among them, you see, just really brothers and sisters in Christ. I tell you, that means a whole lot for the pastor, you know. Both of them here, old churches established like this, and still just brother and sister, working hand in hand. That's the way we should do it. That's very fine. I think that's complimentary to Brother Vick, of his great work here for the Lord, and his great feelings for others, and both of them. The Lord let them live a long, long time yet.

L-39 And, Brother Vick, I thought we were getting pretty old, but we are children yet, see. We're just children.

L-40 I remember Brother Bosworth when he was dying, he was eighty-four. I said, I liked to a burnt my old car up, from getting down there to see him. Then I seen him raise up, his little bald head, he raised his arms out like that. I just fell right in his arms, and screamed, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!" And I said, "Brother Bosworth, I want to ask you," I said, "are you sick?" Said, "No." I said, "Well, what's the matter?"

L-41 He said, "I'm just going Home." Yeah, you know his sense of humor.

L-42 And I--I said, "Well, Brother Bosworth," I said, "I'd like to ask you something. When was your best time?" He said, "Right now." And I said, "Yet you know you're dying?"

L-43 He said, "I can't die." Said, "I died about seventy years ago," he said. He said, "I--I'm a new creature in Christ." And he said, "Brother Branham, all that I have lived for, for the past sixty years, has been the Lord Jesus. And, any minute, I'm looking for Him to walk in the door and go with Him for Eternity." I thought.

L-44 I remember Paul Rader. How many can? Many remember Paul when he died out there. And they called, they had the... Moody Bible Institute, I believe, sent down a--a little quartet to sing for him. And they were singing Nearer, My God, To Thee, you know. And he said... He had a sense of humor, you know. He said, "Who is dying, me or you?" he said. He said, "Say," said, "raise up them shades, and sing me some, sing me some good snappy Gospel song."

L-45 And they got to singing, "Down at the cross where my Saviour died, down there for cleansing from sin I cried!"

L-46 He said, "That sounds better." Said, "Where is my brother, Luke?"

L-47 "Well, Luke didn't want to see his brother die, so he was in the next room." Said, "Go get him."

L-48 And Luke and Paul travel together, like Billy Paul, my son and I travel together.

L-49 And Luke come in, tried to brace himself up, and took a hold of Paul's hand. Paul reached up and got him, said, "Luke, we've come a long ways together, haven't we, brother?" He said, "Yes."

L-50 Said, "But think of it! In five minutes from now, I'll be standing in the Presence of Jesus Christ, clothed in His righteousness." Oh, my! That's that.

L-51 Let me go like that. That's it, clothed in His righteousness! In five minutes from the time he was holding his brother's hands, "I'll be standing in the Presence of Jesus Christ, clothed in His righteousness." He squeezed his brother's hands, and went to meet Him. Oh, my, what a day that'll be, them gallant soldiers!

L-52 See, I stand here and talk to you, and all my time is gone, and guess that's the way it goes. Nine o'clock, but I'm going to hurry, tonight, sure enough. Just got just a few little Scriptures.

L-53 I write down Scriptures and know where to refer to it next. Sometime make a... write out a name, and then ask 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min Brother Vayle what it means, 'fore I come in, you know. I might get it out of the Bible here, and he tell me how to pronounce it. And so I lack a whole lot in education.

L-54 But I promised tonight to pray for the sick. And now my main purpose, my--my meetings, is the reason I don't have too many times; once or twice, maybe, during a campaign, I'll bring the people up like I'm going to tonight, without the discerning, because just to lay hands on the sick. Many people believe that. Now, that, that's--that's good. That's the Scripture. See? But you remember, that was kind of the Jewish tradition. See, Jairus said, "Come lay Your hands upon my daughter, and she'll live." [Mark 5:23]

L-55 But the Roman said, "I'm not worth that You come under my roof. Just speak the Word!" Watch what he testified. Said, "I'm a man under authority." He was a centurion. "And I--I say to this man, 'goes' and he go. And this one 'comes,' and he comes." What was he testifying? That just Jesus' Word was enough to heal his servant; He had power over all sickness. "You just say the Word, my servant will live." [Matthew 8:8-10]

L-56 He turned around and said, "I never found faith like that in Israel." See? Now that's where I try to get the people to believe.

L-57 You know, many people say, "Oh, glory to God, Brother So-and-so laid hands on me, hallelujah, I got well!" That kind of looks like the brother had something to do with it. See?

L-58 Now if you can just recognize the Presence of Jesus Christ, see, and let... It's His hands that counts, see. And just accept Him, then nobody laid hands on you but Christ. See? You touched Him, and His hands touched you, see. And no man gets praise anywhere. It's all the praise... Cause, that's all can be done anyhow. If we take any praise, we are robbing God from it, because God is the One that does the healing.

L-59 And remember, there is no such a thing as any--any man, be doctor or minister, that's a healer. "I am the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases," see, "all." No medicine heals. There is not no doctor claims medicine to heal. No, no. Medicine only keeps clean while God heals. Medicine cannot build tissue, cannot mend a bone. See? You might cut appendix out, but who is going to heal the place it come out from, see? Might pull a tooth, but who is going to heal the place it come out of? See? See it? God is the Healer, He is the only Healer. The Scriptures doesn't lie. They are perfectly right, so He is the Healer. [Exodus 15:26], [Psalms 103:2-3]

L-60 I'm very grateful for all the--the things that we got, like medicines that they can think of, that will kill germs. Nothing against that. I pray constantly for that. But we get some place, we don't have any medicine to help the case. And then another thing, sometimes, a medicine that will help one will kill the other one. See?

L-61 But I know a Toxin that's absolutely not a remedy, but a cure, that's the Blood of Jesus Christ. Faith in that Blood!

L-62 Now tonight, oh, we, did Billy... I forgot to ask him. I run in. Did he--he give out prayer cards, did he or didn't he? [Someone says, "Yes, he did."--Ed.] If he didn't, I was going to have him do it now. We are going to just talk a little bit about faith, and then--then go right ahead and call this prayer line up, and pray for the sick, by laying hands upon them, try to get every person in the building that we can. Now, you have faith now.

L-63 I want you to give me your undivided attention, just for a few moments, as I read this Word. And now I want to read from Saint Matthew's Gospel, the 15th verse... the 15th chapter, rather, beginning with the 21st verse. And this is not too much Scripture to read, you see, it's a little bitty text. But, you know, it--it isn't the--the... It isn't how much; it's the quality. Not the quantity; the quality! See, there is enough on there, in them few verses there, to save the whole world. Sure. See, it's not--it's not the size of it, it's what it is.

L-64 As I was telling here sometime ago, a--a little boy, I believe it was in this state, that was searching around an old attic and he found an--an old postage stamp. And--and he knowed a stamp collector, so he--he took it down to find out how much it was worth. And the stamp collector said... Oh, course, the little boy had ice cream in his mind, you know. He said, "I'll--I'll give you a dollar for it." Well, my, that was, the sale was made right away. I think he sold it for about, I think, it was five hundred; and it went on to, the last time we heard, I forget how many hundreds it was worth. You see, the little old stamp, the paper wasn't the thing, it was just an old piece of paper not even worth picking up. But it was what was on it, that counted. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-65 That's the way with This here. This is just a piece of paper, but what's on it is the Word of the Lord, and that's what makes it so valuable. All right, 21st verse. Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not--I am not sent but to the... unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet for me to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto dogs. ... she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat... the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. [Matthew 15:21-28]

L-66 Now just for a few moments, in the way to make a... to build on this, I want to take a text to say what I've got written here on these Scriptures. I want to call perse-... the word Perseverance, and just one word.

L-67 Persevering, now we know the word, I think that it means "to be persistent," and persistent in something that you're doing. In making a goal or something, you have to be persistent.

L-68 And men through all ages, that's had faith in what they're trying to achieve, had to be persistent, especially if you're trying to do something right. Because, you're going to meet, you're going to meet an opposition.

L-69 You people, tonight, that's going to be prayed for, I'm saying this for your glory, for your understanding. If you're not ready to come in the prayer line, don't come. Because, you must remember that this is the time when God is going to take you at your word, and you've got to take Him at His Word. And it doesn't matter what anyone else says, or how you feel, your feeling has nothing to do with it. Jesus never did say, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Did you believe it?" See, you must believe it. And your healing is already secured, Jesus Christ healed you at Calvary. And, no matter what your trouble is, you must accept it. And before you can accept it, you've got to believe it. Because, faith is based; or, healing is based on faith, and faith is based on the Word.

L-70 Now, you can't say, "If I touch this microphone, I'll be healed." There, there is no basic to that, see. That's in your mind.

L-71 But when it's THUS SAITH THE LORD, then you can know that's true, 'cause, "All heavens and earth will pass away, but His Word will never be changed." So it's true. [Matthew 24:35]

L-72 Now you've got to be persistent. No matter how much the devil tries to tell you, "Well, you just feel as bad." Don't you believe one word of it!

L-73 Here sometime ago, I was called to a bedside, took out of a meeting and called to a bedside where there was a--a young boy dying. And the old father came to me, it's been about fifteen years ago, I guess, and he said, "Would you come to my son, he is--he is dying with a--a horrible thing?" It's a--a disease of the heart, I call... I believe it's called some kind of a--a heart disease, I forget what the name of it is now, but it was real, real bad. And so I said, "Yes."

L-74 Oh, I beg your pardon, it went on to his heart, but it was polio that was in his body. It was polio. And that was before we had the Salk vaccine. And then the boy was real bad. And so when I went to pray, the doctor wouldn't let me in. And he said, "I can't let you in."

L-75 And I said, "Well, I'm..." I was about forty years old, and I said, "Well, I'm forty years old." I said I... "My faith tells me that it's all right for me to go pray for this man's boy, because he wants me to--to pray for him."

L-76 He said, "But, look," he said, "you're a married man. You have a child of your own. You'll pack that polio to the boy." 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min And I said, "Well, let me go in." He wouldn't do it.

L-77 And the man himself, the doctor, as I understood, was Catholic. I said, "I want to ask you something. If I was a priest, and this man was Catholic, and that boy was dying, would you let me go give him the last rites." He said, "That's different. That's a priest."

L-78 I said, "No. I mean just as much to them, as a priest would to the man who was a Catholic." And finally he said, "It's if you'll sign this paper."

L-79 I said, "I'll sign anything, see." And so he dressed me up like a Ku-Klux, and I--I got in there. I didn't mean to say that like that; forgive me, see; but, anyhow, white, and all over my face.

L-80 And I went in there, and the boy was so low till he was just barely breathing. And he had been unconscious, about two days. And I don't understand medicine and a great scientific researches that God has let men do, doctors for sick people, and so forth, but there is some kind of a--a cardiogram, something, had taken. His heart was so low, I forget just what the beat was. It was just about gone. And so the mother was standing there, and I spoke to her. So I got on the other side of the bed. And the little nurse, oh, some nice little lady, she, I guess she was in her early twenties, maybe, twenty-one, twenty-two years old, she was the nurse that was attached to the... or had to take care of the patient.

L-81 And so I went across on the other side of the bed, and knelt down, and I just... a little simple prayer, and layed hands upon the--upon the boy. I said, "Lord Jesus, this father and mother has brought me here to pray for their son, and he is dying. And only You, Lord, can help him. And I know that You said, 'These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.' I plead that promise to You, Lord Jesus, for the sake of this boy's life." No change come at all. I said, "I thank You, Lord." [Mark 16:17]

L-82 And the old father raised up, and said, "Lord, I am so grateful to You, ever grateful, for healing my son." And he reached around and the mother fell into his arms, and she said, "Dad, think of it, he is going to be well now." And I stood and looked, and they were happy and rejoicing, and weeping. The boy was just as low as he could be. They said, "Oh, it's wonderful!"

L-83 And the little nurse looked around, she look at me. She said, "I--I believe you misunderstand the doctor's orders." She said, "I believe you misunderstand. The boy is dying."

L-84 "Oh," the old man said, "no, he isn't dying. He is going to live."

L-85 And so she said, "Look, sir," said "I--I appreciate anyone having faith like that, but," said, "how can you laugh and go on like that," said, "and you see there is no difference in the boy." And said, "The boy will die." Said, "He can't live. Well, we don't see how he has lived this long." Said, "It's never been known in--in among the sick people, or science, rather, that a person ever went that low with a heart beat like that," some kind of a cardiogram, something, "that ever come back again."

L-86 And I'll never forget that old man. He put his hands upon her shoulder, just like a father to a daughter, he said, "Look, my dear child." He said, "That cardiogram is what you are looking at. That's what you're trained to look at. And that's all you know about, is that cardiogram. But," said, "I'm looking at a Divine promise." See?

L-87 The boy is married and got three children now. It depends on what you're looking at. He never got any better for two or three days. But after a while, the first thing you know, here he come right out of it, and went home. He is a missionary in South Africa now, with three children.

L-88 Now, see, it just goes to show, you've got to be persistent. That never bothered that old man. That settled it.

L-89 Just as when that woman touched the garment of Jesus Christ, that settled it. That's all. She, she was persistent till she got there, but that settled it. [Luke 8:43-48], [Mark 5:25-34], [Matthew 9:20-22]

L-90 You must be the same way. You must be persistent. And anybody that's ever got anything, and ever been able to achieve anything, has been persistent.

L-91 George Washington was persistent at Valley Forge. All the odds was against him, and the--the enemy was across the river. But after all night in prayer; and the American soldiers with no shoes on their feet, about one third of them 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min had shoes, and they crossed the river at Valley Forge, through the ice. And three musket bullets went through his coat. But he had an answer from God, and there was no need of him backing down. Nothing could stop him then. He crossed it because that he was persistent. He had heard from God.

L-92 And that's the way we've got to be. If God says so, that settles it.

L-93 Noah was very perseverant after he had heard from God. When he heard the Word of God tell him to build an ark, he built it. No matter what anyone else said about it, and how anyone else thought about it, Noah was persistent. They might said, "Well, that old man, that rain story," and so forth, "the old fellow has just stayed up there in the sun too long. There is something wrong with him." That didn't stop him at all. He didn't hear a word of it. He just only heard that God said, "it's going to rain; build an ark," and he was persistent in doing it. [Genesis 6:13-22]

L-94 Now, Moses was very persistent; first, a running coward. He had been educated, and, oh, he could even teach the Egyptians wisdom. He was so smart, and yet he failed on the job. It took forty years to put the education in him, that Pharaoh give him; it took God forty years to take it out of him, before He could use him out in the wilderness. And sometimes we have to get emptied up before you can be filled up. And now he had been a failure. And he had run out and married this beautiful Ethiopian girl, and was--and had settled down and had a son, Gershom, and going to fall heir to Jethro's sheep and everything. He had long forgot the feeling of the people.

L-95 But one day, while he was on the backside of the desert, traveling down a familiar old path, he saw a bush burning. Now, he never tried to examine the bush, and said, "I believe I'll go over and take off a few leaves, and take it down to the laboratory and see what's the matter, that they don't burn up. And had been burning there for an hour, but they--they don't seem to, tree be consumed." If he'd have thought that, It'd have never talked to him. But he drew up with this in his heart, that he would go to find out. And a Voice said, "Take off your shoes, for you're on holy ground." [Exodus 3:5]

L-96 I want you to notice. One day he is a running coward, and the next day he is a--a radical, the next day; when he had left Egypt, when he had the whole army in his hands, to deliver the people. And, you know, when you hear the Voice of God, It makes you act funny, do things funny, odd and peculiar. Now just think, he is eighty years old now, probably a beard hanging down to his waist, maybe his bald head shining, hair around his neck. And here he is on his road down to Egypt, with his wife sitting astraddle of a little mule, and the baby on her hip; a crooked stick in his hand, eyes up, just praising God. What an odd-looking sight! "Where you going, Moses?" "We're going down to Egypt, to take over."

L-97 A one-man invasion! You couldn't stop him. He was persistent. Why? He had heard the Voice of God, that was enough to make him persistent. An old man, eighty years old, was going to take over the nation, and he done it. He had heard the Voice of God. How is he going to take over, with that stick in his hand? A trained army, a million men standing there, more than a million men, had conquered the world in that day; and here goes an old man, eighty years old, wife sitting on a mule, and a stick in his hand, going down to take the nation over. Why, people would have thought he was crazy.

L-98 You know, when you hear the Voice of God, and hear the Word of God, you are kind of crazy to the world. But if you hear the Voice, you know what you're doing.

L-99 And nothing ain't going to stop Moses then, he was on his road! He was very persistent. Even when Pharaoh, he stood before him, and throwed down the stick and it turned into a serpent, and the magicians came and could do the same thing, Moses didn't run out like a coward. He stood there. He knowed God sent him, no matter how many carnal impersonators that the Devil could bring up. He stayed at his post of duty, 'cause he had heard the Voice of God. He just stayed there and watched the serpents crawl, and, after a while, his serpent come over and eat the rest of them up. What happened to them sticks that the serpent eat, where did they go to? Figure that one out. All right.

L-100 David, after he had trusted God, and saw the Lord God being with him, that helped him kill a bear, single-handed, and also a lion. And then he got a courage up, that God was with him. He knew God was with him, because God had done something for him. [I Samuel 17:32-37] 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-101 God has done something for you. He saved you, that's the greatest miracle there is.

L-102 Now He is ready to do something else. And the time came that when Goliath made his boast. Why, David said, "You mean to say that--that you'll let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the armies of the living God? What's the matter with you fellows?" [I Samuel 17:26]

L-103 Well, Saul was the most able man among them, head and shoulders above his army. And this David was just a little runt, a little bitty fellow, ruddy-looking, kind of a--a boy like, little stoop-shouldered, little sheep herder. And so Saul said, "I admire your courage, son. But, remember, that man is a warrior, from his youth, and you're nothing but a youth." [I Samuel 17:33]

L-104 He said, "But thy servant was keeping thy servant's sheep, one time, and a bear come in and took one. I went after him, and the Lord delivered him in my hands." Said, "A lion went, and," said, "I knocked him down with my slingshot. And when he got up, to roar against me, I took my knife, and caught him by the beard and killed him." And said, "How much more will the Lord God deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand!" Amen. [I Samuel 17:33-36]

L-105 And if God saved your soul from a life of sin, how much more can He take that cancer!

L-106 Notice little old David. Saul said, "I admire your courage, but you're not a fighter. But if you want to go, I'll dress you up," so he took his armor off and put it on him. [I Samuel 17:38-39]

L-107 Why, little old David with all that Ph.D. and D.D.D. hung onto him, he, why, he found out that Saul's ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of God. So he said, "I've never proved this stuff, take it off of me. Let me go the way I want to go, of what I know is right." Oh, my! And here he goes. And he was persistent, that he would take Goliath, and he did. And he slew Goliath. [I Samuel 17:38-39]

L-108 I think of his sheep. There David was, such a loyal man to his post of duty. And this lion, which could have killed him easy, come in and took one of the father's sheep, and went out. And he didn't have nothing, really, to fight the lion with, but a little slingshot.

L-109 You boys know. How many times I've had to pay for a window! And a little piece of leather, with a string, you know, and ram this rock around and sling it. And we used to knock these old snake doctors off the fence, and things, and--and throw it with these slingshots.

L-110 That's all David had; wouldn't hardly kill a rabbit. But we find out that David, whatever he had in his hand, it wasn't very much, but he had courage. And he knew that was the father's sheep. And he was--he was sent out, by the father, to take care of these sheep. He was responsible for them. And now he took whatever he had in his hand, and took out to get that sheep, persistently, that he would take it away from that lion.

L-111 Did you ever see a lion, what it looks like? You've seen these in a cage; well, they're--they're kittens. You ought to hear one in the jungle. These fellows around here, they been in cage and captivity; you hear one of them roar, it sounds bad. You ought to hear one out in the jungle, hunting him, and know that he is hunting you, too. Then, oh, my, he's a great fellow! When he roars; the beatles, monkeys, baboons, and jackals, everything stops. He's a king, and they give him room.

L-112 But here David goes with this little slingshot, to bring back that sheep, and he did it.

L-113 Oh, my, how I could take a text on that for a few minutes. Yes, sir. You're the God's sheep, too. Disease has took a hold of you. I ain't got very much, not--not even a slingshot, but I got the Word. I'm coming after you, tonight, to bring you back. I'm coming to rescue you, with the Word of the Lord. I don't know nothing about medicine and cutting on with knives, and things, but This I've proved. I know that This is right, so I'm coming after you sheep, to bring you back to the shady green pastures of God's love again. God, help me with this little slingshot. [I Samuel 17:32-50]

L-114 David had it wrapped in--in his fingers, and he had five stones in his hand. What is that? F-a-i-t-h in J-e-s-u-s. And here he comes, and he brought back the sheep.

L-115 Now that's the way we're doing tonight, having faith in Jesus, and persistently we're going to stand on His untouched Word. And we believe that God will keep His Word. If It doesn't, then we're all lost. Every Word of God is 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min punctuated with an "amen," to the believer. That's right. Yes, he was persistent.

L-116 And also Samson, when he met those Philistines, did you ever think of that? Why, Samson, they've got him pictured as a man having shoulders like barn doors. Well, it wouldn't be no--no secret, to find a man like that, could pick up a lion and tear him in two. But Samson was a... Forgive me for this expression, I'll just make it like he was a little curly-headed shrimp, just a little mama's boy, seven little sissy-like curls hanging down. See? What, and you remember, he was a weakling until the Spirit of the Lord come upon him, then he took the lion and tore him to pieces. That's right. First, the Spirit of the Lord upon him, then he knew where he was standing.

L-117 And if the church can only get anointed, anointed with real faith. When that lion roared, I guess Samson shook. But the Spirit of the Lord come upon him. He was persistent, said, "I'm ready to meet you," grabbed that lion, pulled him apart and throwed him over to one side, and walked on. [Judges 14:5-6]

L-118 They fenced him in, one night. And he picked up the gates of Gaza, put them upon his shoulders, and walked up to the top of the hill with them. My, oh, my, what a man, a little shrimp like that. But, the thing of it was, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him. He was. That's what made the difference. [Judges 16:2-3]

L-119 Then one day, he was surrounded by a thousand Philistines. And there he was, there wasn't nothing he had, so he picked up the jawbone of a mule, probably been dead for forty years or more, and was real old dry bone. And those Philistines had on helmets, and coats of what they call mail, which is great big laps of steel or brass, and a helmet about an inch thick. And he picked up that jawbone of that mule, and killed a thousand Philistines. [Judges 15:12-17]

L-120 Did you ever think? Take that old dry jawbone off the desert there, and strike one of those helmets, why, that jawbone would go into a thousand pieces. But he stood there, and through them steel helmets, them with spears, just beat them right and left, till he beat down a thousand. The rest of them run up in the rocks.

L-121 What was it? As long as he could reach back there and feel them seven locks, that was God's covenant. There wasn't nothing going to bother him as long as he had that covenant promise.

L-122 And nothing can bother the Church of the living God as long as we can feel that Holy Ghost, the covenant of God's Word in our hearts, the Pentecostal Blessing. "For the works that I do, shall you do also. The Life that's in Me, will be in you. As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you." The Father that sent Him, come in Him. The Jesus that sends the man, goes in the man. It isn't the man; it's Jesus. It wasn't Jesus; it was God. "As the Father sent me, so send I you. Lo, I am with you always, even to the consummation. I'll be with you, to the end of the world. And the works that I do, shall you also. A little while and the world won't see Me no more; yet ye shall see me, the believer, for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world," Jesus Christ. As long as I can feel that Spirit of God around, something is going to happen. I can see people that will believe It, that will reflect the praises and Glory of God. [John 14:12, 19, 20], [John 20:21], [Matthew 28:20]

L-123 Every time you look at the moon, it isn't the moon shining, it's the sun shining on the moon. If I could to say, "Moon, what makes you shine?" Say, "It's not me shining. It's something shining on me. I'm supposed to keep the light going, in the absence of the sun."

L-124 And the Church is a type of the moon. We're supposed to reflect the Light while the absence of the Son of God, 'cause we are sons and daughters of God, the lesser Light, and as long as we can see that moon reflects the same kind of Light the sun does. Oh, it isn't--it isn't the people, it's God in the people.

L-125 I used to, when I used to, I was game warden for several years. I love animals, and I--I like to take care of them. So I--I was a conservation officer for seven years. I used to pass by an old spring. That was the best spring I ever drank from. It was... I always liked it because it was so jolly, always bubbling up, just bubble, bubble, bubble. And I thought, "My!" I lay down and drink. One day, I thought, "Little spring, what makes you so happy? Is it because that rabbits drink from you?"

L-126 If he could speak, he would say, "No, that isn't what make me bubble."

L-127 And I'd say, "Maybe a deer drinks from you, once in a while." 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min "No, that isn't what makes me bubble."

L-128 "Well," I say, "little spring, maybe it's because I drink from you, about once a month."

L-129 Say, "No, that isn't it." I'd say, "Well, what makes you bubble like that all the time?"

L-130 If he could speak, he would say, "It isn't me bubbling. It's something behind me, making me bubble. It's bubbling up."

L-131 And that's the way the Holy Spirit is to the believer. There is something behind you. You can't push It, tear It. It takes care of you. It's the One that does the bubbling, Something within you. As Jesus told the woman at the well, "A wells of water bubbling up into everlasting Life," regular geysers just spraying up the joys of God through your soul, all the time. And as long as the Church could feel that around them, what you--what you scared about, see?

L-132 Samson didn't fear. He was persistent. All he had was a--a jawbone of a mule, but he was persistent because he knowed his locks still hung there. [Judges 15:12-17]

L-133 The doctor might have told you, "There is not a chance for you to get well. You're dying. You got cancer." But as long as you can sit here and feel the glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ, what difference does what the doctor says now makes any difference? See, you be persistent. He would appreciate you if he's a good doctor, he would tell you that he wants you to get well. That's what--that's what he wants you to do. And you must do it; to have faith, you must be persistent.

L-134 John was so sure that he would see the right sign! He--he knowed God told him he would know Who the Messiah was. He was so persistent!

L-135 And somebody might have said, "Well, don't you think this is Him?"

L-136 He said, "I'll know Him when He comes." He was so sure, that he said, "This is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." He knew it was. He testified to it. "I saw the Spirit of God descending from Heaven upon Him, like a dove, and I know that is the Son of God." Persistent! Oh, we could go on and on, with characters. [John 1:32-36]

L-137 This little woman, she was a Greek from the country of Syrophenicia, and we find out that she must have heard about the praises and glory of the Lord Jesus. "Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the Word of God." She heard, and when she heard... [Romans 10:17], [Mark 7:26-30]

L-138 You know, faith finds sources that others don't see. Now if you don't have faith, well, then, there is no need of trying to show it to you. Because, faith can see it. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Faith sees what the blind people doesn't see. Faith is the sixth sense. Five senses are fine, as long as they don't disagree with the sixth. But the sixth sense is faith, "it's the substance of things hoped for," you don't see, taste, feel, smell, or hear, but yet you know it. Faith tells you so. And it's so sure that it's real, that it comes to you a substance. Not just imagination. It's something you have. [Hebrews 11:1]

L-139 I see people come on the platform, said, "Brother Branham, I've got all faith!" "Well, what are you doing up here, then?" See? See? See?

L-140 "I don't have it." And, but there when you got, when anything...

L-141 You've had things to happen, you just knew it was going to be. Yet you didn't know how it was going to be, but it was going to be. That, that's faith. That's real faith. It's going to happen then, when you know that it's going to be. Now, faith finds a source that others don't see.

L-142 His Word is a sword. The Bible said so, in Hebrews 4:12, that It is a sword. But it takes an arm of faith to wield that sword. Only faith can do it, hold the sword. [Hebrews 4:12]

L-143 She had many hindrances, this little woman. Now, she had a daughter that was--was having epilepsy, and she was very, very bad. And she had heard that Jesus healed epilepsy. Now, "faith cometh by hearing," and that was her child, so she was determined to--to get down somewhere and hear Jesus. And now she had many hindrances, just many, many hindrances, but her faith didn't have no hindrance. [Mark 7:26-30] 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-144 Tonight, people has lots of hindrances. If you... Your mind has lots of hindrances. But, your faith, there is nothing can stand in its way. Faith knows no hindrances.

L-145 Let's just think of some of the things that might have happened to this little woman. They might have said unto her, that, "You are a Greek." In other words, "Your denomination is not sponsoring that meeting down there. You don't have any right to go down there." Well, if that would have been in her mind, she wouldn't have sat very long anyhow. She, the jug would have filled up, and she'd have left. But we find out, that didn't stop her. Whether she was Greek or not, she had faith. That's all she needed was faith. [Mark 7:26-30]

L-146 Now somebody might have come to her, and said, "Well, the days of miracles is passed. There is no such a thing. Those people are just a bunch of--of fanatics." But still she was persistent. She was going to go anyhow.

L-147 Let's think another one. Some of them might have said, "Well, you know what, your husband is a--is a notable man here in the city, and if you would be caught down there with that group, well, your husband will actually leave you." But still she was persistent. She had faith, and had a need to use it.

L-148 Some of them might have said, "Why, if you'd go down to the card game, or whatever kind of an amusement you go to, the people will laugh at you." She was still persistent.

L-149 And then that old thing might have come to her, "You know, the pastor will put you out of church if you go down there and get mixed up in something like that." But that didn't stop her. She was still persistent. She was going anyhow. Why? She had struck faith. Faith is going to do it. I don't care what others think; faith does it.

L-150 Finally, she made her way through all these obstacles, and she arrived at Jesus. Now, seemingly, all of her trouble was over, she arrived at Jesus; but, it wasn't, it was just starting.

L-151 Many people would say, "Well, if I know Jesus..." Yes, we see that every night. See, He comes right with us, each night, proves Hisself to be here, but still we come back the next night, with all of our troubles again, you see. See? Is that right? Now that's right.

L-152 She arrived at Jesus. She'll perhaps maybe... If she hadn't had that kind of faith, the first discouragement after finding Jesus, why, she would have been... she would have blowed up, and went back. But, you see, faith won't do that. Faith won't turn it loose. Faith is persistent. It holds right on. Now watch, she had all confidence and faith in this Man. Now if she had just been mocking, or just saying, "I'm going down and give it a try, I'll see what He's got to say. If He says something against our creeds, we'll--we'll just leave. That's all." But she come to get something, and she was determined to stay there till she got it. There you are, that's the person; like the queen of the South, we preached on the other night.

L-153 Notice when she got to Jesus. Instead of getting a welcome, she got a turndown. Now when you... What you think of the people today would get to that spot and be treated like that? Jesus told her right quick. After she come through all these barriers, and finally... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] she said... [Mark 7:26-30]

L-154 She come to Him. And she run up to Him, to worship Him, and said, "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me, my daughter is variously vexed with a devil. And I've known that You're the great Healer, and I come to--to ask You to help me." He just ignored her. Looked at her, walked on. Oh, my! She was a little more than our modern Pentecost; my, they'd have turned up their nose and walked back, said, "I don't have to do that." But not that woman. She had faith. She stayed right there. [Matthew 15:22], [Mark 7:26-30]

L-155 Now she went after Him again, "Lord, can't I just have?" And she wasn't thinking about what she had come through. She wasn't thinking about what she would have to go through. The only thing she knowed, she believed if she could get Him to say so! That's all she needed to know, if He would say so! She knowed it was working on others, why wouldn't it work on hers?

L-156 You fight every inch of the way. God, down in Egypt, give Palestine to the Jews, but they fought every inch of the way! God told Joshua, "Everywhere the soles of your feet rests, that I have given you." Footsteps meant victory, possession, and just as far as you can climb into the Kingdom of God. If you just want to climb a little piece, and say, 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min "Well, I believe I may not have to go to hell, but I believe that I'll be saved at the end, if I join church," you ain't got much ground yet. But every promise in the Bible is yours, but you'll have to fight every devil guard away from it, with a two-edged sword, and claim it for yourself. Be persistent, walking right into it. [Deuteronomy 28:65]

L-157 Now she got right up to the very God Himself. And He ignored her. And she run after Him, crying. She was persistent. "Lord, help me," she said. She worshiped Him, said, "Help me!" Listen at that rebuke. "I'm not sent to your race." Oh, my! [Mark 7:26-30]

L-158 Then a lot of them would have got up, said, "Well, I guess He wasn't sent to us. This revival don't. Guess I'll go away." See, Jesus knowed she had that kind of faith. See?

L-159 And another thing He said, "Your race is only a bunch of dogs." Whew! My!

L-160 Don't talk like that to the modern Pentecostals. Oh! You say that, they say, "Well, I'll just leave this bunch and go join the Assemblies. And the Assemblies say it to me, I'll go to the others, and the others, and the others, you see." But not that woman. She had faith.

L-161 Said, "Your... I wasn't sent to you. I wasn't sent to your race. And, besides, you're nothing but a bunch of dogs. It's not meet for Me to take the children's bread here, and cast it to you bunch of dogs." Oh, my! [Matthew 15:26], [Mark 7:26-30]

L-162 That don't stop faith. Faith is still there, just as fresh as it ever was. What does faith admit? The truth. She said, "That's the truth, Lord." Oh, my! See how little you can get, not how big you can get. Faith makes you little. Notice, still she was perseverant. [Mark 7:26-30]

L-163 Yet, He wouldn't pay no attention to her. He ignored her. And finally she got in His way and He couldn't get around her, and then He told her, said, "I'm not sent to you, and your... to your race. And your race is nothing but a bunch of dogs. And I'm not going to take the children's bread. It's not right for me to take the children's bread, healing to this group, and give it over to you dogs." And she said, "That's the truth, Lord." [Mark 7:26-30]

L-164 Faith will always admit the Word is Truth. Amen. See? If you got real faith, and the Bible tells you that you are doing wrong, you'll admit that you're wrong. You won't say, "Now, wait a minute here, I belong to..." No, no, that's not faith. When the Word says it, that you... That's where you're right or wrong, is by the Word. That's right.

L-165 Now she said. No, sir, that, she just couldn't believe that she could stop at that, so away she goes. And she said, "Truth, Lord, we're nothing but dogs, but I'm only asking that I could just get some of the crumbs that falls from the Master's table." She was crumb hunting. Just think of that. [Matthew 15:27], [Mark 7:28]

L-166 Today, we either get the whole loaf or we won't take any at all. See? We got to be all of it or we don't take anything.

L-167 Still she was persistent. She went right on. She was not a hotbed plant that had to be babied and sprayed over, to keep the termites off. No, sir. She wasn't one of these hybrids like the modern crop of today, that call themselves Christians. When the Word of God said it, and she believed it, she seen it vindicated, she was ready to go after it regardless of what anybody said. Even Christ Himself couldn't stop her. That's what faith does. Oh, that admits the Word being right. She was hunting for crumbs. [Mark 7:26-30]

L-168 Remember, she had never seen a miracle. She come out of a denomination that didn't believe in miracles. She, believing, had to come out of a denomination that said, "There is no such a thing as miracles." She was a Gentile. She had never seen a miracle, in her life. But yet, when faith takes a hold, God is there. See? She had never seen it, but she had heard about it.

L-169 If you don't believe there is miracles, read the Bible and their promises to us today. Faith took a hold.

L-170 She was something like the harlot Rahab. When she heard, by the spies, she didn't want to see Joshua, and see the way he dressed and what kind of a warrior was. She said, "I have heard that God is with you. I have heard what God 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min did." And she wanted salvation, and she got it; right, because she was persistent, also. She said, "I'll hide you. I'll do anything. But one thing I want you to swear to me, that I'll be saved during this time." Oh, my, that's the idea. [Joshua 2:9, 12-13]

L-171 And this poor woman was the same. She--she wanted, she knowed that she was going to get it. There was no doubt. No matter what she had to climb through, she was going to get it anyhow. So Jesus couldn't even turn her back, by calling her of the wrong race, calling her a dog, "It wasn't right to take the children's bread and feed dogs," and so forth like that. But still she went right on after it, anyhow, because she was persistent. She had a need, her daughter was dying. Others had been healed, so why couldn't her daughter be healed? And that was the God of creation. [Matthew 15:26]

L-172 Jesus said, "For this saying, the devil left your daughter." Oh, my! She had the right approach to God's gift. [Matthew 15:28]

L-173 Do you know God does things sometimes just to--to do things a different way, and just to find out what people will do? Now it's over your head, you haven't seen it and haven't noticed it, but I done something just now to do something. And that so helped me. And I watched it work. See, you say things, you change your--your--your attitude, you change your voice, you change sometimes your sermon; watching and seeing certain things, then watch and see how it acts. Because, the prayer line is fixing to come up, it would be better for that not to be among you. See? See, just to see it happen, then you change yourself and go back somewhere again. See? God did that very thing. He still does it, noticing.

L-174 She had the right approach to God's gift. And remember, she was the first one, the Gentile, that God ever done a miracle on. She was the first Gentile.

L-175 Faith admits the Word is Truth. And it's reverent, very reverent, and that's what, and perseverant, and that's what it is.

L-176 Martha, when she went to meet Jesus. Now if there is anyone had a right to condemn, it would have been Martha, 'cause she had sent for Jesus to come pray for her brother when he was in a serious condition, dying, and Jesus... They had left the church, they had come out of the old dead movement that they were in, and had followed the Lord Jesus, believing Him to be the anointed Messiah. And then His very friend, Lazarus, that He come up with... And they had been excommunicated from their church and from society. And His very friend that He come up with, was laying sick, at the point of death. The doctor could do him no good. [John 11:1-26]

L-177 And she sent for Jesus, and Jesus just simply ignored her sending. And He went to another city, and He did the same thing there. They sent again, and He just ignored it and went on.

L-178 And then after Lazarus was dead, and had been buried four days. His face had already fell in, by that time, that hot country. The nose falls first, as I'm told, and probably his flesh had already fell in. Because, after seventy-two hours, corruption sets in the body, and so we find out.

L-179 I got to bury a man in a few days, Wednesday. And he died last Wednesday, and they just locked him up, and just waiting there for me to come to preach his funeral. Probably they couldn't hold him out any longer, because his--his face would fall in. See?

L-180 And that's what was happening to Lazarus. He was already dead.

L-181 And then after he was dead, and it was all over, then here come Jesus slipping into the city. So then they knowed they was going to get criticized, because perhaps was already criticized.

L-182 But Martha, she had been very dilatory, seemingly; about fixing a place for Jesus to sleep, a place for Him to eat, and so forth. Even asked Jesus, one time, to make her sister come help her. But down in her heart, faith struck. While Mary sat still, crying, and doing nothing about it, and give up; Martha slips out of the--out of the house, and down through the city. No doubt, she met some on the street, said, "Where is that Divine healer that you had around here? What about Lazarus now?" She passed right on by them. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-183 She got to where He was at. Watch how she was. She run up to Him. She had a right to upbraid Him, she had a right to tell Him, saying, "Now why didn't You come when I called You?" If that would have been a--a Pentecostal of today, or a Baptist, or a Presbyterian, they would change churches right quick. See? Sure. "Why didn't You come when we called You?" She had a right to, seemingly. But she didn't have a right to.

L-184 As I said last night, you've got no thought. It's His thought, see, what He does. "'Thy will be done,' pray like this." He is not an errand boy. He is God. Notice, "Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done."

L-185 And when she got to Him, she approached Him in the right way. She said, give Him His right title, "Lord!" Not upbraid Him, but, "Lord, if Thou would have been here, my brother would not have died." Oh, my! I can see Him pulling His little, tired body together. And--and He said... "If You would have been here, my brother would not have died. But even now, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." See, she knowed what the God of creation was. She knowed He was the anointed Messiah. She approached Him right, upon her knees, said, "Lord, if You would have been here, my brother would not have died. But even now, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." Oh, if we could only think that! "Even now, Lord, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." , [John 11:21-22]

L-186 He said, "I am the resurrection and Life." No other man could ever say that. "I am the resurrection and Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?" [John 11:25-26]

L-187 She said, "Yea, Lord. I believe that You're the Son of God that was to come into the world." He said, "Where have you buried him?" [John 11:27, 34]

L-188 I was talking to a woman not long ago, and she said to me, she said, "I--I--I like to hear you speak, Brother Branham, but," said, "there is just one fault you have." I said, "Thank you," just one fault. I said, "What's that?" She said, "You brag too much about Jesus, of being Divine." I said, "I hope that's the only one He can find in me," I said.

L-189 "You brag too much about Jesus being Divine." Said, "He wasn't Divine." I said, "Oh, yes, He was Divine." She said, "Well, you make Him God."

L-190 I said, "He was either God or the greatest deceiver the world ever had." See? And I said, "He was God." She said, "He was just a Man. He couldn't have been God." I said, "He was. He was God and man, together." And she said, "You said you believe the Bible." I said, "Yes, ma'am, I do."

L-191 And she said, "If I prove to you, by your own Bible, that He was not Divine, would you accept it?"

L-192 I said, "Certainly, if the Bible said He wasn't. But," I said, "I don't believe it's in the Bible."

L-193 She said, "In Saint John, the 11th chapter, the Bible said, 'When Jesus went down to the grave of Lazarus,' the Bible said, 'He wept.'" And said, "If He wept, He could not be Divine, and weeping." [John 11:35]

L-194 I said, "Well, lady, that won't stand up." I said, "I want to tell you." I said, "That's thinner than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that starved to death," I said, "because that won't hold up to the Bible." I said, "Look, He goes down to the tomb, see, and He stood before the tomb, and He said, straightened His little body up and said, 'Lazarus, come forth!'" [John 11:43]

L-195 He might have been a Man, crying; but when He called that man out of the grave, that had been dead four days, and his soul a four-days journey somewhere! I don't know where it was at, neither do you. So, anyhow, He called him back. Corruption knew its Master. The soul knew its Creator. And a man, had been dead, stood on his feet and lived again, after being dead four days. That was more than a man. That was God!

L-196 It was a Man when He come down off the mountain, that night, and was hungry, looked all around over a fig tree, 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min to find something to eat. He was a Man when He was hungry. But when He taken five biscuits and two fish, and fed five thousand, that was more than a man.

L-197 He was a Man when He was laying out in the back of that boat, that night, where ten thousand devils of the sea swore they would drown Him. And that little old boat in that storm, like a bottle stopper out there somewhere, floating up-and-down like that. He was a Man when He was asleep, He was tired, virtue had went out of Him. But when He put His foot up on the brail of the boat, and looked up and said, "Peace, be still," and the winds and the waves obeyed Him, that was more than a man. That was God in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself! [Mark 4:39]

L-198 He was a Man when He died on the cross, crying for mercy. That's right. But He was God on Easter morning, when He broke the seal, was in the tomb, rose up and ascended on High, (yes, sir) ever living to make intercessions. Every man and woman, that ever amounted to a hill of beans, believed that. Yes, sir.

L-199 He is the same yesterday, today, and forever! "Believest thou this?" [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Yes, sir. He is just as great right here among us, tonight, as He was then. Believest thou this? ["Amen."] He is the same Healer, tonight, He was then. Believest thou this? ["Amen."] Sure. He can't fail. Be persistent. Hold your position in Christ, your confession. Hold fast your confession in Christ. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-200 She was persistent and she got the resurrection of her brother.

L-201 The Shunammite woman was persistent in the presence of Elijah. Elijah come by and blessed her, and told her that she would have a son. The son got about twelve years old. Out in the field, he must have had a sunstroke. This woman had been very kind to Elijah. She was a Shunammite woman, and she came from the land of Shunem. And she find out... She said to her husband, being a rich man, she said, "I perceive that this man that passes by here is a holy man." She said, "Let's do him some kindness." Said, "Let's build him a little room on our side of the house here, when he comes by, and put him a little bed and a pitcher out there, so he can rest himself." And her husband said, "That would be very nice." [II Kings 4:9-10]

L-202 "So you do something to these little ones, you do it unto Me," Jesus said.

L-203 So he said, told his servant, Gehazi. Said, "Go ask her, can I speak to the captain, or what can I do for her?" She said, "No, I dwell among my people. I'm all right." And Gehazi, Gehazi said, "But she hasn't got any children."

L-204 Said, "Go tell her." There come a vision. Said, "Go tell her, about this time she is going to bear a child." And she did. [II Kings 4:12-16]

L-205 The boy got about twelve years old. His, his father being old. He was out in the field, one day, must have had a sunstroke. It was about noon, begin to cry, "My head! My head!" He sent the boy in. And he laid on his mother's lap until he died. Look what an appropriate place, she took him out in that room where that prophet had laid on that bed. See? [II Kings 4:19]

L-206 And she said to the servant, "Saddle a mule, and you take out to Mount Carmel. Up there is a den somewhere, where this preacher is living. He was the one who had the power to see a vision, said that I would bear this son; and if he is close enough to God, he is God's messenger of the hour. And I know, if he could tell me why, if I'd get to him, he would tell me what God took the child for. Let me get up there." She said, "If anybody salutes, don't you salute. And don't stop; just keep going." [II Kings 4:20], [II Kings 4:24]

L-207 Oh, I like that! The urgent's time now. People are dying, we oughtn't to be fooling around on the road. Get going. And she was persistent.

L-208 And Elijah. You know, God don't always tell His prophets everything that's going to happen. He looked up and he seen her coming, he said, "Here comes that Shunammite." And said, "She is full of sorrow, but God has hid it from me." He said, "Run, meet her." And she...

L-209 He said, "Is all well with thee? Is all well with thy husband? Is all well with the son?" [II Kings 4:26]

L-210 I like this, that persistency until she got into the presence of the messenger. And she said, "All is well." Hus-... her 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min husband wringing his hands, and walking up-and-down the room, crying, and the baby lying on the bed, dead, but, "All is well." Amen. Why? She had come to her goal. She had made her goal. Her persistency, that she could get to the man of God, the man of God could tell her why. And then she fell down at his feet and revealed what was happened.

L-211 Now he reached over and got his staff, and said to his servant, "Take this, and go lay it on the baby." Now, I think that's where Paul got laying handkerchiefs on the people. See, because Elijah knew that everything he touched was blessed, but if he could get the woman to believe it! [II Kings 4:29-30]

L-212 But the woman's faith wasn't in the staff, it was in the prophet. See? And she said, "As the Lord God lives, and your soul never dies," see, she had witnessed there he had Eternal Life. Said, "And thy soul never dies, I'm not going to leave you." Oh, my, stay with it! That's it.

L-213 That's the way to get what you want. Like this Shunammite woman, like this Syrophenician woman, stay with it! Stay right there. Stay right with Christ. Take a hold of it, tonight, and hold there. Just don't move. Tomorrow, if somebody say, "That's just..." Just shut their ears up to them. You got faith: You stay there. Said, "I won't leave you."

L-214 And Elijah said, "Well, can't get rid of her, I might as well go with her." So he girded up his loins, and away he went.

L-215 Watch when he got into the room. He didn't know what to do. He never prayed. He just walked back and forth, up-and-down the floor, until he felt the Spirit of God come on him. Then he went and laid himself over the baby, and he sneezed seven times, and come to life. [II Kings 4:34-35]

L-216 Martha knew, if God was in that prophet, surely He was in His Son, see, and that's the reason she could be persistent.

L-217 And if we have had thousands of years of experience since then, to know that God keeps His promise, how persistent ought we to be tonight when we can see the Presence of Jesus Christ, oh, my, and shine like the stars!

L-218 I remember one night, at home not long ago, there was a woman, and I didn't know the woman wanted to be prayed for. I didn't go down and pray for the sick that night. And it was so packed around the place! And some of my trustees are sitting in here somewhere, tonight, was there. And there was a woman come from California, had a fifty-pound tumor. She wouldn't go to a doctor; and then, when they made her go, it was too large to be operated on, a big water tumor. And she was way out like this, a great big tumor. And they had brought her there. They had. They couldn't bring her in the car. They had to put her in a trailer, like, to bring her. And they had brought her in. I didn't know it, and I just went ahead and spoke. And she said, "Well, isn't he going..." I made an altar call. Said, "Isn't he going to pray for the sick?" Said, "No."

L-219 She said, "What door does he go out of?" Uh-huh. Now just think, her faith! And they took the woman around, and packed her around to the back door, where I go out through the pastor's study and went to my car.

L-220 And the woman laying there, caught me by the trouser leg, and she said, "Brother Branham!" Great, oh, my, she was out like that. Said, "If you will just lay your hands on me, God will make me well." And I did that.

L-221 And about three months from then, I was in a meeting. And here she stood, just as perfectly normal as any woman in the country; and invited any sister there to go with her into a room, and undress and see if she had had an operation or not.

L-222 Why? She was persistent. She was determined to get what she come for. That's the way it is. Yes, sir. Their faith had a hold of the Word.

L-223 Micaiah, one time, when he was called in. When Jehoshaphat made an alliance with Ahab, that's when the believer and the unbeliever mixes up. And he said they wanted to go have war; they was going up to a place, to take their own ground. Fundamentally, it belonged to them. Said, "Why should these Assyrians be eating corn that belongs to Israel? Joshua give us that!" That's exactly right. So they went and had a big school of preachers down there, a 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min whole seminary; five, four or five hundred of them, well-trained Hebrew men. [I Kings 22:6-15]

L-224 And so Jehoshaphat said, being a righteous man, he said, "But shouldn't we consult the Lord?"

L-225 He said, "Oh, yes, maybe that's so." Ahab, you know what a fellow he was, so he goes down. And said, "I've got the answer, I've got four hundred prophets. We'll bring them up here."

L-226 So they got down there, and one of them, Zedekiah, I believe it was, made hisself two big horns and went up there, saying, "THUS SAITH THE LORD. Go up, it belongs to you. THUS SAITH THE LORD, you will push them Assyrians plum out of the country, with these horns."

L-227 Jehoshaphat looked around, you know, and he--he said, "Haven't you got another one?"

L-228 "Another one? When four hundred trained Hebrew prophets from the school, what do you need with another one? We've got four hundred! The whole seminary is here, and all of them with one accord, saying, 'Go up, the Lord is with you. THUS SAITH THE LORD.'" Jehoshaphat said, "Well, haven't you got another one?" [I Kings 22:4-8]

L-229 He said, "Oh, I got another one I might consult," said, "that's Micaiah the son of Imlah, but," said, "I hate him." Oh, sure. Yeah. Said, "Well, he don't even agree with these denominations and things." Said, "We--we, well, you have to. There, there is a strange fellow," they said. "Oh," he said, "don't let the king say so. Go get him." [I Kings 22:5-9]

L-230 So they sent one of the fellows down, said, "Now, Micaiah, you know you're put out of the association, you don't have fellowship with them no more. But now if you will just say, the same thing they do, they might give you your fellowship card back, when you come back again." Could you imagine talking to a prophet like that?

L-231 Micaiah said, "As the Lord God lives, I'll only say what He says." Now there you are. Amen. That's it. "Well, you know what they could do for you?" [I Kings 22:14]

L-232 "That doesn't matter. I'll only say what He says." He went back to him, he said, "Now you let me have tonight, and I'll see what the Lord said."

L-233 He come back the next morning, and he said, "Go on up. Yes, sir. Go on up. But I seen Israel, like sheep scattered, having no shepherd." [I Kings 22:14-17]

L-234 Then this Zedekiah comes up, and takes his hand and smacks him right in the mouth, "that little holy-roller," set him down and said, "Which way did the Spirit of God go when it went out of me?" He said, "You'll see." So he said, "What about it?" [I Kings 22:24-25]

L-235 Said, "I saw a vision last night. I saw God sitting up on a high place, and in This, His great high Throne." And said, "He, all of them was around Him. They had a council, 'Who can we get to go down and to deceive Ahab, to get him up there to fulfill what the prophet Elijah had said? What can I do about this?'" And said, "A lying spirit come up, and said, 'I'll go down and get in those prophets, and cause them to make a lie.' And the Lord said, 'You're the one that can do it, 'cause they were seminarially trained, you know.' Said, 'You go do it. That's all you can do.'" Went down there, and he did it! [I Kings 22:19-23]

L-236 Now you say, "Well, who would know what was right?" Micaiah was with the Word!

L-237 How can you bless what God has cursed? How can you tell people that they can live like this and do these things, and still maintain the fellowship of Jesus Christ? You cannot do it. You've got to be borned again and filled with the Holy Ghost. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]"... Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto your children, and them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." That was the prescription. You don't want to tamper with that prescription. [Acts 2:38]

L-238 A doctor can write out a formula to you. And you take that to some quack druggist, and he don't mix it right, you'll kill your patient. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-239 And that's what's the matter today, you've adopted handshakes and everything else, instead of That. Come back! God let Peter write an Eternal prescription for salvation. It's never been changed, and It can't be changed. Shaking hands and joining church, and things, will never take Its place. It's got to come back, Word by Word, the way It's wrote There. That's the prescription they used all the rest the way through the Bible. They used it on up to the Nicaea Council, and then they changed the prescription. That's the reason we got so many dead members today. Truly. You've got to get the real prescription. Then know, if it hit the target there, it'll hit the target now, "It's for you and to your children, and them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Don't adopt anything to It. Don't add any more to It. If you put any more to It... [Acts 2:39]

L-240 Remember, a prescription is just enough antidote in there to take the disease, and enough to kill enough of the--the medicine for the patient. And if you don't, you put too much of the--of the antidote in it, or something another that won't work, weaken it down too much, it won't help the patient. You put too much of the poison in, it'll kill the patient. It's got to be just right.

L-241 And He wrote a Eternal prescription, for it's for every generation. Not shake hands, join church, and all these other things. He said, "Repent, and then be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. It's promised to you and your children." [Acts 2:38]

L-242 They took that prescription and fulfilled it at God's great counter. And when they did, on the Day of Pentecost, they healed the sick, they done everything that there was to be done; 'cause it was God, Christ in them. All right.

L-243 Micaiah knew that that was the Word of the Lord, because it was exactly what the--the Bible, the real Prophet, said. God had cursed that man and cursed his wife, because of their evil. And if (they) He had cursed it, how could these men come around and bless it?

L-244 Here is where they got their idea. The land belongs to them. It actually was given to them. But their sins had drove them away from it. So they thought, because the land belonged to them, that that was all they had to have. No, sir.

L-245 It's on conditions. Absolutely. You can have Divine healing, you can have salvation, you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but that's on conditions, that you meet God's conditions. Outside of that, it's not for nobody but believers.

L-246 A man said to me, not long ago, a minister, he said, "I don't care if you would raise and have doctors' statements of raising the dead, and everything else," said, "I don't believe it." I said, "Certainly not, it's not for unbelievers."

L-247 It's only to believers. It wasn't given to unbelievers. It's only sent to believers. That's all it's for, is for believers, not unbelievers. Certainly, they admit there what--what's wrong.

L-248 But Micaiah knew. When he seen his vision was exactly with the Word of God, then he knew it was right. And he was persistent, whether it took his life or not. He said, "You'll find out, when all this happens that I've said, comes to pass, then you'll know where It's at."

L-249 Same way, the blind man, he couldn't argue their theology; but he knowed his eyes was opened, so he was very persistent about it. Like Philip, and like Nathanael, woman at the well, they were all persistent after they got a hold of God.

L-250 Now in closing, we're going to start the prayer line just now in a minute, just something comes on my mind just now to say.

L-251 Not long ago, I was in Mexico, down. The Lord had sent me down to Mexico City, that big ring there. Oh, people were by the thousands times thousands. And the night before, there had been an old blind man come on the platform, and, now, it was one of the most horrible sights. There was a...

L-252 How many knows Brother Espinoza? See, there is many. Sure. Well, now, he was my interpreter. He can tell you this. And there had been a blind man come up on the platform, poor old Mexican.

L-253 And their economics are so poorly balanced there. For instance, maybe a--a brick mason will get so many pesos a 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min day, maybe say five pesos a day. I don't know what it would. And that's Pedro, and he gets... He is a brick mason, so he gets five pesos a day, but he has to work five days to buy himself a pair of shoes, see, in their economics. And what about little Pancho then, Chico, the little one that has to work out here and only gets two pesos a day, and got five children to feed? But they have to save enough out of that, to burn a grease candle on a million-dollar gold altar, for his sins, you see. That's what burnt me up, and so then see them doing penitence to dead women, and crawling on their knees, and things like that.

L-254 So, one night, this old man come across the platform, he didn't have no shoes on. His hair was gray. He had an old hat tied up with strings. He was coming across the platform. I looked at the old fellow. And here I was standing with a nice pair of shoes and a good suit. He was blind. He was walking like this. And he said, and he kept saying something. Course, I can't speak just a few words of Spanish. He come across this way. And I got to him, I put... I thought nobody would see me; I--I put my foot out like this, to see if my foot, if my shoe would fit him. If it was, I was going to slip them off and let him have them. And, then, his foot was much bigger. And so I--I kind of... I said, "Bless you, dad."

L-255 And I put my shoulders up, see if my coat would fit him. And it wouldn't fit him, and much bigger. Didn't have no shirt, just an old coat on. And I thought, "Poor old fellow, maybe never had a good decent meal in his life." His old trousers, ragged, and dust all over him. And here the Devil had even blinded him. And there he was, walking across there, saying something. And I thought, "If my daddy would have lived, he'd been about the age of that old man." I thought, "O God!"

L-256 And I put my arms around him. You have to feel for the people. If you don't feel for them, there is no need of praying, you don't have compassion. And I put my arm around him.

L-257 I said, "Don't say this, Brother Espinoza." They don't interpret the prayer, anyhow.

L-258 So I said, "Heavenly Father, be merciful to him." I had my hands laid on him on like that.

L-259 He hollered, "Gloria de Dios!" That means, "Glory to God." See? He looked around like that, and the old man could see as good as I could. There he went, walking off the platform.

L-260 Well, the--the next night, they had about, oh, almost from here to the door, would be the platform, and just old shawls and old ragged clothes piled up there, to be prayed over. And it was pouring down rain, they couldn't get... And they come there that morning, around eight or nine o'clock; and I wouldn't be there until that night, about eight or nine. So there was so many people around. No seats to sit down in, like you got. They leaned against each other. Standing there in that rain, the women with their hair all down, wet, just waiting to hear the Word of Life.

L-261 And General Valdivia taken me in. I guess you knowed of him, he is one of the Christian businessmen. And first protestant ever taken in under the government protection. General Valdivia in Mexico, so then I was...

L-262 That night I got in, they let me down on some ropes, back out the back of the ring. I come down into it like this, by ropes, from back off of a car. And while I got down into the ring, I walked over there. And Billy come to me, my son, he said, "There is a fellow there been giving out prayer cards." I call him Mañana, that means "tomorrow," he was so slow, and he never would come get me. So he would give out the prayer cards.

L-263 And Billy said, "Well," he said, "Daddy, there is a woman down there that's got a dead baby." And you all seen this article in the Business Men's Voice. And he said, "She has got a dead baby." And said, "We haven't got no prayer cards." And said, "I've got around three hundred ushers that can't hold her."

L-264 And she--she was a little bitty woman, just young lady, very pretty young woman. And she was... had this little dead baby, and a little blue striped blanket on it, holding a little stiff form, about this long, in her arms, had been standing there since that morning. The baby died at nine o'clock, and this was about ten that night. And so she was holding this little baby in her arms.

L-265 And I said--said, I said, "Well, just tell them ushers to hold her off. If you put her in with them people holding a prayer card," I said, "it'll make..." And I said, "Won't you tell her come around?" 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-266 Said, "You can't tell her nothing." Said, "She just won't listen to it." And I said, "Well, enough ushers over there, surely, to hold her off." Said, "You can't do it."

L-267 I said, "Brother Moore." How many knows Brother Jack Moore? He is a... I said, "She wouldn't know the difference between you and I. She don't know me." I said, "You go on down there and pray for her, Brother Moore." He said, he said, "All right."

L-268 I said, "You go down and pray for the baby. And that'll satisfy her, and she'll go on home." He said, "All right."

L-269 So I turned back around. I was speaking on "faith being the substance of things hoped for," and about Jesus, and how He did when He was here on earth, speaking to them. And just as I started to speak, I looked out in front of me, in a vision, and there was a little dark-faced baby, and he was--he was laughing at me. And I looked again. Brother Espinoza said, "What is it, Brother Branham?"

L-270 I said, "Never mind, Brother Espinoza. Just keep the crowd entertained, just a moment."

L-271 And I went out. I said, "Wait a minute, Brother Moore." And so he had done got down to where the little... where the little woman was. And I said, "Tell her to bring the baby here."

L-272 And so here she come up on the platform. She fell down on one knee, with a rosary in her hand. She was saying, "padre," that means "father," you know.

L-273 I said, "Stand up now. Stand up." Got her stand up. I said, "Baby dead?" She couldn't understand. The tears running down her little face, and her hair stringing down. Now this is true; there is my Bible. And, see, I put my hand over on the little baby, and I thought that would satisfy her. I didn't know that was the baby. I couldn't say it.

L-274 And I said, "Heavenly Father," I said, "before me was a vision of a little baby, and maybe this would be the one. And if it is, I pray Thee, Lord, to honor this little woman's faith, to give her baby back."

L-275 And just then that little fellow let out a scream and begin to cry out, just as hard as he could. And the little woman, she didn't know what to do. So she... I told Brother Espinoza. I said, "Now don't you say it. And wait, you go and let a doctor sign the statement to that."

L-276 And in the Voice, the Christian Business Men's Voice, just recently, it appeared. See, before you write anything, you've got to have evidence that that's right. Doctor signed the statement, "The baby died, with pneumonia; all respiration left it, that morning at nine o'clock," in his office. And this was ten something that night, when it come back to life again, because a little woman was persistent.

L-277 If God could open the eyes of a blind man, He also could give her baby back. He is still the same God, tonight, friend. You've got to be persistent, to achieve something. What if she would have listened, and said, "Well, the baby is dead," and just give it up and go on? See? And see if that same faith that lived in the women like the Shunammite woman, it still lives in people today. Once in a while, they could strike that something. Not a put on, not a make-belief; but something that's real, something that's--that's genuine. Don't you think we can do that tonight? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-278 Now we are going to pray for the sick, laying hands upon them, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, to pray for them. Now we probably can have the line through in about, oh, perhaps twenty, thirty minutes. Now we can't stop for a discernment, you really understand that, because it would be so much. But we're going to pray and lay hands on the sick. Are you ready tonight? Do you feel, in your heart, something is anchored, the Presence?

L-279 How many has been here in the meetings through the week, let's see your hands. I guess practically all of you. All right. How many that's never been in one of the meetings before, raise your hands. Well, my, that's half. Well, I guess some can't get in. Well, let me just say to them... Course, some of them may have a prayer card.

L-280 Divine healing is something that God has already done. See, it's something. We believe, and I believe with all my heart, that the Bible of Hebrews 13:8, "that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever," He is the same. And 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min I believe that the Life that was in Christ should be in us, if we're Christians. And He said, in Saint John 14:12, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do, shall he do also." Said, in Saint John 5:19, "I do nothing till the Father shows Me." Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-281 Now here, for instance, here. Every one of you, as far as I know, is strangers to me. All right, I want everybody to be real reverent for a moment. And if Jesus Christ doesn't appear among us, in His same Power, then I'm a false prophet, don't listen to me no more.

L-282 How many here doesn't have a prayer card, you won't be in no prayer line, raise up your hand, anywhere you're at. You look this way, and pray with all your heart, and believe. This is a hard... Wasn't, didn't come prepared for this now, but I know we ain't got much longer to stay here.

L-283 Now I'm going to take every spirit in here under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now sit still. And if you don't believe, why, better keep your head bowed, see. See?

L-284 But if you're a believer, the Bible said that, "He is the High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities." And how did He act when the woman touched Him? He turned around and knowed who she was, and what was wrong with her. He perceived the thoughts of their heart. Don't you believe He is the same today and forever? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] If you have a need, you pray now. And what is... "What are you talking about, Brother Branham?"

L-285 If I'm His servant, and I claim that His life is in here, then the same works will show theirself. Now, you know a man can't do those things. It's impossible. But Christ remains the same. And I want you to believe that.

L-286 Anywhere in the building, I want you to have faith in God and just believe, and you say, "Lord Jesus, the man doesn't know me. And I've been hearing about this, but maybe it's so, and maybe. I don't know. But I know he doesn't know me. And I know if he could tell me... Now he says, 'Your healing is already done.'"

L-287 If Jesus was standing right here now, with this suit on, that He gave me, He could not heal you. How many knows that, you Bible students? No, He has already done it. See? See? He could prove that He was Jesus, same yesterday, today, and forever; not by nail scars. His Life! Anybody could have nail scars and wear long hair, maybe, and a beard. We don't even know He dressed like that. We couldn't say that that was right. See? But any man could do that. But His Life is what it is, His Life in you.

L-288 Now you pray, and you say, "Lord Jesus, let me touch You," and find out whether He remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. If He'll do it, will you believe? You know that's the way He did it. That proved Him being Messiah.

L-289 This little lady sitting here, keeps looking up at me, and putting her hands over her face, and so forth. You have a... You don't have a prayer card, I suppose. You, I mean the little lady, you don't have a prayer card. No. All right, do you believe me to be God's servant? If the Lord Jesus Christ then... We are perfectly strangers, we're--we're a different race, one from the other. But if I can just speak to you.

L-290 Sitting in front of you is a good friend of mine, Mr. Dauch, from down in Ohio, that had a complete heart failure, not long ago, at ninety-one years old. Doctors give him up, and everything. I started to him. He is a lovely brother, he and his lovely wife, sitting there. They're good friends of mine. And I started to him. And I was just coming out of a filling station, trying to get to him, about a couple, three hundred miles from me. And I was driving as hard as I could, to get to him, 'cause he... She called me, said, "Bill is dying." Complete heart failure, and a heart attack, and ninety-one years old. And I started out of the filling station, I seen Bill standing before me, walking to me, on the street. "I come with THUS SAITH THE LORD. He won't die."

L-291 Here he sits right here now. That's been months ago. He has got much faith. He is sitting close to this woman. She is sitting right behind him. He believes. She is believing, too.

L-292 Now, I don't know you. But if Jesus Christ... While, we're talking now like our Lord talked to the woman at the well. If He will tell me what's your trouble, what you want, or something, well, you'll know whether it's the Truth or not, won't you? It's for a son, and that son has a mental condition. It's a... If that's right, raise up your hands, if that. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min That, that's right. That's right. All right. If you will believe with all your heart, and take that scarf that you've wiped your face with, lay it close to him, and don't doubt, that condition will leave him. Now the very God that could tell you... Don't you doubt. Can't you see what's happened?

L-293 Look right--right at this woman, going right to her sitting here, a--a colored lady. I'm a stranger to you. But there is something you're desiring. And me being a stranger, another race; just like our Lord and the woman at the well, one a Jew, and the other one a Samaritan. If God... Have you got a prayer card? You don't have a prayer card. I mean this little lady with a red striped dress on, right there. Yes. All right. I--I--I don't know you. We're total strangers. Is that right? And now if God can reveal to me what is wrong with you, or something, and you know whether it's right or not, won't you? Frankly, there is nothing wrong with you, only you have a hungry heart. You are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If that's right, raise up your hand. Then you will receive It, that's right, if you will believe with all your heart. Just don't doubt. Have faith in God. Amen. Yeah. You believe with all your heart? I want you to believe with all that's in you.

L-294 Here is a lady sitting here, looking right at me, right down that aisle here. She is suffering with a heart trouble. I hope she don't miss it. God, tell me who. She is Mrs. Fitzgerald. You believe with all your heart? You can have your healing. Raise your hand. I'm a stranger to you. Is that right? Your heart trouble is gone. Is that your name? That's right. I don't know you, never seen you in my life.

L-295 The lady right behind you, she has got a lot of faith now. She's got a prayer card in her hand, but the lady is suffering. And being It's the Holy Spirit, that Light hanging right over the woman yet. She is suffering with a... She has got a tumor in her neck. And she's also got a fallen stomach. That's right, isn't it? Just lay your prayer card on the floor, you don't need it no more. Have faith in God. Believe.

L-296 Do you believe with all your heart? See? Just have faith. Don't doubt. Here is a man right back here, he's got tumor.

L-297 See, that devil, thought he would miss it then. There is a man sitting right over here, that's got tumor. The tumor is in his back. I don't know the man. I've never seen him. He is a total stranger to me. But when I seen that devil go out there, that black shadow; and then I seen it run over this way, it went to this one, for mercy. They're trying to congregate around there. Satan thought he would miss that, see, I'd missed it. But the Lord showed it to me.

L-298 The man sitting right here, he's got tumor in his back, and his name is Mr. Carson. If that's right, raise up to your feet, and be healed in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-299 Do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Have faith. If you...

L-300 Here is a woman sitting here. She's got a kidney trouble. She has got complications. Her name is Mrs. Byrd. That's right. Is that your name, lady? Am I a stranger to you, is that's the trouble you've had? If it is, stand up on your feet and accept your healing, in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-301 Go ask those people. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Don't you--don't you realize that His Presence is here?

L-302 That was my son telling me, "Better not go on." See, I got a meeting tomorrow, and tomorrow, and on and on, see.

L-303 I challenge any man or woman in here to believe. You couldn't hide your life if you had to now, in the Presence of God. That's exactly what our Lord did. That's exactly what He promised in the last days. That's exactly what happened before Sodom burned. That's exactly the last sign that would come to the church. We're here now at the end time. You believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-304 What's your prayer card number? [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] All right, I'll tell you what would be best, let's take the people by the sections. He says there is many prayer cards. Now you see God is here.

L-305 Now is there any ministers? This is all right, Brother Vick? Is there any ministers here, brethren? Now I'm laying hands on these people, I don't want them people go, say, "Brother Branham did this." See? I--I'm just your brother. Your pastor has just as much right to pray for the sick as I do. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min

L-306 He might not have this gift; no, he hasn't, see. There is only one of them in the world, at a time. That's exactly what the Bible said, see. That's right. And, that, now notice.

L-307 But your pastor is ordained of God, if he's a believer, to pray for the sick. And I'm asking some of you minister brethren to come here and stand with me while we pray; let some God-, Spirit-filled ministers that believes in prayer for the sick, with along with Brother Vick, Brother Boze. Where is Doctor Lee Vayle and some of them that would come here, so that... The Bible said, "These signs..."

L-308 Let's stop right here, brethren. How about right here? Come right here. Yes.

L-309 "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." Do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Do you believe we're in Divine Presence of Christ? ["Amen."] Amen.

L-310 I just wanted you to see. Because I spoke the way I did, it was for a purpose, see, or the purpose worked right. Great things are fixing to happen, if you'll just believe it.

L-311 Now I'll tell you what I want you to do, brethren. I want you divide up half on one side, and half on another, make a little alley-like through here, so the people can come. I'm coming right down with you.

L-312 I'm going to ask someone who is a song leader, that would come here, that could lead songs. I want to go down there and pray for the people. Somebody who can stand here and direct the people that's going to be prayed for. Thank you, choir, for giving us... That's mighty nice of you, giving us that room to come like that. All right.

L-313 Let the ministers line up just like this, right. Turn, face each other, see, like this, and like the brother and I. Like Billy and I here, stand like this, one with the other.

L-314 Now how many has prayer cards on this side? Let's see your hands. There is quite a number. I suppose it would be best if we could let them come out on this side, and come right down along the side, this a way. Now before you... But let's let the first part of the line that has cards, let them line right up over here, and we'll start praying for the sick, and laying hands on them.

L-315 I wonder how many here, tonight, that's--that's all right and well, and you are interested in these people getting well? Raise up your hand. Sure, you are. Now remember, will you pray with me? You pray with me. Now you pray with your pastors.

L-316 Now to you sick people that's going to line up and be prayed for here. Remember, when you come through this line, and these ministers and myself touch you, remember, it's just an act just the same as you was baptized. You've come, having hands laid upon you, by believing-ministers, that, God promised that, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick. And these signs shall follow them that believe." These man come here to testify that they believe in this ministry. And they are come here as associates to it, with us together. We are all of one accord. We're in one place at one time. It's time now for the healing. But, if you don't believe it, don't come, 'cause it won't do you any good. See, you've got to believe it. Now do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-317 Now let's just bow our heads just for a few moments. And we're going to sing slowly now. Everybody with your head bowed. "Lord, I believe," Only Believe, now everyone together. Let's be praying now, see.

L-318 Let's imagine seeing Jesus coming down off of the mountain. What Jesus? That same Jesus that's here in the Holy Ghost form. Same One that knows what's in your heart, whether you really believe or not. The same One that knows all about you, tells you night after night. It's Him. You know it couldn't be me.

L-319 And now after His--His Presence... Now, the little Syrophenician woman, remember, after she got in the Presence of Jesus, still she had trouble. You're going to have trouble. When you come through this line, I want you, each one, to believe that you're going to be healed. If you're not, don't come in. Don't--don't just don't take the others' place. Stay there until you have enough faith that you're going to be healed, and then God will grant it to you.

L-320 Now those on my right side here, line up over on the side, while the rest of us sing Only Believe. You with a prayer card, some of the boys will be standing There to receive your prayer card as you come in the line, over on this side, the right-hand side. Go out on the right-hand side if you possibly can, 'cause it'll confuse them, starting this way. 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min You can't go backwards. You have to come around this a way, see; have to come one way, go around. If you brethren will just--just step back there and let them come through this way. It's a bit, may seem a bit confusing, because that there is such a--a--a group of people to be taken care of. But now watch my son, Billy Paul, watch the ushers there; they'll tell you just how to do it, won't be a bit confused. Then you see, on this side, as you come through the prayer line, then you'll go right back to your seat. And then we'll take this other side, and they'll come from that way, and come through, see.

L-321 Now we'll stand here, just vice versa, the line, from one side to the other, and pray for them. All right.

L-322 Now I believe if you brethren will move down just a little bit, so these brothers here can get in right here, so we can all be laying hands on the sick. That's just fine.

L-323 Now listen, brethren, each one of you now. Each one of you brethren, do you realize what you're doing, see, you know the position that God has put you in? Now this challenges your faith. Just remember that you're going to believe that every person that you touch, you, has to get well. They just have to do it. God said so. I'm going to touch them, with you, and I believe they're going back to be well. Don't you believe that? [The brethren say, "Amen."--Ed.] Let's just have a word of prayer among ourselves, while the rest of you go ahead and line up, we're going to pray for the condition of our own faith.

L-324 Heavenly Father, there is many sick people here. And some of them, Lord, still believe that they should have hands of the elders laid on them. That's all right, Father. We know that You taught that. You said, "These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover." You promised it, and the people believe their promise. Your Presence is here. No one can doubt that, Lord. And here is Your ordained ministers standing here, ordained of the Holy Spirit, the ministry of praying for the sick. [Mark 16:17-18]

L-325 Now, Lord God, let every one that we touch, tonight, be healed. We pray the prayer of faith for these now. We're going to believe, that, as we lay our hands on them, they will recover. Amen. Condition us, Lord. Take away our sin and our--and our iniquity. Purge us with the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we'll... Our hands are not holy. Only through Your holiness are we permitted to do this. So grant it, Lord, as I commit myself, with this bunch of brothers, that we're here to help these people to be healed. Grant it, Lord.

L-326 And now I pray for the people, each one that comes through the prayer line. O God, they're coming as if they were coming for water baptism, they're coming right to the table of the Lord, they're coming beneath the cross of Calvary. As they pass through here, may they realize that the unseen Christ Who is standing amongst these brethren, standing here now to grant to them reward of their faith. And I commit it all to You now, Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-327 Now I want everyone else, have your heads bowed. Listen close now to your instructions. If you don't, you're just taking a walk, see. Now remember, if God will let me know the conditions and so forth, and you believe that, see, now just take my word, you've got to believe that this settles it. If it doesn't, it might make you worse. See, settle everything! If you've got sin in your life, step out of the line and confess it. And don't come in the line till you're prayed through. And if you're going to use your life for something besides the glory of God, don't come in the line. See? If you are ready to make a dedication to Christ, fully surrendered, and fully persuaded that this is Jesus Christ, this great Holy Spirit here; and that you are going to receive your healing when you pass through this line, no matter whether you feel different, or what, you're going to be persistent to hold right onto God's promises until the victory comes, like that woman than we talked about. Do you feel that way, audience? If you do, raise up your hand, say, "I accept that." [Congregation rejoices--Ed.] I don't see no reason for anybody going out of here sick, tonight.

L-328 Now I want you, that's not in the line, to pray. I guess Brother Joseph is going to stand here to lead the singing, and I'm going to get down here, so I can pray, too, and lay hands upon these people as they come through.

L-329 Now look, friends, the services will be tomorrow night. We don't know what will happen, somebody getting healed, and screaming and praising God, and so forth. We might get not officially dismissed for a while now, but please stay and pray with us. We need you right now. Pray that the enemy will not be able to crowd any doubt in these 63-1116E, Perseverance, Marc Ballroom, New York, NY, 116 min people's mind. What if that was your mother standing there, your sister, your wife, your husband, your baby? You would want somebody to pray real sincere. Remember, it's somebody's mother, somebody's sister, brother, somebody's child, and we want to be sincere about this.

L-330 And when we pray, I want you men, with all your heart, when you lay your hands upon these sick, believe that God is going to make that person well, 'cause they're going to believe it.

L-331 And now, between now and tomorrow night, why, before I come on the platform, tomorrow night, there ought to be three or four hundred testimonies going right here, of, "I was wearing crutches. I was, and I don't have them no more. I was sick, I'm not sick no more." Within the next twenty-four hours, devils will be leaving this place, and because the blessings is pronounced upon the people.

L-332 Now let us bow our heads as we pray, each one as they pass through the line now. Brethren, just laying your hands upon the sick. All right.

L-333 [Brother Branham goes down with the ministers, and prays for the sick. Brother Joseph Bose leads the congregation in singing. Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-334 Don't you feel right now? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] How many believes that you are healed? ["Amen."] Passing through the prayer line here, time after time after time, it happened right here, that, before they got away from the platform, I believe that each one of you will be well. Oh, I--I believe it. I accept it for you. My faith goes with you, that they will be well. Do you believe that, brethren? ["Amen."] Oh, my, isn't He wonderful!

L-335 Let's just now sing a praise to Him before we're dismissed. And then let's just raise up our hands, and hold them up high. And, remember, we've been through, by the cross, and there is where we got the Light. At the cross,... first saw the Light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, Oh, it was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day! At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the Light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
