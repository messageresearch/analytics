--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Only believe, All things are possible, only believe. [A brother asks, "Do you want these mikes on?"--Ed.] Turn them off, if you will. That's better. Shall we bow our heads just a moment for prayer. Our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. We thank Thee tonight, Father, for the Lord Jesus Christ Who gave Hisself for us, we unworthy ones, but yet, He was willing to die for the unworthy. And we humbly accept it tonight, Lord, with all of our heart as He, being our Saviour, Redeemer, Healer. And we pray, Father, tonight that His great Being will be present with us and will baptize us in His blessings. And may when we go from here tonight, may we go like those from Emmaus, saying, "Did not our hearts burn within us, because we seen Him and we knew Him." For we ask it in His Name. Amen. You can be seated.

L-2 So happy for the opportunity to be in this lovely auditorium tonight here in Chicago in this Lane High School Auditorium. And we are certainly grateful to the peoples who are here, to be present at the meeting, and for all the ministers, the laity, all of God's children, the strangers in our gates. We're very thankful to this school for their fine cooperation with us to let us to let us have this through this next coming week. The churches are lovely, but they're just a little small for this type of meeting. And we're grateful for--to this school. May God grant it the best. And for the engineer here, the electrician, and--and some that I've met today, of the ones who work here in the--with the auditorium... And we are very grateful to them and may God bless them.

L-3 Now, we trust that this week will be one of our greatest weeks in the--in the history of Chicago because of His Presence. And I am so grateful for these things, for the opportunity. Some of you here perhaps--perhaps... How many's here was never in one of our campaigns before? Let's see your hands, never was in one of our campaigns before. Well, there's quite a number that has never been in them before. Well, we certainly welcome you with the heartiest of welcomes. And I want to say to many of you, probably here for the first night beginning in the campaign, we been in a few nights over at the Philadelphian Church with our good friend Brother Joseph Boze. And we appreciate that fine courtesy we find from he and from his over there, his group. And now, many of you here and last time 'fore going over to India, you helped sponsor that meeting to India. We had a great success. The Lord blessed, and many thousands of people came to know the Lord Jesus Christ who were unbelievers before.

L-4 Just a few night's meeting we stayed because of not sufficient room to put the people. It was approximately five hundred thousand people at the meeting. And we've had no place to put them, and they had to lay in the streets and everywhere they could. And it was just such a pathetic sight, and it raining and everything, that we told them we would come at another season to them. And we, God willing, I hope to be back again this coming summer with the Indian people. And I certainly appreciate all that you done. And someday in the great beyond, you... some of those unbelieving heathens that worshipped idols, cattle, and flies, and fleas, and insects, and the sun, and all kinds of objects, now are sweet, lovely, humble Christians because you helped send the Gospel over there. And at the day of the reward (See?) you is the one who gets the reward. I only done what He told me to do. You were the one who sponsored the way. So the Lord bless you.

L-5 Now, this afternoon, I had about thirty, forty minutes of speaking a Gospel message. And last night I spoke on a Gospel message, and tonight we want to have healing services, God being willing. So therefore, I will not be able to go 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min into the other message for tonight, 'cause it takes so much time in the healing line. It doesn't, say now, that I do the healing. It's your faith in God that does the healing. See? It isn't I. I have nothing to do with it, just try to bring your faith up to a place where you can be healed. And I'm sure that every person that believes on the Lord, be more than glad to help everything they can to see someone get well.

L-6 There's a wonderful story from India, I told it at the little church the other night, of a blind man, been blind twenty years. He's even testified before the President. He's just as perfectly normal as any man of his age, thirty or forty years old, that's in the building tonight, after being totally blind for twenty years. And in that miracle that our Lord Jesus performed, that what caused the thousands at one time to come to the Lord Jesus. When it was brought to a showdown, if God is God, after the vision had been seen, of course, that he was going to be healed, then we could bring it to a showdown. But I would be daresn't to do that, just challenge it, without knowing what I was doing. But the Lord told you, "When you come to church tomorrow night, bring your umbrella because it's going to be raining when you go home." It wouldn't be hard to believe that. You'd bring your umbrella, wouldn't you? Well, if He told you so, if He met and said to bring it, you'd sure bring it 'cause you know it was going to rain. Well, that's just the way it is. When He tells us anything, it's got to happen.

L-7 Now, in the Gospel of Saint Mark tonight, the Lord willing, just to speak just for a few moments... I'll lay my watch out here, and try to be ready in the next ten or fifteen minutes for the--the prayer line. And that will let us out, time... We don't want to keep you late, because tomorrow you work. We want to cooperate every way we can and try to bring the Gospel to you. And may you receive It tonight in the--in the way that it's tried to be given to you, with a heart full of love for every one of you, knowing that each one of us are an eternity bound person. I don't know what time I'm going to have to stand in His Presence to give an account for my life. No one here knows. But one thing sure, we're going to have to stand There; so we must make every hour count. That's why I'm here tonight.

L-8 I believe that you're lovely, big city here... Of every city that I've ministered to in the United States, Canada, and to Mexico, I don't know of a city on the North America continent that I think is any more ready for a revival than Chicago. That's right. I trust that God will give it to you. I do. I hope it starts now, goes on through. I hear that Mr. Graham, our Brother Billy Graham, is coming next year. And I pray that there'll be so many converted between now and then, that he will be able to take it to all Chicago, and all Chicago be a little Jerusalem around here. I'd just like to see it, for it would just be wonderful. So we'll keep praying, trusting, looking up, believing that God will do it.

L-9 Now, I just want to speak a few words here and read a little from the Bible. Then we'll call the prayer line. Now, in the Saint Mark the 5th chapter, we read these words, the first couple of verses, just for a little background. And they came over unto the other side of the sea, unto the country of the Gadarenes. And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man possessed with an unclean spirit. And may the Lord add His blessings to this reading. Just to get the company of believers here settled down, so the Holy Spirit can go to work immediately, and start a work on the people to heal them, that's the reason I speak just a few moments. I been in prayer for the last two or three hours since I left here, and we're ready now for the service. The Angel of the Lord is near.

L-10 In this time Jesus had done great things in these early days, in His early ministry. He was misunderstood as most everyone. Did you ever come to think of it, that most men who ever do anything great for the Kingdom of God stand alone? Did you ever think of it? You have to stand by yourself. Jesus stood alone; and all down through the ages other men who stood alone: Finney, Sankey, and Calvin, Knox, even to Abraham Lincoln. That's right. Stood alone... Men who do great things, men of vision, men of spiritual understanding, stand alone. And I think that's because that Jesus had to stand alone Himself. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min

L-11 Now, the one principle of us being here... trying to help you. And the only way that I know, Christian friends, to help you is to get your faith, the best that I can by the Word of God, centered on the will of God for you. See? If you can only see that it's God's will to do these things for you... It's God's will to save you all. It's God's will to heal you all. And He will certainly lead you into deeper depths and higher heights, if you'll just trust Him. Don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night. Let's build it a little farther up the road tonight. Never build it in the same place. You can't stand still. You're either backsliding or going forward.

L-12 We've had years now. There hasn't been too much done. But I truly believe, that we're entering into the greatest time this world has ever seen. I certainly believe that there is coming a time, and it's at hand now, of God going to make Hisself manifested, the greatest He's ever done in all ages. This is the ending up of the time. Time will be no more one of these days. We come out of--of eternity, stepped into a little time space here, and stepped out of time back into eternity. We was before there was a world. Then we came into the world, and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now. And now, in here we've had our--our Saviour come here to the earth, God Himself, made Hisself manifested to us and give us the hope of Everlasting Life, Eternal Life. And also, in there He promised us joy and happiness and contentment which is the earnest of our salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance.

L-13 And it's in our hearts something that pounds great, for we know that God has give us this great attribute. Also in there, He gave us the hope of a resurrection of our body. And for the earnest money of that, He gave us Divine healing. And if all the world tonight would go down on Divine healing and say there is no such a thing. I could not say but what there is. For first, the Bible said so, and Christian friend, I done come too far, seen too much (See?), I--to never turn from that for I know what it is. As long as God keeps me mentally right, and helps me, and gives me His love in my heart, as I have it now, I'll always know He's a Healer. For nothing could save me from my sickness, the condition that I was in, not even Mayo's Clinic. They turned me down. But tonight, by God's grace, I'm in perfect health.

L-14 And so I've seen thousands of those. And now, I don't give myself credit. I have no credit. I'm only grateful to God that He let's me take the message to others. For any man that would have anything good and keep it himself and wouldn't divide it with someone else, is selfish. And that's not the Christian attitude. We must be willing to help others, and see that others get--gets the same blessing that we're getting.

L-15 If I was to be a millionaire tonight, I'd want everybody in the world to be a millionaire. See? 'Cause I--I... We are brothers. We might disagree upon different things, but we're still brothers and sisters. We love each other when the love of God is in our hearts. And even being enemies, as--if we'd have any, which we probably have... But still, we love them anyhow because they, no matter what of estate they're in, they're God's children, fallen, but they're God's children yet. And now, tonight my purpose is to try to base your faith on the Word of God, that you might know that Jesus Christ is not dead. But He's living right here in Chicago in this room tonight. If we'd only seen what He did...

L-16 And let's look at it just as sensibly. And to some of you people who do understand, bear with the newcomers. We could just ask this question. The theme of my campaign has always been Jesus Christ the Same Yesterday, Today, and Forever. And if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, He's bound to do the same things that He did yesterday, for that's how we know Who He was by the things He done. Even the Jews, the great Nicodemus, the teacher, came to Him by night and said, "Rabbi, we know that Thou art a Teacher come from God. For no man can do these things that You do 'less God would be with him." They knew that.

L-17 Well, now, if He has raised from the dead, and promised that the very same things that He did, we would do also, now, that's got to be either right or wrong. Isn't that right, church? It's right or wrong. Well, if it is right, let's embrace it and love Him with all of our hearts. If it isn't right, let's get away from it 'cause it's not right. When they was reading the Koran Bible to me, not long ago in India, and someone had been there a little before me, and they wanted to believe that part of It was inspired, and Mark 16 wasn't inspired and some more of It wasn't inspired. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min He said, "What kind of a Bible have you got?" Said, "We believe all the Koran's inspired." Said, "If part of this is inspired and the rest of it's not inspired, how can you have faith?" That's right.

L-18 Now, It's either all inspired or none of It's inspired. I believe every word of It is inspired, written by God, if we can only rightly put it in Its place, where It belongs. And if we put it in Its place, God will perform and operate and prove His Word. Now, you couldn't put a grain of corn in a box of sawdust or ashes, and it would grow. It won't do it. It's got to be in the right kind of soil to make it grow. Is that right?

L-19 Well, that's... It's corn; it'll grow if it's in the right place. And wheat, you couldn't put it out in a dry place like you would raise onions, or turnips, or something in sandy ground. You couldn't put a wheat out there, for it wouldn't grow. It's got to be in... It's bedded down in water. See? It's got to be in the right kind of soil, and so does God's Word have to be put in the right kind of soil, or faith, or it won't produce nothing. You see what I mean? Yet you receive it as the Word, but if it isn't in the right kind of a soil, it won't materialize. It just can't, because there's nothing there to make it grow. But if it's ever received with faith, something's going to happen.

L-20 Now, Jesus, when He was here on earth, the works and signs and wonders that He did then, now He will do it again tonight. He will do it every time that His Word is put to a showdown, He will do it, for He has to in order to be the resurrected Jesus. Now, if He doesn't do it, then He never raised from the dead. That's right. He's still dead. But we don't worship a dead God. We worship a living God Who's raised from the dead, and lives here among us tonight, and doing the same things tonight that He did back there. Now, for the newcomers we might ask this: "What did He do back there? What kind of a Man was He? What kind of works did He do?" Well, He didn't entertain too big of crowds. He'd have up sometimes five thousand in a crowd. The Sanhedrin could've called two million in a crowd. So He didn't say that He just drawed the biggest crowds in the country. That doesn't mean that He was right.

L-21 He didn't dress any different from anybody else. He was no great, big man and a high statue like Saul. The Bible said, "There was no beauty we should desire Him. And when we seen Him, we hid our face from Him." See? He was just nothing much to look at. But what He was, what makes us love Him. He was the Son of God. That's what makes us love Him. Someone might say, "Well, was He a yellow man, black man, white man, brown man?" I don't care what He was, what He looked like. He's my Saviour. I love Him. Don't make any difference whether He was little, big or--or what He was. I love Him. For when we are born into Him, we become a part of Him. We love Him, and He is ours, and we are His.

L-22 But when He was here on earth, He didn't claim that He was a great healer. Frankly, He claimed just the vice versa. He said He wasn't no healer. He said, "I can do nothing in Myself. Just what I see the Father doing, that's what I do." Saint John 5:19. He was questioned. He'd healed one man laying on a pallet with some kind of a disease or something. The man could walk. He said, "When I'm coming down to the pool somebody steps in ahead of me." But look what He passed by: maybe three or four times as many people that's in here tonight, and every one of them was lame, hopped, twisted, withered, and blind. Just look what a condition. And He passed right through every one of them, went and healed this one, and walked away, and left the rest of them there. To the natural mind, it would be questioned. As I have said, there's three elements that people dwell in. This first one is humanistic. We, down here we say, "Well, I'll pray for that person. I--I--I'm hoping that now they'll get well." Now, next is Divine revelation. That's when something down in your heart anchors it, and says it's going to happen. Then something is going to happen. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min Then the third element is vision, or the Word of the Lord made manifest. When you see that, it's THUS SAITH THE LORD.

L-23 Now, Jesus, when He was passing by the gates of Jericho, a blind man run out to Him, begin to cry, and, "Have mercy on me," blind Bartimaeus. And Jesus had His face set to Calvary to go to be crucified, and He, perhaps, never even heard the man. So he cried the much louder, "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." Somehow, the man's faith touched Jesus and He turned around and told him his faith had made him well. A woman one time touched His garment. For in her heart she said, "If I can touch His garment, He's a holy Man. I believe Him to be what He says He is. If I can just only touch Him, I'll be made well of my plague." And she touched Him, turned right around, walked out into the audience. Jesus stopped, looked around over the audience, found where she was at. He said, "Thy faith has made thee whole. Your plague's gone now." That was Jesus. He only did as the Father showed Him.

L-24 He called a woman from the well of Samaria one time to give Him a drink. She wouldn't do it because she thought it was--It was not according to etiquette in that day for there to have any dealings with one another, the Jew and the Samaritan. He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink. And I'd bring you water or give you water that you didn't draw from this well." And He went ahead on the course about the well and so forth and how she said her father Jacob drank from it and so forth. So after while when He got to talking to her a little while, He said, "Go, get your husband." That was right straight what the trouble of that woman was.

L-25 I believe if she'd had a cancer, Jesus would have told her she had cancer. I believe if she'd had TB, Jesus would've told her she had TB. Don't you? But what was her trouble? She had five husbands. So He said, "Go, get thy husband." She said, "I have none." Said, "That's right. You got five." She said, "I perceive that You are a prophet, Sir." Now, she said, "I know when the Messiah comes..." That was Jesus. Not knowing that was Him, said, "I know when Messiah comes He will tell us those things." See, that's the sign of the Messiah. Said, "I know when the Messiah comes that He will do this." But other words, "You must be a Prophet, a disciple of the Messiah, for You knew that I were--who I was, and told me now something that I know that You know nothing about. And You told me that I had five husbands, and You don't know nothing about me, so you must be a Prophet." She said, "Now, when the Messiah cometh, He will do that." He said, "I'm He that speaks to you." And she left the water pot, and run into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man." That was it. She couldn't hold herself any longer. Messiah was there, an ordinary man, setting out there waiting for them to go get some meat, and bring it out there for Him to eat, thirsting to drink water out of the well. A Man, Man was laughed at, made fun of, dressed like ordinary men, talked in such poor language, till it even mixes up the translators today.

L-26 What a high talk they had then. They try to bring the Bible expressions up to that. That's the reason one says it's this way and one says it's that way. It was such humble talk till they don't even know what to think about it. God did it that way so He could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and reveal it to babes such as will learn. That's the reason they can't translate it. It'll only be revealed through spiritual revelation. Then when you once get inside with Christ, He will reveal Hisself to you. "This is what it is. That's what it is."

L-27 Now, when we see Him doing those things... Now, if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, well, of course He does the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, when He went away, He said, "A little while and the world will see Me no more. Yet you shall see Me, for..." Now, how... Who is that you? Someone might say, "That's--that was the disciples He was talking to." Well, how could this be then? He said, "A little while and the world won't see Me any more, yet you shall see Me, for I 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Now, the disciples has been dead two thousand years, right on it. So there has to be some you's that'll see Him all the way to the end of the world. And there's got to be some world that will not see Him any more. Aren't you happy tonight you're ye? "If ye believe..." Now, we're so happy for this.

L-28 Notice, He said, "The things that I do..." In other words, the same type of ministry that He had would be with the believer all the way to the end of the world. That makes Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. We teach Him as a living God, not one that's dead, One that's raised from the dead. If He's just here on earth and perform miracles, He was just a prophet. But when He died, if that was the end of it, He was just a prophet. But if He raised from the dead, then He's more than a prophet. He's a Son of God.

L-29 So you see, friends, you've got to believe that just the same as Him here tonight just like He was on Galilee. And when you seen that and see His Word made so plain that It's right here before you, that brings faith up. Then it's not a man that healed you; it's not my prayer that healed you; it's not their prayer that healed you; it's your own faith that heals you. Jesus never said to the woman now, when He found her out there in the audience looking around like that, couldn't find... He felt something, whatever it was. He said "virtue," which means "strength," went from Him. And He looked out to see who it was. Said, "I've been touched."

L-30 Why, the disciples said, "Why, the multitude's a thronging you. Who say--Why You say touch Me?" He said, "Yes, but somebody touched Me." And He looked down over the audience, and then those majestic eyes centered right down to them. She seen she could not be hid. So He said, "Thy faith has saved thee. The plague's gone now." And...

L-31 Now, if that Jesus was standing here tonight, He could look over this audience, and if any person could touch Him with their faith, the same thing would take place. You believe it? Same thing, if He's the same Jesus. Then if He was here tonight, He wouldn't claim that I... "Bring Me this man or this woman, or so-and-so, and let Me heal them." No, no. He said, "I can do nothing less the Father shows Me what to do." Is that correct? Saint John 5:19. That He did nothing unless the Father showed Him. Then when the Father showed Him, He just went and acted out what the Father showed Him to do. Now, Jesus raised from the dead; He could stand here tonight, and you might come here and talk to Him on the platform. He'd look at you, and He'd say, "Well, you have a certain thing wrong with you, and you're Mr. So-and-so, from a certain place."

L-32 You'd say, "Lord Jesus, will You heal me?" He'd say, "Don't you believe Me? I've already did it when I died for you at Calvary. Do you believe this?" You'd said, "Yes." He'd say, "Well, then go on your way. Your faith saved you."

L-33 So...?... healing or salvation cannot come from any man. Now, there's gifts in the church such as prophecy, and gifts of healing, and so forth. That don't mean power to heal; that means knowledge of the Word of healing. A preacher don't mean you're saved. But it means the knowledge of the Word of salvation. He was gifted with the gift to teach, or to preach, or to prophesy, or any of those gifts is to magnify Jesus Christ and bring Him to the people. And then when the people sees it, they believe it, accept it, confess it, then they're saved. That's the same thing a gift of healing does. A man can preach the Word so simple that a child could understand it. The people say, "Well, that's right." Then He's cornering the devil. First thing you know then the person says, "Oh, I believe it. Oh, I believe it's for me." And they accept it. That settles it. They go on testifying of it, and they get well. That's the on...

L-34 Some of you say, "I've seen some testify and didn't get well. I've seen some that professed to be saved and didn't get it... saved." See? It's your faith that does it. If you really believe it, it'll do it. So therefore, no man can save you. No man can heal you for He, He has already been wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities: Was. See? Chastisement of our 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min peace was upon Him and with His stripes we was healed: saved, healed when He died at Calvary. So the only thing that those gifts can do, is point you to the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ at Calvary. You see it?

L-35 Now, a minister with a gift of Divine healing, he'd come in here... It's...?... many gifts and rests in that minister. He comes in here to the building. He takes the Word of God. He's a master-explainer. He can stand and explain it like Mr. Roberts or--or Tommy Osborn, or some of those brethren like that who is masterpieces on the Scripture, wonderful men. They've all been right here in Chicago and preached to you. And you know they are. Master men on the--explaining the Word. That's gifts of healing.

L-36 Now, that's the way they try to make you see Him. That's their gift they have to prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. They believe it with all their heart. And they prove it by the Word that it's right. Now, I'm not a gifted person of that type. My gift is seeing visions. Then when you see something that God has did, something that the Father has made manifest as a spiritual gift, a knowledge that God comes down and anoints, makes them preach the Word... Then God comes down in anointing of another gift, and he will know things, and foreshow things, and tell things that was, and what will be. What's that to do? Does that heal you? No. It brings your faith up to Jesus Christ Who has already healed you. That's it. Then you believe it and go away saying, "Praise the Lord, I'm healed."

L-37 Now, Jesus crossing in the boat (quickly now, just a few minutes), crossing this sea. I can just imagine how that was. He preached all day, and that night a big storm come up on the sea and liked to sunk the little boat, and weary and tired but never afraid. I like that. Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day, and pray all day, and then, say, "Now, I wonder if I've got faith enough to do this." He was unconscious of the faith that He had. Any men or women that ever make real warriors in the Kingdom of God is perfectly unconscious to their faith. You keep trying to test your faith. "Wonder if I've got faith enough to do this? Have I got faith..." Don't test your faith. God said so, do it anyhow. God said so. Have you ever tested your faith whether you had enough faith to come to the meeting or not tonight? Did you test your faith to see if you had enough faith to eat your supper tonight? Have you tested... Do you think you'll have to fast awhile and test your faith to see if you got enough faith to drive your car home? Certainly not. It's just automatically you believe it.

L-38 And that's the way you believe healing. Believe anything God said. Just don't fight at it, and shake at it, and rebuke the devil every minute. Just accept it and go on. That's it. There's--there's nothing to be alarmed about. God said so and that settled it. So we just go ahead, knowing it's going to happen. Just forget about it. God said it, that proves it, I believe it, that settles it. Just... That's all you have to do.

L-39 Jesus laying in the back of the boat, and He was asleep, and He raised up to still the waters. Now, look, He's crossing that stormy sea. And when He gets over to the other side... He come all the way across that stormy sea, through that dark, dismal, rainy, stormy night, when, perhaps, ten thousand devils of the sea swore they'd drowned Him... And there He was out there in that little, old boat bouncing around like that through the night, tired and weary. He come all the way over to Gadara for one purpose. There was one person needed help. That was a maniac of Gadara, a crazy man. He come all the way across the stormy sea. It took Him all night to help one person.

L-40 He'd come all the way from glory tonight to manifest Hisself to heal any person that's in here. That's the loving heart of the Lord Jesus. And when this maniac met Him, he run out there, I suppose, like he was going to kill Him. But He seen he was so completely... That boy was so completely surrendered to Satan till the devil used his tongue. You believe the devil can use your tongue? Certainly he does: Make you say things that you don't want to say, make you lie, steal, make you tell things that's not right, say bad words that God don't want you to say. The devil gets complete control of you. Well, then if he gets all the way control of you, you don't know what you're going to say. You become a mad man. And a person... Do you believe your tongue can be used for Jesus Christ? Certainly it can. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min

L-41 Then you sing the Gospel, preach the Gospel, and--and speak good things, and talk good things, and say good words. Then you can--can come--become so completely surrendered to the Holy Spirit till He can speak a language that you know nothing about. That's right. He can.

L-42 Now, this maniac was so completely in the hands of Satan, poor fellow, bound, perhaps one time a good man. But he just started trifling a little here, and trifling a little there. After while, the devil's had him out in a tomb. And when he was, he's such a powerful man till they could bind him with chains, and he'd just break the chain. Did you ever try to hold a mad man, maniac? Why, they're many times their strength. Try to hold one once and watch how he carries on. Why, he's a rough fellow. What is that? That's supernatural power. It's the devil on the man.

L-43 Well, if the devil can take a man yielded perfectly to him, and make him two or three times his strength, what can a man that's yielded to the Holy Spirit, what can God do for him? How many more times can He make him strong? A man that can't move, is paralyzed, the Holy Spirit get a hold of him, straighten him right up. A man that's so weak he can't raise up...

L-44 A little woman the other night, they was talking about here, from Mayo's that was so--so completely gone, that she was laying on a stretcher. And the Holy Spirit got a hold of her and healed her right there. She got up, and so happy she couldn't even sleep all night when the Mayo Clinic had give her up, just a few nights ago. Now, what is that? Yielding. And this man, when he seen Jesus coming... Perhaps, the devil tore his mind and run out there to get Jesus because no one could pass by. So when that demon got close to the Lord Jesus Christ, he recognized Who it was. Don't say they don't recognize you; they do. You believe devils recognize Christians? Certainly they...

L-45 Well, the Scripture, I believe, some place says that the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees. What a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the living God. When you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble, to the weakest of them. Think of it.

L-46 I seen a poor woman here sometime ago so completely yielded to the Holy--unto the Holy Spirit... That she was so completely yielded to the wrong spirit, till it throwed her on her back and her feet was up like that. She crawled on her back like a snake. She didn't even know nothing for two years. And I went down into the basement of the auditorium to pray for the woman. They couldn't even bring her in a public place like this. Why they brought her from the insane institution. She kicked the windows out of the car with five man in there. The ambulance wouldn't even dare to touch her, strong, two or three times her power.

L-47 And so the husband wanted me to see her. I went down the steps. He said, "Don't go near her, Brother Branham," said, "She'll kill you." And I said, "Is that her laying there with her feet?" That's right, and just bleeding all over her limbs. I said, "What's the matter?" Said, "She kicked the glass out of that car. We brought her down in a Chevrolet car, and she kicked all the glasses out. Five man couldn't hold her." And said, "She hadn't been off her back, so we was trying to hold her in there like this until we got her down here. We brought her two hundred miles." There'd been an insane woman received her--her right mind a few nights before that and he said, "We brought her."

L-48 I said, "I'll go out and see if I can talk to her." Said, "Don't you do that." Said, "She'd kill you." I said, "Oh, I don't think so." So I walked out, started to take hold of her hand. I said, "How do you do, sister?" She was laying there with her eyes starey, and her hands up like this, and her feet sticking right up. And--and I caught a hold of her hand, and she gave me a jerk that she would've pulled me... Well, she'd probably broke my neck.

L-49 She jerked me like that with such a terrific force until my feet flew from under me. And I... My foot caught back right on her breast, like this, and I jerked my hand from her. Why, she'd have threw me across the floor. Strong, stronger, many times stronger than two or three men put together... Just jerked it like that, and a little, old housewife. But she was possessed with a demon, and she jerked me like that. And I caught my foot, and just pulled my 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min hand loose. And I run up on the steps like that. And here she come across the floor, crawling on her back like a snake, and a blowing like a snake, a chasing me. I don't mean just wallowing in one place, she was moving. The movements of her body was making her come pretty fast. I had to run to get to the steps, out of her way. And she stopped right there in the floor and she turned around on her back like that.

L-50 She said, "William Branham, you ain't got nothing to do with me. I brought her here." And her husband said, "What's that?" Said, "That's the first word she's spoke in two years." Why, I said, "Sir, that's not her. That's that demon that's got her bound." "Why," said, "she called you by your name." I said, "That's right." Said, "Did you ever see anything like that?" I said, "Yeah, sure, read of it in the Scripture." I said, "You have faith, brother, in our Lord Jesus Christ, and you believe that the same God that give that woman her--her right mental condition been that--from Piney Wood, Mississippi, there, been in that insane institution for ten years, didn't even know her boy, went over to see her, come back... There she was in her home yesterday cooking dinner in her right mind."

L-51 I said, "Do you believe that?" Said, "Yes, sir and I believe it for my wife." I said, "That's the reason he's crying out." Said, "You had nothing to do with me." The woman said that to me. Now, the man did, not knowing much about it, he thought it was his wife saying it. His wife don't know nothing about her saying that. It was a devil. I said, "That's right. But Jesus Christ has something to do with it." So I just prayed for the woman and asked the evil spirit to leave her. She lied on the floor. I said, "Take her on back to the institution; let them dismiss her." So in two days after that, she went home well, normal. A week after that she was setting in a meeting in another city with her little children, just as normal as she can be. I think her husband's a preaching the Gospel now. What was it? The same Jesus.

L-52 Oh, Church of the living God, no wonder the medical association, the head of it, said it was a disgrace [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] in our nation to see the things that's going on.

L-53 He said also the medical association... I got a piece here out of the paper. The head of the American Medical Association said, "No doctor has any right to enter into a home, to visit the sick people, that doesn't believe in the Supreme Being." And give a good writeup of Divine healing, better I could make it myself. I said, "They're just learning now what we've knowed for years." See? That's right. The Medical Association... Many of you take the "Christian Herald," read that great writeup that they got from the doctors last month or month before last when I was in Binghamton, New York. How the doctors are beginning to realize that these diseases are devils... Correctly. The hour's a coming when this world will shake under the impact of the Church of the living God that's moving forward in great power. That's right. I hope to see it in my generation.

L-54 This maniac... This man was so possessed, a good man. The man was humble. He was a lovely brother. But the devil had him all bound. And the devil said, "I know You, Jesus of Nazareth. Why do You come to torment me before my time comes?" Jesus said, "Hold your peace and come out of him." The devil spoke right quick, "If you're going to cast me out, let us go over there in that bunch of hogs." And so they... He said, "Go." And they run into those hogs, and those hogs, now, knowed something struck them that possessed them, and two thousand head of hogs run into the waters and drowned. And this man in his right mind, clothed, setting at the feet of Jesus... There you are. That's the way you act when you come in contact with Jesus. You're never the same. Legion could never be the same. And no one is never the same after they once meet Jesus. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min

L-55 My prayer is tonight, my dear brother, sister, you of the Christian faith, and without... You without that's outside the Kingdom of God, I pray that this will be the night that you'll come in contact with Jesus. And to you that's sick tonight, the doctors has give you up, nothing can be done for you, I pray that this night you'll come in contact with Jesus, go out of here, not the same as you come in, but healed. Shall we pray while the organ plays, if you will. Everyone with your heads bowed now and your eyes closed. We're looking towards Calvary. By eyes of faith we believe that He's here. And now, Lord Jesus, the lovely One, Who gives the insane their right mind, Who gives the sick their healing, they're...?... in the physical bodies again, Who makes those who are wayward, doesn't know You; when they once meet You, things change.

L-56 I'm wondering what happened to Legion's home when he got there. What a different home it was. Father, tonight, if there's anyone in here, maybe, not like Legion was, but still outside of Christ, that's never come in contact with Him... Maybe their home's all tore up, no peace, no happiness in their home, can't come in, set down with their wife and little children or with husband and little children, just all tore up, always touchy, and unpleasant around home; God, may they meet Jesus tonight, go home a different person.

L-57 Many are laying here in the building, Father, weary and sick. Won't You come, Lord? I'm not able to explain Your Word in such a way that would bring great faith to the people. But will You with a manifestation of the Angel of God standing near, will You come, Father, tonight, take this poor, unworthy person, and will You just take control of--of me? Not for own self-glory, but that the few words that's been preached might be made shown right now that it's the Truth, that You've raised from the dead, and You're here. You've done it before, Father. I pray that You'll do it again tonight. People might believe then. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-58 Now, my beloved friend, if Jesus will appear in our midst tonight now, and will manifest Himself just the way He did when He was here on earth, will you believe Him with all your heart? If He will do the same things He did? Up in the balconies, will you do the same thing? Will you accept Him up there? Say, "Yes, Lord, I..." All the newcomers that's never been in my meeting before, will you raise your hand, say, "If I can see Him do the same thing He did in Galilee, I--I--I believe it, I--I--I'll go away from here..." Newcomers, now, that's never seen a meeting, raise your hand, say, "I..." God bless you. I believe it's a hundred percent, everywhere, unanimously everywhere. "I believe, Lord." Now, that's what I hope He will do for you tonight.

L-59 Now, have the boys give out the prayer cards? Where is Billy? Is he... Uh-huh, O? All right. Let's stand a few of them up like this to start number 1. Who has O-number-1, would you just raise your hand that we can see where you're at? Number 1? Prayer cards... Look at your prayer cards. It's a little piece of paper that's got a number and a letter on it. And we have to number you, so that we can do it rightly, 'cause there's probably a thousand more people in here wanting to be prayed for. We can't bring them all to the platform, don't have to.

L-60 Anybody with O-number-1, come down here to the right-hand side. Number 2, who has number 2? Number 2? Go down here, lady. Number 3, who has O-number-3? Would you raise your hand, number 3? Number 4, who has number 4? Would you raise your hand? All right. Over here, lady. Number 5, who has 5? This man. Number 6, who has 6? Anyone have prayer card 6? All right. 7, would you raise your hand, prayer card 7? The lady there. 8? 9? Have we got a prayer card 9, would you raise your hand? 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15? Did I call 15? 15 or 20, what did I say? [A brother says something to Brother Branham."It's fifteen now."--Ed.] 15. Let's see how many they line up there. See? Not the ones... Maybe set these here. Now, let's see how much... I may call out number 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20? Now, who does not have a prayer card, and yet is sick and needy and wants the Lord Jesus to heal you, would you just raise your hand? God bless you. Now, keep your hand up a minute.

L-61 Father God, you see this, Lord. They're Your poor, little children. Some of them are Your--Your brethren. Some of them are Your handsmaids. Some of them are just Mrs. and some of them are little children. God, heal them, will You? And I pray, Father, that something will take place that'll cause every one of them to be healed tonight. May there not be one feeble person leave the building. And, Lord, if any of those people out there that You are speaking to, will You just show them to me, Lord? I don't 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min know them. Thou knowest that. But You know them. Will You just speak and show them to me so that I might call them? I ask in Jesus' Name. Amen. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-62 The Holy Spirit is here. It's here now. The very... How many has ever seen His picture? Let's see your hands. Anybody in here ever seen the picture? We'll have it here tomorrow. Now, that same Light that you see in the picture (God being my Judge) is not--not two foot from where I'm standing right now. That's right. Now, it depends on her faith, or your faith, what It will speak through me. Just like this microphone, it's mute unless something's making a noise through it. And I'll... Perfectly mute, don't know nothing unless He speaks it. Then you be the judge. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever... In the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I take every person and every soul in here under my control for His glory, that God might receive glory. Now, don't be critical. As soon as It anoints me, I'll find something (See?) just immediately. Don't do that. See? It's dangerous, 'cause the disease will come from one to another. So you believe and faith. Don't doubt. Just have faith and believe.

L-63 They're taking a recording here, so I'll have to lay this--a--this speaker up here. The tape here got hot and let it loose. I believe it'll pick it up from right here, Brother Beeler. Can you catch it there? Is your light flashing all right now?

L-64 Now, the boys will watch. And now, don't no one move around. Remain where you are, and be real reverent, and look this way, and believe. Now, it's not an arena. We're not here... We're here in the Church of the living God. And now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, everyone be reverent and believe with all your heart.

L-65 Now, sister, being a--a stranger to you, never seen you in my life. Of course, I see you're wearing glasses. There's something wrong with your eyes; that's true enough. But God knows you. Now, I'm just talking to you. And as soon as I go to talking, I find out this one thing. You are a Christian believer. You are a Christian, 'cause your spirit is welcome. Now, I can feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit that you are a born again believer. That's right. 'Cause your spirit feels welcome to the Angel of the Lord which is here now.

L-66 And you're sure that there's something going on. It's... You can't explain just what it is. But it's a real sweet, humble feeling. Is that right? If it is, raise your hand to the people. Now, the people that's looking, that knows the woman, you know whether she's truthful or not. The woman now knows, because between, she and I, is a Light moving, which is the Angel of the Lord. The woman knows that that's true. That's the same thing as Jesus said to Nathanael, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile." He said, "When did You know me, Rabbi?" That's the same as it was then, it is now. The woman could be an agnostic. She could be an unbeliever or anything. How would I know? But the same Holy Spirit tells me that she's a believer and a borned again Christian. See? The same Jesus, is that right?

L-67 Now, may He tell her something else, something that she wanted to know. Now, I--I can't unless He would show me. You know that's true, us being strangers. I don't know what you're here for. God does. But if He will reveal to me what you're here for, what you want to know, or something that you know that I don't know that He will reveal it. Would you believe that He--He's risen from the dead and standing here now to meet that what you are asking for? Will the rest of the audience believe it with all of their heart if He will reveal it? This ought to settle it if the Holy Spirit will do it. Now, I just want you to believe, sister. Just stand there. Believe that you're in His Presence. That's not your brother making you feel like that; you know. It's Him. Now, I see It. It's moving right down again across the woman. The lady has got some kind of a trouble and it's in her neck. She's got trouble in her neck. She keeps rubbing her neck. Then she's got trouble in her back. And then it comes around under her; she's got trouble in the liver. That is true.

L-68 And you're having like headaches, real severe headache. I see a crash or something. It's a automobile accident. You've had an automobile accident and you got a slipped vertebrae in the back which causing it. That's right. Amen. If that's true, raise your hand. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min Jesus the same yesterday, today, and forever... Did you hear that Voice? That wasn't me. That wasn't me. That was Him. Do you believe Him now? Now, it turns all--a lot of Light, real--around you, sister. I believe with all my heart you're healed.

L-69 Almighty God, in the Name of Jesus Thy Son, while You said in Your Word, "These signs shall follow them that believe: If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." And Lord, standing here, Your Spirit telling the very secrets of the hearts and things like You said, and You did in Your Bible, I lay my hands, while this anointing is upon me, upon this woman. And may You heal her. Whatever is wrong with her, I know not; Thou does. In Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, rejoicing now and be happy serving the Lord. Do you believe? [Congregation say, "Amen."--Ed.] Have faith in God. He's the same yesterday... Now, so before it gets too far on me... Look here at the perspiration. See, just as weak as I can be. That's a vision. Daniel saw one vision and was troubled in his head for many days. Have faith in God. Amen.

L-70 How do you do, lady? Is this the patient? We are strangers to each other, I suppose. We don't know each other. You believe with all your heart? Only your faith in Jesus can help you, sister. Reason I regard you as sister, is because you are a believer. You're a Christian. If it wasn't, you're spirit would be moving back, being dark around you. But it turns light. You are a believer. Your spirit is welcomed by the Spirit that's anointing me. And you're suffering with a trouble in your heart. It's a heart trouble. That is true. And that's caused by rheumatic fever, is what they say. That's right. And it's still on you. But Jesus is here to take it away from you. Do you believe? Come here just a moment.

L-71 O God, our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thine will be done in earth as it is heaven. And in heaven Your Blood is laying there for an atonement to make a intercessions for this woman's confession. Your Spirit is here, moving. Now, I rebuke this enemy that's taking the life of my sister. May it go away from her and she be made well. In Jesus Christ's Name I ask it. Amen. The Lord bless you, my sister. Go happy, and rejoicing.

L-72 Believe on the Lord Jesus, everyone, and be healed, all the ends of the earth. Have faith in God. You believe out there in the audience? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Just believe. "If thou canst believe, all things are possible."

L-73 We are strangers to each other, aren't we? I do not know you. But God does know you. Is that right? He knows you. I don't. But if God will reveal to me what you're here for, will you accept your healing as from the Lord Jesus, after I preached the Bible to show what He did say He would do? And if He's here now, risen, standing here near you...

L-74 And I--I--I'm--I'm just like this microphone. See? I--I know nothing of you. But the only way a voice can come through here, it has to be a voice back here to make it. And if I don't know you, there's got to be Something behind here to make the--the knowledge of it. Is that right?

L-75 Would you believe it come from the Lord Jesus? You're trying to believe. You're nervous. Uh-huh. I'm not reading your mind. No, no. See? You're just nervous and upset. Perhaps, maybe if the Lord will help you... See, sister, it takes your solemnly--your faith in God. And you're trying to move in there and doubts is moving in your way. That's right. That's right. You couldn't hide your life now if you had to. See? You're standing in His Presence, not mine.

L-76 Perhaps, I tell you you're coughing a whole lot. Isn't that right, 'cause you got a asthma. That is right. Isn't that right? I see you raising up in the bed, trying to cough like that, holding your throat, which is asthma. Exactly right. If that's right, raise your hand up. You're also real nervous, aren't you? Yes, sir. You're real nervous. You got a husband that needs healing too, haven't you? He's got something wrong with his eyes. If that's right, raise up your hand. Your name is Mrs. Slater, isn't it? Now, you believe me to be God's prophet? Uh-huh. Now, go believing and you'll get well. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ may it come to pass. Amen. Amen. Don't think strange of that. Jesus said to Peter, "Thou art Peter, the son of Jonas." Be reverent. Don't think... Your thoughts come right here, remember. Remember the anointing of the Holy Spirit's in the meeting. Have faith. Don't 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min doubt. Just believe.

L-77 Little lady, setting right there is bothered with a nervous trouble, setting there, second one. Yes. Weeping just a few moments ago... When I was talking to this woman and said nervous, a real strange feeling struck you, didn't it? If that's right, raise your hand. You've been suffering with nervousness, Satan telling you, and everything, you was going to lose your mind and things. Isn't that right? If that's right, wave your hand. You were healed right then. Your faith made you whole. Jesus Christ made you well. Amen.

L-78 Just have faith in God. Don't doubt. See, you don't need prayer cards. You need faith and believe what I... I challenge your faith in Jesus' Name. Look this way and believe that I've told you the truth of God. Watch what happens. Is that the same Lord Jesus that the woman touched His garment? She never touched my garment, but she touched His garment. He knew what her faith did. One thing, a demon screamed out. Have faith in God. Believe.

L-79 All right, is this the man here? All right. Come, sir. We are strangers to each other, I suppose, sir. God knows both of us. I don't know you, and perhaps, you don't know me, our first time meeting in life. Is that, sir, correct, sir? If it is, would you just raise your hand so the audience would see? First time meeting in life, but God knows all about you. And He can tell me about you. I--I don't know. You know that to be true.

L-80 If we're strangers then, and Jesus has risen from the dead, and what we preach as--as the Gospel here, and believe It to be the truth, then by the Word of God tonight, and by ever night, I can prove it by the Word that Jesus has risen from the dead. And He's alive tonight. He is not dead. He's a living.

L-81 Now, if you standing there... I don't know you, never seen you. But He knows you, and you--you got some motive of coming here. I don't know what it is; you know. But He does, and if He will let me know what you're here for, then you'll accept it? What... You believe that you'll get what you ask for? Will the audience believe the same? [Congregation say, "Amen."--Ed.] Have faith.

L-82 The man's suffering from a chest trouble, trouble in his chest. That's right. And you're a preacher. You belong to a church called Church of God, or something like that. And you're from a place called...?... or something like that. That's right. And your name is Reverend Huff, or something on that order. That's right. And you are here with a daughter. And the daughter's suffering with a gland trouble. You believe me to be His prophet? Then in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I rebuke the enemy and ask for victory. Amen. Amen.

L-83 You believe with all your heart? You got trouble with your leg, setting right there at the... leg trouble... Do you believe that Jesus heals you with that leg trouble? You do? You was praying, wasn't you? And your faith has touched the garment of Jesus Christ. You're a stranger to me. If thou canst believe with all your heart, it'll go from you. Amen.

L-84 By the way, this is leg trouble too, setting right here, a lady right on the end there, believing. You believe with all your heart God will heal you with that leg trouble? If you believe with all your heart, you can have what you ask for. Do you do it, lady? With... The elderly lady setting there with the handkerchief in her hand, you believe that Jesus Christ makes you whole? God bless you. Then you can have it what you...

L-85 Have faith in God. Just believe. The reason I called that... Leg trouble, that's what trouble this woman right here is. Them devils are screaming one to another for help.

L-86 This woman's bothered with leg trouble, foot trouble. That's right. Say, I see somebody standing by you. You're in a church. The man was just here. You're a member of his church. The man is on the platform. Is that right? Now, go back rejoicing, being happy, praising God, and--and get well in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May it be so.

L-87 Have faith in God. Do you believe, sister? Believe that He can heal those eyes and make them well, that lady's trouble you've been suffering with so long and nervousness? That's right, isn't it? How would I know except God would reveal it? That's right. O heavenly Father, in the Name of Lord Jesus Christ I bless this, my sister, for her healing in Jesus' Name. Amen. God bless you, my sister. Go, believing now with all your heart and be well.

L-88 Would you come, lady? You believe with all your heart? Just a moment. If God will reveal where your trouble is... Do you believe it? It's in your back. That's right. Isn't that right? He makes you well now. Go on your road, rejoicing. 55-0116E, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 72 min Your faith heals you, sister. Amen.

Let me show you something. Everyone with heart trouble, has trouble with your heart, raise your hand, just a minute out in there, raise your hand. Looky here. See? You can hardly pick it out. You believe you're going to get well? You're wanting me to lay hands on you though. I'm not reading your mind. But that's what you was praying, "Is he going to lay hands on me?" Ain't that right?
