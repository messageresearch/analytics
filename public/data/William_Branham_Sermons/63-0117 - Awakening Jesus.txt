--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening. As always, a privilege to be in the house of the Lord.

L-2 How surprised I was to see this boy here from Arkansas, friend of mine. A long time, I believe the last time I seen you was up in California, wasn't it? My, my! You still in California? Here? My! Think I'll have to move out. All the east is coming west.

L-3 And, well, everybody happy? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That's right.

L-4 Well, I think this is about our sixth service now. We got to go on through next week, and--and up until next Monday night. Now, don't forget Monday night at Tucson, the banquet, and we're expecting a great time down there this coming Monday night.

L-5 I was talking to Brother Williams and Brother Rose, today. And so I said, "You know, I'm going to start praying for the sick." I said, "I keep them poor people there every night till about ten or eleven o'clock." I said, "I feel real ashamed of myself, of doing it like that." And I do apologize for holding you so long, but I don't get to see you too often.

L-6 And I can't make that excuse, 'cause I do worse than that at home. See? Sometimes start in of a morning, early, and preach till that afternoon and some time, or just whenever we get ready to go home. And we just set around, like, just as thick as we can be, so just have a good time.

L-7 Nice to be here, Brother Groomer. Where... [Someone speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Yeah. Yeah. It was kind of hid from me. Was not... I was here last year when we come on, wasn't we? ["Yes."] I thought so. Remember the place and the church. So happy to be here tonight! God bless all of you.

L-8 And now we're expecting the Lord to--to--to heal the sick tonight. We're kind of changed the program a little, and I get into the Message, of preaching the Gospel, or what I try to think, my very best of my knowledge. And then I--I get started, I just don't know when to stop. I just keep on going, and I keep you too long. Then, I thought it would be a good time tonight, after so many nights of preaching, just to try now and pray for the sick. So today we've kind of prepared for it and waited on the Lord. And I begin to notice last night, the way. You have to kind of go the way He leads you to go, you know. You--you feel something move you, and directly visions will break, and you know that it's something coming near then.

L-9 Then, today I was going out, too, in the... I was in the... my motel, and the Holy Spirit said go a certain way. And there was a swimming pool out there. I thought maybe some little child might have got drowned. I went across there, happened to look over, and I seen some people. They're setting here in front tonight. They know how that was the Lord Who got there, and just what He said is just exactly the thing. So I knew then it was time to start praying for the sick.

L-10 And now we are going to approach Him now, by prayer, before we approach His Word. And you're such a nice audience. You been so attentive each night. I know some of you have to get up and go sometime, before. I know that's not because you just want to walk out. You got to catch busses. You got to go to work. I--I realize that. And now let's bow our heads just a moment now for prayer.

L-11 Now, I notice there's just about as many standing back there as there is setting out here. And we want... We know that God will answer their requests just the same as He does anywhere. Now do you have a request? Let it be known by an uplifted hand. God will hear.

L-12 Our Heavenly Father, we are now coming into the Presence of Jesus, in--in His Name. And we're going to the throne of grace, to ask for pardoning of our sins, 'cause, knowing, day by day we do fail Thee. Every hour of our life, seldom one passes without we have to stop, say, "Lord, forgive me. I--I didn't mean to do it just that way. I should have done it this--this other way." Then, we know, Lord, that You're always so full of mercy and ready to forgive Your children. You listen to their faintest cry. We're so glad that we have an Advocate.

L-13 And we pray, Father, tonight, for this church, for our beloved brother. All these years around here, knowing him, and finding him, his character, a wonderful servant of Christ. How we thank You for a man like that! I... It's such a privilege, Lord, to be among he and his people, and to associate with them, and coming together to fellowship with them, around the Word of God. We pray, Lord, that You'll move in on the high tide, tonight, and will--and will give these blessings. So glad to meet old friends that I knowed years ago in the beginning of the ministry.

L-14 And now, Lord, we pray together that You'll bless us as we assembled ourselves together tonight in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We've assembled for that purpose, Lord, and we pray that--that You'll meet our needs tonight, and answer our requests to Thee, to heal the sick, save the lost, and encourage those who are discouraged. We ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-15 Now, we want you, that want, wishes to, tonight, to turn in the blessed old Word, in the book of Saint Matthew's Gospel, the 8th chapter. And we want to start reading from... Setting today, from Matthew, the 8th chapter, beginning with 23rd verse.

L-16 After leaving today, from Brother... or Brother Williams and Brother Jewel Rose leaving from where we were at, I... my mind fell upon an occasion. And so I just reached over... Because, we had been speaking, and the Holy Spirit had drawed real near to us. So just as they left out, I thought, "Oh, my! Now He will surely speak." And I picked up in my mind an instant in the Bible that taken place, quickly turning to it. And I got some little Scriptures to go with it, and drew from it a text, wrote down a few notes on it. I'd like to pass these to you.

L-17 First, let us read now in Saint Matthew, the 8th chapter, and begin with the 23rd verse. And when he had entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with... waves: but he was asleep. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? And he arose, and rebuked the wind and the sea; and there was a great calm. But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obeys him!

L-18 That's quite a striking little text, or Scripture. I'm going to take an odd text from it: Awakening Jesus. Awakening Jesus.

L-19 It must have been a--a hard day for Him. He was tired. His body was worn out. You know, as He went along, the people drew God out of Him. They drew their desires from Him. And when they did... We won't try to go into detail to explain that, because there's no one can do it. How can we explain things that we don't know?

L-20 That's the reason there's no way, at all, of ever being saved until you're ready to accept what you cannot explain. See? You've got to believe. "He that cometh to God must believe that He is." Now, there's no way of scientifically proving that, but you must believe it anyhow. And if you could prove it, then it would no more be an act of faith. And faith... God has so hid Himself until you have to believe that He is, without seeing Him, know that He's there, anyhow. Whether you see it, or not, you believe it. Surely you believe it, anyhow.

L-21 Now, I think that's marvelous, and that gives illiterate people like me a chance, everybody, to believe it, because we hear it. "And faith cometh by hearing, and hearing of the Word of God." Then we accept That, and believe That. And upon the basis of our faith in That, we are saved, healed. And whatevermore we draw from God, comes from an unseen Resource.

L-22 Christians; the whole armor of Christianity is faith. Everything that we have is unseen. The only things that's real is unseen, unexplained. The things that can be explained are not real. They're superficial and die. But the things that cannot be explained are immortal, the whole realm. Look at the armor of Christianity. Love, what part of you is love? Love, joy, faith, long-suffering, meekness, patient. See? None of those things, you can't see them. They're unseen, but yet we believe them. Love never dies. Faith is the--is the victory. We believe things that we don't see.

L-23 Now, in Jesus was God. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself." And these people believed His testimony. And them that did truly believe it, could draw God's blessing from Him. And when they did so, He said, "Virtue went from Him." Virtue is "strength." He... In other words, if we'd say it today, he got weak when the people drawed off of Him. Well, if it worked that way in that human body, it'll work in another human body.

L-24 And we create our atmosphere around us, each one of us. You've been with people that were nice people, but you just couldn't hardly be around them. Then you've been with other people that you just love to be around them. You create that atmosphere. And, oh, wouldn't you loved to have been around Jesus just a little? Wonderful! See what that atmosphere He created would have been, I imagine it was just one great big bundle of love, and respects, and godly fear. Now, I have often heard people say...

L-25 Many of you, I guess, has already played the tape of that last vision up there, why I'm right here in Arizona now. And that was... Oh, my! If you get it, it's, What Time Is It, Sir? And if you get it, ever bought a tape from us, get that one. Now, they're not mine. They belong to another company that's with us, with the tape, and they're not mine. So, but, I know the boy has them.

L-26 And I never had anything like that to happen. Some of them say, "When you're in the Presence of God, why don't you ask Him this or that?" It's--it's different than what you... See, what many people calls the power of God, is only the blessings of God. The power of God is altogether different from the blessings of God. The power of God, in His Presence, you just don't know what to do. You just... You're--you're so... You're so scared till you're numb, all over.

L-27 There's two days, even in my back and the back of my head, and up-and-down my body, I couldn't feel, at all. And so just perfectly numbed, with such a fear, when that constellation of Angels standing right here, now, just stand, looking at Them like I am now.

L-28 And if you think that would be, "Oh, well"? No. If you're actually there and see it, it's different.

L-29 And now, the Lord Jesus, being Emmanuel, must have been tired. Virtue gone out of Him. And He had a big job ahead of Him, the day before, when He landed over on the other side, as we all know, 'cause He was going over into Gadara, and there is where He found this maniac. He thought, perhaps, when the ship was crossing the Galilee, which probably taken quite a little while, He just took the advantage of the opportunity to take a little rest. That's no more than--than natural, what anybody would do.

L-30 They had entered the ship with Him, and brought Him aboard. And they had went across the sea, to preach over on the other side. And Jesus saw this glorious opportunity, being tired and weak, because He was human. He wasn't immortal then. He was a Man, and He had to die. That's the reason God had to be made a Man, in order to die. Now, there He was, and sleepy and tired. His disciples took up the oars and set the sail.

L-31 In those days, they had, if they had any wind, they could tack the ship and--and it could blow by sail. And sometime if it was too slow, yet it helped out a little, on the pulling of the oars, they'd take the oars and go along with it. And with the sail, also, they could really make pretty good time. One set in the back. Usually, on a big ship like that, about eight or ten men to oar it. Well, they had a--a rudder, and one man taking care of this rudder, in the back, if it was sailing. Then, if it was oaring, of course, they could tie down the rudder and pull with their oars.

L-32 Now, let's just think they had the sail up, 'cause there must have been a little wind blowing, from what taken place after a bit. And anyone knows, that part of Galilee, or down in there, oh, my, anything can happen at any time. And so they were on their road, sailing across.

L-33 And Jesus must have went back in the back of the little boat, and curled up, and laid down in a little pile back there, so He could just take some rest and be recuperating from His loss of strength, for His service that laid ahead.

L-34 And the disciples must have been rejoicing with one another, over what they had been seeing Him do. It must have been a wonderful time for them, 'cause they were--they were having a time, testifying maybe with one another. And maybe they were discussing some things that they had seen Him do.

L-35 And now let's stop here just a minute and listen to their discussion. They might have discussed the--the place when He had said something like this, "I AM THAT I AM." When He said... They said, "Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness, and was under Moses."

L-36 And Jesus said, "And they're, every one, dead." There's only two made the promised land, see, Joshua and Caleb. "They're all dead. But I am the Bread of Life that come from God, out of Heaven. A man may eat this Bread and not die." Changed, it was different. How could He be the Bread? They might have went through that. And they might have went through...

L-37 Being that there's perhaps strangers here, for the healing service, I might say this. They might have said... Now, that would be one thing that He claimed, that He was that "I AM" that was in the burning bush. Cause, they said, "You're a man not over fifty and you say you seen Abraham. Now we know you're crazy." See, mad means "crazy." "And you're not over fifty years old," when He was only thirty. "But," said, "You're just about fifty years old, and you--you said you seen Abraham? Now we know you're crazy." See?

L-38 But He said, "Before Abraham was, I AM." Oh, my! Not only seen Abraham, but, "Before Abraham was, I AM." And He's just as much "I AM" now as He was then. Now, remember, "I AM" is not "I was," or "I will be." "I AM" is constantly, all the time; same yesterday, today, and forever. "I AM."

L-39 And then they might have said, "Well, now, here is one reason that we know that He was Messiah. Because, He... We know." Now, He had done went to sleep now. "And we know that He's bound to be Messiah, because we are told by the Scriptures what this Messiah will do when He come." Now, that is good philosophy for anyone, and good, sound, orthodox doctrine.

L-40 That's what I was trying to get to last night, up at the other, Mesa. Always, judge not after emotion. Judge after the Word. It's got to be the Word. Now, watch the Word and what the Word says, then know that's right, because God said that. That makes it right, now, And they were judging Him now after the Word.

L-41 Now to find out whether He was Messiah, you could go back to the man who gave them the law. God gave it to them, of course, but Moses brought it off the mountain, from God. And he told them that he would leave them someday. But, "The Lord God would raise up a Prophet like him, likened unto him: a law-giver, a--a King-Prophet. And--and it would come to pass that every one that refused to hear this Prophet would be taken from among the people." Now, they noticed that, when Jesus come.

L-42 And all down through the Scriptures, they had a commandment, the Jews did, that, "If there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet, I, the Lord, will make Myself known unto him in vision. And what he says comes to pass, then hear that prophet, for I'm with him. But if it doesn't come to pass, then don't hear him." Now, that's just logical. That's just sensible.

L-43 Like when there was a man stood up one time, Jeremiah, a major prophet. The Lord told him that--that Judah was going to be down in Babylon for seventy years. Said, "Don't you listen to a dreamer, to a prophet, or anything that says contrary to that. He put a yoke on his neck."

L-44 And Hananiah, now, Hananiah was a prophet. And not only that, but he was the son of a prophet. His father was a prophet. And he came up, under inspiration, and took that yoke off of his neck and broke it, and said, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, in two years they're coming back." The people could clap their hands on that. My, that was good! They wanted to listen to Hananiah, but it was contrary to the Word. It wasn't with the Word. You see?

L-45 Therefore, Jeremiah, he said, "Hananiah, amen, the Lord grant your words to come to pass. But, wait a minute, let us remember there has been prophets before us. And when the prophet prophesied, and he is known... The prophet is known when his prophecy comes to pass."

L-46 I see some Indian friends setting here. I was reading on their history, some time ago, in early Christian days of the Indian. And they had to follow the game, to live. And if there come a prophet among them, and he prophesied and told them where the game was, he become chief. But if he prophesied a lie, that was the end of his road. They got rid of him, right now. He didn't live no longer.

L-47 Well, that was the same basis that God did. God told Jeremiah, "Hananiah has lied. I never told him that." See, it's contrary to his Word. "And he'll be off the earth within a year." In the seventh month he died. He took him off the earth. Now, you see, although he was inspired, but it was contrary to the Word.

L-48 No matter how forceful a preacher can preach, how well he can make it look, if it's contrary to the Word, leave away from it. Stay away from it, clear.

L-49 It's the Word. That's God's program, the complete revelation of what He was, what He is, and what He will be. It's a continual revelation of Jesus Christ. And a complete revelation of Jesus Christ, is this Bible. Anything revealed contrary of Him, telling what He would do, what He is now, "Oh, that was in days past," don't you believe it. It's got to be the same Jesus, see, and that's the Word, now.

L-50 Now we find out that these disciples might have talked of the case. Maybe Peter might have said, "You know, I was thinking, myself, that I remember my father telling me that there'll come a great commotion someday. They've always had little up-spurts. That there'd be, before the coming Messiah, there'll probably be false messiahs rise. But he told me, 'Son, remember this one thing. We are Jews. We are God's chosen. And we have a commandment from our Heavenly Father, that, and know that that Messiah will be a Prophet. And if the prophet is only known when he speaks, and what he says comes to pass, so he will know then that that is Messiah.'"

L-51 And when Peter walked up into His Presence, by the invitation, perhaps, of Andrew, his brother, who had heard Him, and seen the day that when John announced Him, and that was Him.

L-52 And John, he saw the Spirit, he heard the Voice. Nobody else heard It or saw It, just him. All the thousands standing there, nobody saw It but John. It was sent for him. "John bare record, seeing the Spirit of God descending, see, and a Voice from Heaven."

L-53 When Paul was stricken down by a Light that blinded him, none of the rest of them saw the Light. It was so real, to Paul, till It blinded his eyes.

L-54 The wise men followed the Star from Babylon, all the way down. And they kept time, by the stars. Crossed over every observatory, and not one saw It. It was showed to the wise men.

L-55 God chooses who He will choose, does what He wants to do. He is God. And He will never go contrary to His Word. Always with His Word, now.

L-56 And Simon might have said this, you know, while he was roaring... oaring across the... this lake, and Him asleep in the back of the boat. He said, "When I walked up in His Presence, and He said to me, 'Your name is Simon, and you're the son of Jonas,' that settled it, for me. I knowed then that that was truly the Messiah, because He told me exactly the truth, never seeing me."

L-57 Philip could have had the testimony of getting Nathanael, and He told him where he was at before he come. They could have talked about the woman at the well. They could have talked about blind Bartimaeus, who touched His garment by standing a hundred yards from Him, perhaps, and his--his faith in God touched Him. The woman who touched the border of His garment! All these things proved that He was Messiah. What a great time!

L-58 Now, then, they might have discussed the attitude of the people towards Him. Now we're... They're crossing the lake, all the time. Towards Him, some said, "Some believed. Some didn't believe."

L-59 That's the same as it is today. Some people believe It. No, you could, no matter how plain it would be vindicated, some won't believe It. And there is some of them so spiritual, that, the first little nod, they get It. And others can be pounded, day and night, and they never get It.

L-60 Let me stop a minute, on this, and explain something. Seeds that fall in the earth, if they are germitized, they grow when the sun strikes it, moisture condition. But if they're not germitized, the sun could shine on them, they'd just rot away, the same. There's nothing happen.

L-61 We are germitized. Our names are called, put on the Lamb's Book of Life, before the foundation of the world. No matter how religious we are, that has not one thing to do with it; sometimes it's against us.

L-62 I feel at home with such a fine brother as Brother Groomer here, and these other brothers here. I--I feel just to say this.

L-63 Notice Jesus. We know now He was Messiah. And when He come and showed Himself Messiah, upon religious people, Pharisees, Sadducees, all from priests from the lineage of Aaron, for hundreds times hundreds of years. Their great-great-great-great-great-great-great- way back, grandfathers, were priests, studying the Word, studying the prophets. And the prophets plainly spoke of this. But when Jesus come and performed that, they was as blind as a bat. Religious to the dot, smart, intelligent, intellectual as they could be, far beyond one of us today, trained in the Word, raised from a child. And when the real Truth splashed across in front of them, and that Light shone, they said, "This Man, we can't figure that out, so He must be a devil, Beelzebub. He's a great powerful mind. He can read the mind of the people." A telepathist, we would call it today. They didn't understand.

L-64 But now look. One day, over at Sychar, a little city of Samaria, and Jesus passed through and set on the side of the wall. And a little woman, ill-famed, bad name; she had a lot of husbands she oughtn't to had. And here she come up, to get some water, And Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink. And bring a drink." And she told Him that they--they couldn't do that. It wasn't right. It was an insult for her to... for Him to ask a Samaritan woman such a thing.

L-65 And He quickly told her, "If you knew Who you were talking to!" Now, she didn't know it. Said, "If you knew Who it was talking to you, you'd ask Me for a drink."

L-66 The subject went on for a moment. After while, Jesus, being sent up there to the well, said to her, "Go, get your husband."

L-67 She said, "I don't have any." Still she was blinded, see, because any man could teach a theology, see, or he can make any kind of a statement. He can say whatever he wants to, that still don't make it right. He said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any husband."

L-68 He said, "You've told the truth, for you've had five, and the one you're now living with is not yours. You told the truth."

L-69 Watch that Light struck that germ of Life. The plant went to growing. Quickly, magic, quickly; this prostitute, out-scourged, kicked-out, not a trained priest! A woman in bad life, but she was predestinated to Eternal Life. And when that Light struck it, quickly she recognized it.

L-70 She said, "Sir, I perceive that Thou art a prophet. Now, we haven't had one for four hundred years, but yet we know that there's coming a Messiah. And that Messiah will be a prophet, and He will tell us these things." See, she knowed a Man that told her that wouldn't tell her a lie.

L-71 And He knew it. And He said, "I am He, that speaks with you."

L-72 She never asked another question, but, into the city, and said, "Come, see a Man!"

L-73 Look at the difference. See, when that Light strikes, it'll either blind or bring to Life. See? It's got to. Life, Bible Scripture!

L-74 Now, there could have been many things that people could have talked about. Some of them said like this, "Never a man spake like this Man." Some of them believed, said, "This Man seems to have an authority. He seems to be so positive in what He talks about. We never seen a man that could stand up and just speak things like that. We've heard priests talk. We've heard rabbis, priests, and all, everything, and lectures, and so forth. But this Man talks with authority. He knows what He's talking about. Never a man spake like that." Some said, "He's Beelzebub."

L-75 It must have been John, a young fellow, you know, thinking fast. Must have been him that said, "Just think of it! The One that could take five biscuits and two fish, and feed five thousand, amen; the One that knows the secret of the heart; He is with us, in the ship. We've got Him right here. Brethren, you're testifying," he might have said, "but the One that we're thinking about, He is right here with us."

L-76 That's the same thing right now, the One that we preach about, the One that we talk about. What good is a God of Moses if He isn't the same God today? The One that we talk about is here with us. Oh, what a thing to think about!

L-77 And then, you see, also they were on a dangerous lake. And what a--a feeling of security, while sailing the--the tornado-ed lake, to know that One laid with them, on the ship.

L-78 How secure you can be! When the seas are troubled, when they're not troubled, just don't make a bit of difference. As long as you know He's laying right there, what difference does it make? Let come, let go, what may, doesn't make a bit of difference. It's there. I know it. You say, "I... Bless the Lord!" Doctor say you're going to die with a cancer; just say, "Glory to God! Quick trip Home, maybe." See? They don't mind.

L-79 Talking, and a group of doctors, other day. He said--he said, "I read your book on Divine healing." I said, "I guess you criticized." Said, "No, sir. I admit that you're right." I said, "Thank you, Dr. Schoen."

L-80 He said--he said, "Brother Branham, we have record that when we tell a person that's got a malignancy, or--or something is going to kill him, an ulcer ready to burst, or tubercular, it depends on what attitude they take. If they get all tore up," said, "they die right away. But," said, "if they take the attitude, 'Well, dying is just part of living. It's all right, when I die,'" said, "you know, it almost retards that case?"

L-81 I just thought, "If that mental attitude, taken like that, what will it do when the Holy Spirit strikes that inner man?" There it is. It's... I asked him that.

L-82 He said, "Certainly, that's right, if you can move into a spot, move up into that." One of the best surgeons and doctors there is in southland, he said, "If it's... Mr. Branham, it can be proved. If a man will move, can move up into that spot, until even his own mind don't even know he's got it, to think he's got it, and don't even pay any attention to it," said, "it would do it, if he can believe that." That's true. See?

L-83 The mental attitude you take towards it will bring... Now, the mind won't do it. But if you give that attitude towards something got Life in it, then that Life comes down and does it. Not your mental attitude; that only brings you in the Presence of Him. That's what you do, your mind. The five senses is all right as long as they don't deny God. But when they go to denying God, then you leave them alone. God controls them. That's the Creator.

L-84 Now, what a security, as I said, sailing this treacherous sea, knowing that He's laying right in the boat. There is something them disciples was that night, like we are tonight, they were enjoying the effects of a meeting; after the revival, feasting on the results of the revival.

L-85 Now, Brother Groomer, and brother here, and many other. About fifteen years ago we come through this country, and there was a revival. My! And you know what we're doing today? Just talking about it. The revival is over. It's been over, a long time. We're just living on the results of it, waiting.

L-86 And those disciples were doing the same thing, rejoicing, living on what they had seen done, probably the day before, and the week before, and a year before. They were testifying about it, giving, oh, great testimony of it.

L-87 How do we know that, as Jesus in their day was resting between revivals, how do we know maybe He's resting now between the revivals? Yeah.

L-88 "Oh," you say, "now, wait a minute, Brother Branham; getting a little off the line now. Jesus don't have to rest."

L-89 Yes, He did. The Bible said that, "God made the heavens and earth in six days, and the seventh He rested." Certainly did. He rested. Jesus, being tired, laying on the boat, He was asleep and resting.

L-90 And maybe after the toil of the revival that's just past, maybe He's resting now like He was then. I hope that's it.

L-91 And the disciples was rejoicing on what they had seen Him do, see, and knowing that He was with them.

L-92 That's kind of like the man, mind of a man. A mind of a man is always talking about and rejoicing what God has done, and they're saying what He will do, and ignoring what He's doing.

L-93 He wasn't asleep, exactly. We'll get to that, in a few minutes. See?

L-94 They'll believe what He has done, and shout about it. They'll talk about what He's going to do, and glorify God. But what He's doing right now, they ignore it. That's just the nature of a man. That's just the way he does it.

L-95 Then, while they were enjoying the blessings of their fellowship, one with another, and, oh, counting it all up, what they had seen done, all of a sudden there rose trouble.

L-96 And that's just about like Satan, to do that, see, right when you're having a testimony meeting or something. Many times I...

L-97 Here not long ago, I was in a meeting, just getting ready to make an altar call. And an old fellow pitched right over in the floor, dead as he could be, see, in a heart attack. And all the place was disturbed. And I forget... It was at Shawano, Wisconsin. I thought, "God, what can I do?" I looked over here, and I seen the old man in a vision, walking out the door. I know what to do then.

L-98 Not long ago, with this great sponsor of Oral Roberts, doctor up there in Philadelphia, what is that? He's a... Forget his name now. He's a dentist. He's a great sponsor of his television program. I can't think of his name. And we... [Someone says, "Barton."--Ed.] Barton. We were having a meeting, and I was just getting ready to make the altar call. And I noticed a woman acted real funny, and her daughter run over there, begin to rub her face. I thought, "Well, she is subject to fainting." And all at once, her feet went right out straight, and her hands went back like this.

L-99 Dr. Barton run over to where she was, took her pulse. She had none. He looked up at me, shook his head. Well, I tried to keep the people's mind... They was setting out, a great crowd. Keep it off of it, like that, just going ahead, talking. And so he said, "Go get little Branham." That was Billy. And Billy seen that dead woman. He had nothing to do with that. See? He didn't want that. Well, just as I started to speak again... Now, Dr. Barton, as you know him, you might ask him.

L-100 Started to speak again, I said, "Now, everyone, do not be excited. Keep quiet." Sometime when you see a demon try to come out of a person, they get so irreverent, the crowd gets tore up. That's the wrong thing to do. "Set still. Don't get excited. He is here."

L-101 And while I was speaking like that, I don't know how it ever happened, but turned over to her and called her name. "Mary, looky here." And when she did, she come to herself, come to.

L-102 See, it's that troubled time. Suddenly there rises trouble, right in the time.

L-103 Now, now, you might ask Dr. Barton about that. I met him the next day, and he said, "Brother Branham," said, "that woman had no heart. I taken it down here on her--her bosom. I take her heart in her neck, everywhere." Said, "She was gone." And, then, they was a real wealthy family, and it was the first time she was ever in a meeting like that. And she...

L-104 I went, he taken me up to her house, and she said, "I heard you call my name." And I never seen the woman in my life, but it was the Holy Spirit. See?

L-105 Now, suddenly, there rose trouble. The ship begin to rock. The waves got high. And, the sail, probably the wind just come down with an angry gush and whipped it right off the mast pole. And the ship rocked over, and the big waves white-capped and throwed the water in on the boat. And the boat begin to fill up with water. Trouble! All hopes of survival seemed to be gone, though they had seen Him do so many things. They had seen it, but, when trouble set in, all was forgotten.

L-106 I wonder if that's just not about the case tonight. We know what we have seen God do in this revival. You ministers know that. You see His--His power. His, how He raised the dead; doctor's statement. He foretold the things that happened, on the dot. He's healed the sick. Thousands times thousands has been healed, around the world. But now while the little lull comes, and then when trouble strikes, do we forget that so quick?

L-107 Just like Israel, when He had done all the plagues in Egypt, and done the great things He did. Then when they got to the Red Sea, Moses had to scream out, "You've seen ten miracles, and still you doubt God?" When they found no water at the old watering hole, they were murmuring, complaining. That's just human beings. They forgot all the miracles that He did. See? We do it, too.

L-108 Perhaps these disciples had got it all, 'cause time of trouble. Now when we get a... They had got into a trouble that they couldn't find any remedy for it. As long as we can find a remedy, we hold right on to it. But they had got into a trouble that they could not find the remedy, and they got scared. They cried out. They were scared when they had no remedy.

L-109 I promised myself I'm going to get the church out of here at nine o'clock. So I could stay on that a long time, but I--I'm trying to just hit the high places, where you can see.

L-110 Brother, there's a lot of trouble tonight that we ain't got no remedy for. I have a string, a list down here, national troubles. They can't solve no remedy. They don't know how to do it. U.N.'s, Leagues of Nations, and all this talk, it gets worse and worse all the time.

L-111 That night in Finland, when that little boy had been killed on the street that day. The mayor of the city has got it wrote up, and I got it signed by his seal. Seen a vision of it, years before. When I come through Arizona here, telling you about it, "There'd be a little boy raised from the dead, and what he'd look like." You all remember it, many of you. Now, it happened just that way. I told you it would appear in The Voice Of Healing. It did it, about two years later, or three. See? Now, all of them disturbed, and all that carrying on, and there was a remedy. God had the remedy, and He healed the little boy.

L-112 That night, going down the street in Kuopio. And when we was going down the street, about six of these little Finnish boys... They just had that war, and the little fellows hadn't never shaved. It was--it was... They was little boys they had to take in the army. Them Russians killed them off. And they were going down there, with these big, old, long, saber knives, holding the crowds, while I was going down to what they called the Messuhalli, where they let about thirty-five thousand, then make them go out, then let me speak to another thirty-five thousand or forty.

L-113 And along the street, there stood Russian soldiers. And when I walked by, with a Russian salute, and tears running down their cheeks. And when I'd passed by, they grabbed them Finnish soldiers and hug them. Brother, anything that'll make a Russian hug a Finn, or a Finn hug a Russian, will settle wars. They have passed over the thing that settles wars, but they'll never be able to achieve the remedy by man-made achievement. It's already been made. A Man died for that purpose.

L-114 The church has troubles that they haven't got any remedy for. How is all the Methodists going to get all the Baptists to be Methodist? I just wonder. How is all the Assemblies going to make all the Oneness be Assemblies, or the Assemblies go vice versa? How is all the Pentecostals going to win all the Presbyterian, Lutherans? And how is the Catholic going to take the whole thing? See? They just can't figure it out, which one of them is going to rule. See? They don't know. They haven't got the remedy. All right.

L-115 But, did you know, they didn't have the remedy how to stop that storm, but the remedy was laying there.

L-116 And let me say this, brother, tonight. In all of our troubles, we've still got the Remedy. Here it is, for He is the Word. It's laying right Here, and His Spirit is right here to manifest It. So, we've got the Remedy. But we try to find other things, to start another organization. That's us. See? We can't master it. It's already been mastered. We just fail to walk in the way that's been mastered for us. But they were troubled.

L-117 "If they're going to have a healing service down at Groomer's, well, you know there is something about them people I don't like. They're holy-rollers. I ain't going down there." Well, there you are. See? That's it. That's just the way it is. See? Yeah. It's...

L-118 But Christ is that Remedy. He's the thing that can make it. His disciples, today, get in a lot of trouble, and don't know the Remedy. That's right.

L-119 And let me say this. Many times His precious saints get in trouble, too, physical trouble, but here we got the Remedy. Amen. We got the cure.

L-120 Thinking of this woman setting here with lung trouble, then; this oxygen, hear her breathing in it. I think of how that poor thing sleeps at night. Think of the expense that is. Sister, there, I know the Remedy. It's Here. You don't have to do that. But you have to use It. See?

L-121 Now, the disciples get in physical trouble, trouble that the doctors hasn't got the remedy.

L-122 Just like those disciples, they had trouble. They were disciples, and they had--they had trouble that the navigators couldn't remedy. They... No one could remedy it, but the Remedy was laying right there.

L-123 And you may have a trouble tonight that the doctor can't remedy. But we got Him right here now, like they had. He's right here. That's right. We, like those people, we forgot Who this is in the ship. It's just not a church. It's just not a rules that we go by. But it's the Creator of heavens and earth. He may be resting right now from a revival. He sent one. May be resting.

L-124 He had another one ahead of Him, the next day, a maniac had to be healed. But, at that time, He was resting, and trouble set in. And He was asleep, resting. But they forgot Who It was, see, in the turmoil. "Well, I know, but pull on that oar, Simon. Andrew, harder on that oar! What are we going to do?" See? There it is.

L-125 What you all flusterated about? "Doctor said this. Doctor said that." Well, maybe he did. Maybe the man is right. That's what he said. But, what does This say? That's the next thing. See?

L-126 And another thing. After they knowed Him the way they did, they should have known that a Man that could tell the thoughts that a man was thinking, and knowed the end from the beginning, knowed it was going to happen anyhow. Amen. Now, don't, don't miss this. He knew it was going to happen. I doubt very much He was asleep. But He knowed it was going to happen. He was God, and God is infinite, so He knowed it was going to happen. And He knowed when it was going to happen. And it only happened, to test their faith. Didn't He say so, later?

L-127 And that's why you're sick tonight, maybe. That's why the lull of the revival is, to see what you're going to do about what you've seen done. Are you going to pick it up, make another organization out of it?

L-128 The God that moved on the scene, when this sister, setting here, they brought her into the line, down here at that little, Mexican church that day, cancer in the heart. Her doctor has the x-ray. Her husband is setting there. They said, "There's a dead woman in the line." I said, "Bring her on." I was sure that He was there.

L-129 Sister Waldrop, that's been a long time ago, sixteen years. See? Dying, with a cancer! Remember, that same God is still in the ship. Don't get flusterated. There's a testimony that could turn Phoenix, the Maricopa Valley, or the world, upside-down, one out of a tens of thousands.

L-130 He is still here. But we get all flusterated, see, like they did. "Oh, my! Pull on this oar. What we going to do next?" Now, don't think about that. Long as He's in the ship, forget about it. Certainly. Now, He only did it to test their faith. And does not our Scripture tell us that, "These trials are put upon us, and more precious to us than gold?" We don't think so, but the Bible is right.

L-131 Could you imagine Job enjoying being broke out with boils, and all these things gone, losing all of his wealth and his children, and everything? It wasn't very easy, but God was proving to Satan that He had somebody He could put confidence in. Maybe He's trying to do the same thing in your case, and the rest of you. "Oh, they'll forsake You. They'll..." Oh, no. Job, they couldn't make Job do that. No, sir. See? He's only trying to prove them.

L-132 Remember, in a few minutes, He said, "Oh, ye of little faith. Couldn't you understand about breaking the bread and feeding five thousand? Don't you know I'm the same Jehovah that fed them for forty years out there in the wilderness, out of ovens, out of Heaven, when I poured it out every night? What you so scared about? Don't you know I dried up the Red Sea, one day? Don't you know I opened up the earth and swallowed the unbeliever? One day I measured the earth and spurt it off, out into space yonder." And He's in the ship. Now, that's not mythical. That's truth. Yes.

L-133 Same now. He tries to prove us and see where we'll stand, or not. Take a revival away, and start a argument in the church, just to see what you'll do. Turn Satan loose among you, among, see how you'll stand. Let him strike you with something, see what kind of a stand you'll take. Job said, "Though He slay me, yet I'll trust Him." Amen. Amen. That's it.

L-134 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, said, "Our God is able to deliver us from that fire, but nevertheless we're not giving up." Sure.

L-135 But we get all flusterated, you know, like they did, the disciples. They... We're human, just like they were.

L-136 And He had proven Who He was, and then, still, after He had proved to be the God of creation. He was the Creator. "How did He? Well, tell me what He turned loose, to cook that bread and cook them fish." Well, He--He not only created the fish, but He cooked the fish, the same time. That's the truth.

L-137 Where did that manna come from, out of Heaven, literal food that kept people alive for forty years? Bread, fell down from Heaven. Where did He get it at?

L-138 Where did those crows get that meat and bread, to feed Elijah? The intelligence of a crow, to cook some meat, and kill a cow and butcher it, and cook it up and make steaks, and put it on bread and bake it, and bring it to Elijah.

L-139 He is God. We don't believe it, then we're unbelievers. That's all. We've got to believe.

L-140 That's what Abraham done, "Called anything contrary to it as though it didn't even happen." No matter how old he got, or how much, he just kept praising God for the promise, went on with it.

L-141 Now, He proved what He was, by His Word and the signs vindicated. He said, "If I do not the works that's written of Me, then don't believe Me." See? Now, there is how you catch it. I trust that you get thinking real deep here. See? Always watch that Word.

L-142 That's what--that's what Satan attacked Eve by, in the garden of Eden, and reasoned her out of it, by reasons.

L-143 But when he come back and attacked Christ, he throwed the things right back at Him again. He said, "If thou be the Son of God, now I'd like to see a miracle. You know, I never seen one. I'd like you turn these... You're hungry. Make these stones bread."

L-144 He said, "It's written..." Oh, my! There you are. Upon the pinnacle of the temple, "It's written..." Upon a high mountain, "It's written..." Stayed right with that Word, and put the old fellow right in the place where he belonged.

L-145 Now, He said to them guys that didn't believe Him, thought He was a soothsayer or--or some kind of a--a--a Beelzebub, a devil, under spiritualism, that He knowed the thoughts of people's hearts, and things, trying to do that. He said, "Which one of you can accuse Me of sin?" Said again, "If you don't believe Me," said, "search the Scriptures, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life; and they are the thing, they are They that testify of Me. They are the thing that makes My ministry what it is." See what I mean? "They are they that testify of Me." See? Referring (what?) right back to the Scriptures again. "They are they that testify of Me. They tell you Who I am." Amen. Glory to God!

L-146 The Scriptures tells you whether you're a believer or not. The Scriptures tell you whether you're lining up or not. That's how you know a man, by his testimony. Not what he says with this, but how he lines with the Scripture. True. That's how you know it.

L-147 Jesus invited them to do it. "If I didn't meet every qualification of Messiah, then you tell Me where I missed it." Oh, my! That's good. Isn't it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] "Tell Me where I missed it, if I didn't meet the qualification, if I have done exactly what the Scriptures said that I would do."

L-148 Oh, Christian, if we could line ourselves up in there, do what the Scripture says a Christian should do!

L-149 They should have known He was the God of creation. And could... He was the very one that created the water and the wind. They should have known that. And if they knowed that He was that, did they not understand that this creation of the creator would have to obey His Word, oh, my, if He created it? Who is the greatest, the creation or the Creator? Like Jesus said, "Who is the greatest, he that is sent, or He that sent him?" Uh-huh. See? Which is the greatest, the creation or the Creator? The Creator. And they seen, and He proved, that He was that Creator. And then if He was that Creator, could, would not His creation obey Him?

L-150 Let us remember also that He created our bodies. Won't our bodies obey His command? "Spit out that cancer," He says to the body, and away it goes. You just take that Word and plant It in here and see what happens. Sure. Yes, sir. Our bodies has to obey His command.

L-151 You say you're a Christian. I believe you are. You believe. What are you resting in? Someday He will raise our bodies up, after they've absolutely, completely perished. If you don't believe that, why you go to church? See? "If there's no resurrection, aren't we, amongst men, most miserable?"

L-152 But His Word of promise, "He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Amen. I am the resurrection and Life. Amen. He that eats My flesh and drinks My Blood has Eternal Life, and I'll raise him up, the last days." Why? The body, the ashes, the volcanic ashes that we're made out of, obey His command because He's the Creator of it.

L-153 The Life that's within us is not only a creative Life, but it's part of His own Life. That's the reason we have the authority to speak to a devil, 'cause it's God's own creative Life, if you're anointed. Correctly. Not you, it's not you that speaketh, but the Father that dwelleth in you. See? "Take no thought what you'll say, 'cause be added at that time." Just go on, stay with it. Oh, I love that!

L-154 After the disciples found themselves at the end of their road, it must have dawned on some of them, that He was still with them. After they come to the end of the road, it must have dawned on somebody, "Well, here, after all, we was here giving this testimony. There He lays, right there. See? He's just taking a rest between the revivals. And here we are fussing and stewing, and all worried, and tore up, and doubting, and scared, everything else. And the Creator is laying right here in the boat." Oh, my!

L-155 O God, let it dawn on some of us again. Let it come to pass, Lord, that it can be dawn, it can dawn on us.

L-156 That's the very God that took you, separated you from your mother. The very God that give you the Holy Spirit! He's just as much God right now as He was when--when He--when He gave you the Holy Spirit. He's just as close to you as He was right then. Just exactly. You must remember, He's always there, always. That's right.

L-157 It dawned on some of them that the Creator was with them in the boat.

L-158 I wonder tonight if the sick people, being I'm going to talk to the sick in a moment, if it can dawn on you that the very God that you trust in, the Creator of heavens and earth, Who made your body, is right here. He's just as great tonight as He ever was. He's God. He cannot get any less and ever remain God, as long as He's God.

L-159 You say, "Is that true, Brother Branham? Is that the Scripture?"

L-160 Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." Yeah. He's the same.

L-161 So what ought to be our plea tonight, Brother Groomer, Brother Noel? What is our plea? Wake Jesus. If there's trouble around, let's--let's get Him on the scene. Amen. Wake Jesus, for we have Him with us. He's with us, sure, He is, just the same as He ever was. They had just seen the Scripture Word that God spoke of Him, vindicated by Him. So have we.

L-162 You know, on the Day of Pentecost, Peter, inspired with the Holy Ghost, stood up there. And the people was all laughing, making fun of that little handful of Jews out there, stammering, and spitting, and slobbering, and acting like a bunch of drunk people. And those big religious people standing there, saying, "Why, these men are full of new wine."

L-163 And Peter stood up, and they was pricked at their heart when they heard that sermon that preacher preached. He really laid the Gospel down. He said, "You men of Judaea, and you that dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and hearken unto my words. These are not drunk, like you suppose, seeing this is the third hour of the day. But this..." "Perhaps"? No. "This is that that was spoke of by the prophet Joel. 'It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh: upon my sons and my handmaids and maidservants will I pour out My Spirit. I'll show wonders in the heaven above, and fire and smoke. And--and upon my maidservants, and they shall prophesy; and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions." Right? And they said, "What can we do? How can we get This?"

L-164 He said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And we be told by others that that ended it. But they, that's... If you'd stop there, that would end it. But go on, what He said. "For the promise is unto you, your children, them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."

L-165 In the face of a cold denominational world, we prove that's the Truth. Amen. If that part of the Word is true, the rest of It's true. Yeah. They'd seen the Scripture vindicated by Him. We have, too.

L-166 He was not hard to call on the scene of action. It's very easy to call Him. Watch Him when He comes on action, though. That's what I like, to see Him when He comes in to the crowd of the people. Watch Him when He... They said, "Master, we perish."

L-167 He rubbed his eyes, said, "You of little faith, why did you doubt? Haven't you seen all that I've done? Haven't... Hasn't--haven't the Scripture been proved by Me? All the Scriptures pointed to Me. And you've said, all along, you believed Me. 'Yes, Lord, we believe You. We'll do this, that, or the other.' And when the little trouble comes up, then away you go."

L-168 Isn't that us today? Sure is. Right. Yeah. "You said you believed Me, but why didn't you? What did you doubt for?"

L-169 A woman said to me, some time ago. I might have re-... said that here some time. It'll bear repeating. She was a Christian Science. And she said, "Brother Branham, I--I appreciate your remarks that you say of the Scripture. But," said, "there's just one fault you have."

L-170 I said, "Thank you. Just one? My!" I said, "I'm certainly got grace in your sight."

L-171 And she said, "This fault is, that, you brag too much about Jesus."

L-172 I said, "Oh, my!" I said, "If that's the only fault I got, I hope God feels--feels I only got one fault when I get there. And if that's the only one, I'm sure I'm going in." I said, "If I had ten thousand tongues, I couldn't brag on Him enough. No matter what I'd say, I couldn't brag on Him enough."

L-173 She said, "But, Brother Branham, you make Him Divine. You make Him God."

L-174 I said, "He was, and He is. And if He wasn't, He was the greatest deceiver the world ever had." That's right. She said, "Oh! Don't..." I said, "Don't you believe that?"

L-175 She said, "Oh, Mr. Branham, I believe He was a teacher." And said, "I believe He was a prophet, but He was just a plain prophet like the rest of them." I said, "Oh, my! Oh! You're so mistaken." She said, "I'll prove it to you." I said, "How?"

L-176 She said, "In the Scriptures, when Lazarus... Saint John, the 11th chapter, when Lazarus died, the Bible said, that, 'Jesus wept.'" And she said, "How could He be Divine and weep?"

L-177 I said, "That was the Man part weeping. That was the Man. The immortal part was inside. That was God in Him." She said, "Ah, nonsense!"

L-178 I said, "I want to ask you something. When, that night on the ship, He was a Man laying there, sleeping. That's true. He was sleep and tired, like a man. But when He could put His foot upon the brail of that boat and say, 'Peace, be still,' and the winds and the waves obeyed Him. He might have been a Man, crying, but when He said, 'Lazarus, come forth,' and a man had been dead four days come on it. He was a Man when He come down off the mountain, hungering for something to eat, looked on a tree; but when He took five biscuits, and two, fed five thousand, that was the Creator." That's right. Sure.

L-179 In action, God in action! Oh, I love that! Not some idol, not some mythical thought of rubbing a statue, not some totem pole, but a real, living God in action. Amen. Amen. Not something that was. Something that is right now. Sounds silly, to the world. But, oh, how gracious, to the saint who believes it. How wonderful! Certainly. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-180 You know, He was more than a prophet, and yet He was a Prophet. He was a God-Prophet. See? Because, the prophets was the Word. The Bible said the Word came to the prophet, and as long as the prophet was speaking the Word, that He and God was... The man knowed not what he was doing. He was just speaking the Word of God. See? Not knowing what he was doing, he was prophesying under inspiration. See? Then, it wasn't the man's word. It was God speaking through lips.

L-181 Now, God chose to use man. Now, He could have chose to use the sun to preach the Gospel. He could have chose to use the wind to preach the Gospel. He could have chose the stars. He could chose anything He wanted to, but He chose man.

L-182 And somebody is going to do it. That's right, somebody. If He could just ever find Him a man, one man that He could get in his hand, He will do it. He's had such a hard time, finding one man.

L-183 I think of Samson. He found a man with plenty of strength. And Samson dedicated his strength to God, but he wouldn't give his heart. He gave that to Delilah. See?

L-184 God wants your heart, strength, soul, body, mind, all you got. It's the only way He can use you, use the whole man. Yes.

L-185 That's what Jesus was. "In Him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily." We have It by measure.

L-186 Because, when that Pillar of Fire come down at Pentecost, you notice, the Bible said, "Cloven tongues like Fire sat upon them." What was it? That Pillar of Fire separating Itself, and dividing Himself amongst His people. What a gracious thing! See? God in you? See? God in His people. Now notice.

L-187 Someone says now, in the church tonight, would say this. People today, if would say, "If we only could know He is here with us. Is there any way?"

L-188 You see, they could look at Him. Now, listen close now, 'fore we call the prayer line. They could look at Him and say, "There He lays, on the boat. Now, He's there."

L-189 Now, if we only had some way to do something like that. If we could just look at Him somewhere, we could say, "There He is, right there."

L-190 Now, but He is that close. He is even closer. "For I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Isn't that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] He's closer than He was to them, 'cause they had to go across the--the deck of the boat, and back to the back, and wake Him up. You don't have to do that. Oh, my! Whew! Oh! I feel religious right now. I just begin to feel real good, right now. Oh!

L-191 Hebrews 13:8 says, "He's the same yesterday, today, and forever." And He said again, "Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end, the evening time." Preached on last night. "At the evening time, I'll still be there." Again, "I will never leave you. No matter what the boat is doing, how much rocking and rolling they're doing, or anything else, I'll be with you, be with you to the end time, never leave you." You say, "How can this be, Brother Branham?"

L-192 Saint John, the 12th... the 14th chapter, the 12th verse, said that He would prove it. See? "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also."

L-193 You say, "I wish you could prove and show me that He is just as He always was. If you could prove it to me!"

L-194 Well, here is where He challenged, the proof. "He that believeth on Me, the things that I do." In other words, you will be an amateur Messiah, Messiahette. That's exactly right. For if His Life be in you, it ain't you; it's Him. See? And you are ordained to carry His work on. "He that believeth on Me, I'll prove that I am Messiah. And He that believeth on me will do the same thing." Now, that, He can't lie and be what you think He is, and what I know He is, and you believe He is, too. See?

L-195 You know what He's doing? He is here tonight, waiting to be proved. That's right. You know what we ought to do? We ought to do like they. Wake Jesus that's in us. Wake Jesus in our own lives: the God that set our souls afire with the Holy Ghost; the God that taken these blinded eyes of mine, opened them up; the God that raised me off of a death bed. The God that I seen bring the dead back, after being dead for hours; the doctor pronounced "dead," and write a statement to it, five different times. Waken that God. Waken Him up. We ought to call on Jesus and wake Him, and call Him on the scene. We have need of Him. Yes, sir.

L-196 Then, call Him, to confirm His Word. If we wake Him up, get Him stirred up, in us, till your own doubts and flusteration has passed away. Now call on Him and say, "Lord, You promised, a little while and the world would see You no more. And I'm not of the world. You prayed that I'd not be of the world, and I'm not of the world. I'm yours. And You said, 'The world will see Me no more, yet you'll see Me.' Uh-huh. 'You'll see me.' Lord, I want to disturb You. I want to arouse You, out of my own sleeping body, my own sleeping heart, of these realities." Waken Jesus. "Come to me." Then the doubts and fears will cease.

L-197 All the flusterations and worry, about, "Oh, the doctor said this, and that he going to do this. And I--I--I don't know what I'm going to do. I--I..." It'll just all cease, 'cause He's God. He speaks, and everything else keeps still.

L-198 Now, we could talk on, with several more pages of notes. But let me ask you something now, 'cause it's almost, about ten minutes to nine. Course, that's two hours earlier than last night, you know, too. But, look, let me say this, to stop right now, and I can finish this some other time.

L-199 Can God fail? [Congregation says, "No."--Ed.] Neither can His Word, because He is His Word. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." "Yet a little while and the world won't see Me no more, yet you'll see Me. For I..." And "I" is a personal pronoun. "I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the consummation, the end of time. At the end time, I'll be there." The Light will be shining at the end time.

L-200 "He's the same yesterday, today, and forever." Hebrews 13:8 is written. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Hebrews 13:8, it's written. So, if it's written, now let it be done. Amen. Don't be afraid to put His Word to a test. It's there. He is here. The only thing you need to do is wake Him. You...

L-201 We breathe so much of the unfilterated spirit, so much to cause us to try to remind of something else, and turn to, "I'm tired. I--I'm too weary. I've seen this do." What do you point to some wreck for? "I'll take you to..." Said, "I know somebody, trusted God, and died."

L-202 I know millions, the same time, died under doctors' care. See? Sure. Sure. If the doctor has done all he can do, you haven't got nothing else but trust God, and if you'll believe it.

L-203 Now, you just can't say, "Well, I--I'm going to trust Him." That isn't it. That's, really do it. That isn't it.

L-204 You got to disturb Him, till you can see Him come in. Can't our prayers disturb Him? Can't our prayers waken Him from His rest, bring Him on the scene? They did. They cried out, "Lord, we are perishing," and He moved in on the scene. Now we can do the same thing. Now, you believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Then let us pray.

L-205 O Lord, this simple little thought, "Awaken Jesus." Lord, we have--we have not used His Spirit and His faith, so long, till it merely goes to sleep, as it was, in our souls. Let us shake ourselves tonight. Let us arouse ourselves and get our own sleepiness away from us, that we can see that He is still in the boat.

L-206 O Lord, today I tried to shake my soul. I knowed I had to stand before a little group of people up here tonight. And I shake myself. Lord Jesus, waken, come forth. I've put Your Word out before the people. It's brought to a test. Prove to this audience tonight, Lord, that You still live, that You're still here with us. Your Words are true, "I'm with you always, even to the end of the world." You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're still in the ship, Lord, the old ship of Zion that's carrying us across the troubled seas. And when the Devil sweeps a storm down upon us, what difference does it make, as long as He is in the ship? Be with us now, Father. And may You walk right into the hearts of the people tonight.

L-207 May You walk into my heart, soul, body, mind, eyes, lips. And let this dedication, of myself, be a confirmation of Your Word, that You promised in Saint John 14:12. "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall you do also."

L-208 Then may it be, go to the audience, that they might believe it this way, "A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me." And when we're setting in this Heavenly place tonight, in Christ Jesus, manifest Yourself, Lord. It's Your promise. Your words won't fail. And then, course, then let it be upon the basis of the faith of the people, that they can receive You then. That's all we can do.

L-209 I pray, God, that You'll get glory to Yourself. I commit this audience, the Message, the Seed that's been sown. May the Holy Spirit come in, shine Its light. Like I said on the seed of that little Samaritan woman; may, quickly, as soon as the Light flashes, may the believer see it. May the sick man see it, the sick woman, boy, or girl. And those who are desiring for others, may they see It, quickly, and be healed. In Jesus' Name. Amen. Do you believe now? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-210 Now, I believe... Prayer cards? Well, I'll try. I can't bring but just a few at a time, so let's start bringing them up, some people, to pray for them. And now I know it's pretty crowded.

L-211 Just set still, minister brothers. I'll back right up here, against it. Take your--your place here. All right.

L-212 Now, don't doubt. Believe. Will you do that? "All things are possible to them that believe." That's right. "All things are possible to them that believe." All right. Now, you must believe. You got to believe God's Word to be the Truth. All right. Now let's...

L-213 How many can we stand up here at a time, about eight, ten? All right.

L-214 Let's start from number one, and get number one to about ten or fifteen, A. A, number one to fifteen. Who has prayer card A, number one?

L-215 I see there's both Spanish and Indian here tonight. They might not be able to understand it.

L-216 All right, here comes one woman, right over here. Number two? Right here. Uh-huh. Right out here. Yeah. Right here. All right. Number two. Three, number three? All right, right over here, if you will. Number four, five, six, seven, eight? Somebody take the little boy there, so he won't get stepped on. Eight, nine, ten. Now, about ten. All right. We see how we kind of... Oh, we're... I don't know. I may--may have too many now. All right. Ten. That's all right. Let them line right like that. That's fine.

L-217 How many believes now with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, we haven't got too many here, ten. Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. All right.

L-218 Now, everyone, I want you real reverent. Now, I've been right on a hour, or a little better, speaking. What I say means nothing unless God backs it up. And if He doesn't back it up, see, still the Word is right, yeah, no matter whether He does or not. He's done it before, see, and He never has failed me. And I--I know He won't, because He said He wouldn't. See? And I--I know that He will do it. But we must believe it. With all of our hearts, we got to believe. Now, so far as I know...

L-219 I want you that's in the prayer line, look this way, what all is going to be in the prayer line. I--I believe that every one of them are strangers to me. I believe all of them are strangers. If that's right you, just raise up your hand. If I don't know you all, just raise up your hands like that. All right. See? Now, I don't know those people. They, there's not many here...

L-220 I know some here in these lines right out here. I'm not sure. I think this is Brother Noel's wife. I'm not sure. It's been a long time.

L-221 And so how is Brother Johnson? I think he's got a stroke, hasn't he? Oh, my! What say? Is that right? Bless her heart. Those people were like father and mother to me, when I first started in the meeting, this little group of Arkansas people. I'll never forget Arkansas. No, sir. I've never been in a meeting anywhere, 'less there's plenty of "Arkies." How many is here tonight, raise up your hands, from Arkansas? Now, the rest of them is from Oklahoma, so you can just depend on that. See? That's the way it goes. But we're all Heaven bound, see, "setting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

L-222 Sister Jones and Brother Jones, years ago when I come to your church, I believe it was Moark. Wasn't it? And you remember when I come there, the only way I knowed of finding the people's trouble was by... You'd lead them up on the platform and they'd lay their hand on mine, and then I'd wait there just a minute. And then, not try to use my own voice, and It would speak, say, "Tumor, cataract." And I told you that there would come a time that, He told me up there, if I'd be sincere, then I'd know the very secret of their heart. See? That's right. How many remembers that when I first come to Phoenix? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] All right. Has it happened? ["Amen."] See?

L-223 Now, remember. Watch this tape. We're stepping right up a little higher now. See? It's going right on up, a little higher. Remember it. Just--just remember. See?

L-224 Now, we want to see Jesus. I want to see Him. Now, we know that His body will not return to the earth until He comes for the Church, because it must remain There for a sacrifice. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] It must be on the altar. He sets on the Throne of God, tonight. And it must remain there, for, by His stripes, He is the Sacrifice, and the Sacrifice is on the altar. See? And His body cannot come. But His life returned, that was in Christ, come back upon the church, in the form of the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit...

L-225 It wasn't that body that did it, anyhow. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works. It's My Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." Now, we believe that. Don't we? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-226 Now, if I told you the spirit of a gangster is in me, you'd expect me to have big guns, and mean. See? The spirit of an artist, you'd expect me to take a brush and paint.

L-227 If I tell you, "the Spirit of Christ," then it'll do the works of Christ. "He that believes in Me, the works that I do..." Just like putting the life out of one vine into another, it'll bear the--the fruit of the life that's in the vine.

L-228 Now, I don't know that He will do this. I can't say it. But if I, by a gift... Now, no need trying to explain it. I can't.

L-229 But many of you know that I been around the world, been over, several times. Before a half-a-million people, at one time, five hundred thousand people. See so many different languages, I'd have to jot down what I said, to wait till it went through fifteen more interpreters, then come back to the thing I said. And see that Spirit of God go right down there and do just the same thing it does here. See? See? All nations, languages, without an excuse.

L-230 Now, remember, it won't go to everybody. When Jesus was on the earth, not over one-third of the Jewish race ever knowed He was on the earth. You know that. He come to the Elected, and they received It. That's right. That's where the Spirit goes tonight, to the Elected.

L-231 Now, if you can believe that Jesus died for your sins, and have accepted Him as your Saviour, and He's took your life and remold it again, then, remember, "By His stripes we were healed. See? Now, you was. You're already healed. You believe that? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, the Bible said, "We were." Is that right? ["Amen."] Not "will be." We, already. We've, already.

L-232 The whole sin question was settled when Jesus died at Calvary. You believe that, brother? [The brethren say, "Amen."--Ed.] See? "He's the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world." Now, it'll never do you no good until you accept your pardon. See, you've got to accept it. And you got to accept your healing in the same way.

L-233 If some man come by, say, "I'll heal you," now, he's wrong. That's contrary to the Scripture. He can show you here where Jesus done it for you, and it's based on your faith. God never can do nothing... God cannot work against your faith. You've got to believe it.

L-234 Now, Jesus, when He come to His own people, listen what the Bible said. "Many mighty works He could not do, because of their unbelief," after He showed Himself to be Messiah. Now, He proved it in that day, He was Messiah.

L-235 May God help me to humble my spirit in such a way that I can prove that He is still Messiah; that, the same God that was on the earth, can take a--a mortal body, surrender to Him, and work through it exactly the way He promised to do. Would not that be convincing? Wouldn't that be showing that He's--He's not asleep? He's awake. He's ready for you to call Him in action.

L-236 Now what about me standing here, tonight, what have I got to do? There is hundred and fifty people here, I guess, something like that. Whether it's a hundred and fifty, whether it's one--one person, was five hundred thousand, don't make any difference. Just the same. See?

L-237 Now, if anybody thinks that this is bogus, and not right, I ask you to come up and take my place and do the same thing. Uh-huh. Yeah. See? You know better than to try that. Uh-huh. See? Notice. But, now, God has to prove whether He's right or not. Now, if the Lord God...

L-238 Is this one of the... Give that boy your card there. Come here. Here is a lady, lot younger than I am. I've never seen her in my life. I suppose we're strangers to one another? That's right. We do not know one another.

L-239 Now, when you go home, you read Saint John, the 4th chapter, and you find out if this isn't even a little round place... Anybody ever in Palestine, up there at--at Sychar? That little well is still there where that woman was at; little round place, vines on it. And Jesus set over against the wall when the woman come up. He was standing in the little panoramic when the woman come up from the street down here, come up and got the water, the end of the street. And she come up there. And now He carried a conversation with her until He found where her trouble was, then He told her what her trouble was.

L-240 And when He did that, she said, quickly, "Sir, You must be a prophet, see, 'cause You..." He had to have... Then if He was a prophet, that was the Word of God coming to Him. But she said, "We know we're looking for the Messiah. And when He comes, that's what He will do." How many knows that's Scripture? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That's the Scripture.

L-241 Now, here is my hand over the Bible. I, as far as I know, I've never seen the woman in my life. And she says we're perfect strangers to one another. Now, the Word either has to be right or wrong. Right. It's either right or wrong. We can't make it anything different.

L-242 Now, lady, just to speak with you a moment, like our Lord did to the woman... If He can tell me...

L-243 Now, if I'd say to you, "Oh, course, you had a prayer card. You come up here. You're sick." See? Well, then if I'd say, "Glory to God," lay my hands upon you. "Glory to God, you're going to get well." It's all right, not a thing wrong with that. That's exactly what to do. See? That's right.

L-244 The Bible said, "They lay hands on the sick, they'll recover." That's true.

L-245 But now, you could scratch your head and study, "Did he tell me right? Am I going to get well?"

L-246 Now, what if--if the Something that knows your life, what you have been, what you have did, and, or what's wrong with you, like He told that woman what was her trouble? And if He could tell you them things, well, surely if He know what has been, He knows what will be. Is that right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Sure.

L-247 Now, if the woman is sick... She might be standing for somebody else. It might be sickness. It might be financial trouble. It might be domestic trouble. I don't know. I can't tell you. That's true. See? But whatever it is, if He would say it, she would know whether it was truth or not. She would know it. You know whether it was or not. And then if it's wrong, then that wasn't the Spirit of God, 'cause the prophet has said so, and his prophecy was wrong. But if it is right, then that was the Spirit of God. See?

L-248 Now wouldn't that comfort us and make us feel wonderful, if we know that Jesus was here with us tonight? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Would it give you faith? ["Amen."] See? Certainly.

L-249 Now, to heal the woman, I couldn't do it. I--I can't do that. It's already done. See? See? It's done, and now based upon her faith to believe it. Now, if He was standing here, Himself, with this suit on, He couldn't heal her. He would say He would already done it. "If thou canst believe, see, that I've done it, it's all over." See? That's it. See?

L-250 But, now, only thing He could do, He could prove that He was Messiah, yet, that God-Prophet was to come. And He promised that His disciples would do the same thing, so there you are. See? It brings it right back to the Scripture. And that's Scripture, brethren. I know it's all contrary to the modern belief, but it's God's belief. It's God's way, 'cause He said so. There's the Scripture to read for yourself. They just try to twist it up and make something else out of it.

L-251 Now, I want to ask you something. The woman is a believer. I want to...

L-252 Something will happen. You just remember, something will happen. Now, if it does, then how many is going to accept and say, "That settled it for me"? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Will you believe that, lady? You believe it, over there? Rest of you believes it? ["Amen."] Let God be the judge.

L-253 Now, no more than I said that, reason I said that. How many has ever seen the Light, that picture of that Light, that Angel of the Lord? George J. Lacy, you know. See? All right. That Light is right between she and I, now. And it's welcoming. I know she's a believer. That's right.

L-254 What you want me to pray for you about: sores, sores on your body. Another thing, it's just complications. You have so many things. But, wait a minute. I'm in contact with your spirit. You're ready for an operation. That's right. Up for an operation. Now, He said that was in the gallbladder. That's right. Now what do you think? God bless you. Just believe. That's it. Amen.

L-255 Isn't He Christ? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now question the lady if you wish to. That's... See?

L-256 Now, that's Him yesterday, today, and forever. See? Your faith has aroused Him now. See? He's on the scene, to do things to help you, to bless you, and to give you those things that you long to have.

L-257 Now, that one vision has weakened me more than that hour-and-a-half sermon. See? And just feel yourself trembling, getting away. See? Frankly, this is the first time I've had a service...

L-258 The other night, the Holy Spirit struck, over in some church, I know, and It called three or four people. And when it did, they didn't respond just quickly, and then He was grieved. He went right away, see, and left me right there. You have--you have to, you have to answer Him back. Yes, sir. Just remember, He ain't obligated to you; you are, to Him.

L-259 We are strangers to each other. [The sister, says, "I've seen you once."--Ed.] You saw me once. ["Yes."] Here in Arizona? ["Yes. I was...?... in the prayer line."] In a prayer line. How long ago has that been? ["It was either in '54 or '55."] Yeah. Long time ago. Yes, sir. ["I'm not for sure when."]

L-260 I remember the longest prayer line I ever had in my life, was down here at Phoenix, one afternoon. Over...

L-261 I forget the name of that church. There was a... Used to be, a little, short fellow had the church. I forget what he... Great big church, here in Phoenix. Was it Fuller? No. Brother Fuller, I know him. What say? I remember Garcia. But this is a great big church over there where Dr. Sutton used to pastor, or something. What was the name of that big church over there? It's one of the biggest full Gospel churches in the country. [Someone says, "Faulkner."--Ed.] Faulkner, that's it. That's it, Faulkner, over at his church.

L-262 You remember that line? I started that afternoon, prayed on till midnight that night, I believe it was. Just con-... Just laying hands on the people, I got so weak I couldn't even move no more, hardly. See?

L-263 That was before vision came. It would come, but just sparingly, now and then. And then sometime when I'd be by myself, He'd tell me something was going to happen. I'd come tell you all that He told me something was going to happen. It always happened. Didn't it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Yeah. Now, what does It say? "Believe it." God confirms it. See?

L-264 Now, the lady, being many years ago, I guess I've prayed for two and a half million people, or maybe, since then, you know, around the world. May be more than that. But I--I would never know who, about you, or nothing for it. But now the Bible said, that, one time...

L-265 And, by the way, that darkness, was over that woman, has left her. That's right. Uh-huh. I know. You feel different, don't you? If you just hold that faith, that's all it takes. Now, fill it with joy and faith. Cause, it'll come back with five other, or seven others, worse. See? Just stay right there and say, "I believe. That settled it."

L-266 Now, we being strangers to each other, I just would say, for two witness. The Bible said, "The mouth of two witnesses, or three," I believe it was. Wasn't it? "Two or three witnesses, three witnesses, let every word be established."

L-267 I aim to put the rest of my time down here, if I can, on healing line. So, I don't want to take too much on discernment. Just so you would know.

L-268 By the way, that lady sitting over there, having dizzy spells. They won't happen to you no more if you just believe it. Tell me what she touched. I--I seen that Light circle here and go right over in that corner. I seen the woman holding her head, like this, in the vision, moving back and forth, like that. Uh-huh. See? What did she do? She touched His garment. Not... The Bible said, that, "He's the High Priest" (is that right?) "that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities." That's what she did. See how quickly she responded? There it happened. See? Just believe. Now, that should settle it all. That makes it the truth.

L-269 Now, you see why I'm not running on down the line. Just try to hold myself back, as much, 'cause I want another line tomorrow night. But just that you would see that He's come on the scene. That's Him. It can't be me. I never seen that woman in my life; don't know nothing about her. See?

L-270 It's so simple, till the big intelligent people today stagger right over the top of such simplicity. See? That's the reason they miss it. They try to figure it out. You can't figure it out. You believe it. You just believe it.

L-271 That Indian girl, having headaches, if she'd just believe it, it'd leave her, too. I never seen her. She's not even... See? See?

L-272 Touch Him. Just touch Him, once, and find out if it's not right. See?

L-273 Those people are strangers. Ask the lady. I never seen her in my life. That's true, before God, as I ever knowed. See? See? He's on the scene, if you can believe Him. But just don't stagger at it; believe it. It'll do something for you if you'll believe it. He'll heal you. All of you can be healed if you just believe it.

L-274 You see, here stands a woman on the platform. And the Holy Spirit moving out there through the audience, healing the people, show that He's everywhere, omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Amen. Glory! Wake Jesus, inside of you. Let He that come into you, in the form of the Holy Spirit, move through you.

L-275 I don't know you, but God does know you. The Lord God can reveal to me something you're here for. You'd believe me, wouldn't you? All right. You look on me. I--I mean by that, like Peter and James, you know, said, "Look on us." Just to get you from...

L-276 It's just coming from everywhere. I believe there's going to be a real healing service in a few minutes. See? See? See?

L-277 One thing, your eyes are bothering you. You're almost going blind. Nerves in the eyes are dying.

L-278 The first time, I caught that, in a long time. Somebody said, "He guessed that." I didn't. I didn't. Now, remember, I'm catching your thoughts here by the Holy Spirit.

L-279 Let's see if I guessed it. Look here, sister. You're a believer. You got trouble with your chest; cancer, skin cancers on the back of the neck. Now, you believe God will take it away? [The sister says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] Uh-huh. You want to go back over in New Mexico, where you come from, believing God healed you? All right, Mrs. Watkins, go back...?... over there. Be healed in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou canst believe. Just have faith.

L-280 We're strangers to one another. You've seen me in the meetings. But, I mean, to know you, just to say I know you, I don't.

L-281 Now, just a little bit. I'm way over my time there, but surely you know He's here. This one woman standing here, again, then we'll--we'll pray for them. I think that's at least three. Isn't it? Oh, yes. That's all out through the audience, then.

L-282 I have no idea. You look healthy and strong, to me. I don't know you, but God does know you. But there is something on your heart. It's something you're desiring. And it's for somebody else. I see a young man, no, two young men. They're your sons. No, one of them is a son, and the other one is a son-in-law. And they both have stomach trouble. And they both got black shadows over them. They're, both, sinners. That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. You believe now? How many will believe with her? Let us pray.

L-283 Lord Jesus, we believe You now for this request, for our sister. I bless her in Your Name. May she go and receive what she's asked for, for Your glory. Amen.

L-284 All of you believe now with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.]

L-285 Now, come this way. You believe He can tell me what's wrong? Wouldn't that be nice, that old asthmatic trouble would clear up, and you could go home, be well? Well, if you believe it, it'll do it.

L-286 Speak English? Heart trouble, stomach trouble. Believe the Lord Jesus and it'll leave you. Amen. All right.

L-287 Come, lady. Speak English? Hard to get your breath; asthma. Go, believe. Breathe! Believe it, in the--the Name of the Lord Jesus.

L-288 Come. Speak English? You believe me to be God's prophet? Your trouble is in your back. Believe! Won't bother you no more.

L-289 You believe me to be His servant? You're bothered with arthritis. I see you trying to get out of bed. You can't hardly do it, of a morning. Go, believe, and you won't have to do that no more, and you'll be made well.

L-290 Do you believe? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] All your heart? ["Amen."] Wake Jesus, in you now. Christ is here. He's on the scene. Do you all believe that? ["Amen."]

L-291 Now put your hands over on one another. Just lay your hands over on one another now.

L-292 I'm going to quote a Scripture. Jesus said, "Go into all the world," Tempe, Arizona, "preach the Gospel. These signs shall follow them that believe. In My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; take up serpents or drink deadly things, would not harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover."

L-293 Now, with Jesus present now, if you believe He's present, say, "Amen." [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] The same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ is here in this church tonight.

L-294 Now, you pray for the person you got your hands on. Just pray right out, say, "Lord God, heal this person." They're praying for you.

L-295 Lord Jesus, I pray, God, that You'll send Your power and Spirit upon this audience, upon this little woman here, Lord, with this mask over her face. I pray that You'll heal them, Lord. May the Devil, the storms, be quietened, and the power of God take over this audience and cast out every evil power and unbelief. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
