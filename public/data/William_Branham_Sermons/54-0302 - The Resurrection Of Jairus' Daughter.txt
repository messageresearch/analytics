--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening, friends. It's a great privilege for me to be here tonight, in this valley of the sunshine, to represent to this audience of believers, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in the way of praying for the sick, manifestation of His Being. And we pray that God will do the exceedingly abundantly tonight, greater and for His glory, than any time in the services past. It certainly has been a wonderful two days of service that we have already had. I was thinking today, that the best that I can remember, the tide of spiritual enthusiasm is riding higher in Phoenix than any time I've ever seen it, even to the time that I was here first. See? It's seemingly that you're on the verge of a great revival. I pray to God that it'll begin now. There's two great pla--outstanding, pouring-out places in the city tonight, that I know of, two evangelistic meetings, many churches that's praying.

L-2 I'll tell you a little secret. You might not know it, but it's true. There's two women that's hid away (Christian women). And they won't appear until the end of the meeting. That's never eating or nothing, praying for me in this platform, will be in there seven days now, a praying for this meeting. That's what does it. God res... Bless their gallant souls. Fasting and praying that God will give us victory... He will certainly do it. He will be obligated to do it, if we'll just ask Him and believe that He will. Tonight, I'm happy tonight to have with me again, Brother Jack Moore and Brother Young Brown, who was my first associates to be with me here in Phoenix the first time I come. And they're certainly two gallant brothers. I don't say that because they're standing here. And you know what I'd say any time. Men that has meant much to me in my life and my spiritual career, men who believe God to the fullest extent, believe that He's able and willing and will do anything that need to be did... Anything that His people will desire and ask, He will do it. And that gives me a lot of consolation.

L-3 I'm wondering where the little Spanish choir is. I told Brother Moore today that they sang for us the other night. And I tell you; it would... We'd sure like to get a--a picture of those doing that. I told them they'd increased a little and gotten better in their singing, the little girls and boys in the choir. And it's certainly marvelous. We appreciate it. Just as I was brought in, just now, Brother Moore come back and said, "Two ladies was just singing," said, "sound like you was in heaven out here." Ah, that's wonderful. I... When I get across on the other side... I've always told people if you want to look for me, why, right where the waters, the sea of Life comes out from under the throne, you know... When it goes down this way and turns eastward, and right across over on that big bank, the angelic choir sets there. They sing all the time, 'cause there's no night. They're singing, all these fine voices of this earth that's gathered around there singing praise to the Lamb on His throne. I'll be setting right across on the other side, listening at them. So you--you can hunt me right there. That's where you'll find me.

L-4 I just want to set down under that evergreen tree and just relax a few thousand years, just to look it all over. Won't that be wonderful? That may sound mythical, but it may not be just that way. But anyhow, by God's grace, I want to be there. Yes, I want to be there. And I believe that by His grace, unmerited grace, that I have of my own--that's none of my own, that He gave me, by no merits that I had to present, I'll be there. "For those that He has called, He has chosen. And those that He has--that He... Those who He called, He justified. And those who He justified, He hath glorified (already). And when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting." Amen. Right in the presence of His beings tonight, in His sight we are already glorified: "Those who He justified, He hath (past tense) glorified." And what makes you a Christian, is because--and long for that perfection, is because the perfection's laying right out there, that other glorified body. When this one is moved out of, you move into that one. Isn't that marvelous? What are we scared about then? We just believe, and then the Master of all it said, "All things 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min work together for good to them that love God." Nothing can harm us. Just as peaceful as little children playing around. Just... We got a heavenly Father Who watches over us. And whatever He sees that we have need of, He just presents it to us.

L-5 I used to have to shift for myself. But since I found Him to be my Father, why, He--He does it for me. I found out this in my twenty-one years of experience of preaching the Gospel: any job that's too big for my Lord to attack, what's the use of me trying it? I just let Him have it, so... See? Just commit it to Him. He promised to take care of me. When opposition comes, I just commit it to Him. 'Cause He said He would do it for me. And if He can't do it, I know there's no need of us trying it. So we just live peacefully and go on. He brings it out all right. No need of getting all fretted up and stewing about it. Why, He's just going to make it all right. Amen. I love Him for that, don't you? Let's read some out of His precious Word, so I won't be late in the service tonight. The reason I read from His Word each time, is because that I know... To this audience, the purchase of His Blood, if I read one sentence out of His Word here, if you don't get no more than that, you'll be blessed by coming here.

L-6 And what I read here is His Word. It will never change; It'll never pass away. It's eternally right. Mine may fail, 'cause I'm just a man, speak like any other man, make mistakes and everything. But when He speaks, mark His Words; it's the truth. See? And this is His Word. Primarily this is--this is the Foundation. And every church, every borned-again person is built upon this Foundation, Jesus Christ, the Chief Cornerstone. And He's the Gate, the Door of entrance to all eternal blessings. He is the Gate, the Door to the sheepfold. And this Bible is His Word. And if a man, woman, or whoever, speaks anything to be truth that's contrary to the contents of this Bible, it's wrong. That's right. It's absolutely wrong. But if the man speaks, and it's backed up by this Bible, then it's truth. Every word of it's true.

L-7 And I have tried by God's help to make the ministry that the Lord Jesus... to present it to the people upon a solid basic foundation, God's Eternal Word. It's got to be here. If I come and told you that--that God gave me power to go and make the blind to see and the deaf to hear, that would be contrary to His Word. See? If I told you that--that you'd touch the pole there and you'd get well, that's contrary to His Word. See? But when I come preaching the Gospel, the Gospel is the good news that Jesus has come and has redeemed us, died in our stead, and is ascended up and setting at the right hand of the majesty of God, making intercessions on our confessions, that's the Gospel. See? He's making what? Intercessions on our confessions.

L-8 No matter how weak, how sick, how far in sin, whatever the condition is, He's there to make intercession upon what we confess that He has did for us. And anything that was included in the Atonement... "wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace upon Him, with His stripes we were healed," any of those things, those attributes of His death that we take in our heart and believe to be the truth and confess that He has done it, before He ever--we feeled anything about it, He's before God to make it right, to make intercession. If I was paralyzed, and in my heart I believe He healed me, I'd confess that I was healed. If I couldn't move a--a muscle I'd--and I believed it, I'd confess that I was healed. And then according... If I mean that from my heart, not just mentally upset, but from my heart if I mean that, before God He's making intercessions upon my confession. That's right. And He has to bring it to pass. Just think of that.

L-9 Now, in His Presence... See? Hebrews 3:1 said, "He's the High Priest of our profession." Profess and confess is the same words. Profess anything or confess anything, "confess" means "to say the same thing." If God said, "By His stripes we're healed," then I say, "By His stripes I was healed." He said, "He bore my sins," I say, "He bore my sins." I don't have them any more; He bore them. He said He healed me when He died for me at Calvary with stripes. I'd say, "He healed me there. I believe it right now and accept it." That settles it. And now, no matter how I feel, how that they--they--it looks... If I'd say, "Well now, look. You say you're healed and look right, look at your body." That don't have a thing to do with it, not one thing. God's done said so. It ain't what I can see; it's what I believe. 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min

L-10 When I was so sick, that I couldn't hold a mouthful of food on my stomach, the best doctors in the nation that examined me, said, "It's impossible for him to get well." And I read God's Word. And I asked God to help me. And I eat corn bread, beans, and onions. And I took a big mouthful, and my mother got scared and called the doctor. I swallowed them, and when I'd swallow, they come right back up again. I held my hand over my mouth. Oh, no. Can't do that. God's done said so. And I swallowed it back; it come back; I swallowed it again, just kept on till it stayed down. I got me another mouthful and kept on like that. Day after day, walking down the street and I'd have to hold my hand against my stomach, it was hurting so bad, praising God for my healing. Tears running down my eyes and such sulfur--suffered so bad. Some of them would say, "How you feel, Mr. Branham?" I'd say, "Just wonderful. Praise the Lord. I'm healed." "You're healed?" I'd say, "Yes, sir. Praise the Lord, I'm healed." Just like gall. Why?

L-11 Somebody said, "You lied, Brother Branham." No, I never. I believe that when Jesus died, He healed me. And I accepted it. It had to be so. I wasn't confessing what I felt; I was confessing what I believed. I believe His Word was eternally the truth; it couldn't pass away. It was absolutely the truth. And I--my feelings had nothing to do with it. That's right. That's the way I accept Him for my salvation. I'm not saved tonight because I feel happy. That's not the reason I'm saved. I'm not saved because I shout. I'm not saved because I spoke with tongues. That don't make me saved. I'm saved tonight, because I met God's conditions of His Bible. That's right. God said so, and that's my faith. I believe I'm saved because I done what He said. Jesus said, "Whosoever hear... He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me has Everlasting Life and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to life." I believe it. I've accepted on those basis. That settles it. I'm saved. Satan could beat me around the stump with my feelings. A drunk man could come in and say, "I feel just as good as you do." He probably does. But he hasn't got the faith in the thing that I got. See? I'm saved, because--not because I feel like it. I'm saved because I've met God's requirement. And you're healed the same way.

L-12 As I often quoted this little story, one of the greatest things--enemies that God has--or the human race has (and God's... all your enemy is His enemy, of course) is fighting time. A man says, "Show me, I'll believe it. I can't believe it unless I see it. Seeing is believing." You've heard that. Just let me show you what an error that is. (Come here, Brother Brown.) Let me show you an error. A man's standing before me, a little taller than I am, with a blue suit and a blue tie on. How many believes that? Sure, all that can see knows that's true. Now, that's the way I know he's there. Well, I know he's there now, and I can't see him. Then seeing is not believing, is it? How do I know he's there? I can feeled him, is that right? Then seeing is not believing. You want to argue with me he's not there? That's... I got just as much confidence that he's there, if he was and I was looking at him. See? Because he's there; I feeled him. Now it's impossible for me to feel him, he's out of my reach. But he's there because I see him. (Thank you.) See, taste, feel, smell and hear, God gave men those things to contact his earthly home. But by faith you believe God.

L-13 Now, what is faith? "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." You'd say, "That shirt is white." Yes. Well now, if your faith says that you're going to be healed (just as sure as you're... just as true to you and just as real that your sight says that's white) there's no need of being prayed for, you're already healed. That's it. You can go home, so you're going to get well. You can't keep from it. See? It's not just a emotional; it's not something mystic; it's a facts, a truth. Sight will fail. Faith... Everything else will fail but faith. Faith can't fail (See?), because it goes into the supernatural realms and it can't fail. Now, the Lord bless you. Dwell upon these things while I read a chapter out of His Bible here and maybe pass a few comments, for the next fifteen minutes or so. Then we'll have the prayer line. Keep your minds on this. God's Word will never fail. No matter how you... If you accepted death setting there, crippled up in that chair, if you accept the teachings of the 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min Lord Jesus and accept Him as your Healer and if you're rolled out of here tonight in that chair, the same thing, that won't have one thing to do with it, you'll still get well. You have to.

L-14 Many people think that symptoms... When they see symptoms, that--that's what they look at. You can't be saved on what you see. You've got to be saved on what you believe. Is that right? You're not saved by feelings; you're not healed by feelings. Why, when I was first converted and received the Holy Spirit, the devil beat me harder than he ever did. I still believed I had the Holy Ghost. Because I had met God's requirements. And God gave me the Holy Ghost and I know He did. See? Now, that's the same thing. Now, we take for instance, like a fellow in the Bible (I'll give you just this before we read). There was a man in the Bible who really had an awful case of symptoms. And that was a fellow named Jonah. The Lord told him to do something and he didn't do it, then he backslid. And he got out on the sea, and the sea was all roaring and going on, and--and the ship was about to sink because there was a backslidden minister on the--the ship.

L-15 And he confessed that he was the guilty one. Didn't want the whole congregation to perish with him. So they tied his hands behind him and threw him out of the ship. God was determined to have His Word preached just the same. And there was a big fish or whale swallowed up Jonah. And the fish when he prowls through his wa--the waters until he finds what he's... food. Then he goes down to the bottom and rests his swimmers on the bottom of the sea. Feed your goldfish and watch them do the same. Well now, look at this preacher now. He was on a stormy sea, backslid, hands tied behind him, in the belly of a whale, in the bottom of the sea. Talk about symptoms, he had them. If he looked this a way, it was a whale's belly. He looked back this a way, it was a whale's belly. Perhaps setting up, down there in that whale's belly. And the seaweeds wrapped around his neck in the vomit of the whale. He... Everywhere he looked it was a whale's belly. And he's worse off than anybody in here tonight. Well, he looked at all that, but he... What did he say? "They're lying vanities." He said, "Once more will I look to Your temple, Lord."

L-16 'Cause when Solomon dedicated that temple, and the Pillar of Fire went in behind that temple and settled down; Solomon asked God if His people got in trouble anywhere and would look towards that temple and pray, then for Him to hear from heaven. And Jonah believed that--that God heard Solomon's prayer. And you know what? God kept him alive for three days and nights and brought him right back and loosed him, and put him in Nineveh to preach the Gospel. Now Jonah, under those circumstance, could refuse to see the whale's belly, could refuse to see his backslidden condition, but with faith looked beyond that stormy sea, his backslidden condition, the depth of the water, the whale, his conditions and where he was, and say, "I'll look to Your holy temple."... And God delivered him upon that faith in that earthly temple, how much more ought to you--tonight, to refuse to see your stomach trouble, heart trouble, whatever it is, and look beyond the veil yonder, where Jesus Christ sets at the right hand of the majesty of God, with His bloody garments waving back and forth, making intercessions upon your confessions. My. Just refuse to see any of it. The devil brought it to you. Just throw it right back in his face and walk away from it. Just refuse to have it. That's what we got to do. Is that right?

L-17 In the Scripture now, in Luke the 8th chapter and the 50th verse. And when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole. How we bow our heads while we talk to the Author of this Scripture. Kind heavenly Father, we approach Thee in the Name of Thy beloved Child, Jesus, to thank Thee for the blessings that Thou has given to us, we unworthy people. And Thou has redeemed us altogether by grace. By election of God Thou has called us into this blessed hope that we have tonight in Christ Jesus. And we thank Thee for it. And now, as we're gathered here tonight in this lovely, big city, we pray that You'll come down into our midst. There's no building on earth worthy for You to step in. There's no people worthy for You to speak to. But Thou has not considered that. You've come to the poorest, to the low, the ignorant, the outcast, and we thank Thee, for we're so glad that You're a 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min God like that. What could we do if You were haughty and indifferent? But Thou art not--not that kind of a Father. You're sweet and loving, forgiving. And that just makes us love You that much more. Now Father, You don't beat us as the cruelty of a serpent, but You love us as the love of Father can only love. Forgive us, Lord, we are all guilty of sin and indifference towards Thee. And let Thy Blood atone for us tonight. And in these next few words, circumcise the lips of the speaker and the hearts of the hearer, that Jesus Christ may be exalted before the audience, for we ask it in His Name. Amen.

L-18 Our text is dealing tonight, of course, with the resurrection of the--of Jairus' daughter. Our kind, loving Saviour had spent much time just before this. He was busy all the time, moving from place to place, crossing seas, stilling waves, giving maniacs their right mind. He was always busy about the Father's business. He was a very humble Son in obedience even to death. Night before that or two, He'd crossed the sea, and the disciples had been very weary; and He had stilled the sea for them, crossed all the way over into Gadara, where there was a maniac, taking the chance of crossing the stormy sea, when the devils of the sea swore they drowned Him that night. But He went over there at the cry of one person. One poor maniac lost his mind, perhaps a good man one time, walked upright before God but probably got in the wrong crowd. Might be started drinking or something, lost his mind. And he lived out in the tombs, where the demons lived. Put him in chains, and he had supernatural powers. He'd break those chains and jump on men and beat them and kill them if he could, when they come by. And that poor fellow, maybe he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere, praying for him. Jesus crossed the sea all the way over into Gadara, to give mercy to one man. He'd do the same tonight. Where one humble soul is calling to Him, He'd cross seas or leave the heavens to answer that prayer. It's the same Jesus yesterday, today, and forever.

L-19 He went up on a mount prior to this time, and He watched the little ship as it went out into the ocean. The disciples had left the shore. And they left without Him. They got in trouble. You know, did you ever watch that? If you and I leave without Jesus, we're going to get in trouble too. The devil is going to set a trap for us just as soon as we get out from under that shelter of His protection. The devil set a trap for Him--for the disciples. But here's the lovely part, though they had left without Him, He climbed upon the mountain and was watching them. I like that. He's climbed upon the ramparts of glory tonight, watching us. His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me. He said even a sparrow couldn't fall to the ground without the Father knowing it. How much does He know that this man's in a wheelchair and that little baby laying there, the lady setting here suffering with cancer and so forth? How He knows those things, knows all things. He's just as concerned as He can be. He knows all things.

L-20 And then when He came to them... We'll notice over at the other shore, there's a--a little fellow by the name of Jairus. And he was a nice little man. I believe that Jairus was a secret believer. He didn't want people to know about it. There's a lot of people like that in Phoenix tonight, that they'd be right here in this meeting if the pastor wouldn't put them out of church Sunday, for coming. That's right. They believe it. But they're afraid. Jairus believed too, but he was afraid. He believed. And when he heard about Jesus, the things that was done, He was different from any other man. He knowed that was God's Servant, God's Son. He knowed He had to be more than a man. And he believed the ministry, though he was all bound up with a organization that he couldn't move. For they'd strictly said that any man that hears this fanatic is--just might as well take your church papers and go on. Because you're going to be put out of the synagogue, considered a heretic. So you know, anybody that's deep sincere like Jairus, sometimes God has to work things around to make them to be a believer and come out and confess some things. Don't you believe that? He does.

L-21 He had one little daughter, and she was about twelve years old. She took sick. As most all men would do, they called the doctor, I guess. And the doctor looked the child over and said, "Well, perhaps I'll give her a round of medicine." 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min And the next day he come back, and the child was worse and grew worse all the time. I'd imagine Jairus, way back down in the gable end of his soul, he thought, "Wonder where Jesus is? If I have to have Him, you know..." That's the way a lot of people think though. That's right. "I--I really believe it, but I... For my social prestige, I just can't confess it like that." The world's full of them tonight. Looking to men, scared of men. "Don't fear men who can kill the body, but fear Him who can kill both body and soul." Don't care what the people says.

L-22 There is a many peoples have...?... in town and found tonight riding around in big nice Cadillac cars and things, up-to-date in what's called in the social ranks of the world, would love to be enjoying the--the experience of some of these poor dear people setting in here tonight, maybe don't even know where their meal will come from tomorrow. They'd like to do it. But for their social standing... See what a curse money is and riches. No wonder Jesus said, "Scarcely a rich man can enter the gates of heaven." Like the camel going through the eye of the needle, has to unload his burdens and get on his knees and crawl under. He can get there, but he has to unload first.

L-23 Jairus... That finally that the hour had come when the doctor had walked out and told Jairus, said, "Jairus, you're a priest here at the temple and a fine man. I've liked you, and I been your doctor for many years (Perhaps he said these words.), but I hate to tell you, but your child is going to die." "Oh, my. Going to die?" "Yes." And all the people begin weeping. Now, the hour had come for action, not "Wait till I see Jesus again," or "Wait till a convenient time," or "Some night I'll slip over and listen at Him." But time come for action. If there ever was a time come for action, it's now. The midnight hour has come. You've got to act. "I've got to get to Him." Perhaps somebody had already told him that Jesus was coming. Did anybody ever tell you that? "Jesus is coming." At the same time, He was crossing the sea, getting to him. God always puts His men there just at the right time. Just... If you believe Him. Is that right?

L-24 So I can see him get his little coat, and throw it on him, and pull his hat down or whatever he had, and start off down the street. I can hear some of his members say, "Where are you going?" "I'm going to find Jesus." "Well now, looky here. Don't you disgrace our church, to fool with such a fanatic as that. Do you not know the high priest has said he will put all those out? Now, at the next general council, we'll put you out, little church." That still exists too. "We'll have our next meeting; we'll see that we get another pastor. We just can't stand that kind of stuff in our church." But Jairus had a need. His baby was laying dying. The doctor had done all he could do. He must contact God. When a man gets desperate like that, he's going to find something. Hallelujah. That's where I had to get one time. A desperate moment, when Mayo's looked me in the face and said, "He's just got a few minutes to live." I got desperate. And I found Him. I'm not condemning Jairus; I'm one with him. I'm just glad I found Him. That's right.

L-25 When he--little Jairus started down the street, he didn't care if they put him out of the council or whatever... Say wait, I believe there is a Pentecostal organization called Council. I don't mean that council, but I mean any council, well, whatever it is. Yes, sir. All right. He said now... He started down. He didn't care whether he lost his church, whether he lost every friend he had. He had one alternative, that was find Jesus. Somebody told him Jesus was coming, so he went to find out. And I see the little old ship, or little boat, and the disciples a pulling, Jesus setting in the back with His head down. Moved into the willows and I hear the willows parting as the little boat got to the shore. And Simon Peter jumps out and grabs a hold of the rope and wraps it around a tie post somewhere.

L-26 Up on the hill set a little woman, knitting. Said, "I wonder what's all the discouragement, all the upset about down there?" She looked down. Some of them said, "You know that Healer? He's come to our town. That's Him down there. Don't go down now." But 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min that poor little woman had had a blood issue for many years. She'd sold all she had, give it to the doctors and none of them could help her. They couldn't stop the issue of blood. She said, "If that Man is the Son of God, Who He claims to be, I won't have to have Him to pray for me. I'll go down there and just touch the border of His garment, and I'll get well." That's right. "I'll just touch His garment, and I'll be well." In other words, "If I can make some kind of a contact, I'll get well." And I see her coming, pale-faced, withered up, laid her knitting down. And here she comes down the hill. There stood the priest saying, "Where are you going?" "I'm going to meet this Man, Jesus." "Do you realize that we'll put you out of the church?" "I don't care." And away she went. Right on through them.

L-27 Here stood another man saying, "Do you know the days of miracles is past? Don't you know I'm a teacher of the Scripture? We haven't had miracles since the death of the last prophet. Well, we don't have no miracles. Them days is past. Moses did miracles, but this guy is just a fanatic. It's just a bunch of psychology. That's all it is." I can just see her, they said, "You cannot go." I can see her ducking her little head down, and just crawl between their legs, and go right on anyhow. She wanted to get to Jesus. For she said, "If I can get to Him, I'll touch Him, and I'll get well." That's it. That's something. And away she went. Jesus, everybody around Him like that, and she crawled up behind Him. And she touched His garment. And when she touched His garment, He stopped. Looked around over the audience, "Something happened." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He will do the same thing here. Just touch Him one time and see. Looked around, said, "Daughter, thy faith has made thee whole." Amen. This is not hid; it's in the Bible. See? "Thy faith has saved thee." And the woman felt in her body that the blood issue had stanched--stopped.

L-28 Little Jairus had met Him and said, "Master, my little girl is laying at the point of death. Won't You come heal her?" And He said, "I'll go." Said, "Come, lay Your hands on her." Now, that was his point of contact, to lay hands on. The woman, her point of contact was touch His garment. "According to your faith, be it unto you." Here he goes. They're walking along. And I imagine little Jairus' heart beating heavy anyhow. Looked around and see who all is around him. All of them standing around, saying, "Isn't that Jairus? Isn't that our--one of our local pastors here in the city? Why, here he's having a... I bet He's come to skip for his girl, 'cause we've heard she's been sick a while. Wait till the next council, we'll fix that guy. We'll put him out. We'll learn him how to believe these fanatics. Mmm, hmm. We'll take care of him."

L-29 And I can see little Jairus, he didn't care. He'd already contacted Jesus. A man once contact Jesus, he's a different man. That's right. Oh, he was smiling. He didn't care. There stood all the priests. "Good evening, brethren." Walk on, he didn't care. Not a bit of red in his face. He'd contact Jesus. Looked over and seen Jesus, "It's all right now. He's going up to my house." And brother, when Jesus comes to your house, everything's all right then. Amen. That's all. "Coming up to my house." Well, Satan always does these things, you know, like this. And about that time, here come a little fellow, perhaps with ashes on his head. Which was a sign in those days, in the Orients, as a sign of message of sorrow, said, "Don't trouble the Master. Your daughter is already dead." Then the blow came. I can see little old Jairus' heart skip a beat. And he looked around and he started to scream. And he looked over towards Jesus; I can see Him slowly turn His head, "Don't--don't fear. Only believe." That's all right. His heart started back beating normal again. As long as Jesus said, "Only believe," that settled it with him. He knowed he was a believer. Straightened up, swallowed a few times to get his heart back in the right place, started walking on. Jesus said, "Didn't I say if you'd believe, you'd see the glory of God?" Moving on... 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min

L-30 Come on down at the house, and here the people was out in the yard a screaming and a carrying on. "There comes our pastor with that fanatic." I can hear some of them say, "If your doctor has said there's nothing can be done for the girl, you ought to have knowed not to fool around with them fanatics. If your doctor said nothing can be done, nothing can be done." But he was wrong. Though he'd done his best, not disregarding him. And many times he's wrong today too. He's just a man like I am and you are. Said, "If your doctor you know her now... The girl is dead and she is laying in there. And now you've brought disgrace to her church. The girl's already dead, and she's laying in there. Now, you've got Him over here, and there she's dead, died while He was coming. What a disgrace you've brought on our church." That didn't bother Jairus. He moved right on. Jesus don't--had done said, "Only believe." "In my heart" he says, "I believe. Jesus told me if I'd believe I'd see something. I'm believing. I'm going on." That's the way to do it.

L-31 I can see some of his neighbors run out and say... Why, they wanted him to move out of the neighborhood, perhaps. But he went right on in. There the people... And Jesus said, "Give peace--or place. Why all this to-do? Why screaming and weeping? Don't do that." Said, "The girl's not dead; she sleepeth." Well, they said, "Now we know He's crazy. We know He's a fanatic now. We know the Man don't know what He's talking about. Because we know she's dead. We've embalmed her and laid her out on that couch, put the flowers around her. We know she's dead." But Jesus knew better. Hallelujah. Don't make any difference what the people says; it's what Jesus said. Make any difference what mama said; it's what Jesus said. Don't make any difference what the pastor says; it's what Jesus said. Don't make any difference what Brother Branham said; it's what Jesus said. Make any difference what the doctor said; it's what Jesus said. He said, "Only believe."

L-32 So Jesus put them all out of the house. You know, that's a pretty good lesson right there. Those who wouldn't believe Him got put out. I imagine there'd be a whole lot of that at the Resurrection, don't you imagine so? He put them out. Said, "Get them out." And He took the ones who really believed. I can see Jairus... stepped over in the corner and said, "Now, mother, act nice. This is Him. This is the One the prophets has all spoke of. And He told me not to fear. And, mother, in my heart since I've met Him, something has happened." I can hear mother say, "You know what? When I looked at Him, something happened to me." Amen. That's it. Only get in contact with Him. That's all. Said, "Why?" The others didn't have any needs. These had a need. It's just those who have a need gets in contact. Said, "I believe Him. I've--I've never heard Him say no more than, 'Give peace.' That's all I've heard Him say. But something... Peace entered me. And I believe with you."

L-33 I can see Jesus looked around and say, "Now, father and mother, you come with Me. And Peter, James and John, you come too (Faith, hope and charity.). You come along with Me." And they went into the room, put all the outsiders out. There He was standing there and the outside wall around Him. "The very audacity. That fanatic. I'm a priest and He put me out of the building." Don't make any difference who you are. You're just a man in the sight of God. That's all. You might have a lot of social prestige and have D.D.'s hung on your name, but that don't make you no more than bootlegger that was converted about a hour ago. That's right. He said, "Well, look who I am. I've got a social standing. I'm a red scholar and He put me out." Such a wall, but it was on the outside.

L-34 And Jesus was possessed with all the fine qualities of God. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. When everything was failed around here, He was possessed with a power that He could speak in another tongue. He called in unknown tongues, "Tabitha..." out like that. And that girl's soul that had done sailed out to eternity yonder, returned back into her body. Hallelujah. Took her by the hand, (course, her blood being taken from her, being embalmed) said, "She's weak now, give her 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min something to eat." Oh, my. What a Holy Ghost meeting in that house. I can see little old Jairus' eyes a sparkling, saying, "Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?" Out into the rooms, out into the street, everywhere else. Tell everybody. "Didn't I tell you?" See? "Fear not. Only believe. All things are possible to them that believe."

L-35 No matter what the circumstance is, what papa says, what mama says, we're believing what God said. And the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8, that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? Then if He's the same, He cannot be a dead Christ and be as He was then. So if He was alive, He walked on the shores of Galilee. He was alive. He was--not when He walked on the shores of Galilee, He walked on Galilee. Like it was on the shores. Well, He's risen from the dead, and He lives tonight, not in body form here on earth, but in spiritual form, the Holy Ghost. It was made manifest in flesh in order to take away sin. "But a little while" He said, "and the world will see Me no more." Me. Pronoun, personal pronoun. "Yet a little while and the world (of the unbelievers, like that was around Jairus' house that day) will see Me no more. Yet ye shall see Me..." Who's ye? The Church. Why, you say, "His disciples." Oh, no. "Ye shall see Me" (listen at the rest of it) for I (another personal pronoun) will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." That group of people has been gone two thousand years, but He's still in this group of people. And when this group cease, He will be in another group of people. Is that right? He will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-36 You can touch Him till He will turn. Is that right? He's the same Lord Jesus. He's the same One that said, "Only believe," even in the face of death, He said, "Only believe." Believe what? Believe for the impossible. The doctor's done said... The girl, she might have died with cancer, for all I know. I couldn't tell you what she died with but she was dead. No matter what she died with, she was dead. The girl was already... As soon as the--anyone died, immediately they embalmed their bodies, taken them out and buried them about a hour or two later. And then from the distance, the more Jesus had to come, it had probably been more than that couple of hours since she had died. And when Jesus got to her, to where she was laying there, Jairus had to believe for the impossible. But impossible melts away like a snowball on a hot red stove when Jesus Christ speaks. They... You're--you're scares just settle down. Jairus' heart moved steady as he walked up there knowing that Christ told him these Words and he believed.

L-37 Peter asked Him one night, said, "If it be You, bid me come to You on the water." Jesus said, "Come." That's all Peter had to hear, "Come." He jumped out of the boat and started running to meet Him. And even on His road, when fear come, he saw the big waves, big whitecaps bursting probably as high as this building, he got scared. And as soon as he got scared... See, he got his mind off of what Christ said, "Come." He got scared. He got his eyes on the symptoms and he begin sinking. Now, you take this in your heart tonight, that Jesus said this, "Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe you receive them, and you shall have them. It'll be given to you." And He said, "If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto Me. The things that I do, shall you also, greater, because I go to My Father." He did not claim to be a Healer. He only claimed to do just as God showed Him by vision. Jesus spoke and said He did nothing except God first showed Him what to do. The Man cannot lie for He was God. See? He said, in Saint John 5:19, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing that doeth the Son likewise." Well, if the Son has resurrected and said, "The things that I do shall you do also, for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world," then the Son of God lives in His Church to perform the same things that He did when He was here on earth. If He will come tonight and bless our gathering together and will perform the same things that He did when He was here on earth, will you accept Him as your Saviour and as your Healer? May God bless you while we talk to Him in prayer. (If the sister will come to the organ.) Here's some handkerchiefs to be prayed over. Now, with one accord, 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min bowed hearts before the Maker...

L-38 Kind heavenly Father, we approach Thee to thank Thee for this written Word. To realize what a supreme sacrifice has been paid that we could have this Word tonight... It's the most persecuted Book in all the world and yet the greatest seller of all literature that was ever written. It's the--it is the absolute one Book that every Word is infallible. And these things, we believe with all of our heart. In the contents of this Book it is written, that from the body of Saint Paul was taken handkerchiefs and aprons to the sick. And evil spirits went out of them, and diseases, and they were healed. Because they seen that Paul was sent from You. They seen him have visions, and what he said come to pass, and they believed him. And they believed that whatever he touched was blessed. And they'd taken off of his body, handkerchiefs and aprons. And, dear God, as long as this Bible is read here on earth, I believe there will be somebody who will have that kind of faith. And tonight, I'm thankful to be speaking to a group of them people that believes it just the same today. And I lay hands upon these handkerchiefs, because the people has brought them in faith.

L-39 Realize, we're not Saint Paul. But You're still the same Jesus. And it was You, Lord, that the people were looking to, in Your servant, Paul the apostle. Paul's hands was like any other man's. But their respects to You through him, knowing that You were chosen, that he was chosen of You, and they feared God. And I pray now, that You will bless these handkerchiefs and when they're laid upon the sick and afflicted, may the evil spirits go out of the people. That poor old mother waiting tonight, and that little sick baby, waiting for these handkerchiefs, when it's laid upon them, may they rise and be made well. Send the Holy Spirit, Lord. May He come into our midst, just now, and reproduce to we the believers tonight, not because that He'd have to do it, but for a confirmation of His Word, which we believe. Saying, "The things that I do shall you also." May He come tonight and confirm that Word with signs and wonders, great outstanding miracles. May He Who stood by Paul and Silas, stand by us tonight, spreading forth His great arms of glory over this building. And may the power of God catch every heart, just now. And may there not be a feeble one among us when we leave. And as we go, may we say like those from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" May You do something like You did that night. You done something in a way You did it, and no other man could do it just the way You did, breaking that bread.

L-40 And now, Father, in this prayer line tonight, do something that they'll know that no other Man can do it but You. And then we'll go away with the same blessings, to rejoice, to join with the rest of the people in this city and say, "Our hearts burned within us." "Come, see the Man that told me all things that I ever done," like the Samaritan woman. And we'll bow our heads humbly and give Thee praise. For we ask it in the Name of Thy beloved Son, Jesus. Amen.

L-41 What was it you told me, prayer card? M. That's the same we had last night, we're still in M's tonight. I think we had the last part of them last night, if I remember right. Last part of M's. I didn't think, or at least they told me... when I leave the building, that anointing, and you... there's no need of me trying to explain it, there's just no way of doing it. You just feel like you're--you're stepping off the world somewhere; and you can't walk and... "Oh," you say, "Brother Branham, I don't believe that." I know there's a little doubt about it, but that don't change it a bit; just the same. I want to ask you something. When I make those statements, I--I feel that people wonder about that. They... Look, all prophets, seers, poets, inspired people, always are considered by the world, neurotics. I believe Stephen Foster was the greatest folk song writer America ever had. Many of you know Stephen Foster's literature, "The Old Folks At Home," "Swanee River," "Old Kentucky Home." That old Kentucky home is just across the river from where I live. One day setting there, not long ago, at his desk where... valued, I forget, at how many thousand dollars years ago, where he wrote that famous song, "My Old Kentucky Home." I was setting there looking at his picture, and it's supposed to be an Angel that touched him, give him his inspiration, fine looking man. In the Suwannee hotel, not long ago, when I was with E. Stanley Jones, down in Florida, I was thinking the same thing. 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min I thought, "Mr. Foster, you had it in the head but not the heart." He would get up in inspiration. He was borned under that sign for a writer. You can't do it. It's a gift of God. You...

L-42 So when the inspiration would be on him, he'd write a song. Then when it left him, not knowing God in the way of salvation and power, he would--he would come out of it, and he'd--he--he wouldn't know what to do. He'd go out and get on a drunk. And finally, he come out from under it one day and had a servant to bring him a razor and he committed suicide. Not long ago, when Brother Moore... I'm not sure... I believe Brother Moore... Yes. Brother Moore was with me in England. We stood by the grave of William Cowper, that famous poet that wrote that lovely song, "There Is A Fountain filled with Blood," drawn from Immanuel's veins, when sinners plunge beneath the flood, lose all their guilty stains. When he wrote that song and come out of the inspiration, he tried to find a river to commit suicide. He didn't know where he was at. In England, he was branded as a neurotic. That was poets.

L-43 Look at prophets. Look at Jonah that we was speaking of awhile ago. After he was kept alive in that whale's belly for three days and nights, come up into Nineveh and walked through that street, giving his--his--his prophecy to a city the size of St. Louis, Missouri... And he gave his prophecy with such force, till even they put sackcloth on their animals and repented. Went up on the hill and set down under a little tree, and when the inspiration left him, he prayed God to take his life. He didn't know where he was at. Look at Elijah, who went up on Mount Carmel and challenged the whole nation. "Come, prove Who's God." And stood there on that mountain that day and laughed at the prophets of Baalim. Walked out there and said, "Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known today that Thou art God and I am Your servant." And the Fire of God fell and licked up the water and took up the sacrifice. Then stood right there on... and bowed his little head between his bony body and prayed, and God sent rain on the same day. When it hadn't rained for three years and six months. Not even dew had fell.

L-44 And now, look. What a powerful man. And then run out into the wilderness at the threat of a woman. And wandered in that wilderness for forty days and nights. And when God found him, he had pulled back in a cave somewhere. Is that right? Said, "What are you doing in there, Elijah?" There you are. So don't wonder. Just remember I'm trying to base these things on the Scripture, so you'll know that what I'm telling you, everything is THUS SAITH THE LORD. It's based in the Scripture. See? So it--it hasn't been taught by theologians, of course, but the Holy Spirit is teaching it now (See?), to the people. They're finding it in their hearts. May the Lord bless.

L-45 Let's see. We've just been calling about... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... fifteen people at a time, to twenty. Let's call tonight, M... Let's start back--back towards the first. Let's begin at twenty. Let's begin at twenty tonight. Who has M-20, prayer card M-20, raise up your hand, M-20? All right lady, come over here. M-21, 22, raise up your hand. M-22? Is the prayer card here M-22? Thank you, sir. Come. M-23, 23? Is M-23 here? Would you raise up your hand, M-23? Thank you. 24, M-24, would you raise up your hand? All right. M-25, would you raise up your hand? M-25, M-26, all right. 27, 28, 29, 30, M-30? Yeah. (Don't you see M--M-30... got it?) 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35? (How many...?... Fifteen? Is that just fifteen? I believe that'd be about enough.) Now, the prayer cards are given out twice a day, given out once in the afternoon at three o'clock (between two-thirty, I guess, and three), and the next is give out between six and seven in the evening. Come for your prayer card at one of those times.

L-46 These people coming to the platform to be prayed for, there's not one speck of insur--assurance that they'll be healed. God and their faith has to... As far as healing, if you believe me to be God's servant, I tell you this and listen closely: Every person in this building is healed now. I base that on THUS SAITH THE LORD. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... as far as God is concerned. And every sinner in here is saved right now, and has been since you've sinned. But it'll never do you any good for either one, for your healing or your salvation, until you accept it as 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min your own personal property. Then it comes in effect. When I put my name on a piece of--on a deed that you all--that somebody give me, it becomes legally mine then. And Jesus Christ has give every one of you tonight, every person in here, every believer, a checkbook. And at the bottom, it's got His Name signed to it. Just fill it out, and send it in tonight, and see if He will recognize it. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. The cashiers are a little busy sometimes, but they'll get to it.

L-47 Just recently (while they're getting the line lined up over there), I was praying for a woman; two women, it was. Now, can I have your attention closely while I tell you this, so you'll understand? And now, a woman come by... Now, watch what He said. After about one or two people, I become su--kind of subconscious. I know I'm here but I'm not just... it's... you just... I just won't even try to explain it, 'cause you can't. But anyhow, the woman was told she had a--a serious stomach trouble. And watch now; I might tell you, "Go" (after I come out of the vision) say, "Go and the Lord bless you." That's me saying that. "Go and Jesus Christ make you whole." That's... Sometimes I see it turn dark around the person, and I know death is on them, and they're going to die. I never tell them that, not 'less I'm led to tell them. Because even though God could pronounce death on that person, yet their prayer could change that. I want to see if you would say "amen" to that. It did do it once.

L-48 There's a prophet by the name of Isaiah, went up and told Hezekiah that "THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're going to come--die right there. You're not coming off the bed." And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and wept bitterly, and said, "Lord, I beseech Thee to consider me. I've walked before You with a perfect heart." And he wanted fifteen years extension. And the prophet... Now, why didn't God talk--why didn't God talk to Hezekiah? He was the greatest man in the whole Israelite kingdom; is that right? He was a king. And do you believe he was talking to Jehovah? The Bible said he was. He was ta... Why didn't Jehovah talk back to him? God has ways of doing things. Instead of telling Hezekiah, Hezekiah standing face-to-face with Jehovah, saying, "Jehovah, if You'll spare me for fifteen years... Consider me, will You?" With tears running down his cheeks. "I know Your prophet has just come told me I was going to die. So I know he is a prophet, and I know what he says is Your Word. And I pray for You to spare me, because I've got something I want to do for Your Kingdom," and so forth. He reasoned it out with Him, like you would with any man. And God, instead of speaking right back to the king over His people, He stopped the prophet. Said, "Go, tell him I heard him."

L-49 Could you imagine Isaiah coming back through that crowd? Here Isaiah come walking out from the king's... There was a--the dignities standing around the gate. "What about it, great prophet of God? What about our king?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD, he's going to die." That settled it. Walked on down here at the gates and out beside of that stood the soldiers. "What do you say, prophet? What about our king?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD, he's going to die." Go on out to the poor people standing at the gate. "Oh, great prophet, what saith the Lord about our king?" "THUS SAITH THE LORD, your king is going to die." He had THUS SAITH THE LORD. And then God told him, said, "Go right back and tell him that he's not going to die." What happened? Prayer. Most powerful weapon that was ever put in the--in the... on anybody. I can see Isaiah walking back saying, "Pardon me, he's going to live. THUS SAITH THE LORD, he's going to live. THUS SAITH THE LORD." What done it? Prayer changes things, is that right?

L-50 So many times on the platform I see it turn dark; I'll just say, "Go ahead, the Lord bless you. (See?) The Lord make you well." But when you hear it speak out, "THUS SAITH THE LORD," mark that down in your book. See what happens. That's... See, I have no way... He said that. When I'm speaking, it's not me under inspiration; it's not me. It's Him, that--that Pillar of Fire that you've seen in the picture. 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min That woman was told, with this stomach trouble... (Ready? Just a moment.) The woman was told with stomach trouble, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, you're going to be well. Go eat."

L-51 And a woman come behind her, had a lump on her throat. And told her just the same, she was going to be healed. The woman, when she left the platform, she felt for her lump. It was still there. She went off the platform rejoicing. She said, "If God could inspire that person to tell me what was in my life, I'll be daresn't to disbelieve that what he said wouldn't come to pass." That's right. The Bible said, "Go ye" and what no more? "Go ye" and what? "Sin no more." What is sin? Unbelief. "Go ye and disbelieve no more, or a worse thing will come upon you." So don't even come in the line, you're not ready to believe. See? "Go ye and disbelieve no more or a worse thing will come."

L-52 The woman went home to... She tried to eat. And every time she'd eat, it would just burn her up. She couldn't do it. Weeks passed, six weeks or more. She was still believing. And one morning, her children had all went to school, and she got so hungry, and she picked up a little piece of toast and eat it. It didn't come back up. She thought, "That's strange." Real funny feeling come over her. She eat some oats. It didn't come up, so she drank a cup of coffee. It stayed down too. Why, she just felt so good, she said, "I believe I'll run down and tell my neighbor." And down the street she went with her little shawl on her down there, the little woman about in her thirties. And she run down to tell the other woman, said, "Oh sister," she started to tell her when she... to go tell her what happened, and when she knocked at the door, she heard somebody screaming. And she opened the door and run in, and there was the woman standing before her screaming at the top of her voice. The lump had just left her throat. And they come to find out...

L-53 And they followed me over to a meeting in Chicago and stood and testified, said, "What happened, Brother Branham?" "Why," I said, "do you not know that sometimes when you pray, the Angels of God can't get to you at that time." Daniel prayed one time to twenty-one days 'fore the angel could get to him. Is that right? But when God had spoke anything, it has to come to pass. What was it? The Angel of God knowed those people, knowed what God had pronounced, and He was going through that neighborhood right then, hunting them women up, performing what He said would come to pass. What if they'd disbelieved? What if they'd lost faith? See? Believe, no matter comes or goes, believe anyhow. Now, if I tell the truth, God will testify of the truth. God will never testify to an error. It'll always testify of truth.

L-54 So, may the Lord bless you while we once more... Let's sing this slowly, like this, now, "Only Believe." Let's just raise our hands and say, "Now, I believe." All together now. Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe; Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe. Grant Lord, just now, that the Word of God might be fulfilled, which was spoken by our Lord, "The things that I do shall you do also and greater for I go unto My Father." In Jesus Name I ask this. Amen. Now, be reverent. Don't move around. And do just as you're told to do. Remember that. I'm not responsible for critics. Anything that happens to a critic, I'm not responsible. To a Christian believer, yes, I am. Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God.

L-55 Now, far as I know, there's not a person in the prayer line that I know or have ever seen in my life. I don't know of any out there that I know anything of. How many in here that's sick tonight, hasn't got a prayer card, and yet you want God to heal you, raise your hand. Just ever... Why, it's just everywhere. Now, the thing I ask you to do is believe this: Believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And what He did then, the--the things that He did then, He promised that them would follow His Church until He returned again. And believe that I'm here tonight as His servant, not worthy, unmerited grace, why I'm here tonight. But by 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min sovereign grace and election of God, God has sent me as a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Then believe Him. And if a word that I would say, if I've told the truth, God will testify of the truth. That's right.

L-56 Now, I must talk to the woman. Because there's spirit all around. And I'm conscious now that the anointing of the Holy Spirit in near where I'm standing. The Angel of God that you see in the picture here, is just real close to where I am right now. And now, if Jesus of Nazareth was standing here with these clothes on, could He heal anybody? No. The only thing that He could do, would say, "I healed you when I died for you. I did everything that I could right there." But now, to this woman, if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, and He... To this woman here, He'd talk to her, like He did the woman at the well.

L-57 Why do you think Jesus talked to the woman at the well for? To contact her spirit. He said, "Bring Me a drink." She said, "Well, it's not customary for Jews to ask Samaritans such." Said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink. I'd give you waters you didn't come here to draw." And she said, "Why, the well is deep..." And the conversation went on till Jesus found where her trouble was. Said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I have no husband." Said, "Right. You got five." She run, said, "See a... Come see a Man that told me everything I've done." She said, "I perceive that You're a Prophet." See, she said, "Messiah is coming, and He will know those things. He will be able to tell us those things. I know You're a Prophet, but when Messiah comes, He will tell us all things." He said, "I am He that speaks with you."

L-58 Now, if He's the same yesterday, today and forever, and His anointing is with His Church, unworthy, yet to fulfill His Word, then talking to you would be contacting your spirit, is that right? Then you know sister, if I could do anything for you to help you and wouldn't do it, I'd be a brute. But it... Only thing that I could do would be to help you in some way, like preach the Gospel, that's the way... God's set some to preach the Gospel, some to teach the Gospel, some to play music, some to be deacons, some to speak with tongues, and some to interpret tongues, and some to--to pray for the sick, and some prophets, is that right? All those are set in the Church for what? To edify the Church, to bring the Church together. Now, we're living in the closing of this world's history. The time is at hand. The Gentile dispensation is winding up. Just like He did with the Jews, He's showing a great measure of grace to them, making His last call, so that the unbelievers will blaspheme the Holy Ghost and be worthy of the con--of the condemnation they're fixing to receive. But how blessed those will be that'll stand out and outshine the stars, that'll believe on Him, and His great works of this day.

L-59 Now, I'm not standing here to read your mind, sister. I'm only standing here to see what He will tell me. If He will tell me... We're strangers, aren't we? I guess this is our first time ever seeing each other in all the world. I don't know nothing about you and you know nothing about me. But now, if Jesus has raised from the dead, then if He was standing here (which He is), why, He would know what was wrong with you, and what you've done, and what you should do. And anything. Like He said, to Nathanael, "I saw you when you were under the tree." He believed it. Now, if God would come here to me, and us perfect strangers, and say something like that through me, the same Jesus, say something like that through me to you, you'd--you'd have to believe Him, wouldn't you? You'd have to believe Him. Well, may He grant it.

L-60 The first thing, you are--you're suffering with a--an arthritis. Isn't that right? I see you trying to get up when it's worst of ever, of a morning. You have to turn some way that's easy, to get out of the side of the bed. I see you moving out. And you're a pray-er. You try to pray then... stiffly. God bless your heart. That's the truth, isn't it? 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min Now, that wasn't me. That was Him. Now, I could do no more about it. Now, I never seen the woman, yet in a vision. The best I remember of what happened, seeing her in a vision, that she was in a room and she was trying to get out of the bed, sideways. And there's something wrong with her with stiffening in her body. Now, that's true. Now, that's just what our Master said to the woman. He found her trouble. Now, she's to believe, is that right? Well now, if I'd talk to her more, just stand and talk to her a little while, and He--He might say other things. But to save all the prayer line or something like that, well then, it just weakens you more and more.

L-61 Now, it's just the anointing, it's just begin to moving right now. See? I'll just talk to her a minute. Look here just a minute, lady. I want--I want to talk to you again just a moment for God's glory and see... I believe it was something stiffening in your body, was wrong. Do you--you... You're a believer. And you are healed of that. But it's something you've had... No. You have been. You--you've been seriously ill. I see doctors around you, some reason. It's a--it's a gland trouble, a serious... And I see them walk away shaking their heads. And they've give you a year to live. That's a... Is that right? But say, that's been long ago. You wasn't quite as gray as you are now. And it was a... Must've been about two years ago. Is that right? Is that true? You're not from this city. But you're from near here. It's a place where... It's got something like a dale or Avondale. Is that right? Return to Avondale and get well in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, thy Master.

L-62 Have faith. Believe with all your heart; you'll see the glory of God. As Jesus said, "Did not I tell you, only believe?" How do you do? Now, this would be a perfect example of the repeat of Saint John the 4th chapter. When Jesus came to a--a Samaritan woman. It was a racial affair, as they have now. The Samaritans and the--and the Jews, they had kind of a little racial affair like white and colored. But Jesus let her know quickly that God was with those who worshipped Him in Spirit and truth. The middle wall was being tore down. That's what it is today. And the same Jesus that saves me, saves you. The same heaven is open for all tribes of the earth. That's right. There's no middle wall of partition. And we stand this night, as it was then. And you stand... And I stand as His servant to represent Him to you, in a way of increasing your faith for your healing. And I trust that God will do something that'll increase your faith so you--that you'll get healed and be made well.

L-63 But I see now, I see a--a boy and a girl. It's a--it's a brother and a sister. And there's something has happened to them. They're--they're away from you. It's in an institution. It's a mental condition. And they're in another country: California. Is that right? Come here. O God, Who created the heavens and earth, let it be known tonight that Thou art God, and I pray that You'll deliver those people from the powers of Satan. And I pray that You'll grant it. And in Jesus Christ' Name, may it be done. Amen. God bless you, sister. You believe with all your heart and you shall have what you've asked for. Amen. Have faith in God. Believe with all your heart and God will grant it.

L-64 Was that your friend that held your pocketbook? What do you think about that, lady? You think that's wonderful? You do. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? You're suffering too, aren't you? If I can tell you what's wrong with you by the power of God, will you accept God's Son as your Healer? You have gallbladder trouble, is that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. Then stand up on your feet and be made well in the Name of Jesus Christ. Have faith. Jesus Christ, the Son of God raised from the dead. You say, "You read that woman's mind." Well then, Jesus perceived their thoughts. He did the same thing then, didn't He? Amen. Have faith in God. Believe God.

L-65 (Is this the patient, Brother Moore?) Come here, sir. Suppose we're strangers to each other. We do not know one another. But you're a believer; I can tell it just as soon as you come here. Your faith is welcoming to me. I know you're a Christian. If you're a Christian and my brother, I'm your brother with the--by the same merit of grace, Jesus Christ. If I could heal you, I would do it. I cannot. Because that only lays in Jesus Christ. But as God's servant, with a Divine gift that was ordained of God at... When the world first started, God ordained that I should come and pack this Gospel in this last day. Believe this? God bless you. 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min You're from away from home too. You're from California: Long Beach. And you have lu--something wrong with your lungs and your liver. Ain't you got a handkerchief you want to give me from some woman? And she got heart trouble, hasn't she? Aren't you a minister of the Gospel? Take that to her in the Name of Jesus Christ and be made well. God bless you. Have faith in God. Just believe Him; He's here, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-66 Sister, you just waving your hands. Because you have been reverent to God, your arthritis has left you. Stand up on your feet. Stomp your feet up-and-down. It's all gone. The stiffness is gone from your legs. You're healed. God bless you. Let us say, "Praise God," and give Him praise. We thank Thee, heavenly Father, for the magnificent works of the Holy Ghost, which is now present to do the exceedingly abundantly, above all that we could do or think. Blessed be His Name. Amen. Oh, He is so wonderful. Just have faith. What did you jump up for just a minute, mis--awhile ago, mister? You know you were healed, didn't you? Isn't that right? Yes, sir. That's right. You had; you had a stomach trouble and a heart trouble too, isn't that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. He healed you then. God bless you. You was healed. I just wanted to confirm it to you. Now, you can home and be well. God be with you.

L-67 (Is this the patient? Uh-huh. Well Brother Moore, excuse me, I... ) All right come, lady. Do you believe me to be God's prophet--not--servant? Or whatever you want to call it? I'm just His servant, a nothing, I am. It's just Him now. I'm... I've... Well, He... It's Him. And you're--you're conscious that you're in the Presence of Something. You know it's not a man. And if I could heal you, I would do it. But I have no way of doing it. But our Lord Jesus Christ has a way of doing it. Now, look on me just a moment. And like Peter said, as he passed through the beautiful gates to the crippled man, "Look on us." Or Elijah said, to Jehoshaphat, "If it wasn't for the presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look towards you," the king of Judah--Israel.

L-68 You've had trouble. You've had an operation. And that was something in the back, like a kidney. And it wasn't successfully. They tied that kidney to something. And it was altogether a mistake. And the doctor that performed that is in an institution, mentally upset and gone. Come here. Great Jehovah God, have mercy. I pray that You will heal this woman and heal the doctor. He didn't aim to do it, Lord. I pray for them both, that through one trying to help the other, now Lord, help them both. And, Satan, you hid from the doctor but you can't hide from God. Come out of her. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may she go and be made well. God bless you, sister. Go, and may...?... Have faith. Just pray. Just believe. You can see the glory of God.

L-69 You that put up your hand there, sir, leaning up like that, you want to get over that high blood pressure? You believe that God's going to make you well? You believe that God's healed you? You was praying then, wasn't you? You was praying for me to speak something to you. He heard you. You're healed now, and you can go home, be made well. The little lady there, was praying also, next to you. The one that believes there, with lung trouble. He--He healed you too, so you can go home, be made well also. God bless you. Come, bring--bring the man. How do you do, sir? I suppose that we are strangers, sir? I have never seen you in my life, know nothing of you. We're just two men that's met here in this world, standing here before this audience of people. And the God of heaven knows both of us. He's fed us all the days of our life.

L-70 If--if Jesus Christ, His Son, has risen from the dead and been made manifest and is in the--His Church to perform the things that He did in the days gone by, then if I am testifying truth, then He knows all about you. Is that right? I see the man going away from me. You've had a trouble--a paralysism in your face. Since a child you've had that. Little boy, dark hair, paralyzed in the face. You're suffering now with an ulcerated stomach. That's caused from smoking cigarettes. You smoking cigarettes, you shouldn't do it. Say, by the way, I see you with a rosary or... You've been a Catholic and just recently converted, is that right? And 54-0302, The Resurrection Of Jairus' Daughter, Assembly Of God, Phoenix, AZ, 84 min you're concerned about your father and mother. They're Catholic yet. They're not here, are they? Your mother has varicose veins in her legs and your father has heart trouble, is that right? Go take the Gospel to them in the Name of Jesus Christ and may they be made well.

L-71 Have faith. You believe? You want to get over that heart trouble, with your hands up, that lady setting there? Do you? If you want to get over it, stand up on your feet. All right, lady. You setting next to her, you got stomach trouble, you want to get over the stomach trouble? Stand up on your feet. The rest of you want to be healed? Stand up on your feet. I challenge every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ, stand on your feet. O God, You made heavens and earth. Show Your blessings upon this audience. And I condemn every demon that's bound the people. Come out of them in the Name of Jesus... Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
