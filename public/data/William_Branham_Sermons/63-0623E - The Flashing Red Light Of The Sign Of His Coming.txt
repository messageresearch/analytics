--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Neville. Let's remain standing just a moment for prayer, and bow our heads. Our Heavenly Father, to Thee we give praise for all that our eyes have seen and our ears have heard. And we thank Thee, Lord, because that today we know that Thou art the same great Jehovah God that always has been and You ever will.

L-2 We thank Thee for Jesus Christ Who made it possible that we could be back into Divine fellowship with Thee again, through the shedding of His innocent Blood, that through the--the propitiation of that Blood we now are sons and daughters of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be at the end, but we know we'll be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And, Father, that's all sufficient for us, as long as we're like Him, standing in the form of His image.

L-3 And now, Father, we do not want to be at this hour conformed to the things of the world, but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit, by the Holy Ghost, that He might come and take our lives into His Own care, and would--would lead us and guide us for what days we have left upon the earth, and magnify His great Name.

L-4 We thank Thee for all these things. And with expectations we look for Your visit with us tonight as we've gathered in now, and believing that You will meet with us as You promised. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Be seated.

L-5 Believe it was David that said, "I was happy when they said unto us, said unto me, 'Let us go into the house of the Lord.'" And we are very grateful indeed to be here tonight, and feel it a privilege to have this grand opportunity to--to be here, speaking with you people.

L-6 I'm making some tapes. So I just looking back into the room to see if the brethren were getting the tapes. It's--it's on now, the tapes are going. All right. This purpose for this, is, I had promised of sending out Messages, would come, be taped here at the tabernacle. Now we are...

L-7 I'd like to say something about this morning. Today, right after noon, rather, when we was ending the morning meeting, something taken place that maybe some of you wasn't here and didn't hear about it. I was closing service, and I speaking from the platform here, watching a brother standing out here shaking hands with the people, by the name of Brother Way, we call him here. His wife is a fine registered nurse.

L-8 And Brother Way is one of God's servants, and he's also works in secular work, but has a call upon his heart, for years, to the field of mission work. He felt led that God should bring him here and wait at this post here until receiving further orders for to advance into the field. A few days ago, speaking to him, and having a little interview with he and his wife.

L-9 And this morning, when making my confession of having complex, I referred to Brother Way also as having a complex, which is certainly normal among all people, and at a--a moment after that, Brother Way was stricken in a heart attack and dropped dead in the floor. And I seen his wife, and I noticed... I have been around many people dying, and I--I do not have to--to say this.

L-10 I like to brag on Jesus Christ and His power. But at this time I think we should never try to brag on Him in any way to something He--He--He didn't do. But I have seen Jesus Christ raise up the dead, many times, infallible, doctors' testing to prove. For instance, in Connecticut just recently, in a meeting, setting in a large, the old... some kind of a famous auditorium, there was a Doctor Barton, a Christian doctor on the platform with me, a medical doctor. And there was a fine renown Christian woman, a lovely, wealthy woman she was. She was setting kind of to my left. And I had called the prayer line, and I noticed the woman just all at once...

L-11 When anyone, their heart stops... You can close your eyes, but when you are shocked to death, when your heart stops, really your eyeballs turn back, and the white part of your eye pushes out. And I noticed it as she sank down. And quickly they called for the medical doctor, and he run to her to take her pulse, and shook his head, put his hands upon 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min her, his ear to her heart. And she was gone. She sank in the floor, and her daughter screaming, which interrupted the meeting. I continued on, 'cause I didn't have no word of the Lord for the woman. And I continued on.

L-12 They said something about getting Brother Branham. And they said, "We don't want to call him in the prayer line, 'cause he's under discernment." And they said, "Get little Branham," that was Billy. And Billy, being it was a woman dead, he didn't want to.

L-13 You know, people get suspicion of somebody being dead. That, that's--that's just a hull. There is nothing there. That, people think strange. That, the person isn't there, themselves; they've moved on. And so he was afraid to--to go around the woman, because she was dead.

L-14 And then immediately the Holy Spirit spoke to me. I turned from the place, walked down the step, come around to where she was. And just as I started to where she was, the Holy Spirit spoke to me; and I said, "Mary!"

L-15 She said, "Yes, Brother Branham." She was all right. And--and she had never seen us before. And it was the first in meeting.

L-16 Then at Shawano just recently in, oh, I'd say, in the last, about, four years ago, or five, I was speaking one night at the armory. And there was a great crowd of people. And a elderly man of some eighty years old, I guess, and his lovely wife, they were Lutheran by faith, go to that great famous Lutheran church there. I forget the name of it now. It's the largest Lutheran gathering in America, at one single gathering, of church membership. And it's a great country for the Lutheran. And while I was speaking, I noticed the fellow, head going back like that; and his hands went out, and he pitched forward, dead in the chair. And his wife begin screaming, and she screamed out, "Somebody help me! Somebody help me!"

L-17 And I looked. I said, "Just everyone keep seated, be quiet." See? I waited for the Lord to give me a word. And--and I... Satan... I was just fixing to make the altar call, and that's just when he wants to show hisself.

L-18 So did you ever notice when you start to make a altar call, even little babies will start screaming, and things like that? That's Satan. You who are spiritual understand.

L-19 So the Lord gave me his name, and I called him, and he come to life just like that.

L-20 And this morning when I was turning, see, and I've seen, many times, the Lord Jesus bring back the dead. The little baby in Mexico died at nine o'clock that morning, and this was between ten and eleven that night it come back to life. And--and that's a bona fide testimony with doctor's witness of it, see, that the baby died in his office at nine o'clock that morning. I think it was pneumonia. And the baby is living today, so far as I know. And that was before, oh, my, thirty, forty thousand people.

L-21 And then this morning I seen our Brother Way, as he's setting, he was setting right here now. But as he was setting right along in here somewhere, he was standing. And we were singing, and, "Glory, glory, hallelujah," and shaking one another's hands. I noticed him as it struck him, and his head went back. He, Brother Way, isn't given to things like anything like of fainting or going like that. And, he, I seen him fall backwards. And I seen his wife, which is a registered nurse, check his pulse. And she screamed; it was gone.

L-22 And--and then I believe it was Sister Nash, a lady here, a colored sister that comes to the church, some of them started running forward. And now she, Mrs. Way, kept reaching for me to come across the platform. And I said, "Everybody keep quiet, keep in your seat." Don't never be excited in them kind of times. See? That's what Satan wants to do. Just wait and see what He says. If it's somebody moving on to Glory, well, we got to go sometime, no better place than in church, so--so then right in the house of the Lord. So then... But the man was turning back. I thought maybe something had, he had fainted or something had happened to him, in that manner. But when I looked, and his head turned around this way, and seeing the inside, down part of his eyes, pushed out. You can't shut, you can't put your eyes in that condition; it's the heart stopping that does that. And I went across this, and he... There was someone, kind person, had laid a... something for his head to lay on. And there was his feet, hands, and everything, stiff. It stopped. His face was as dark as my coat, reddish black, and his eyes turned back. And I know heart attack. I know what they do and how they turn; anybody else that's ever seen it. So I put my hand 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min upon his pulse, and there's no more pulse than there is on this desk. [Brother Branham taps the wooden pulpit--Ed.] Not a thing. Here is his wife, a registered nurse, who checked his pulse. There was no pulse there.

L-23 Then, the other day while I was with Brother Way on a discernment in here, I seen that he had a murmuring heart, anyhow. So then I thought, "This is it." So I laid my hands upon him. I said, "Dear God, I call, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the soul of my brother, his life back again." And the Lord Jehovah knows, and His Bible here before me, it felt like, when I had my hand on his pulse... And as I know I'll answer for this at the Day of the Judgment if it be wrong. And it felt like his pulse beat four or five times, quickly, went, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump; and then started off, going, pump, pump, pump, pump.

L-24 And he was trying to open his mouth to say something to me. And trying to get his mouth, and gurgling, kind of, to try to say it. And he got out the words, "Brother Branham." Then it looked like he would go back to sleep or something, and I waited just a moment again, checked his pulse again; it was beating normally. And then again I looked, and he looked over at me. And he was kind of, I seen, beside himself; he didn't know where he was at, but his heart beating normal. And God had called back his life to him again.

L-25 So I--I say that in honor of Jesus Christ, who it is the same God, that when... This morning I had preached at length, way over my time, and tired and worn. And there could be two things. He either got tired, or when I spoke of having a complex, not just to--to mess my brother up, as we'd say it, because I had... I was making my confession of having complex. And I guess if I'd ask tonight, in this audience of people, "How many in here knows you have complex?" practically every hand would go up. That you might know, Brother Way, just let me show you whether it's discernment or not. How many knows that you got a complex, raise your hand. Look at there! See? But I--I don't know if that shock of me saying that to Brother Way, taking it like I might be rebuking him or something, then, that he fell into this condition, and the Lord Jesus brought him back.

L-26 Now I--I am... think that the same God that the great Saint Paul represented in his days, that when he preached at length one night, and a man fell and his life was gone out of him; and Paul, getting over the man, by the grace of God, said back to the audience, "His life is within him." I--I think that it proves to us, or if you've never seen it before, that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-27 And then it might have been this, that I've tried to think of it this afternoon. That, I had stood here, and with all my heart told you exactly the Truth, and tell you of my complex, and make my open confession, 'cause... and ask you to pray that my inside being would be changed towards the people, that I could do as the Lord did. And to confirm that He still will send me to the field, He let that happen to show that He still heals the sick and could raise the dead, could raise up the dead. And I think it was no more than a confirmation of what I been preaching about, and had been witnessing of the Kingdom of God. And that's something along the line that He had just told Brother Roberson there, and another one of the brethren. Now we love Him for that.

L-28 And we thankful tonight that Brother Way is with us tonight. And surely God has not finished with our brother, or he'd have went on this morning. There is something for Brother Way to do. And I want you to know, Brother Way, that this entire church, with myself, will be praying that God will show you His plan for your and your wife's life; and, as soon as it is materialized, will place you in there. I'm sure He'll do it, Brother Way. And all of us, as Christians, will be thankful for Brother Way. Is that right, church? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] And will pray that he and Sister Way will find their place in the Lord, for their service in life.

L-29 Now, also, I wanted to speak to Brother Way. I come early so I could speak to him and find just what his attitude, or what happened. And he doesn't know. See, it just went out, and he just dropped and went off. That's all. Brother Way was wanting and asked if there is anybody in the building that's going down to Arkansas, Tuesday or whenever you're going, to--to this meeting. Now, it's--it's perhaps a very small meeting. It's a brotherhood that meets. And I think it's up in some kind of a jungle, or something another, way up. And there probably will not be too many people, I--I guess, at the meeting, because, frankly, they don't even know I'm coming, yet. See? And so my friends around there, will probably be a night or two before they'll know, even my friends in Arkansas, that know me down in there, will be at the meeting. But if anybody is going, and would have room to let someone ride with them, Brother 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min Way would be glad to do it. He said to make the announcement that he would be no burden upon the people, to take care of him while he was there, 'cause he could do it. But he, if someone was going, it would be a sign to him that God would love for him, or would be in--be in the will of God for him to go down. So all of you know Brother Way, setting here at the corner. And if anybody would want to, that's going down, and has a room for an extra passenger, he'd be glad to do it.

L-30 And then next Sunday night, the Lord willing, I'll--I'll be back, or next Sunday morning, rather. And--and if Brother Neville has the Sunday school, and when it's over, I want to make another tape if I can. And if I'm not mistaken, I think I'll be speaking on Does Your Life... Is Your Life Worthy Of The Gospel? That, that's, or, Is Your wife... Life Worthy Of The Gospel? That's what I mean to say. Is Your Life Worthy of the Gospel? And I want to make a tape on that, if the Lord willing.

L-31 And now, tonight, I have announced today that I was going to make the tape. And the pastor, I don't think even preached; just called me out, and so to speak here at the platform. Now, then I don't know... Now, if they making the tapes, if you seem to get tired or something, you wish to go out, just be quiet as possible, because we don't... See, these--these microphones are very, very sensitive, and they pick up a little noise. And we're making, trying to make these tapes for an international ministry.

L-32 And tonight I wish to announce my subject as the... after I--I read God's Word, found in Saint Matthew's Gospel, the 24th chapter. Of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew, the 24th chapter, and let's begin now at the 32nd verse and read the Scripture. Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is--is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the door. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be fulfilled. Heavens and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. But of the day and of the hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but the Father only. But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

L-33 Now in our reading, we find tonight, as we read, that the first part of this chapter reads that the disciples called Him apart upon the mount, mountain, and said to Him, "What will be the sign of the end of the world? What will be the sign of Your Coming? And when will there come a time there won't be one stone left on the other, on the temple?" Now He goes on to answer. See here at the 1st verse. ... Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him... to show him the building, of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. And his disciple... And as he sat upon the mount... (pardon me)... as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

L-34 See, they asked three questions, and He answers back three questions. "When will there come a time there won't be one stone left on another? What's the sign of Your Coming? And what about the end of the world?" And many, I believe, that we brethren make mistakes by trying to apply it all to His Coming. But He is answering three different questions that was asked Him. "Why would be the time that there won't be one of these stones left on another; when will this thing be? And what will be the sign of Your Coming? And what will be at the end of the world?" See, three different questions. And He starts off answering one, about when "the stones would be left with not one upon another." And then after He finishes that question, then He starts off, "the sign of His Coming." And then goes into, "the end of the world."

L-35 Now we notice here one of the things that I wish to speak on tonight, is the... The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming. And we're going to dwell tonight upon the days of Noah, "So shall it be at the coming of the Son of 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min man." And now this struck me the other day, and I thought maybe I'd try to tape this and speak on this. And writing down several Scriptures here that I would like to refer to, maybe, and--and read, in a little bit.

L-36 But now our Lord Jesus was asked this question, and He gave them the sign of His Coming. And then immediately He said this, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall not pass away." And then He said, "Learn a parable of the fig tree. When it's putting forth its branches, you know that summer is nigh. So when you see these things coming to pass, or being made manifest, know that the time is at hand. And this generation shall not be done away until all of these things shall come to pass." What generation? The generation that's seeing the apostasy that we're going to speak of tonight.

L-37 So when we think of my text, as a flashing red light of His Coming, it reminds me of waiting at a railroad station, that when a man or people stand around, as many of us has, when we was waiting to catch the train. And we can't hear the train, or you don't see him, but you know it's--it's time. Maybe the dispatcher says, "He's a--a little late. He's not exactly at the time, but we don't know just when, but he will arrive soon." And we'll walk around in the station, with our hands in our pockets, and setting on our suitcases, and go out and buy a bag of peanuts, and talk to the... somebody across the street. But all of a sudden we see something happen. There is a noise takes place out at the track. And when we did, the arm goes down, and the red light begins to flash. What is that? The train is in the blocks. Though you can't hear him, though you can't see him, but yet that flashing red light and that arm down shows that he's coming in. And then if you're expecting to leave on that train, you better throw that bag of peanuts down, stop your talking, get up your suitcases, and get ready or you'll be left behind, 'cause he's just stopping locally just for a few moments. He'll be gone. If you still stand to chat, the neighbor across the street, you'll be left behind.

L-38 How much more is it, then, when we see a flashing signal that He's in the blocks! The old Gospel train is passing by, pretty soon. And as we study tonight on this great text, flashing signal, as our Lord set upon the mountain and told them these things would take place, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man."

L-39 Now we want to go back, for a little piece, and find out if we can find anything in this day that resembles the days of Noah. And then we can tell then where we are in that day that our Lord spoke of, see if we can find just any resemblance of the days of Noah. In order to do this, I think we ought to go back to the Book of Genesis, to the days of Noah. And if you will turn with me, if you will, in the Scripture, back to Genesis the 6th chapter, and that's the days of the flood, and the morals and the conditions of that day, Genesis the 6th chapter. Now, we want to read, see and compare that day with this day. Notice. And it came to pass, when man begin to multiply upon the face of the earth,...

L-40 The very first word presents us with a absolutely flashing light that the day is at hand, for there has never been a time in all the history that there's ever been so many people, and so quickly multiplying, as we have today, until it's hard to get a place to stay. And so many people multiplying upon the earth, till science says, that, "If it continues to multiply like it has been, in twenty years there won't even be food on the earth for the people." Reader's Digest, I believe it was, that quoted that, that, "There won't even be food for the people that are multiplying so fast."

L-41 We can look around and see that the places that used to be wilderness has turned into city, and yet birth control is on its greatest rampage it ever was. I believe it was said of Chicago... I hope I don't misquote these figures. But actually registered cases, thirty thousand abortion cases every sixty days, in Chicago. Abortion cases every sixty days, registered! How about those who has never registered? See, just in one big four-million-population city! What about the world? And yet the population is so crowded until it's they can't even take care of the...

L-42 India, they're trying to become... to make interrupt the human part of man, and make them become sterile, that children cannot be born, because they're--they are in on the increase so. Four hundred and seventy million, at this time, in India.

L-43 How about China, where the increase is greater, Russia and the many countries of the world? "When man begin to multiply upon the face of the earth." See? Now we're taking back to the antediluvian time. ... and daughters were born unto them, 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min And the sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were fair; and they took unto them wives... all which they chose. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a--a hundred and twenty years. And there were giants in the land in those days; and also after them... the sons of God came... to the daughters of man, and they bare children to them, and the same became mighty man which were of old,... renown.

L-44 Oh, what a--a subject that we got here! See? Now, one of the first things I want you to notice, that the--the sons of God saw the daughters of man, that they were fair. Now I don't... I'm pointing this at the whole world. But there never has been a time on the earth, as I can think, only that time, that there ever was such a--a wholesale beauty among women.

L-45 And you can remember, some of you elderly women, and some of you people, man, that can remember back years ago, that how it was seldom you found a pretty woman. But today you don't find any but what is pretty. Is because that they have come to a place of all this bobbing their hair, and makeup, and--and all kinds of sexy clothes and things. They can present themself in such a way. And then it's, another thing, the hand of time has turned it back, according to the Scripture. And women are constantly on the increase of being pretty.

L-46 I can remember when I was a little boy in school, and turn and look at the little children today, the little girls coming on. And I can look, think of women when I was a young man, and look at the girls today. I remember there'd be one popular girl, and that's not been over twenty-five years ago, one popular girl, a pretty girl, and pretty near every boy wanted to go with this girl, because she was the queen of the--of the group. Maybe in a whole city, there'd be two or three of those women. Now the whole thing's become pretty, all of them. That's to fulfill the Scripture, and a red light flashing that the time is at hand.

L-47 They've invented such stuff as lipstick and--and makeup, that a woman that isn't so fair, she can still make herself pretty by the--all the face lifts and the--the things that they do to make themselves pretty.

L-48 Max Factor runs day and night, and there is more spent on cosmetics, in America, in a year, for to make the women pretty, than there is spent at the grocery store. That's right. I forget how many billion dollars each year is spent for cosmetics, to fair our women.

L-49 Now, I'm saying nothing against that, I'm just showing you that it is a flash of red light that the time is at hand. For Jesus said, Himself, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man." See, the same thing.

L-50 And notice, "When people begin to multiply, many people. The daughters of man was fair; and the sons of God looked upon them, and took them wives." Now, that's not my own saying. I'm reading it out of the Bible, where Jesus said for us to go back to Genesis and compare these days together. The multiplication of people, and the beauty of women, now that's a great sign.

L-51 Now the warning, Jehovah's warning, the 3rd verse. And the LORD said,...

L-52 Immediately after this took place... Remember, the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible, and Jesus was empowered with the fullness of the Holy Spirit. And He spoke only by the Holy Spirit. And the Scriptures are written by the Holy Spirit. And the very One Who wrote Genesis 6, told us in Matthew 24, to know when the time was nigh, to go back to Genesis 6 and compare it.

L-53 Multiplying of people upon the earth; and yet such birth control, and all of the things that goes on, don't even check it. It's going just the same, because we're at the end time.

L-54 And then notice, immediately there come a time when it said the women was very fair, very pretty. And we check that with this and can prove it.

L-55 Now, I was looking at some pictures of long ago when our forefathers, when they crossed the plains. And I can't call the--the woman's name, but her name was known from San Francisco to--to Boston, of being the most fairest 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min woman in the land. Pearl White, I believe, was her name, of many years ago. She was killed by her lover, Scott Jackson. And if you would see the woman's picture, of being the most fairest lady of the land, you would hardly look at her. She would look like an antique out here on the street. For, most any woman you could catch any way you want to, would be three times prettier than her, any woman today that you'd catch just going down the street. See, it's an increase, beauty for women.

L-56 And then I wonder if our women realize this and can... That's the reason I want this tape to go, that--that you mustn't put so... We want you to be pretty, but we want you to be natural. We don't want you to be superficial. Some of these pretty women, if you'd dunk them in a wash tub a while and wash them up, they might look a little different, and--and dress them like they should be dressed. But they--they--they don't do it, and you can't tell them no different. And we're going to get to that after a while. But this is the--the red light flash.

L-57 And remember, when people begin to multiply upon the earth, and the women got fair, it was that hour, it was at that time, that: ... the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,... You see the clutch? Do you see the hand of God, "My Spirit"? The daughters of men were fair; and they took unto them wives. And He said, then, "My Spirit will not always strive with man. I'll allot his days." Now the 4th verse: And there were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,... the sons of God came... unto the daughters of man, or--or the daughters of man, and they bare them children to--to them, and the same became mighty man which were of old,... renown.

L-58 Did you notice it never said nothing about marriage? Notice, "The sons of God came unto the daughters of man," nothing about marriage. And if you take in the original Greek there, the word meaning, says, I've got it wrote down here somewhere, a "wife." "Taken to them wives," in the 3rd verse, "taken them wives." In the Greek, I looked it up this afternoon, it didn't say, "Take to them wives." It said, "Took to them women," not wives. Now you check it with your--with your... the Emphatic Diaglott, and watch if that isn't true.

L-59 "Taken unto them women," not wives. They took them just as they were, free lovers, like we have today. Other words, they were lovers in that day just as they are now. They went any way they wanted to, and took any woman that they could.

L-60 "And when the sons of God..." Now, many of them says here that that was the fallen Angels, and so forth, and them men and women. But to show that it is wrong, it's absolutely wrong, the Bible doesn't say anywhere about Angels being either man or women. And, besides, there is never a--a woman spoke of as being an Angel, in the Bible, never. Now if you want Scripture for that, Matthew 22:20, and so forth, you can find it.

L-61 Now, that, that, there is no such a thing as a woman angel. That's the reason that a woman preacher... Angel is a "messenger." And it's--and it's a... An angel is a "messenger." And there is no such. But, you see, they have changed, today, like it was then. Now, I've got some historical points wrote down here, we wish to get to in a few minutes.

L-62 Notice, women of that day, in the days of Noah, must have been the talk of the day. See, "the sons of God," Seth's, Seth's sons, saw the daughters of Cain, that they were beautiful. Why? They were wicked, and they were daughters of Cain. "When the sons of God saw the daughters of man, they were fair, they took unto them women. Then the sons of God fell from their estate with God, and become woman-chasers." And if that ain't the picture of today, I don't know what is. That is true.

L-63 Man! Even look at our churches today, look at everything you wish to, notice it. Everywhere, it looked in that day, must have been pretty women. Man became slaves to them, says history, that man became actually slaves to the women, because they were so pretty, that they become slaves. They literally made shrines, and worshipped. And, just think, they literally worshipped female flesh and blood in that day. That's history.

L-64 And compare that with today. It's the same thing, my brother. Man actually worship women. Why, in our own country, Mrs. Kennedy is twice thought of, what the President is. That's right. And if you always talk about a man, if 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min he's got an attractive wife, that's it.

L-65 And now they say that about the driving. You hear them say the women is the safest drivers. That's wrong, because I'll tell you why. Billy and I, crossing this United States, with a first hand condition, we put a--a little map up in our car, a little tablet, and wrote "man" and "woman." And every time a woman made the wrong, we put a mark on her side; and a man made one, we'd put one on his side. And out of three hundred, what we call "booboo," pulled on the road there, you would be surprised. There were two hundred and eighty women, to nineteen man. But you know why? They don't get that in the police courts. The police won't arrest a pretty girl; one out of a thousand. Sure, get her telephone number, but he won't arrest her. And that's just the way. No wonder the records doesn't show it. See? Because, man today is like it was in the days of Noah, they bow to the shrine of pretty women. That's right. Oh, my!

L-66 How it must have been awful in that day, worship as they, females, flashing themself in such an attractive way. And if they were any better on doing it then, than they are now, I'm glad I didn't live then. Think of it, of how that they only... how that women has got to acting the same as they do now.

L-67 Notice, the Bible said, "They eat and they drank." Now, that's--that's legitimate. Sure. "Marriage is honorable." A man, man marry a woman, that's honorable, that's instituted of God. But when it comes to a time that man will take another man's wife, or take some young woman, or some woman that no matter who she is, and break his marriage vow, and do something that's wrong, it's sinful in the sight of God. And the Bible speaks very hardly against it.

L-68 Now notice, It said that. Marriage, God instituted that in Eden, but He certainly condemned adultery. And these men and women, in that day, bypassed the laws of God, and took it upon themselves and done it, anyhow. Now, compare that with today. Look at it. If you want to see the train is in the block, take a good deep think of that now, as the infallible Jesus Christ said these Words. See?

L-69 And notice, the Bible said here, "They eat and they drank," of course, with their pretty women. Now, we realize that that's all right. Eating and drinking, that's one of the natural laws of life. We have to do it. But when that's all upon your mind, today the people just become gluttons, drunk, women drinking in the restaurant. And you go into a place where the--the highballs and cocktails are served, the women outdrink the man.

L-70 Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Noah, they were eating, and drinking, and giving in marriage." In other words, they were living with the women without being married to them. And today, why, it's so instituted. They did have a Reno, that you could get married, and divorced and married again, all in the same day. But that's way out of date now. The--the husbands, so-called, and wives, pack different keys to the rooms in these big cities. Now, I travel. I--I'm right in the cities and know it to be true, that the husband has his dates, and the wife has her dates. Well, it's such a conglomeration of--of rottenness, until it's produced a bunch of--of soft, lazy, no-good, hell-bound generation.

L-71 A few years ago, look where man has got to, in his body. Look where he's got to, by the things he's done. Science is constantly trying to make a better food, hybrid corn, and--and hybrid tomatoes, hybrid beef, when the stuff's no good at all. It's killing the people, and they don't realize it. Why, in a few more years, they'll be nothing but just a--a bunch like a jellyfish.

L-72 Fifty years ago, ball games went on just as they do now, and you never heard of anybody getting hurt, but now they kill a dozen, or two, a year. A ball will hit a man, he, there ain't nothing in him to hold his life in him. He's like a guinea. You hit him, he is so soft, he's dead.

L-73 When Bob Fitzsimmons fought Corbett, I believe they fought a hundred and twenty-five rounds, one afternoon, bare-fisted. When those man with such punch in their arms could take a two-by-four, at four inches, and bust that two-by-four with nothing but calloused fists. They slept with their hands in vinegar, to make their fists hard. And a--a round wasn't a little two or three-minute round like we have today. They didn't have a featherbed tied over their mitts, and nobody got killed. And they fought. A round was a knock-down. You had to knock the man down. And they fought a hundred and twenty-five knock-downs. They were man. And today they're going to have to stop the art of boxing, when there's a featherbed over their arms and over their fists, can't fight a two or three rounds without 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min somebody getting killed. What's the matter? He's made up out of a bunch of, I don't know, soft muck, hybrid nothing, till the whole generation is dying.

L-74 Did not the Bible say that, that they would get weaker and wiser? Why, in another race of people coming on, they'll live out of a capsule, take a capsule for their dinner. It's nothing but a bunch of cigarette-smoking, whiskey-drinking, cocktail-running, a bunch of dope addicts, shots. Teenage children in school, and juvenile delinquency; no wonder, her mother out on the street, acting the way she does, throws the child into the same thing.

L-75 Pretty women increase; social life broke down. Oh, my, what a great thing in the day we're living in! How they do this, it's un-... get by with that. They won't get by with it. What are they doing? Just as they did then, they're making the Commandments of God a mock. God said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." But they show that they can do it, and get by with it. They think they're going to get by with it, but they'll never do it. Maybe you oughtn't to come, listen to this. Huh? However, God said that this would be the time that the red light would be flashing. Jesus said so.

L-76 Now what a--a sin that they are doing, and laughing at sin! Many times, that, the very thing that this Bible calls immoral, the world today calls virtue. When you take our--our young girls, and strip their clothes off of them, and put them out there with little shorts on, in slacks and things, and walk them down the street, and they think that's virtuous that the girl can display her female flesh. When, the Bible says it's sin, horrible! But the world calls it virtue. See, they're making the Commandments of God... And the church says nothing about it. It's time that somebody rose in the name of righteousness, in the Name of Jesus Christ, and put a stamp on this, 'cause sometime we're going to answer for it at the Day of the Judgment.

L-77 Now, if this sounds old and fogy, to somebody, check back a few years and look what's going on now, and then imagine a future. There is no future but the Coming of the Lord.

L-78 Notice, check these antediluvian females with the stride of today; check what they were. Check what the sons of God did; check what they do today.

L-79 I was setting at a convention not long ago, and it broke me down almost, when all the... Everybody seemed to be just enjoying a minister's talk, that was standing on the platform. And I was setting over in a corner. And there was a--a young lady come in, and she was really dressed bad. And she come walking up through this church, as the Bible says, mincing as she went. And every preacher on the platform, plus the congregation, everyone turning their head and looking, following this girl. And I thought of this Scripture, "The sons of God looked upon the daughters of man," sinners, ungodly, pretty women. Oh, it's tore a many a church to pieces. It took the Spirit of God away. Notice, "Looked upon the daughters of man."

L-80 Now remember, the infallible Jesus Christ stated these things would be this a way in this day. And He said, "When you see these things come to pass, then you know that the time is at the door." Now, there isn't many people will say that. There is many preachers that couldn't say that. He could, if he would. But if he would, the congregation would take him out. That's exactly the truth.

L-81 But here is one thing. If a man is called of God, he'll stay with that Bible, I don't care what he has to do. You must remember that It's the Truth. And the Truth either binds or sets free. And this is exactly what Jesus Christ said.

L-82 "The sons of God fell because of beautiful forms and faces, of the daughters of men." And that's just exactly what we got today, same thing again.

L-83 Now, compare that day. Multiplication of people; the women getting fairer; the sons of God falling; marriage and giving in marriage; divorce cases; living in adultery; and so forth.

L-84 "Why" you say, "Brother Branham, just a minute. I don't know." Listen, brother, just before you say something, listen to this. Jesus Christ said, that, "Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." And when you see... When a man walks out of his office, walks out of the church, walks out of his house, strikes the street, what do you see but a display, on every side, of flesh and blood of females, form-fitting, pretty-faced, tempted. That's what God said would take place. When that taken place, then the time was at the door. 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min "As it was in the days of Noah, when the sons of God saw the daughters of man, and begin to take unto them women." See? There you are.

L-85 Now watch. We find that, the same thing today. We see in the history, that such sex appeal they had in them, until the sons of God made unto themself shrines of women. That's of Venus, and so forth. See? They, they made shrines, and bowed to them. When you say, "Brother Branham, we don't have such things as that today. You couldn't compare that with this day." I beg your pardon. I believe it's worse today than it was then.

L-86 What do we see? TV. You can't even pick up a newspaper but everything that you see is spread with females. Pretty women on every whiskey package, in magazines, sexy, immoral dressed. On the TV, in everything, is some sexy-dressed woman, some pretty woman. And we find out on--on cigarette advertisements, everything that you can look at, you find that it's some attractive woman. You can't even see the advertisement of a pair of silk stockings less you see some kind of a thin-shaped legs going through it. And that's right. But what is it? Why is it?

L-87 I remember a man I worked for, Chris Meisner, up here on the corner. Many of you remember Chris Meisner. His wife, Lillian, her name was Lily, I think, an Ellinger. And when she... A man come over. She was a beautiful girl. And a man wanted to get permission from her father, to put her face, her picture, her profile, on a box of candy. And this old German Luthern stood to his feet, and he said, "That's an insult to me, to put my daughter's picture on a box of candy, to be spread across the country." What about today? When, the billboards, the television, everything you see, is immoral, vulgar, sexy, ungodly-looking women. That's right. What is it? The train, the old--the old train is in her blocks now. The Bible said so, she would be coming pretty soon. We hear the sound.

L-88 We talk about other things about it, but, remember, this is another flash, one of the flashes that's flashing before us today. Oh, we see the national condition; we see the political disturbance; we see the church situation. We preach on all that. But this is something new. It's something is not very popular to be spoke on, but it must be done, for there's got to be a voice crying out. Remember, the very words I say tonight will meet me yonder at the Judgment. See?

L-89 When I seen this woman not long ago, in a vision the Lord showed me, see her die. That, I can't never think of that woman's name, she, Marilyn Monroe. And I had never seen her. I don't go to movies. But I--I--I had seen the girl, and she was attractive. And she was trying to get to something; she was dying, had a heart attack. And the Lord said, "Now you say that, 'She died just at four o'clock. She did not commit suicide.'" Said, "But you can say she died at four o'clock, 'cause it's just a few seconds before four." And there I seen where they found her. And I told Billy, I told the family, the ones that was with me, about it. And a few days afterwards, it was Marilyn Monroe that died.

L-90 Now, when I was in Canada the other day, my kids kept telling me, over at a certain place where a lady had let us have the house, had a television. And they said, "There is going to be a play, called, The River Of No Return." That's the river I fish on, all the time. And John Smith, a friend of mine, takes that tour. Said, "They made a movie of it." And said, "Daddy, maybe that Mr. Smith is on the program. Would you like to look at it?" "Well," I said, "when I come back from Canada, if I make it in time, I'll look at it." Well, when the play did come on, I went over to see it, went to see it. And when I did, who was playing in it but Marilyn Monroe. Now, there she was, after being dead a year or more, there she was all sexy dressed. There was her voice upon, still playing; and will be, for years and years, upon that magnetic tape. If that magnetic tape holds her action, when if she could look from where she is tonight... I trust she is saved, but I don't know; that's to God. But if she could look back, she cannot deny that. She can't deny this, because we've got it. How much more has God got every move, every action, upon His great supreme tape that'll be. We cannot get out of it. It's right there.

L-91 And remember, if there was a microphone setting right here where this is, and I was a broadcasting now to the world, the people around the world would hear my voice before it even got across this pulpit to you. That's in the electronics of the--of the world.

L-92 And you know, that voice never dies. It'll never die. Science claim, "In twenty years," if they can progress as they have now, "That they'll pick up the literal voice of Jesus Christ when He was on earth, in twenty years from now." Because, it's like dropping a pebble in a pond, the little waves may finally fade out of your sight, but science claims 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min they go back to one bank, across the ocean to another, and back and forth, and they never die. And neither does the words that you speak; they'll meet you in the Day of the Judgment, and will condemn you or save you, and you'll never be able to get away from any of it.

L-93 And we are very conscious, it's coming right through this room now, is pictures of people. If you don't believe it, turn on the television. And there is voices of people, yet our senses won't pick it up.

L-94 Now, they've got a sending station and a magnet pole, or a tube, or a crystal that picks up those voices and reproduces them. And now the only thing the Bible is, is this, the Word of Jesus Christ that He spoke, and They are literally alive just like any other word is in the world tonight.

L-95 Now, if your heart has been cleansed by the Blood of Jesus Christ, and becomes a receiving set from that sending Set, He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and does the same things that He did, 'cause His Word can't die. They are living forevermore. They don't have to pick up a set, or twenty years from now. We receive It right now. Now, there you are.

L-96 Living in this great day that we're living in, near the coming of the Son of man, and the lights a flashing everywhere, of His Coming. We see it in politics; we see it in the church; we see it in the time; we see it everywhere we look. We see the sun don't look like it used to. The world is out of cater. They tell me right now, at the North Pole, up in there, that the sea has become, I forget how much, deeper than it used to be. The Bering Strait, you could walk across them. Now, it's many, many, many feet deep, in the Bering Strait. Why? The earth is swelling in the middle. It's getting shallow out here where it was deep, and getting deep up here where it was shallow. The world is completely out of cater. She is toddling. She is weaving. All nature is giving in, and everything that we can see.

L-97 And now, tonight, we find out that the very nature itself is producing, in the human race, the sign of His Coming; for, the sons of God, and the daughters of man becoming fair, and how they've taking unto them women. What a hour that we're living in! Oh, my, and how it was in that day!

L-98 Then we see in the history of this great shocking thing, of man worshipping women, and we find out today it's a woman's world.

L-99 I was in Switzerland, not long ago, and I was talking to... Now, nothing against our Christian women, no, sir, they are jewels. I'm talking about the run of the world. There was a lady riding along with me, Brother Guggenbuhl, and his girl friend that he was going with. He is a man about--about pretty near my age, never been married, an old bachelor, and he was going with some young lady. And then one of the girls from there, and she said, "Brother Branham, tell us about America. We understand that, the women over there, it's a woman's world over there, sure enough." I said, "That's right." Said, "I've always wanted to go." Then I begin to explain to her. She said, "What?" I said, "Yes." It changed her opinion right away. "Well," she said, "how could you live a Christian life in such a place as that, then?" Think of it.

L-100 When I went into--into Rome, and was down at the San Angelo, the catacombs, it was a shocking. When I stepped out of my hotel and went down to where it's that place called, "Three Coins in a Fountain," the women on the street, of how immoral. The women walk out and asking you to take them out on a date, all sorts, sizes, and kinds. And I forget how many come to Billy and I and Brother Baxter, before we could get down to the pool, and the man from the TWA that was showing us around. I said, "Does those women have to live like that?"

L-101 Said, "No. When the soldiers were over here, they got used to it. And, yet, they got a good job, yet they continue on." But even in a place like that, when I got to the spot of San Angelo, the great big sign there, out from the Vatican, that said, "A notice to American women! Please put on clothes before you come in and to give honor to the dead."

L-102 I seen an American girl get off in Paris, where it's, actually, one of our fashions used to come from Paris. But that girl was so immorally dressed, with her father and her mother, until soldiers that was working out there dropped their 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min picks and shovels, and run up there and looked over the scene, to watch this American girl pass.

L-103 We set the pace of fashions. Where, it used to be Paris, but now they come here to get the vulgar, lowdown filth. And this nation, where a revival has just passed through, of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, with the lovely Lord Jesus showing His signs and wonders of mercy, and of speaking as it was in the days of Noah, and the light's a flashing from side to side. A God that can raise the dead from his bed; a God that can heal the sick; a God that can tell things before it comes to pass, and make it perfect on the dot, every time, without failing. And you can preach to our women in America, and they get worse every year. Bombay, I mean...

L-104 In Durban, South Africa, where there was some two hundred thousand natives gathered out to the meeting, when the great miracle that God performed. And I seen thirty thousand blanket natives. Women standing there with a four-inch clout of beads only in hanging down in front. And the man, no clothes on, the four-inch clout. Naked! A blanket that they slept on, a goat skin; they're given it, to them, when they're a certain age; and then they live in that, sleep in that, wrap up in that, and die and buried in it, in a corral somewhere.

L-105 And I seen those women, so primitive, till a woman give birth to a baby, setting twenty foot from me. She never went to a hospital. They, a woman helped her there a minute, and in about five minutes it was all over. She picked up the baby and held it to her bosom, for it to nurse. That primitive! But when they seen the power of Almighty God come upon a boy who was so afflicted, and not even in his right mind; and he raised up in his right mind, giving praise to God; thirty thousand blanket natives received Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour. What happened? You remember, that's ten times bigger than Pentecost. Thirty thousand! And nobody... I watched those women with my own eyes, when they fell upon the ground, breaking their idols, giving their lives to Jesus Christ. They didn't know; they had probably never heard His Name, many of them. But when they fell upon their--their knees, and I asked them, if they were sincere about it, meant it, to break their idols. And they broke their idols. And when they fell on their knees and give their lives to Christ, while I pray for them, and they rose back up. And those women who would stand with their arms down, not knowing they were naked; as soon as the Life of Christ touched their life, I seen those women fold their arms and walk out of the presence of man. And if the touch of Jesus Christ will do that to a blanket native, what ought it to do to a nation that's heard the Gospel for a hundreds of years? There we now... I seen that. That's not what somebody else said. I seen that. See? It's strange then that we call ourselves Christians, and each year take more off. And the churches seem to care nothing about it.

L-106 TV programs, oh, make female flesh and blood... They are not gods. They're not goddess. But it sets America in exactly order to fulfill the Scripture. America's number is thirteen. America's shrine is a woman, always. It's on our money. It's on everything. And now it certainly brings into a time that we're going to have American goddess, too, not too far away. You can see the handwriting on the wall.

L-107 Oh, what are we going to do? You can't even walk out upon the street and find... Look out on the street, start down town and just see at the display of women, how that they make themselves with clothes on that, honest to goodness, a woman ought to be ashamed to stand in her dressing room like that. Walking out upon the street, so tight, and--and little bitty clothes on. And--and out on these bathing beaches with these little 'kinis, or ever what they call it, on, and such things as that. And not knowing that in them is a spirit of evil. When, many of them sing in choirs. That's what Jesus said would take place.

L-108 Female flesh! They are flesh and blood. They're not gods. To my opinion... God forgive me if I'm wrong. It's a wholesale striptease. You can't hardly blame a man, if he's not a--a Christian, but what would fall, and fall into temptations and to such a place that he would do something wrong, till he'd... See, he could not hold himself. It's amazing that there is not more ravages goes on, because, so many of it, the women is in for it. But, if it wasn't, how could you blame the man? Put blame where blame belongs.

L-109 A woman say, "Now, Brother Branham, I'm just as moral as I..." No doubt about that. But, my sister, do you know that you're going to answer at the Day of Judgment for committing adultery when you throw yourself out there and man look upon you? He said, "Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart, and will have to answer for it." And maybe you didn't do the act, but 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min if you permit Satan to put that spirit on you, when, nature itself ought to teach you that's wrong! Without the Spirit of God, nature should do it, teach you that's wrong.

L-110 I predict that soon they'll come out with one of these things, it'll just be a fig leaf again. I predicted that thirty years ago. See, some insult to the Bible. See? They'll do it. It's public striptease. 111 Now, the devil does the same to the sons of God today. And that's right. Watch our businesses. Most of our businesses is controlled by women, lots of them. That's right. Look at our churches, look at our nation, how the sons of God bow low at the shrine of these things, these women. When, they are, to me, it's no more than public harlots. That's an awful thing to say, but it's the naked truth. I know that people hear these tapes and things, will say these things. But how can you do it? If you present yourself like that, and man look upon you, as Jesus said you've "committed adultery" with him. And when that man has to answer for committing adultery, who did it, who's fault is it? It's the woman that stripped herself like that and produced herself, or presented herself before that sinner. That's right. What is the sign of? The end time, the red light.

L-112 Motherhood is broke. Nations are breaking. Now if you want to see where Jesus said that, read Matthew 5:28. That's where it was at. Female life has been the cause and form of falling, upon that, sexual power has been the ruin. If you want to trace back, here is some nations that I traced back their fall. One was Egypt, Assyria, Rome, and whatmore, fell by the power of women.

L-113 Notice, there is nothing that God could give a man, outside of salvation, better than a nice wife. There is no man can console, no--no person can console a person when they're tired, they won't confide in anyone like they do their own wife. And what a fortunate thing you brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright, and moral, and you can come in when you're tired and weary, and set down and she can talk to you. She can do more with you than anybody else. That's right. She is a jewel. She is a queen.

L-114 But remember, "Woman was made for man; not man for woman." The last creative being that God ever created was a man. A woman is a by-product from a man. "And she was made for a man; not man made for the woman." They have vice versa-ed it around, and man falls at the shrine of women. That was the very thing that started it at the beginning. That's what happened in the beginning. When God's son, Adam, could not be tempted to doing what was wrong, Satan come into a person called the serpent, which was like a man. And there is where it started, that Eve got from behind the Word of God, and that caused every heartache, every graveyard. Every sin that was ever committed, started right there.

L-115 Here it is again. What? Women was the cause of the first fall, and women ends up the time. She started it; she ends it. No wonder the Bible said, "Those that escape out of Zion shall be glorious in the sight of the Lord."

L-116 When Isaiah 5, he talked about how the immorals of the women would get in the last days, and how there'd be, so much clothes they had to have, and how they'd have to have their hair set, and everything like that. The Bible speaks that, Isaiah 5. "How she'd walk with high-heeled shoes on, tinkling her feet as she went along. And she would roll down her stockings, and the things she would do; and many changeable set, apparel, and stuff like that." And said, "All that will be taken away from her, and she shall sit and stink, from immoral." And said, even, "Seven women will grab one man, and said, 'We'll do our own work. Let us just take your name, to take away our reproach.'"

L-117 But he said, "How glorious will that little branch that escapes all these things! It'll be 'HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD' in that day," when real genuine born-again women know their place, though they be laughed at, and called silly and old-fashion, everything. But, act like a woman, like a lady! Stand like a woman! Dress like a woman! Talk like a woman! Live like a lady. Hallelujah! Yeah. Amen, that means, "so be it." Don't get scared. It don't hurt you. All right.

L-118 Jesus' Own Word said what would happen, that great display.

L-119 Also He said, "In the days of Lot." If you want to mark that Scripture down, it's Luke 17:28. He said, "They were eating, drinking. They bought. They sold." Ordinarily, these are legitimate things. But watch. And--and that they occupied, but they put all the... their mind on it.

L-120 And in the days of Lot, women were so low, in their morals, until they was not used as women should be used, 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min but they were perverted, until they... It become so common, that women become so common that, they--they, man lived with man. The natural perversion from the sex cells had changed its position, because that women had become so cheap.

L-121 A few days ago I was over, Tucson, went to get a loaf of bread. And there was a boy setting out there, and two little boys in the car. Another come in, get a pack of cigarettes. The old gray-headed gentleman looked down, said, "Who is these cigarettes for, your mother?" Said, "No, it's for that boy." He said, "Is he old enough to have them?" Said, "Yes, sir." He looked back like that. And I was standing with a loaf of bread and a quart of milk, watching. And he went, said, "All right," and he give it to him. He looked back to me, and said, "I doubt that."

L-122 I said, "He can't get old enough to do it. He is too... He ain't old enough at any age." He said, "I'll agree with you." Said, "Do you--do you have a hard time trying to quit them?"

L-123 I said, "I never did start them." I said, "I never did start it." I said, "My parents smoked and used tobacco, but the Lord God kept me from it."

L-124 He turned and looked at me kind of strange, and he said, "Well, I think it's a rotten shame today, to see of how..." Said, "Used to be, we put women on a pedestal." Said, "We honored her. We took off our hat in her presence. We walked down the streets, and gentlemen would hear somebody make a remark about a certain woman, they'd slap him down." See? And said, "They honored women." But he said, "Sir, women has brought it on themselves." Said, "Now they don't get up. They used to get up; in a streetcar, a lady get up, every man would take his hat off and let her set down." Said "Now it's push, crowd!" Said, "They have brought it on themselves." And that's the truth. That devil hole of Hollywood yonder produced it out on the televisions and magazines, till the thing has become a great big pot of filth. That's right.

L-125 I know that ain't popular saying, but it's a true saying. It's the Truth. It's the Word of the Lord, and also a warning sign that Christ will come in this generation. Said, "The ones that sees this come to pass, will not pass out until all these things be fulfilled." Said, "Both heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word will never pass away." It's a warning. The red light is flashing; drop of the curtain. We're at the end time.

L-126 We see the signs of the Lord Jesus healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out evil spirits. We see the--the people made saintly and holy, by the Holy Spirit. We see lives changed. We see great signs. We see mystic signs in the skies, like flying saucers. The Pentagon, many of the people putting it on television, writing it up. They don't know what to think about it. All kinds of mysterious signs! The Lord Jesus coming down in a form of a Pillar of Fire, have His picture taken, living among us, proving that He's the same yester-...

L-127 We see all these things happening. We see the coldness of the church. We see the denomination growing. "When you see the fig tree, and all the other trees putting forth their buds," Jews returning. "The fig tree," Jews returning to their nation, their own country. We see the Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Baptists, the Lutheran, the Pentecostals, all the churches, "putting forth their leaves," revival. He said, "Get ready! That's the time." When we see that coming to pass, that's when God is fixing to call His Elect. Then when you... Another sign. Said, "When you see the women becoming extremely pretty, when you see the sons of God taken them with wives, and taken unto them wives, and doing this, that, or the other," said, "know that that's the sign." Here we are.

L-128 Now, something else I had wrote down. Remember Lot's two daughters. Yes, we remember that, down in the city of Sodom. Jesus said here, in Luke 17, "As it was in the days of Sodom." Remember, that, men had misused women in such a way until the natural act of life was no more desired. And, oh, it's awful to say this from the platform, but this is... There ever was Truth, it ought to go from here. And it is so bad, today, till there is tens of thousands times thousands of them, on the increase everywhere, perversion, Sodomites, as it was in that day. Because the natural use of 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min human life to reproduce themselves upon the earth has been so mistreated, and so gone on in the way it has, until the desire of it is failing fastly. I'll say, within another ten or fifteen years it'll be past, almost, the way it's increasing now.

L-129 Great remarks. I had something from Edgar Hoover on that, but I don't know... I thought I had it laying here, but I haven't, of what he said about it. And now we find out these things. Oh, my!

L-130 Jude, in his little, big Book, I call it, in the 7th verse, let's just read it. I want to read this. Jude, in the 7th. This is the last Book before the Book of Revelations. I've got it marked down here, Jude 7, verse 7. Man and woman bringing marriage vows, breaking them, going after strange flesh! Listen. ... as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, give themselves over to fornication,... going after strange flesh,... (See? Oh.) fornication, going after strange flesh, are set forth of examples, of suffering, and vengeance, and eternal fire. That is, to be completely consumed and done away with.

L-131 Here some time ago, in Los Angeles, I was waiting, or was out at the campgrounds. I was riding up the road. And a--a little lady, a pretty little girl, very pretty, was going up the road. And I thought, "She must be going to a show." And she had on a little frontier clothes, just about--about a six or eight-inches-wide across the front of her, and a little three-or four-inch fringe hanging. And up high on her body, a little spot, just about enough that you could wad up and shut every bit of it up in your fist, hanging across her this way. With a cowboy hat on, and a pair of boots with tassels on them. And a very attractive, I could see where any young man would slide brakes and everything, to stop to her, going twisting up the road.

L-132 And I was fixing to turn to the campground, and I went up towards the campgrounds. And I started to turn around, to go back. I thought I'd stop, say, "Young lady, I wish to speak to you in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though you be a pretty girl, there is no doubt about that, though you have a figure that would probably... You, you want to hear the brakes whine. Do you realize that that spirit that's making you do that will drive you to a devil's hell where you'll suffer through the ages that is to come? Do you realize that that pretty, little formed body, and them well-set cheeks and hair, and so forth, and red lips, maybe in--in another six months the worms will be crawling in and out of that well-formed body, out here in the dust? And that soul that stays in there, today, will be in a devil's torment."

L-133 Then something stopped me, as if God would say, "If you do that, they'll lock you down yonder in jail." See? There you are. Then I seen Billy come out and motion, it was time to come. I hear them singing Only Believe.

L-134 Oh, my! How can people be bewitched in such stuff as that? Is because they disregard the Word of God.

L-135 And another thing, is ministers behind the platform, who is associated in these organizations, who read That and know It, are forbidden to say anything about It, because they'll drive their congregation away from them then. And the churches are looking for members. But God is looking for born-again saints of the living God, that will shine as the stars. God help us to be honest and tell the Truth, what Jesus Christ said. But that's the day we're living in. That's the signs that Jesus said would be, and we see it right before us.

L-136 Look now, and Jude the 7th chapter again, "Sodom and Gomorrah." Oh, my, what an awful thing! Unmarried to women, "going after strange flesh." A man that's married to his wife, they're--they're not no longer two, they're one. And a man that'll run out after another woman, he automatically separates himself from his wife. And a woman that runs out with another man, she is dead to her husband. She's denied her own flesh; she's cut away from him. That's right. In the Day of Judgment, will have to answer for it.

L-137 But today they don't want to hear a Message like that. The people don't want to hear That. They want to be tickled in their ears. Exactly what the Holy Spirit told me the day I laid that cornerstone there, said to: Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;... For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall... heap for themselves together teachers, having itching ears; ... and shall be turned from the truth, to fables. Said, "When the vision leaves, you read Second Timothy 4." Said, "Don't forget, Second Timothy 4!" And when the vision left me, standing right there on 7th Street, a nineteen-year-old boy standing there, the Voice of God spoke out in 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min the room, and He said, "Second Timothy 4." That's exactly what it's turned to be. See? "The time will come when they'll not endure sound doctrine."

L-138 People want something. The Pentecostals want something that can pat them on the back, and let them live the way they want to. And they can play the piano at forty beats per second, and jump up-and-down, and dance about it; and women do the way they want to, and man the same way. The Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran, and Baptist, there is a many a sincere person in all those organizations. That's exactly right. But that system has got them so bound down, till they think as long as they belong to that church, and their name is upon those books, that they're Heaven bound. Your name on a book here on earth, don't mean that to God. [Brother Branham snapped his finger--Ed.] Your name has got to be written in the Lamb's Book of Life, by the Blood of Jesus Christ, to know that your sins are forgiven. That's right.

L-139 But they want that kind. That's the kind of pastors they want in. They don't want nothing else. And when God in this last days has shook every Divine gift that's recommended in the Bible, every gift that Jesus Christ promised, every gift, and every sign, and every end-time sign. Everything that was promised in this Bible, as far as I can see, myself, has already been shook before the nation, and she plunges on towards hell as hard as she can go. Tell them? They'll run on, anyhow. Let me just get a few more Scriptures here before closing. All right. Oh, "Set forth for Eternal destruction," is what they are, the Bible says.

L-140 This nation lies in this same rot. This same social rottenness, this nation lies in it tonight. You know that. It's no joke. It's not a hearsay. It's the Truth. Genesis 6:12, "All flesh was corrupt, man walked in his own way," in his own thinking, ignoring the laws of God. That's the way man does today. Man don't want to hear the Word of God. People don't want to hear It. They want to walk in their own way.

L-141 Jezebel refused to hear the Word of the Lord. She wouldn't want to call that old fuzzy-looking preacher, Elijah, her pastor. But he was her pastor, anyhow. Right. God sent him, and he bellowed out his message. Though uneducated, they don't know where he come from or where he went to. He came on the scene with the Word of the Lord. He sent his message, that he preached, and he condemned everything there was, called sin. That, that modern Jezebel, had switched and bewitched the people under the witchcraft of her powers until the whole nation was corrupted, and Elijah stood alone out there on the mountain. God said, "Elijah, don't think that. I've got seven thousand down there that's honest in heart, yet." That's his second pull, and the third one went back for them.

L-142 But remember, God was merciful, and He--He... And Elijah's message condemned that unbelieving generation. Noah's message condemned that generation, and brought judgment upon those who refused to hear it, and deliverance to those who believed it. "And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man."

L-143 Genesis 6, ignoring God's laws! They say, "God's laws?" God's Word says today, in the Bible! Now listen, I'm not saying this to any individual person. I'm only responsible, as your brother. I'm responsible for telling you the whole Truth, as the great Saint Paul said before his leaving, "I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God."

L-144 Now, the Bible says, today, that women should not cut their hair. I don't care how many preachers say that that's all right; it's wrong. I don't care how many churches stands for it; the Bible still says that it is wrong. "It's a shame for her to do so." But they continue to do it, anyhow, going on. What are they doing? In their own mind, making their ownselves pretty, they think they're pretty.

L-145 God's Word warns, she shall not do these things. "She shall not put on a garment, or slack, or anything that pertains to a man," but she goes right on just the same. Try to stop her? Say, "What are you hollering about then, Brother Branham? What you going on? Why, people like you better if you'd..." I don't care, that. I do care what people think. Now don't get me wrong. But I'm interested in what God thinks, and This is His Word. Yeah, you tell her it's wrong to do that, she'll go right ahead and do it, anyhow. See? Why? Women in all Christendom 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min do these things, and the church don't seem to care anything about it. Why is it? The sons of God has fell for the lust of female flesh and blood, and denied the very God and Blood that bought them, to separate them from those filthy things. Amen. That's the Truth. So help me God, it's the Truth.

L-146 Try to stop her? You think Noah's preaching had any hindrance? No, sir. But what is it? It's a voice, the Voice. And when we're all called to the Judgment, the very Message that I'm preaching, tonight, will meet me right there, Word by Word. And then what are you going to do? It's a flashing red Light.

L-147 There was a time, bull-headed amongst the women. We're going to... We will just set this, because of this being women. And you wonder why I'm always hollering about this. Now I'm going to lay, get a lot--lot of Scriptures throwed in here before closing, and show you why. And that's the reason I've got to stay true to this Word, and every servant of God ought to stay true to the Word. You must stay, because there's got to be a voice somewhere crying out against it. I don't care what the rest of them does; you're not responsible for them. You answer as an individual. You don't answer as a Methodist, you don't answer as a Baptist, or a Pentecostal. You answer as an individual, to God, for your own life.

L-148 And we see these signs, and yet they go on doing it. Tell her it's wrong, see what she says. Bull-headed! That's exactly what Eve done. Eve knowed better than to do that. Did she? She had the Word of God. Said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you die." Well, why did she do it? She wanted her own way. And why will women cut their hair; why will women wear these clothes, and the Bible saying that that's just exactly what they're supposed to do? And the thing that they're doing, they're all condemned. Exactly. But why does she do it? She's got her own self. Yes, sir. She is going to have her own way. And the church says nothing about it. And the church is supposed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ, and say nothing about it?

L-149 Tell one of them about it, you know what they say? In so much as to say, "No old Bible is going to stand in my way from having some fun." Now just exactly. You tell them it's written in the Bible. Oh, they might not say those words, but that's what they express. Did you ever hear the old saying, "Actions speak louder than words"? Well, then, does it? Actions speaks louder than words. No matter what you're saying, your--your life speaks so loud till they can't hear your testimony. As I said this morning, just jump as high as you live. See? Your actions speaks louder than your words. And you just might as well come out and say it, because their own words speak. Your--your words, no matter what it is, your actions speaks what--what you are. If you speak anything different than what you really are, it becomes hypocrisy. Jesus said, "You hypocrites! How can you say good things, when out of the heart speaks, out of the heart speaketh the mouth?" See, they were saying something they didn't mean. And women so, is to say it, oh, my, "Have my own fun."

L-150 What happens? Out of marriage... Here is another place in the Bible. Out of marriage goes the vow, "obey." Obey? "A keeper at home, chaste, of good works." She laughs in your face and goes to the powder plant, somebody's office. "My husband..." Yeah. Oh, I doubt that. You see forces today, such a disgrace, put women on the police force. If that isn't a mark of--of debauchery among any city! As many man is out of work, and they have to put them women out there, when the Bible said she is to "stay home and be a chaste keeper at home." But she keeps all the boss' books, and yours, too. Yes. That's right. I ain't talking about good women now. I'm not throwing this to you women that's really godly women. God bless you. That's on tape, or wherever more. But I'm talking about, where you find one like that, you find fifteen hundred the other way. They won't listen to a Word. "Keep your Bible! Preach It to yourself. We don't want to hear It." Obey? Oh!

L-151 She might say this, "You tell your Bible stories to somebody else. Keep your God to somebody else, and leave me alone. What are you hollering at me about? I never did ask you to say these things." I know, but God did. See? So that's all.

L-152 So they still corrupt the way. Just as they did in the days of the Lord, just as they did in that day, so do they today, 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min just the same. It hasn't changed. It doesn't change. It won't change.

L-153 Juvenile delinquency finally gets her children. The jail gets part of the women and the man, and hell takes the whole thing, that's exactly right, finally swallows them all up. And the preaching seems to go over the top of their backs. They never listen to It. They're going to have their own. You can tell them the Bible says This. They say, "Keep your Bible. We're going to have our fun."

L-154 I can hear some of you sisters saying now, maybe not right present, but hear you saying, "Who, me obey my husband? Huh! I make him obey me." But there is where you're wrong. "Stay at home, chaste? I don't care what the Bible says about it, you leave me alone!" Listen, sister, that wasn't in, back in the Dark Ages, that's the voice of today. That never happened so much back in the antediluvian, it happens today too. That's the same thing.

L-155 Again they say, "I'm a modern woman. I live in America." Well, that's no more than you live in a hog pen. It wouldn't make a bit of difference to God where you lived. You are what you are in your heart. That's right. And don't think, sister, that you're so modern, that you're one of these modern women, as you want to say today. You're from a way back, according to this Bible, in dark ages, in the antediluvian time. In the time of Noah, that's when they did the same thing. So you're not so very modern, after all, are you? See? That's the way they acted in the antediluvian world. See? And that's the way they're acting today, so it must be dark age again, back in the great dark beyond.

L-156 And you man that will let your wife do it, you're no longer sons of God. No, you kind of fell into Sodom, that's right, let the women boss you around. Oh, my!

L-157 I don't know whether to say this or not. I better by-pass this part. But, all right. This is terrible, but all to this age that we're living in. You see the red light on, flashing? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] The trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more, And morning will break Eternal, bright and fair; Then His chosen ones shall gather (from the dust of the earth) to their Home beyond the sky. Oh, what a day that will be! All right. Oh, yes!

L-158 Go back in Sodom? Don't worry, there is an A-bomb waiting to clean it all up, that's right, clean up the whole world. It'll do it. And then it'll all be renewed again, like we seen under the Sixth Seal, for a redeemed bunch of people who has accepted the Lord Jesus, who has become Christian, who has sold out their cares and their fashions of this world, and has come to Jesus Christ, and looking to Him and Him alone; in His humble, simple program, to come and believe on Him, and receive Eternal Life. And if you say you got Eternal Life, and disagree with this Bible, your eternal life is not the Eternal Life that God gives. You're deceived, by death, and not of Life. That's right.

L-159 Now, oh, "Fear God and keep His Word, for this is the full commandment." The red lights are flashing, and the time is at hand. As it was in the days of Noah, see, they took the legitimate thing and perverted it. They took eating, and they took drinking, and they put building, and they put all these other things, and perverted it. Now, Jesus expects us to build a home, see; but just look what has taken place in that. Eating, He expects us to eat, that's right; look what's taken place in that. Drinking, we expect to drink our waters and whatever we have to do; but, instead of that, they've took it into drinks and liquor, and everything, and cocktails, bringing their women in. See?

L-160 And what about the increase of population, as it was in the days of Noah? What about the beauty of women increasing constantly, more and more? See? Red light! What about the time that women would come, when they would be the way they were, "heady, high-minded," and everything, couldn't tell them nothing? Preach the Word to them, they'll go right on do it anyhow. See? What will happen? Just exactly like it was in the days of Noah. One day, the door of mercy will be closed. Then the Scripture says, "the sanctuary become smoky," that means that the Intercessor has gone from it. And as long as the Lamb is still back there... As I said this morning, or somewhere I was preaching, that, as long as the Lamb is there to make intercession, there is still mercy. But what assurance do we have, when we see the train is already in the block, when we see the Coming of the Lord, the flashing of the light?

L-161 How I could speak of different things as we know that He promised to do here in the last days, and we see it right 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min before them. And then we see this subject tonight, of another red light flashing, of carrying on among our women, and things the way they're doing. We see it's pointing, every--every milepost, everything, every needle, every compass, is set straight onto His Coming. We're at the end. There is nothing else that I know to happen but the Coming of the Lord.

L-162 And then, my dear friend that's outside of Christ, what do you think about this? Are you just resting... Honestly, friend, I want to ask you a simple question. Are you just resting upon some little sensation you had, or some, maybe, something that you had? Maybe you got happy one time and danced all over the place, as many the holiness people and Pentecostals, and Nazarenes, and Pilgrim Holiness. They believe if they get happy enough to dance, that that's It. And then cut your hair, wear shorts? Would the Holy Spirit make you do that, when He condemns it in the Bible?

L-163 What about you who says, "Well, I belong to the church. I'm a Pentecostal. I'm a Methodist, or whatever I am. I'm a member! My mother is a charter member of the church. I've been a charter member"? And the very spirit that's on you is making you do the things that this Bible condemns for you to do. See? You say, "I've spoke with tongues, Brother Branham. Now, don't you get a hold of that. I spoke with tongues, and that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost." If your life... If you can still cut your hair, if you can still do these things the Bible says not do; you could speak with tongues all day and night, and it's still nothing to do with God. The tree is known by its fruit.

L-164 I'm getting old. I know that. Each day I get a new ache and pain. Every one of us do. You might as well tell the truth. I thought, "God, don't let me..." One of the most miserable things, is to see a man or woman who has never accepted Christ, and just lived an old mossback church member, meaner than Satan himself, and see him out there, with crabbed old something, "Well, I tell you, I don't believe in the..." God never... That's a--that's a... That's the horriblest crown that Satan can crown a life with. A grouchy old woman, about sixty or seventy years old, with fat hanging down under her arms, and the wrinkles all over her face, and her hair bobbed up, in four or five different colors, and strutting herself down in a pair of little shorts; if that ain't the crowning of Satan, I never seen it, or some old crabbed man.

L-165 O God, I know I... Give me grace to never complain. And I want my life, Lord, I want my people's life... God, grant that our life could be crowned, no matter if we suffer, whatever takes place, how many turns against me. I know this one thing in my life, as I get older, my friends, the stream behind me, will soon be running out, narrower and narrower, as I go down the road. And I know one thing, it'll come to pass after a while that there'll be nobody come to me and say... ask me advice. The ones who know me in my younger days will be gone on, if I shall live. My friends will get fewer and fewer, as I get older now.

L-166 And I know that someday I've got to die. I hope that God never lets Satan crown me as an old crabbed, indifferent man, and my wife an old nagging woman, or your wife, or you that way. I pray, brother, that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the Spirit; love, joy, long-suffering, gentleness, patience, Truth, faith, in the Holy Spirit.

L-167 My life thins out. About thirty-five years ago I stood in the pulpit here, as a little boy. Tonight I'm an old, gray in hair, and bald-headed, stooping shoulder; I'm broke down. My life is running out, and the threads are getting brittle that I'm walking on. As I move on down the stream, my friends get fewer. And after a while it'll come to a place, maybe, that I--I won't enjoy the songs like I used to; and maybe my grandchildren, the children will have to say, "Don't make grandpa nervous." It may come to that if I live.

L-168 Then I'll come on down till I can't get up out of my chair. Then one morning the fog will come into the room, I'll motion across the border, to death, to come get me. He can only take me by the hand and lead me across to my Master. He is not my slave-driver. I am not his slave. He is my slave. Christ conquered death for me. And only one thing he can do, is pull me in the Presence of my Maker, "When this earthly tabernacle be dissolved."

L-169 The moment when a mother is fixing to have a baby, you notice, I don't care how cruel she's been, and how mean. You know, a while before that baby is born, the mother gets gentle. Why is it? When them little muscles in that womb is twitching and jumping like that, there is a heavenly body waiting for it. And when it comes from the mother, the doctor or the midwife, whoever it is has to pick it up and shock it, spank it, shake it, or something, and then it catches 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min the breath of life. And the little angelic spirit comes into it, the breath of life, and it becomes a living soul. And when we have Christ in our heart, and Christ becomes real in our heart, it's a little baby. "If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved..."

L-170 Jesus said, in John 14. In closing, I'll say this. He said, "Don't let your hearts be troubled; if you've believed in God, believe in Me. For, in My Father's Kingdom is many tabernacle. I'll go and prepare a place for you." When this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one. "I'll go and prepare a place for you, that where I am, there may ye be also." Wants to be with Him.

L-171 Then I know, as this little child cries, for the new birth has been formed; when all other life breaks away, all mortal life and everything is gone, then it'll take something to shock me, and it takes death. Death gives you the shock, when it strikes you, but it only borns you again in a new Kingdom, over on the other side where there is no sickness, sorrow, no old age, or nothing. God help us.

L-172 How, friend, can you ever turn down something like that, seeing that there's no hopes in the world, outside of Jesus Christ? The red lights are flashing. Nations are breaking, Israel's awakening, The signs that the Bible foretold; (women cutting their hair, wearing shorts; the red light is on, see) Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; "Return, O dispersed, to your own." The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, have your lamp trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near!

L-173 I love Him. I want you to love Him. And as we bow our heads just a moment, in a word of prayer, in closing. The red lights are flashing. The signal is on. The Coming of the Lord is at hand. He speaks to the nations. He speaks to the people. He speaks through the signs and wonders. As we took Sodom and showed how that Angel come to Abraham, the signs that He performed just ere the falling of the fire, we see that.

L-174 He said, "In the days of Lot, they built, they sold." Look at it today. "And as the days of Noah," women becoming pretty, the sons of God falling, human flesh being worshipped in the form of females, and all these things that's taking place, that we've talked of tonight. The light's a flashing, the Coming of the Lord is at hand. Are you still just a church member? Are you sure, my friend? How do you know you'll live through the night? Look at Brother Way standing here this morning, in a moment, just turning around to shake hands with somebody, dropped dead right in his track. God might not be so kind to you as to give you another opportunity. You don't know what minute that that heart makes its last beat. Think of it.

L-175 The Coming of Christ is flashing its signs. Look at them. See if what I've told you tonight... It may not be very popular, but it's the Truth. It's what God said, and here we are.

L-176 Women don't want to stay home. They don't want to take care of their families. They just hire a babysitter and go out to a party somewhere. Juvenile delinquent, all things is taking place; bobbing their hair, wearing shorts, make-up. The increase is getting prettier and prettier. Man, sons of God, are falling. It's a trap for Satan to use, the sons of God to fall into that. Just as Jesus said, it has to happen. He said it would be there, and here it is. He said, "When these things come to pass, this generation will not pass away," and that's forty years, "until all these things be fulfilled." Think of it.

L-177 Are you still just a church member? Have you done wrong? Look and search your life over, tonight, men, women. Look at yourself, look at your own faults. What, in your present state now, if Christ was on earth preaching this? You say "If--if He would have, if I'd have heard Him preach that, I--I would have repented." If you would, This is His Own Word tonight, you'll do it now. If you're without God, and you know...

L-178 "Oh," you say, "I belong to church. I've spoke in tongues. I--I don't..." Now we're laying that aside. Look at 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min yourself, check your life now with God's Word. Are you that person to walk away and say, "I don't care what the Bible says. Brother Branham, I think you're wrong"? It ain't me that's wrong. If there's any wrong about it, It's the Word. And you don't know God yet, and you're not sure that if Jesus should come at this hour that you'd be ready to go. Why would you trifle, when seeing death is so close, when see the end is so close?

L-179 If there is any here, with your heads bowed now, would want to be remembered in prayer as we close, would you just raise up your hand and say, "Brother, pray for me." God bless you, sister. God bless you, brother, sister. Oh, just over the building.

L-180 That's it, let's just take a little inventory now. You sisters now, with all good faith and hope, just think of this. "Have I really obeyed God? Really, where is my desire? Brother Branham, I--I--I--I still do these things. I--I feel good. I feel happy." Do you know heathens feel just as happy? You know, a drunk man is just as happy, under liquor, as you are, the influence of liquor? And if you're happy under anything that's contrary to the Word of God, it's the devil. If you say, "I'm satisfied in my church," and you hear the Word of God preached, and won't tally up to It, you're inspired by the wrong thing, no matter what your inspiration is. I've seen them scream, and jump and holler, and--and everything, and drink blood out of a human skull, and call on the devil, that's right, just as happy as you ever could be. Heathenism produces just as much psychology as anything else, psychics of the mind. But the experience of Christ is of the heart, that change the whole make up, changes the person into a new creature. Think of it, real hard.

L-181 Look at yourself. Just imagine a mirror before you, you're look at yourself. "Am I honest? Am I sincere? Do I really, in my heart, do I serve the Lord?"

L-182 Say, "I serve It." And look in, you women with bobbed hair, wear shorts. Look at you that does these things. Look at you man who let your wives do it; say, "Am I a son of God? Am I a Sodomite?" You women say, "Am I really a modern woman, or am I some antediluvian something that Jesus said would be here in the last days again?" Think it over. Look at yourself.

L-183 See, your own being expresses what you are. And if you're not right, will you be honest enough just to... Be honest now, raise your hand, say, "Christ, I don't hold my hand to Brother Branham or to no other person but You, but I am wrong. Forgive me. Brother Branham promised to pray for me, now I'm going to raise my hand, say, 'Jesus, have mercy on me tonight. Save me for Christ's sake. I don't want to be lost. All this life You've give me, it would be a most horrible thing if I--if I just throw it away, when I have this golden opportunity tonight to really see with my own eyes that the red lights are flashing on every side; the Coming of the Lord, the promise that He would show these signs, and He'd heal the sick, He'd raise the dead, He'd cast out devils; there'd be a bunch--a bunch, just a few people, just a minority that the world would be making fun of, and calling bad names, and so forth, like that.'"

L-184 And they have to call us bad names. They have to call the Truth bad names. Jesus said, "Whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven, when He's doing the very same thing you see done." He said, "But whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, when It comes to do the same thing, will never be forgiven in this world." See, they have to do that. There has to be a Message like that, to make the people make fun of It, to show God's justice to condemn the whole world and destroy it.

L-185 While there is mercy and someone standing in the gap, Jesus Christ, and a open door tonight, won't you receive Him, my friend?

L-186 Now, customarily, it's come to the altar. That's all right. I have nothing against it. But the Scripture, It said, "As many as believed was baptized." From all your heart, if you'll surrender your life to Jesus Christ right where you're setting, right where He spoke to you when you raised your hand!

L-187 That same God that could call this man back to life, being laying dead right before me this morning, to confirm to you that I'm telling you the Truth. Who can raise the dead but God? That's right. So it isn't your--your little broke-up pastor here, it's the Christ that loves you. And He is expressing to you tonight, "You've heard the Truth. You've saw the Truth. It's from My Word. You seen My Word call back. You see My Word predict these things. You see it happen just 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min exactly through all these years, without one failure."

L-188 Now what will you do with Jesus, while the red light is flashing? Why don't you do this, throw down that old sack of worldly peanuts! Why don't you throw down that old True Story magazine, and that old--old junk that you're pulling your soul through every day! Why don't you scoot that television in a corner and turn it around, if it's keeping you away from church! Why don't you lay aside every weight that so easily besets you! Why don't you raise your heart to Christ, and say, "Christ, tonight I'm finished. I'm making ready. I see You're coming. I'm picking up the suitcase, God's Bible, that's packed with Eternal Life, and, from henceforth on, I'll live from This!" Won't you do it, while we pray?

L-189 Our Heavenly Father, not meaning to be rude, by no means, Lord. But the Message is pointed at the time, not at individuals, not at any certain person, but it's pointed at the time. It's a time the Holy Spirit seemed to press me to tape this. As after many, many times across this pulpit, that we have showed the days of Lot, the days of Sodom, the days that Jesus spoke of, the signs of the time, the coming of the Lord, in many ways. And then after all that I have spoken so hard against the women of this day and around the country, then, Father, I thought it would be the Holy Spirit speaking to me that I would tell the people why I have done this. It's because that Your inspired Word has so probbed at my heart, till I just could not hold the peace.

L-190 Some nearly fifty or seventy-five hands in the building went up, Father, upon a crude, cutting Word of the Lord. But It's brought them to a shock, to let them know that the whistle is blowing; the saints are all gathering together; the nations are tearing to pieces; the signs of the Coming; the red lights are flashing. And we see, by the action, pointed to our women tonight of this day, that the way that the Bible said they would be, and here they are.

L-191 The infallible Voice of Jesus Christ warned us to watch the days of Noah and compare it with the day that we live. And then when we seen those things happen, women becoming fair, and sons of God taking them, and how these things would be, then we know that that generation would see the Coming of the Lord. Then, we know the flashing light, His coming is near.

L-192 I pray, Heavenly Father, that You will bless each one that raised their hand. I--I just offer this humble, sincere prayer, and I know You'll hear me. You were so kind to Brother Way this morning, to let a humble little prayer start that heart beating again, a sincere love for a brother that had dropped into his wife's lap, cold and dead form. Lord, let people know tonight that being dead in sin and trespasses is far more dangerous than dying a physical death; for there is no one can catch you at that time, if you pass beyond the veil, in sin and trespasses. Grant tonight, Lord, that, every soul that raised their hands; I offer this prayer in the Name of the Lord Jesus; that there will be such a revolution come to their life, that there'll be such a purpose in their heart, that purpose in their heart that they'll sin no more against God; that they'll stand, from this hour on, upon God's Eternal, blessed Word and be fed by His Holy Spirit, and led into the paths of Life, day by day, as they journey on from this hour, henceforth.

L-193 Now, Heavenly Father, I may never see them, I may never be able to shake their physical hand here in this earth, though I'd like to do it. But, Lord God, I pray that this prayer will be answered. And You said in Your Word, "He that will hear My Word, and will believe on Him that sent Me, has Eternal Life; and shall not come to the Judgment, but has passed from death unto Life." In my humble way of bringing the Truth of God, tonight, many heard the Word. Now, You promised that You would save them, and they "would not perish," that, no man could pluck them from Your hand, that You would raise them up at the last days, not one hair of their head should perish. You promised it.

L-194 Now, as a prayer, as a servant, Lord, and as a brother to--to them, I--I pray this prayer and place them into the hands of God, that not one harm shall ever be able to come to them, and Satan will not pluck them from the hand of God. They are Yours, trophies. And I trust that You'll give them long life, and if possible, let them see the Coming of the Lord Jesus. May they go from here tonight, and to be soul winners, to tell others, to bring them to a saving knowledge of Christ. Grant it. It's all into Your hands, Father. In the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-195 And while we have our heads bowed just a moment. I wonder if such person present now, that feels that while we were in prayer that--that something unusual happened in your heart, and you feel that from now on that you are going 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min to live a consecrated life to Christ, and you see the Coming of the Lord at hand, you believe what I preached was the Truth, about this flashing red light, of the way things are. And--and you understand that it's the Word of the Lord, 'cause it's Christ, and you believe, from tonight on, you'll live a better, closer life to Christ, because the prayer that you prayed tonight and the confession you made. And with your head bowed, you just raise your hand, say, "I believe it. From this night on, I'll live a different life." God bless you. That's fine. That's just wonderful. I believe to say practically everyone, perhaps, that raised their hand a while ago, raised their hands back that they have accepted it.

L-196 Now if you've never been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, remember, "There is not another name under Heaven given among man whereby you must be saved, but the Name of Jesus Christ." Remember, there is only one Bride, the Bride of Christ, and that bears His Name.

L-197 Now, and if you've never been baptized by immersing in water, in the Name of Jesus Christ, let me as His servant... If God has proven to you by signs and wonders, and by His Word, that I tell the Truth; I command you as Saint Paul did, in Acts 19, who found a bunch of Baptists. They had been baptized by John the Baptist. He said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" They said, "We know... whether there be any Holy Ghost." He said, "Then to what was you baptized?" They said, "We've been baptized already, by John the Baptist, out in the Jordan, the same man that baptized Jesus Christ."

L-198 That would be a wonderful baptism, but Paul said, "It's no good now." He commanded them they would have to be rebaptized again, in the Name of Jesus Christ, Acts 19:5. And Paul said, "If an Angel comes down from Heaven and preaches any other gospel than This that I have preached, let him be accursed," Galatians 1:8. Then he repeated it again, said, "As I have said, so say I again. 'Though a Angel,'" let alone a minister, bishop, pope, or whatever it might be, "if a Angel come down from Heaven, a--a Cherubim out of the Heavens, and preached another gospel than That, let him be cursed." Then, I command you, if you've never been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, while the water is in the pool, and the robes are waiting, come and be baptized, "Calling upon the Name of the Lord, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; for the promise is unto you and to your children, and to them that's far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."

L-199 Our Heavenly Father, now it's up to You. Persuading man, I try; but to make man, I cannot. And You never work against a man's will; because, if a man or woman is predestinated to Eternal Life, when the Light of God flashes over that seed, it'll come to Life. And if there is Life among us tonight, Father, that You flashed Your Light over, and they've seen the Truth, may they walk humbly and sweetly to the pool, to be baptized into the Name of Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ.

L-200 Which, we know that every person in the Scripture had to be baptized, and rebaptized. Those who were not baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, had to be rebaptized. And the great apostle, who had the keys to the Kingdom, said on the Day of Pentecost, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, that your sins may be remitted, and then the promise of the Holy Ghost is to you." Grant that it will be carried out tonight, in full measure, Father.

L-201 I commit them to You now. "Take these few words and the meditation of my heart, and may it be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord." And anchor upon Thy children, and give to them Eternal Life. Save all those who are savable, and heal those that are sick. May the grace of God rest upon each of them, as we commit them to You now, in Jesus' Name.

L-202 Now with our heads bowed, I'm going to ask our sister that plays the piano to come here. Just a moment, just about five more minutes. And if there is any that desires to be baptized now, that's made a confession and believed. If you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and you believe it with all your heart, not just--just emotional, but you believe it, and you are ready to confess that you're wrong; and you're not standing upon your own merits, but upon what He done; and you're ready to walk forward, to take on His Name in water baptism, become a member of the Body by the Holy Spirit; then, the women's room is on my right, and the man's room is on my left, with robes and things 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min ready.

L-203 While we bow our heads, as our sister plays, "I can hear my Saviour calling," if the song leader will give us a little word of that. With our heads bowed now, the service is in the hand of Almighty God now; to whoever wishes to be baptized; wishes to go into the prayer rooms to pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, there is instructors here will be ready to instruct or do anything. May the Words not fall in vain, but may they accomplish that from which it's purposed. With our heads bowed, may we pray now. And, and where He leads you, follow. I can hear my... Now pray, every sinner. I can hear my Saviour... Could you hear Him call, when He raised the dead man this morning? I can hear... Could you hear Him calling, when you hear the Word flashing Its Light at the end time? I'll go with Him, with Him... Are you willing to go all the way? Where He... God bless you, my brother. The men to the left. The women to the right. I... Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads... The Bible said, "As many as believed were baptized." ... follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, The Holy Ghost...?... I'll go with Him through the... If somebody will go with the women over here, for seeking the Holy Spirit, go in the room to the right, some of you sisters instructed in the Lord. ... all the way. Where He leads... Can you honestly say that, "Where He leads me I'll follow"? Will you do it? What about the little Voice speaks to you, will you--will you go where He leads you? Watch the red light. See the light flashing? We're at the end time. Where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. I can hear my Saviour... How does He speak? Through His Word, in your heart. Will you come now? This is your invitation. Remember, if it happens before we come together again, you've been warned. ... hear my Saviour calling, "Take thy cross, and follow, follow Me." Where He... Now will some of the brethren, for instructions, go in the room here to my left, with the brethren getting ready for baptism. "Where He lead..." Some of the minister brothers here, come and help us, step in the room with them. ... follow, Where He leads me... Do you really mean it? ... follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

L-204 Now, just a moment. Now, if you have not been baptized in water, by immersing in the Name of the Lord Jesus 63-0623E, The Flashing Red Light Of The Sign Of His Coming, Branham Tabernacle, Jeffersonville, IN, 140 min Christ. Just only the titles, "Father, Son, Holy Spirit," there was never a person in all the Bible, not one person, was ever baptized in the Bible, in the Name of the "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," in that title. No person was ever baptized in the church, in history, for the first three hundred years this side, every one was baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, until the Nicaea Council at Nicaea, Rome, where the Roman Catholic church was organized, then they substituted the titles of "Father, Son, Holy Ghost."

L-205 If there's a historian, a minister, any other person, on air, in tape, that can produce one Scripture or one speck of history, where anybody was ever baptized any other way than in the Name of Jesus Christ, till the Roman Catholic church at Nicaea, Rome, you're duty bound to bring it to me, let me apologize. There is no such thing. No. And every person that was baptized by immersing, that was not baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, was commanded, before they could enter Glory, to come back and be rebaptized again. Now it's up to you.

L-206 There is no Scripture in the Bible, where any persons was ever baptized, using the name of the "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," as the people baptize today. It's a Catholic, Roman Catholic creed that was handed down through Martin Luther, and John Wesley, kept running on. And the Bible predicts it would be that way, and would run out in the last days, and the door would be open, as we just went through the church ages to see it.

L-207 It's up to you. I'm just a messenger of the Message. Once again, let's believe it. The doors are open. The baptistery is full, and there is no reason... There is robes ready, and we'll be ready to baptize in the next few minutes.

L-208 If you're here and have not been baptized, once more let us sing, and come, won't you? Fulfill...

L-209 You say, "I intend to do that someday, Brother Branham." That someday may meet you like it did Brother Way this morning, but maybe not the grace to follow, as it did. You may go any minute. Whether you're young, if you live through the night, you'll... And if you're seventy years old, you'll outlive many ten-year-old, and fifteen-, thirty-year-old people. Thousands of them will die through the night. That's right. You don't know when you're going.

L-210 Be sure. Don't take a chance on that. Just remember, you can take a chance on your work, or you take a chance on this, but don't you take a chance on That. Remember, my voice will be a witness on God's magnetic tape at the Day of the Judgment, against it.

L-211 But now think of it, as we sing again with our heads bowed. "Where He..." Brother Neville. "... I will follow." Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O. Box 4951 Naperville, IL 60567 USA Email: thevoice1017@lwbcast.org http://www.lwbcast.org/ Standing In The Gap
