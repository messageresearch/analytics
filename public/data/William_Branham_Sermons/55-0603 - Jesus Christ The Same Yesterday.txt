--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Remember that God hath set in the church, some apostles, teachers, prophets, evangelist, and so forth, gifts of healing, and divers kinds of gifts, that God has put in the church for the perfecting of the body of Christ. I believe we're living in the shadows of the coming, as I say again. I believe that this light fell in the eastern country on the day of Pentecost, when there was great moving amongst the Jewish people at the first, when the Holy Spirit was first poured out on the eastern people. The prophet said there would be a day that would not be day nor night, kind of a--a dismal day, kind of cloudy. "But in the evening," He said, "there would be light." And the same light that shined on the Jews in the orient in the eastern country in the beginning... We've come to a day that they denied the gifts of God, the power of God, yet there was enough light for to believe that there was a God and Christ was His Son. And we've accepted it, and joined churches, and built great schools, and so forth which is to be appreciated.

L-2 But, friends, the light shown on the eastern people; we are the western people. And the prophet said, "It'll be light in the evening time." I believe we're in the evening. And the same sun that shined on the Jews in the eastern country is shining on the Gentiles in the last days in the western country, just before the setting of the sun. You might differ from that, but let's come out this week. Let's get our hearts together; lay down our little differences. Let's come out now and just look right straight in the face of God and say, "God I am not here to criticize; I'm here to learn of Thee. And teach me, oh Lord." And if any man lack wisdom let him ask of God Who can give it. And I believe that God will-will show Himself to you and make Himself known.

L-3 Now, Divine healing, teaching it... Tommy Osborn, and Tommy Hicks, Oral Roberts, many of the other teachers across the world, and Mr. Bosworth, F. F. Bosworth who's one of my field managers... They're great scholars on the Scripture. And they're top men, learned men. And they can take a Scripture and tie Satan in such a place till he just can't get out of it. That's all. I might not be able to do that. I was raised of a poor parent. My education is very limited. But when I was borned in the little mountain cabin in Kentucky, there was something happened. A Light came in the room. And that Light has followed me all the days of my life. My people before me, Catholic. And my father and mother didn't attend church at all. I never was in a church house since the day I was... Well, I suppose about eight days old or ten when my mother take me up to old Southern Baptist Church up there for Sunday school. And I was dedicated to the Lord. And from that time, I suppose the next time I was in church I was in church I was about twenty-three years old. But all down through life there keep being something happen like visions. I'd see things. It'd foretell me things that's coming to pass.

L-4 My ministering brethren seemed to tell my after I was converted years later that it was the devil. And I... It scared me. Because I'm sure, friends... I want to go to heaven the same as you want to go to heaven. I love the Lord like you love the Lord. And I don't want to be wrong; I want to be right. I'd rather just quit and walk away, and--than to try to misrepresent anything willfully. I want to be honest. I want to be truthful. I want to be your brother. And--and I want God's blessings on what I do. And then one night alone He spoke to me. It's all written in the book here. They'll have it in a night or two if they haven't got it tonight. And if you'd would like to question any of it, any officials of the city, where I come from, or anyone, the churches or so forth, call them up at my expense. And you will see that it's true.

L-5 Now, tonight being the beginning night, and everyone comes out, and just about one tenth of the people has ever been in the meeting before. It becomes a place, no matter what I would talk about... First thing we ought to place this on the Scripture. Have a little meeting tonight, and tomorrow night we will gather again if God willing and continue on. 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min And as you, if you don't understand, you just promise this that, you will keep coming, looking into it, studying the Scriptures. Bring your pencil and paper. Run the Scriptures down. Attend the afternoon services, so we can understand what it means to be healed. Now, I believe that healing is in the atonement, that it was included when Isaiah said, "He was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed." When Jesus died at Calvary, He saved every sinner that ever was. But it will never do you no good, until you personally accept it as your personal Saviour. And He healed every sick person that would ever be sick. But it'll never do you no good until you accept it as your own personal property. "He was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we were healed." It's all past tense. All God can do for you He's already did when He, Jesus died for--to reconcile sinners and back to Christ at Calvary.

L-6 Now, that's the Gospel, friends, as clear as I know it. Now, it's the individual. Now, maybe say, "Well, what's the use in preaching?" That's what a minister's for. God sent preachers to preach the Word. When you hear It, search it, see it's the truth, accept it. Now, the preacher doesn't save you. His message doesn't save you. Your personal faith in a risen Lord Jesus is what saves you. No matter how much you'd cry. How loud you would holler. How much you would take on. It'll never save you until you believe it with all your heart, and stand up, and confess it. For He's the High Priest of our confession, Hebrews 3, or what we confess He's the High Priest to make intercessions upon what we confess is the truth. Anything that was included in the atonement is the personal property of every believer. When a man gets saved or a women, boy, or girl, God gives them a checkbook, as it was, with Jesus' Name at the bottom of every check for anything redemptive blessing that Jesus died for. It's your personal property. Don't be afraid to fill it out. The bank of heaven will recognize it. Jesus said, "Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it. Whatever you ask the Father in My Name that I will do," the unlimited unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ in that promise.

L-7 Now, but before you could do it... Now, God does that, then He sends people into the church such as preachers, teachers, evangelist, gifts of healing... Don't mean the man now can heal you; it means that he has faith in what he's talking about and proves it by the Bible. After that there's prophets; that's seers. All those gifts are without repentance. They... God sent to that... Office gifts are sent by God, foreordained of God. And they're set into the church. They're borned in you. Them traits are borned in you when you come to this world. You just find your position, go on with Christ. And all those things are in the Kingdom of God. And all of it's for the perfecting of the Church and to bring it together. Now, I wish to read just a little Scripture here out of the Bible cause my words are a man's. God's Words are eternal and will never fail. And we will try to pray for some sick people. I see they got a group lined up here. And so I will speak to you just a moment on the Scripture, and then we will pray for the sick.

L-8 How many here ever knew Congressman Upshaw? Wasn't he the congressman here in Georgia? Well, you remember, it was Congressman Upshaw who was, that I'd seen the vision over Mr. Upshaw; never seen him in my life, when he was rolled in that place like something like this in California. And I've seen him playing on a hay stack where he fell and hurt his back and so forth. Then seen him in a few minutes going by tipping his hat like that. I said, "Well, Congressman, I... You're healed. Jesus Christ makes you well." Away he went, crutches, wheelchair. And he walked until God taken him home, touching his toes and so forth. Over in the book of Jude now for a little word. And let's study closely together for about fifteen minutes. In the 3rd verse we read this: Beloved, I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful... me to write unto you, and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints. And then as a text tonight I want to use Hebrews 13:8: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to day, and forever. Shall we bow our heads again just a moment.

L-9 Heavenly Father, now this lovely people, who's gathered here in this great sunshine state of Georgia, we've heard 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min much of their faith, how it's come abroad through the country, how the people are humble and how they love You and worship You. And since being in this city, different business men and so forth calling and talking about the meeting... We pray that You'll shake this city and this country with an out-pouring of the Holy Spirit. May every church that's in this community receive an old fashion revival. Just shaking them, Lord, and sinners repenting and coming to Thee. Help Thou me, Lord, Thy unprofitable servant. For I ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, on the Scripture reading tonight, and if you wish to mark down the little--the little text as we try to bring the context to you, on Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-10 Now, Jude about thirty years or more after the Pentecost, was writing to the church that--and exhorting them that they should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints. I might ask my Baptist brethren setting here, "What about that with the Baptist church?" He say, "That's what we're contending for." I'd say to the Church of God brethren, "What about that?" "That's what we're contending for." The Pentecostal brethren, "What about that?" "That's what we're contending for." And the--the Presbyterian, Methodist, or whatever it was, every one say, "That's what we're contending for." And I believe it. I believe it.

L-11 Now, there is... People said... To me not long ago someone said, "Well, Brother Branham, that's against my faith." I said, "What kind of faith do you have?" See? "Against my faith." There's only one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one God. Now, if the Scriptures said that He exhorted to earnestly contend for the faith (not a faith), the faith that was once delivered to the saints... And each one of us wants to say that our church does that. The only way to be positive sure of this night church, is to go back and see what kind of a faith that they had to contend for. And then we should earnestly contend for that type of faith. Don't you believe it? Contend for that faith.

L-12 Now, we would have to go back then to the beginning of the New Testament. For they were called saints in the New Testament. And the first opening of the New Testament was John the Baptist. And he preached the message saying only this, "Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand." So repentance would be part of the faith that was delivered to the saints. But John spoke, saying, "That there's coming One Who will be the Instructor." And when Jesus came to John after His baptism, then the disciples and all begin to--to follow Jesus. And people went after Jesus; John said, "I must decrease; He must increase." Now, Jesus was the One Who introduced the faith, the Christian faith to the Christian church. And He was the beginning of the Christian faith.

L-13 Now, notice closely as we search reverently. Now, we will have to see what He did, and the life He lived, and the things He taught. And what He taught, He handed down to the disciples. And after about two rounds of them, then Jude sends back and said, "Now, wait a minute; you're getting off the line. Let's go back and contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints at the beginning," way back when they first started. They were getting off the beaten path. So if we can see what they had at the beginning, then we will know what to contend for now. Jesus wasn't a--didn't claim to be a great person. He was very humble Man. He didn't dress any different from any other man. He didn't dress like one of the scribes or the priest. He walked right on in and out among men, and they didn't know Him. He looked like other men. We never have any record of the Scripture where He ever was learned in school books, yet He had more wisdom than any man that ever lived on earth, because He was both God and Man.

L-14 But we don't find Him where He had any schooling as said in the Scriptures. And we do not see Him going around bragging about what He was. He didn't make any statement said He was a Healer. (Pardon me.) Jesus never said He was Healer, very much contrary. He said that He was not a Healer. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; it's My father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." So you see, what type of Person He was? What if He was here on earth tonight, where would you find Him? You'd find Him any place He'd be welcomed. He went about among the p--poor. The ecclesiastics of that day refused Him. They had... He had a contrary doctrine to 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min what they'd been taught, yet His doctrine was purely Scriptural. I want you to hold that now just for a little bit and watch. It was Scriptural. Every word that He said was Scripture itself. Not one time did He break any Scriptures but fulfilled just exactly. But they're way of teaching it was contrary to what it really was.

L-15 I wonder sometimes after nineteen hundred years if we haven't strayed a little bit from the path, got just a little bit off of the path. If we have, let's come back now and look at it just for a little bit. Now, when He was here He was baptized of John. Then He bare record, seeing the Holy Spirit descending like a dove, went upon Him. He went into the wilderness and fasted for forty days, nights come out preaching the Gospel. And all the regions around about gathered to Him. And He prayed for the sick and they were healed. Great signs and wonders begin to follow Him. Now, as a preacher I don't think that Jesus was a great outstanding forceful preacher. John the baptist was a preacher, but he done no signs at all. He never performed a miracle. But Jesus come by not preaching so forceful as John, but there were signs and wonders accompanying Him. He said, "If you can't believe Me believe the works that I do. If you can't believe Me believe the a vindication that the Father has given of Me, for the works that I do, the same testify that the Father has sent Me." What a statement.

L-16 Think of it. "The works that I do testify that the Father has sent Me." Man can make any kind of a statement, but if God don't back that statement up, you've got a right to say it's wrong. But when God comes around and confirms that statement to be the truth then it's sin to disbelieve it. For what is sin? Sin is one thing: "unbelief." That's right. You couldn't say how much of that is night. It's all night. And in the daytime you couldn't say just this much is day. It's all day. Jesus said, "He that believeth not is condemned already." Faith in God and unbelief that's the two things. One is sin and the other one is salvation.

L-17 Now, I think Nicodemus well expressed those Pharisees in those days. When he came to Jesus by night... Think of it. A man of great scholarly sage, learned, polished, came to a Man without a diploma. The old and learned came to the Youth and said, "Rabbi (or Reverend, Master, Teacher), we know that Thou art a Teacher comes from God. For no man can do the things that You do, less God was with Him." That's pretty close isn't it. "We know..." Who, who's we? The Pharisees, the teachers of that day. "We know that Thou art a Teacher come from God, 'cause no man can do the miracles that Thou does, except God be with him." That was the Pharisees' statement about Jesus. You see it? Notice now let's see what the church was. Peter said on the day of Pentecost; he said, "You men of Israel..." In other wise you should have known this. "Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you..." Not by His great theological teachings, not by His eloquent speech, not by some seminary that He come out of, the papers that He packed... "But you should've knowed Him, you men of Israel, you should've knowed this Jesus of Nazareth. For God was with Him by signs and wonders and miracles, which He did in your mist." What a rebuke to the people that had let that pass by them without recognizing it.

L-18 Now, let's find out what kind of a--miracles Jesus did. Now, He wasn't one that went around and said, "Bring Me this crippled man, and I will heal him." He never said that. Today if they talk about Divine healing they say, "Bring... Let me take this guy over, and let's see if that Divine healer can heal him. I'll believe it." Brother, do you realize the spirit that's on you is the same one said, "Come off the cross, and we will believe you?" It's the same doubting spirit.

L-19 But when Jesus started in His ministry, let's just follow Him a few moments now and see what He did. When Jesus of Nazareth begin His ministry, the first thing the fishermen begin to come up and listen to Him, and one got converted by the name of Philip. And Philip as quick as he was converted, went to hunt his partner Nathanael. That's a real good sign of conversion, isn't it? Went to find Nathanael, and when he found him he said, "Come, go with me for I have found He Who was spoken of by Moses and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth the Son of Joseph." And Nathanael a righteous good man, very dignified orthodox, Pharisee said, "Now, just a minute," said, "could any good thing come out of Nazareth?" And he gave him a very good answer, said, "Come and see." That's the best way to find out. Come, find out for 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min yourself. Said, "Come and see." Well, here goes Nathanael and--and Philip on the road over, and they come up into the prayer line, perhaps where Jesus was gathered around praying for the sick or whatever it was. And when they walked up into the audience, Jesus looked out upon the audience, seen Philip coming with Nathanael, and He said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile." My, that was shocking to that man.

L-20 What if it would be in America like that tonight? You know what they'd say? "That's mental telepathy. That man's a mind reader." They said the same thing in that day. But Nathanael said, "Rabbi, how did You know me? How do You know who I am? You've never seen me before. How do You know me?" He said, "Before Philip called you, when you was under the tree I saw you." He never questioned it any longer. He said, "Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel." Jesus turned him about and said, "Because I told you where you were at before you come to the meeting, you believe Me now? You'll see greater things than this, if you can believe that." That was Jesus of yesterday. It should be Jesus of today. If He is risen from the dead He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-21 Philip went and found Andrew. Andrew went and got Peter. Peter came up to where Jesus was; He turned around and looked at him and He told him who he was. He said, "I'm going to change your name: going to call you 'little stone' now." Knowed who he was. I can imagine how Peter would say, "Well, how did He know who I was? Well, He never saw me in His life, so how would He know me?" Kindly strange...

L-22 There was a woman one day who was going through a crowd. Jesus, the crowds was all putting their arms around Him and trying to get near Him. And as the woman pressed through the crowd, having a blood issue for many years... Spent all she had with the doctors; they could do her no good. And she touched His garment, went on all about in the crowd and hid herself. Jesus stopped... Listen; here it is. Jesus stopped, and turned Him about, and said, "Who touched Me?" While the apostle said, "Why, Lord, why ask a question like that? The whole crowd is touching You." He said, "But I got weak. Virtue went from... Somebody touched Me." And He looked around over the crowd till He looked till He found her. And He settled down; He said, "Thy faith hath healed thee. That old blood issue has stanched right now." That was Jesus yesterday. That's Jesus today. "Thy faith has saved thee."

L-23 Up along... One day He had to go by the way of Samaria. I wonder why from Jerusalem He's going to Jericho, straight path, but He went up around hilly country, up to Samaria. And when He went up there, He was setting on the well, and He sent His disciples away. And a woman of Samaria come out. I don't know why she come at this time of day around noon, between eleven and twelve o'clock? Whether she'd been out all night and just getting up or whether her--the better class of people wouldn't let her come while they were getting water from the well, that I couldn't say. But when she came out, Jesus setting over against the wall, He said, "Woman, bring Me a drink." Watch it, the conversation now. Wonder why? Now, listen. She said, "Why, it's not customary for You a Jew to ask me a Samaritan such a thing." Then He, in the course, He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask me for a drink, and I'd bring you waters you wouldn't come here to draw." Why, she said, "The well's deep."

L-24 Now, He was carrying a conversation with her for some purpose. Now, this isn't Scripture; this is my opinion, what I think. By seeing Him move the same way today, He was contacting her spirit. See? She was a woman. The Father had told Him to go up there, and He just waited till the woman come then He had to wait to contact her spirit. Then He said, went ahead and talked to her until He found her spirit. And when He did, He said, "Go, get your husband." Went right straight to her trouble. "Go, get your husband." She said, "I have no husband." Said, "That's right you got five, and the one you have now is not your husband. In that thou saidst well." Why, she said, "I perceive that You are a prophet." Now, here it is audience; now listen close. Listen what that 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min Samaritan woman said, being half Jew and Gentile. She said, "I know that when Messiah cometh He will do these things. He will tell us all things when Messiah cometh." What was it? The very sign of Messiah, not mental telepathy, not a fortuneteller or a devil working person out there. Sure, the devil has his counterfeit, but everything the devil's got he made it off something God had.

L-25 Did you notice it she said, "I know when... I don't know Who You are; You must be a prophet. But I know when Messiah cometh He will tell us these things." He said, "I am He that speaks to you." And she left her water pot, and went to the city, and said, "Come, see a Man Who told me all I ever did. Isn't this the very Christ?" Now, He never told her all things; He just told her that one thing. But He could've told her more, as the Father would've showed Him.

L-26 Look at Him; you say, "Did He heal everybody?" No, sir. Jesus didn't heal everybody when He was here on earth. How many do you think died while He was here. He raised three as a witness. Mouth of there two or three witness, every word be established. He passed by many, many, many sick people, crippled people, blind, afflicted, and never healed them. Did you know that? Let's take Him now to Saint John 5. He passes through the pool of the Bethesda, or were five porches. It's a big place. The Bible said, "Great multitudes of people... (Now, take two thousand to make a multitude in the eastern language.) and multitudes of people lay there, impotent people, lame, blind, halt, and withered. And here come Jesus by just after the woman had touched His garment. His whole garment flowing full of virtue, it was virtue to them that believed it was there.

L-27 The Roman smote Him in the face and spit in His face couldn't feel any virtue. But it was that woman's reverence and respect, believing that God sent Him, and He was the Son of God. It was virtue to her. He will be virtue tonight to you, if you'll come to Him reverently and say, "Lord Jesus, I believe that You're just the same tonight." The same virtue is flowing tonight, yet behind Him a Blood sacrifice with full pay of redemption." There He was and she passes by. He went on. After she'd touched His garment, He went down to the pool of Bethesda; there laid great multitudes now. Listen at what kind of people: lame, blind, withered, halt. Just think of that. And here He come, Son of God, full of virtue. And there was a great. Here, let's dramatize it. Set withered... Here's a poor old withered up mother standing there, her little old bone almost sticking through her skin, with her hands out, "Somebody help me get into the water." Here comes the Son of God right by her. Maybe there stood the poor old daddy all drawed up with arthritis, "Somebody help me get in," and the Son of God passing right by him. There stood the blind man totally blind, maybe a little blind baby. And the Son of God passed right by, until He came to a man laying on a pallet. For Jesus knew that he was there. And He said, "Will thou be made whole." And he said, "Sir, I have no one to put in the water when the water's troubled." Now, he could walk. He wasn't crippled. He probably had a prostate trouble, or TB, or something it was retarded. He'd had it for thirty-eight years, wasn't going to kill him. So he said, "I have no one to put in the water; when I'm coming someone else steps down ahead of me." Said, "Take up thy bed and go into the house," then walked away. Compassionate, full of love, and walked away and left thousands of blind, lame, halt, and withered laying there. What if that happened in Macon? You know, the same thing it'd be said, "Let me see Him do that. Why, did He do that?" But here's His secret now...

L-28 And to my ministering brethren, read it on, five--5th chapter of Saint John. Get down to the 19th verse when they caught Him and questioned Him. Now, listen to His words, everyone now, for the saving of time. We--our time's run out. He said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, The Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing; that doeth the Son likewise." Is that Scripture? Saint John 5:19, Jesus Christ speaking. Let me quote it again. "Verily, Verily (That's absolutely, absolutely.) I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing; that doeth the Son likewise. The Father worketh, and I worketh hitherto." In other words Jesus said this plain 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min thing, "I do not do one thing until first the Father shows Me a vision of what to do, then I go do what He tells Me to do." The Father had showed Him that that man that was laying there; He made him whole; that's all He could do. The Father didn't show Him nothing else. And any true servant of God, any time in the Scripture, was the same thing. Search it. See if that isn't right.

L-29 Look at Elijah when he laid all of his kindling wood and things around, killed the sacrifice, and so forth. He stepped out and said, "Lord, I did all of this at Your--at Your word. I made this just according to what You showed me." Now, many times we get all enthused, rattled up when we shouldn't do it. Stand still; look to God; believe with all your heart. He's the only One that can do it. You see it? Where one a being healed here on the platform, there's hundreds get's healed in the audience.

L-30 Now, Jesus when... Just one more statement, if you please just a moment. When Lazarus died, wasn't it strange that when Lazarus got sick--before he got sick that Jesus turned and went away from home? His buddy... I can imagine hearing the critics say, "Oh, and there you are. There it is. See there's something happening right here where we can see it done; looked what happened." Away He went going away from home. And then after Lazarus got so sick, perhaps the doctors gave him up. They sent... Martha and Mary sent for Jesus to come back and pray for Lazarus. Did He do it? He just ignored it and went on. Strange isn't it. He went to another city. They sent some more messengers, "Tell Him to come, pray for Lazarus, at the point of death." Jesus just ignored it and went on. Your pastor do that, oh, my. See?

L-31 But notice after so much time... Here it is now; listen. After so much time, Jesus turned knowing that the time the Father had showed Him that would be fulfilled. He turned to the disciples, and He said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth." Said, "Why, if he sleepeth he doeth well." He said, "He's dead. And for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there." 'Cause they'd been saying, "Heal him, Lord; do something for him." See? "I'm glad I wasn't there, but I go wake him." Amen. The Father had showed Him what was going to take place. Look at Him there at the grave when He prayed at Lazarus grave, He said, "Father I thank Thee that Thou has heard Me already. But for these that stand by I say it." Just acting out in drama what God had showed to Him by vision, for He said, "I do nothing except the Father shows Me first."

L-32 That was the faith that was delivered to the saints. Did the saints keep it? Certainly. Peter upon the housetop, a Jew self-styled, had nothing to do with the Gentiles, wouldn't eat their meats and so forth. But the Lord appeared to him in a vision, and told him to rise, and go forward, doubt nothing. That right? Saul of Tarsus with letters in his pockets, going down, bearing out threatenings against the church, all around and hail them into the prison houses... On his road down to Damascus was struck off his horse by a Light that stand in front of him, a Pillar of Fire, hung out in front of him. And It shined like the sun in its might. And Paul fell from his horse.

L-33 They led him down into the streets, and he laid there praying and fasting. Way down in the city was a man contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints by the name of Ananias. One day while he was praying, a vision came before him, said, "Go up there in the street called Straight, ask for a--a certain place, and go in and lay your hands upon Saul, that he might receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost." He said, "Lord, I hear what great things that man's done; I'm afraid of him." He said, "Behold, he prayeth." I can see Ananias rise to that, vision start down to the main street, and go by the fountain looking for that house where he'd seen in the vision. When he come to it, he went in, said, "Brother Saul, even the Lord that appeared to you on the road, knocked you off your horse, sent me that I might lay my hands on you, and you receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost," the faith that was delivered to the saints. Amen.

L-34 Paul later on, after being warned in the Spirit not to loose from Crete... But the shipmaster wouldn't listen to him. On out into the sea they went. The little old boat become water-logged, pitching around out there, fourteen days and nights, no moon stars. All hopes that they ever be saved... Two hundred and eighty people out there was... All hopes 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min was gone. Paul went down in the bulkheads somewhere and prayed. The old ship was pitching as hard as it could. Paul come running out with chains on his arms, this little Jew and begin to swing his hands, and said, "Brethren, be of a good courage." Boat still pitching... Said, "Last night there stood by me the Angel of God Whose servant I am, saying, 'Paul fear not, for you must be brought before Caesar, and lo, God's give everyone that sailed with you to you. But the ship's going to be wrecked upon a certain shore.'" Said, "Wherefore, brethren, I believe God. It'll be just exactly the way He showed it to me."

L-35 That's the faith that was once delivered to the saints. God have mercy on us tonight, friends, that we will get down and contend for that same faith, for Jesus said, "A little while and the world won't see Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I (which is a personal pronoun), I will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever... When He was here on earth He didn't claim to be a big person. He was small, made Himself little, yet He owned all heavens and earth. The earth and heavens was created by Him. And when He was here on earth, He had one garment. Yet He made ever stalk of cotton would ever grow, or ever sheep that ever lived, or everything that ever was. He has created by Christ Jesus.

L-36 And when He was here on earth, look what He did: He went around and did just as the Father showed Him. When He got ready to go away, He said, "These things that I do (giving His church orders)... The things that I do shall you do also; even more than this..." The word there is 'greater,' but get the right translation, means 'more.' He couldn't do anything greater. It was more and or greater in quantity, but not in quality. He did everything as in quality, raised the dead, and stopped nature, and everything else. "But more than this shall you do, for I go unto My Father. And a little while, and the world won't see Me no more, yet you shall see me." My brethren tonight and sisters, listen to this a minute; since that day till this day there has been "ye's" "A little while and the world (world order), the world won't see Me no more." They don't believe it. "The world will see Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, for I will be with you," He said He would be in us until the end of the world." And till Jesus comes visibly in the second coming, the Holy Spirit will be working in His Church, doing the same things that He did when He was here on earth. I believe it with all my heart. I believe Jesus rose from the dead. I believe He ascended to God the Father, setting in glory tonight, at the right-hand of the majesty of God, making intercessions upon our profession. I believe the Holy Ghost is here on earth, carrying out the same work that Jesus did, by His anointed vessels tonight in the earth. And the time is at hand, and everything's a pressing forward towards the end time, while we've got a little sun left to look into. Amen. I believe that with all my heart.

L-37 Now, you what here to be prayed for tonight... As you come each day we try to do this: We try to make it just is to, everybody the same every day. When we first started, we went out, and I tried to make a orderly prayer line without having prayer cards. You can't do it. Brother Roberts and all the rest of them finds it the same way. You can't do it. So we used to, we'd send all the prayer cards to a minister, and then first group got there group in, why, that settled it. Then there was discord amongst the brethren. Then I had a preacher out giving out prayer cards, and he couldn't do that, because he was a preacher. He had to many friends.

L-38 So then we find out; we go down and give out all the prayer cards the first day. Well, if anybody come in otherwise from that, he couldn't get prayed for, because these were the prayer cards that has to be prayed for. So the way we found to do it, the most legitimate and honest way that we can, is to come down every day, and give out prayer cards every day. And at that time at night we don't--maybe can't pray for over two or three hundred... That isn't my ministry. I--I just pray for as many as I can, and then after I get real tired and everything becomes blurred to me, they take me off the platform. And the next day they go back, and give out more new prayer cards, and start the prayer line again. Now, I want to ask you something now, while you just be reverent for the next, say, fifteen, twenty minutes. 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min

L-39 If Jesus has risen from the dead... I put it like that, which we know He has. If He has risen from the dead, and is a living tonight, then He should be the same in principle. He should be the same in power. He should be the same every way that He was then, except physical form. Is that right? If He's here in the form of the Holy Spirit... And if He is here... And I want to ask the people around in these seats around the stadium, if Jesus Christ, as I have tried to explain to you tonight how He was in the Bible days... Now, remember wasn't a Guy that challenged everybody, and, "Bring Me this one or that one." He'd walked along and ignore them. But when the Father showed Him anything He did it. And standing in the crowd... Sometimes He'd look over through His crowd, and He would perceive, what? Their thoughts. That's kind of a strong word wasn't it, brother? But did the Scriptures say that? He perceived their thoughts, and said unto them, "Why, reason ye among you and so forth?"

L-40 Blind Bartimaeus one day way back, if you'd ever go there and see that word wrote how it was from the wall where he was supposed to be setting, He could've never heard him in that howling crowd. But he's... The--the faith of that blind beggar stopped Jesus on the road to Calvary. And turned around and said, "As thou has believed so be it unto you." The faith of the people... Look at the woman. When she touched His garment, Jesus never said, "I've healed you." He said, "Thy faith has saved thee." Now, if Jesus would return during this meeting, and show Hisself in His people, doing the same thing here, that He did, as I said He did in the Bible, then you'll know that we are absolutely living in Bible days again with the same faith that they had then. Is that right? We will know that Jesus raised from the dead. How many of you will accept it? Let's see you hands, everywhere around the stadium. That's--that's fine.

L-41 If Jesus will re--do the same things tonight right here, that He did then... I... That's quite a challenge isn't it. That the Son of God... Here's the way I believe it, friends. and the way you've got to believe it. Don't just kinda baby around with this; it's either right or it's wrong. That's either the truth, or it's not the truth. God's either God, or He's not God. I believe that that way. If God made a promise, God's got to stand behind His promise. And if He won't do it, then His promise is not no good, then He--His Word's like mine. But God will stand behind it, if you'll stand behind God. If you'll dare to step out there and take Him at His Word, He will do it. Now, put your faith in Him tonight, in Calvary, and look to Him, and believe it. And now, I believe if He will; I don't say He will; I don't know; He's God. If He will return tonight and show the very same signs right here in this audience of people here where we are setting, if He will show the very same signs that He did when He was here on earth, that'll be infallible proof that He has raised from the dead. Is that right? Infallible proof... Shall we pray.

L-42 Heavenly Father, tired from a long day's journey. I pray that You'll come now. Grant tonight, Lord, I... Out here, the first time of being out in the open for a couple of years, and a new place... I don't feel I'm among strangers; I feel I'm among Your people. And they're here, and they love You. And I have certainly give Your Word open up here to them and a great challenge. And I pray, God of heaven, that You'll help me now, that You'll come and anoint this group of people with Your Holy Spirit, will anoint Your servant. And may the Lord Jesus Himself come and show to this waiting audience, that He is here on earth. He's not dead. He's here with us, and will be until His visible body shows in the second coming. Father God, grant these blessings in Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.

L-43 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] That lady's a perfect stranger to me. I never seen her in my life. I don't know nothing about her. We're strangers aren't we, lady? Perfect strangers, we've never seen each other and don't know each other. But Jesus knows her. We was probably raised miles apart, first time we ever met in life. Now, He knows about me; He knows about her. And the only way in the world that I'd know what to tell the lady do, it'd have to come from some supernatural resource. Is that right? You believe that don't you, lady? Now, I want you to be reverent. And you know I--I'm waiting for His Presence that's exactly right. I--that's... I'm just a man. See? But when He's here, I know it. See? You know it too. So I'm just waiting for Him to appear. While they 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min started the song my--of "Only Believe."

L-44 Now, the Lord bless you, and keep your seats. Be reverent; don't move around, and the boys will dismiss the meeting just as soon as they feel. 'Course I... After He gets started, I--I don't have... They tell it to me; I pick it up on tape recording. I know what He said. And mark it down, that every thing that He says is absolutely the truth, and it'll be just exactly the way He said it. But remember now, whether it's me, you'll hear it, it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. When you here that, then it's Him speaking. Now, if this woman standing here, a stranger to me... I don't know her, and she don't know me. God knows her. Well, then the only way I'd have of knowing anything what she was here for, would have to come from some supernatural resource. Is that right, lady? Well, it depends on what you think it was, would determine whether you get what you ask for. Now, let's just pray a moment will you, friends.

L-45 Heavenly Father, we pray now this is the moment; this is the time; this is the beginning now after the Word has been preached. This is the beginning of the Macon meeting. Lord, I don't know a person here, outside of this own little group that's setting here with me, Brother Thoms, and Brother Beeler, and the boys. I pray, God, that You'll help me now. If I've did anything contrary to Your will, forgive me. Forgive this audience, as they come out here as my listeners tonight. I pray that Your Blood will cleanse every one of them from all unrighteousness. Take all doubt and skeptics away. May the devil leave the all from the grounds. We dedicate this grounds to you for the services now and coming. And now, may the Holy Spirit promised by the Lord Jesus, that said, "The things that I do, shall you also, even more, for I go to My Father." We pray that He will come now and anoint...?... His unworthy servant, that my lips might be used of Him, and the ears of the hearer be circumcised for the hearing of the Word of the Lord. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-46 Now, the technician or the engineer on the mike might have to speak it up, 'cause I don't know how loud it will be speaking. Can you hear in the balconies all right, around? Can you? Good. Now, be reverent. Now, for the glory of God and to the up-building of His Kingdom, I take every spirit here under my control in the Name of Jesus Christ. So I want to talk to you just a moment. Now, I've got to carry a conversation with you in order, just like our Lord. See? He found the woman come up to Him at the well... Perhaps the Father told Him to go up there. I believe the Father told me to come down to Macon. Well... here... If it wouldn't I wouldn't of come. So I feel I'm here tonight by the leading of the Holy Spirit. And we are strangers, as I have said, to each other. I don't know you, and you don't know me. But you're conscious something's going on. If anybody close to the audience can watch the woman's face now... See, she realizes she's in the Presence of something besides man. If--if that's right, lady, raise your hands? That's right. See?

L-47 Did you ever see the picture of It they taken here in Texas, that Angel? They got the picture of It here. It's in Washington, DC Yes. Now, that is exactly what's standing between me and you now. I don't know whether you see or not. But the lady begins to move away from me. And it's moving; the--the lady is upset about something. She's nervous. It's not exactly about herself. It's about a child. And that child has a blood condition, something wrong with the blood. It's called Rh disease. And the child... I see it trying to talk to you; it's got some kind of in and its--its speech is not exactly right. And it's a--it's bed-fast. It's in a bed. And it's about eleven years old. Our heavenly Father, be merciful now. I pray God, as Thy Spirit near, bless that what we are asking of thee and may it be found even so, for we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen. Now, my sister, that was true wasn't it, every word. Now, the tears that you wipe from your eyes with that handkerchief, you take and lay it on the child; the end of the week, you let me know what happened to the child.

L-48 You believe? Now, His Presence, His majesty, the King of glory is here. Now, just be real reverent and you'll see the Kingdom of God and the power of God, if you'll just believe. Now, I suppose you and I are strangers too, are we, lady? We are strangers to each other, but not strangers to the Lord Jesus. For you're a believer. Now, if there be anything about you that would--anything wrong, it'd have to come from 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min some supernatural resource. You're just a little nervous just at the time. That's... You are. But don't be nervous. It's not... Now, of course I see you're wearing glasses, which would make me know that something's wrong with you're eyes. But now, you just be reverent and let's just let Him do the talking, when it comes down to anoint.

L-49 Something happened out there. Now, let's look this way just a moment. Yes, ma'am, I see you coming from somewhere. It's a out of a bui--it's a doctor's office. You--you've come from... You've been under a doctor's a care. And oh, I see a black shadow a following you, which is a cancer. You have cancer. And that cancer is located in the stomach. And the doctors have given you up, in saying that you can't get well. That is true, isn't it? Well, if He's here, and there's anointed Spirit here now, that you know that that's the truth. All right, then He said, "These signs will follow them that believe: if they lay hands on the sick, they'll get well. Is that true? Come here just a minute. Shall we bow our heads a moment. Our heavenly Father, death circling this woman, following her along, Your servants the doctors has done all they know how to do. But this hideous demon has hid from them. He's too much for them. But he's not too much for You, Father. Thou does know all things and have all power, and to save the life of this, my sister, I rebuke this demon called cancer, in the Name of Jesus Christ, according to the Holy Scriptures, and may it go out of her and never bother her no more. For God's glory we ask it. Amen.

L-50 Now, and notice, that this is Friday. Monday you'll get real real sick. See? Sometime between now and Monday, real real sick, "You'll think you're just almost going to die. That'll last for a little while; it's a growth dead. See? Then come back end of the week and tell me how you're feeling, how it... Go ahead and eat just like you want to. Amen. Let's say thanks be to God, dear friends. You might not realize... You believe God will heal you of that rupture, setting there, sir? You believe He'd make you well? You have a rupture. You want to...?... You want to get well of it. Stand up on your feet and accept your healing then. God bless you.

L-51 Have faith. Just believe. See? See, you don't need your prayer card; you need faith. Now, the Lord Jesus the Son of God that raised from the dead is right here now. That's His Spirit. Have faith. Now, I suppose, lady, you and I are strangers to each other. I see you bend... Oh, it's a blind woman. All right, I want every one to bow your heads everywhere please. The lady's blind. I am not able, of course, to do anything for her but pray. And she want's you to pray too. What if you were blind? Now, just kinda keep you head down this way if you can. Now, what demonology is, lady; it's a grip. Just like it said when the deaf spirit went out of a man. In another words there's something in his ears. When it let loose, the man could hear. Jesus prayed for a man that was blind. He could see after he was prayed for. Now, I--I'm just your brother, and I want you to believe with all your heart. And now, that the God that makes this wind to blow across you is here to make you well. And every eye stay closed, 'cause these are spiritual things.

L-52 Now, our heavenly Father, walking up to this poor sister standing here, walking around in the world of darkness, who could help but thee, Lord. Nerves in her eyes dead, hardening away. But just You can heal her. And I pray, Father, that You'll grant it tonight. If we found grace in Your sight, let it be so tonight, Lord. The end of this meeting, may this woman be walking around praising You, showing the people what great things God has done. By her healing may it cause an old fashion revival to break out in her community. Grant it, Lord. Thou has said Thou can if ye believe. Now, with my unworthy hand, representing Yours laid upon her eyes, I ask that the blindness go away. For in faith believing the Lord Jesus Who is standing present, forgive us of our unbelief, and may the blind spirit that's bound this woman, leave her. I ask it to go in the Name of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

L-53 Now, would everyone keep their heads bowed just for a few moments. Now, you just keep you lids down. Now, keep your head this way now. Now, God let it be so. Now, I want you to open your eyes and look towards the light now. See me? Can you see me? [ The lady says, "Yes."--Ed.] Put your hand on my nose. Let me see you do that. All right, that's right. You may raise your heads. I want you to watch here. Lady, can you see out in there? If you can, raise up your hand. Can you see those lights around out in there. If you can raise up your hand? I want you to turn around this a way. Can 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min you see my hand? [Lady says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] Could you tell my how many fingers I have up? [Lady says, "Four."--Ed.] That's exact. Now, watch, put your finger on my nose. You have your sight.

L-54 Let us say, "Praise be to God." Now, look, lady, here's what happened. See, the blind spirit leaves you now. See? And you're... The nerves that was dead in your eyes are just beginning to vibrate, cool feelings. Now, you'll feel... You'll... Tomorrow you'll see still better. Next day you'll... But about seventy two hours, then you'll go real dark blind again. Then when it does, it comes out; it will be gone then. Don't doubt now. Go on your road rejoicing, and be thankful and happy. Let's see if you can't walk out this way just by yourself. Go right ahead. See? Let's say praise be to God. Let's give God praise just like this everybody. Just give God praise. Amen. All right. Let's bow our heads now. Heavenly Father we do thank Thee for all Thy goodness and mercy, and we pray, God, that You'll just do the exceedingly abundantly and show to Thy people that Thou art God. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-55 All right. Oh, my, it makes you love Him doesn't it. Just watch what... The lady's going right back to her seat. Let's say, "Praise be to God." Amen. That's fine. Now, lady, you was healed with blindness; there's a man setting next to you there. He has high blood pressure, and he wants to be healed, don't you, sir? Stand up if that's... If I told you the truth stand up. Now, go home you're well. Jesus Christ did it. You believe? Amen. Now, the man setting next to you there, he has something wrong with his eyes, and he wants to be healed too. And he has something wrong with his ears also. And he wants to be healed. Now, you lay your hand over on him, and he will get healed. That's it. Heavenly Father, I rebuke that spirit in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Make it be so. Amen.

L-56 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Now, the man next to you, put up his hand. Would you like to be healed, sir, with a hernia, rupture? Do you believe that God will make you well? You do? Double of them, He will--He will make them both well. You believe that God will do it? If you do stand up on your feet and say, "I accept it." Just stand up on your feet and say you accept. That's right. Say, "Thank you, God." All right, you can go home now and be made well. Amen. Praise be to the living God. Have faith. Jesus said, "Thou can, if thou believeth." Amen. That's the way to believe; just start moving along now. Something struck you didn't it, brother. See, you don't need your prayer card. You... The only thing you need is some faith, and God will do work. Amen. That is true. Just believe Him. He's God, and He cannot fail.

L-57 I see a dark spirit swirl that meeting just then. I didn't see where it went. Yes, it is, it's over this lady setting right here. It's epilepsy. Lady, you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well of that epilepsy? Stand up on your feet. Our heavenly Father, we rebuke that demon. Satan, you're exposed come out of there in the Name of Jesus Christ we adjure thee. Amen. Have faith. That's--that's good first night faith, isn't it? Say, "Amen." That's really. Believe it with all your heart. You can be made well, no matter what's wrong with you. Just only thing I ask you to do, is have faith in God. Believe that He is, and He will grant it to you.

L-58 All right, do you believe, sir, with all your heart? If you believe, well, God is able to do the exceedingly, and the abundantly, and above all that we can do or think. 'Course that's up to the individual, isn't it? Whatever you think, then whatever you believe about it, well then, God's able to do it. Isn't that right? We're strangers to one another. We don't know each other, but God knows us both. Isn't that right? Amen. Oh, my, I--I hope you don't class me a fanatic, but I'm so glad to see this kind of faith to start with. What will it be in ten nights? My, it'll be wonderful. I didn't think you believed that much. I really didn't. But now you're getting into the Kingdom of God. He can do some great things for you. Amen.

L-59 Now, you just look to me as His prophet or servant and believe with all your heart, Jesus Christ will help you. I believe. And if He does, then you'll be grateful and thankful. Is that right? You're not from this country. You've come here from somewhere else. You're suffering with something; it's in the kidney. And it's tumors in the kidneys. And you've come from the north going south. You've come from the Carolina. 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min You're from a city named Greenwood, or something like that, Greenwood, South Carolina. That's true. And you're a preacher. And your name is Reverend William Rogers. Is that right? Go home, brother, and may the Lord Jesus make you well for the glory of God. Amen. Have faith in God. Believe Him. All things are possible to them that believe. "If thou canst believe..." You say, "Strange?" Oh, no. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, isn't He? Amen. Now, just... The Bible said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible."

L-60 I see standing in a vision here above me; I see trees like palm trees hanging over this man setting here. Yes, he's setting there beside of a lady. And he's got arthritis. She has a gallbladder trouble. It's husband and wife. Yes, and you all come from a place called Florida. And the name of the city something like Perry. P-e-r-r... Isn't that right? Stand up on your feet if that's right. You're--you--you'll go back home and be well. Jesus Christ, your faith healed you and makes you well. Now, your arthritis is all gone, and you're well. You believe? All things are possible to them that believe. If thou canst believe... Right now the whole group of you could be healed if you just believe it. I... It's beginning to get blurry out in... If you can just have faith, it don't make any difference what's wrong with you. Just keep looking; keep believing.

L-61 I see a man setting here looking at me. I believe, it's--it's on the, right here at the line. He's looking towards me. He's been in surgery, had an operation. It's cut part of the stomach away. About two-thirds of the stomach has been taken away, and the gallbladder. And you've had two heart attacks. That's right. And you're a preacher. All right, go home; you don't have to come in here you're healed. Jesus Christ makes you well. Amen. You believe with all your heart? Have faith. Don't doubt; just believe with all your heart. What about out there in the audience way back, you believe Him, way back? You shall see the Kingdom of God. You believe He raised from the dead, He lives forever more? Have faith in God. Oh, my, every one of you can be healed, the whole group right now.

L-62 You believe, lady. You're... Are you the--that's patient? Is this--is this the patient? All right, look this way just a moment. Now, we're strangers to one another. God knows us both, doesn't He? Now, to the audience, see, the only thing you have to do, friends... It's not me it; you're the one; you're faith is what's doing it. It--it's your faith a doing that. See, it isn't me. I... It's God's gift, but you're pulling from it. You see? And it's just making me so weak, I can hardly stand here. And my legs are buckling under me. Oh, I just wonder what this meeting will turn out to be. Wonderful.

L-63 Now, have faith. Believe. Now, here stands a lady here; I never seen her in my life. I don't know nothing about her. God knows all about her. I don't. But God does. If God will let that lady--something be said about her or whatever she's here for... I don't know what she's here for. God knows what she's here for. I don't. God knows that. But He does. And if God will reveal to her, through His unprofitable servant, just as a vessel, just like He did through Jesus His Son to that woman at the well, where her trouble was, would you believe it He's raised from the dead and He's just here the same?

L-64 Now, here's the same: a man, a woman. And that's the way it was there: a man, a woman. Jesus never see her; she never seen Him. They didn't know each other. But He talked to her a few minutes and told her just exactly what her trouble was. What was her trouble? And she said, "I know when Messiah cometh, He will do these things." He said, "I am He that speaks." Well, the Messiah is the One that's here now. He's the One Who's doing the work. How many of you, if God will make this woman known something in the supernatural realm, will you now, every person in here accept Him Christ as your Healer? Will you do it? Raise you're hands if you will, anywhere if you will do it? You can just go on and on all night, but what of it. Let's all be healed, every one of you, right now. So you everyone be healed and glorify God.

L-65 Is there a sinner here that would say, "I will accept Christ, if I can see that done. I will believe it with all my heart, and accept Christ as my Saviour. Will you raise your hand anywhere? Anywhere around the...?... That's fine. God bless you. That's good. God bless you. Now, may He grant it. Now, just a moment... Now, lady, I want you to look to me just as a--a servant. And I--I don't know you, have never seen you. But if God will let me know what you're here to see me about... You are here for something. If it's you're there a deceiver you, it'll--He will tell you in a few minutes just exactly. And if you're here for health, I--I couldn't do it 55-0603, Jesus Christ The Same Yesterday, Today, And Forever, Porter Stadium, Macon, GA, 79 min no more that just what He'd tell me to do. Isn't that right? It's all I could do, 'cause I don't know you. You don't know me. But He knows us both. Then at that God knows it's at stake right here tonight, when it's getting late after ten. It's perhaps way later than time to close this stadium. But to be a groups of people be healed right now. So I believe He will do it, don't you?

L-66 Now, God knows if the people out there understands, that we do not know one another, just raise your hands like that, so that they'll know that I don't know you and you don't know me. All right, we're strangers. 'Less we just--you've heard of me or something like that. This our first time meeting. No way in the world I know anything what you be here. I just don't know you, just a lady here somewhere that's came into the line and that's all I know. Now, just look at me, just a moment. I don't mean that. Just like this, Peter and John said to the crippled man at the gates, "Look on us." See? In another words, "Pay attention." You see? And they looked up. Peter seen the faith; he said, "Stand up; Christ has healed him." Now, He's the same Lord Jesus. And what He could do right here for this woman, He can do all over the audience.

L-67 Now, the first place, you're here for a--a condition, a spiritual condition. That's right. You're seeking spiritual help, been having some trouble recently, darkness following you, nervous, upset. It's just a time of life has rolled around to that. You're not from this city. You're from--you're from this a way. You're from Texas. And the city is called like Sweet some... Sweetwater something like that, Texas. Isn't that right? You're going home a well woman. Jesus Christ has healed you. The devil has left you, and you're free. Amen. How many believe with all your heart? How many wants to be healed right now with all your heart? If you'll do this right now, you can be healed. Stand to your feet, every one of you. Lay your hands over on each other, right now while you can. Believe.

L-68 Our heavenly Father I now come in the challenging Name of the Lord Jesus. I condemn every sickness, and let the devil that's bothered these people come out in the Name of Jesus Christ. Every one of you here now that believes the Lord Jesus right now, that He's healed you, raise your hand and just praise Him. Just raise your hands and say, "Praise You, Lord Jesus." Amen. Say, "Praise the Lord," everywhere. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Go home a well person now, while I commit the service to the brother. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
