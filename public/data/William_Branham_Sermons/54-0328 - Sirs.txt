--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ...You Christian friends, want to greet you tonight in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Beginning of this revival, I trust that it'll be a great blessing to all who are here, and those who will be coming in farther in the services. Each evening we want to begin at just as close as we can to... Need to be here around quarter after to half past eight. That was my thought today to get over; and I was just a little late. I drove my own car, and I got mixed up in some traffic down there, and it held me up just a little bit. So I... Sorry to be a little late. And they were standing out waiting for me when I come up: my boy was. And so now tonight as we are gathered here to start this prayer meeting: praying for the sick, believing God for the supernatural; I trust that every person here will take it upon themselves to be under prayer all the time. In your homes be fasting and praying. Come with great expectation. For if you don't expect anything, you won't receive anything. You'll just receive as you expect.

L-2 Now, in this city tonight I think there's two or three more revivals going on, of healing services. We're not here to be competitors to those brethren. We're only here to do our part. And we're believing God and asking to help all the sick and afflicted everywhere where people are praying for the sick, in every church and every denomination. We believe that God will hear the prayer of any sincere person that will believe. Now, I am not, by no means, a Divine healer. I believe in my other meeting here in Louisville, and many times being here with our dear Brother Cauble, and the church, I've never at one time said I was a Divine healer. Which if I did, that would be wrong, because I am not. And there's no other man that's a Divine healer. We're just ministers of the Gospel, to preach, to pray for the sick. God is the Divine Healer. And all that God can do for you, He did it in Jesus Christ. Your work of redemption for soul and body is completed. Even to your rapture, is already completed. When Jesus rose from the dead, God justified, justifies us by faith, believing that, that God rose Him up from the dead; and we are waiting for the rapture which will come. Everything will happen in its season. And our salvation, our healing, and everything was completed when Jesus Christ died at Calvary.

L-3 Now, in here we have many times that we... In the meetings, we have a--a system of giving prayer cards. Well, we wish there was some other way that we had of controlling without having to give out prayer card, but it's the only legitimate way that you can keep the people in line, lined up. We have tried many ways, and I never did like the way before we had prayer cards to give out: of the people clamoring, and some of them crying and jumping over one another, and pushing and shoving through the line. It doesn't seem like Christianity. I think Christianity is orderly. And Paul come to set the church in order and all things to be done decent and in order. And I believe God honors it more when we keep it orderly and under the power of the Holy Spirit to be the Leader of the church and of the people.

L-4 Now tonight and tomorrow night, and now until the--the crowd gets enough to--our seating room here will not be--will be inadequate; then we're going over to the Memorial Auditorium, which they're going to let us have. They've promised that. Now, tomorrow... If you know any sick people or so forth, get on your phone. Call up someone. Bring somebody with you, or some unsaved person that they may get saved in this meeting. That's the main thing is the people to get saved. Healing... Jesus Christ only used healing to draw His crowds together, then He preached the Gospel. After He healed a few, He brought His altar calls and so forth, and not what He called altar calls. Altar calls is something that we have adopted. There never was an altar call give in the Bible. But the people believed. Believers was added to the church. But we had a system back in the early days, the Methodists, we'd call them up to the altar and have them to pray through. Well, I think that works pretty good, so God has blessed it, and we remain with that--with that system of praying at the altar. I think that's what altars was made for: to have people to pray, the place of worship. Come to the altar to worship God.

L-5 Now, I don't want to take much of the time in the evenings of speaking. For maybe some evenings will be given 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min altogether to preaching services. We have eight days to be here, if God willing, which is a quite a long meeting, lengthy for... But it's just locally advertised. And that's the reason that we think that our seating capacity... I think even the auditorium over there only seats about, oh, between three and four thousand, something like that. Which... Well, just to locally Jeffersonville, New Albany, around here, it ought to be all right to take care of this situation. I'm asking you people here tonight, as my dear friends in Christ Jesus, that you'll stand by me in prayer during this time. And you'll--you'll... I'm not here for a stage show. I'm only here to do the best that I know how to make life a little easier, and to make people a little happier, to bring converts to Jesus Christ.

L-6 I'm not here to represent any denomination, for I do not belong to any denomination church. And I don't think no more of one than I do of the other. I just love all of its converts to Jesus Christ. And that's why we're here, and to try to get people to see that. Divine healing is for the Methodists, the Baptists, the Catholic, the Jew, the sinner, the harlot, the--whatever more, Divine healing's for every one of you. Jesus Christ died for every one of you, for your healing, the same as He died for the salvation of the whole world. And if you'll just accept it and believe it... Someone might say, "Well, Brother Branham, does God heal the sinner?" Yes sir. And when he's healed, his sins are forgiven him. That's what the Bible said. "Then go and sin no more, or a worse thing will come upon you." Now sin is--is not some kind of immoral act. Sin is unbelief. That's right. The Bible said, "He that believeth not is condemned already." So we know then that sin is unbelief. So do not go and disbelieve any more.

L-7 Now, the church... We'll try to carry everything just as orderly and reverent as we know how. We believe in old time heartfelt salvation, believe in the people's liberty to say "Amen," "Praise the Lord." Whatever the Spirit of God leads you to do, do it. And He won't lead you to do anything, but what's right. And He's the Spirit. God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. And God, the very word "god" means "object of worship." So God likes to be worshipped by His children, that we can be free and not bound down in yokes. But we can exercise our faith in Him, and believe it, and not be ashamed to tell the world about it: that Jesus Christ raised from the dead, lives and reigns in our hearts, and we're not ashamed of it. Doesn't make our face red to testify of the glory of Jesus Christ. For He is worthy of all praise; don't you believe that? That's right.

L-8 Now, I wish to turn into the Scripture to read a few words. We're just starting a little late. Each evening we're going to try to be out by nine-thirty, if possible, so you can come back on the--the following night. And I was just coming up, and I heard Brother Cauble's voice saying about many people in here that had been healed of sickness. I was just looking back in the--on--in the audience just now and see a woman that was merely a skeleton here recently. Cancer had eaten her so bad till the doctors give her till the next morning to live: just, that was all. And that's been about six or seven years ago, and she's setting here tonight, weighing about a hundred and fifty pounds in perfect health, not a trace of it anywhere. Say, "Is healing lasting?" Just as lasting as long as faith is. That's right. Just as long... Salvation's the same way. Just as long as you got faith, you're healed. When you lose faith, you're gone.

L-9 Now, I wish to read some of God's Word, 'cause He's never said my word wouldn't pass away, but He said His Word wouldn't pass away. So if I read His Word, then I--I know that if you get no more than just the reading of His Word, then you'll have plenty to go home with. Just one Scripture, you can hang your whole soul right on it and just know that it's THUS SAITH THE LORD. Now, while we mention that Word, watch in the prayer line; watch in the audience. Visions hasn't, just no more than just the sign of God's Presence. But watch what He speaks to the person and to the person in the audience. I see we got tape recordings here where you could chase it back and find out just what He said.

L-10 Now, I've had... How many's been in my meetings before? Let's see your hands up everywhere. Oh, my, it's almost a hundred percent. So there won't be any introduction to the operation of the Holy Spirit. It will only be for you just to believe. 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min Now, in Saint John the 12th chapter, the 20, and 21st and 22nd verses. I want to read a portion of these. And there was certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

L-11 Now, shall we bow our heads just a moment. Our kind heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for Thy Word; It is Truth. And we pray now that You'll break every shackle and set the people free, at liberty. And may the blessed Holy Spirit baptize every one in here tonight anew in His Presence. May great signs and wonders accompany this meeting, insomuch that it'll stir the whole city. May the people come in such a way, not because that it's our effort for You, but because of the Gospel's sake. Grant, Lord, that the buildings will pack, and the streets will stand with people, great signs and wonders; ambulances bringing up the sick, going back without them; the cripples pushing their wheelchairs in the corner, walking out rejoicing. May it start an old fashion revival that'll sweep throughout the entire city and the communities here. Bring every church in unity with Christ, and may there be great joy throughout the entire city. Grant it, Lord. Bless these few words now. Inspire speaker and listener. And may the Holy Spirit move on our hearts in such a way, that when we leave here tonight, may we say with those who came from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us because of His Presence." For we ask it His Name. Amen.

L-12 This soul cry of these Greeks... The Greeks seek wisdom and the Jews seek signs; and Paul said, "We preach Christ crucified." And Greeks has always wanted wisdom. But these Greeks come up (perhaps were proselytes to the Jewish religion), and came up to Jerusalem to worship at the Pentecostal feast. And then while they were up there, they had heard of the great fame of this One Jesus of Nazareth. His fame had scattered everywhere. Many disbelieved Him. Thousands disbelieved Him. But thousands believed Him. And it was mostly among the common people who heard Him and believed Him. Those who were of the other type, they did not have much time for Him 'cause they were satisfied with their religion. And they had--fathers had been taught certain things and their--and they'd had their traditions handed down. And something new, no matter how phenomena it was, and... Well, He tried to tell them it was in the Scriptures that He was to come. "And oh, well, they, if--if--if He was to be the person, the priest would know something about it." And therefore, they wasn't interested. But these Greeks when they heard... Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word of God. And they come seeking Jesus. And this... I believe that has been the heart's cry of every man and every woman who's ever heard anything about Jesus Christ has had that same thing: "Sir, we would see Jesus." They didn't want to learn His theology. They didn't care nothing about His teachings. They didn't care about whether He, what kind of clothes He wore. They were only interested in one thing: that they wanted to see Jesus. That's the main thing. And that's the cry of today.

L-13 And Christian friends, as a missionary myself, returning from foreign fields; and then as I come into Africa, I was met there by the Council of Churches of South Africa. And all the--from one coast to the other, a great council of churches they taken me out. They said "Brother Branham, we--we didn't want you to come over to teach us some new theology. We didn't want you to come over to teach the Word, for perhaps we more--know more about it over here than you American scholars do. For we find that in your missionaries that come over." Said, "But what we are trying to find, we want to see God's Word made manifest." That's it. The archbishop of India, the Eastern Orthodox Presbyterian, one of the highest churches politically, religiously, politically recognized in the world... Even their baptism will be accepted in a Catholic church, of the Eastern Orthodox. And the archbishop, while I spoke recently at the Chicago Christian Businessmen's banquet, the archbishop was there, and he said, "When they ordained me an archbishop in India... Why," he said, "you all many times send missionaries over," said, "to teach us the Bible." And said, "We know more about It than you'd ever thought of knowing." And that's true. You ought to hear them once. It's an oriental book. We're teaching It in--in a western way, and It's an oriental book written in the eastern way. And our parables and things that we teach out of there sometimes is as far as the east from the west of being right, the way we teach it. You have to see--have to go to the country where the Book was written to understand what they mean." 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min

L-14 He said, "When they ordained me a archbishop over India," he said, "they--all the great presbyters, and the bishops, and the priests, and the cardinals, and all come around and laid hands upon me to receive the Holy Spirit; and all kind of ritualistic prayers they read out of books and everything," and said, "they laid hands on me." Said, "Nothing happened." He said, "I come over here to America, to a person that hardly had education enough to speak right, and laid hands on me, and I received the Holy Ghost." Said, "Now, what's the difference?" Said, "The thing of it is that in India, we don't want to know your tract that you're passing out, or your theology, or building this or that; we want to know Jesus." Amen. Now, that's the cry of the--of the world today, is to know Christ. I believe Paul said to know Christ is life. And he knew Him in the power of His resurrection. Not to know Him by Word; not to know Him... That's... To know Him by Word, that's all right; but that's a long ways from be--being sufficient, to know Him by Word. We got to know Him by Person of His resurrection.

L-15 Now, if tonight that cry would be in Louisville... It's everywhere. "We would see Jesus." Now, let's find out Who this Jesus is. And I believe that if He is what He said He is, and His Word is correct, then He's just the same today that He was then. If He's changed one bit, than the Word is not correct, and our Bible is in error. Now, recently... Oh, not recently, some years ago over in a certain city here on the river, there was a young child who--or, young man, twelve, fourteen years old, who go--went to church and was a very, very, very influential boy. And he--and he--he would love the Lord, and he asked his mother one day; he said, "Mother, if God is so great, could someone ever see God?" She said, "Now, I don't know, sonny." She said, "We go to church and that's all I know about it" Said, "Now, our pastor's going to visit us for lunch." Said, "Why don't you ask him?" So that day he asked the pastor, and the pastor said, "Sonny, no." Said, "No man can see God at any time, never did, or never will see God at any time." Well, he wasn't satisfied with that. He asked his Sunday school teacher. She said, "No, no one could see God."

L-16 And so he took a little trip up here to Six Mile Island with an old fisherman down on the river. Coming down that afternoon after a storm on the river, and oaring his boat, coming along, the rainbow come out back in the east, and as the old fisherman was watching the rainbow, pulling his boat, the tears begin to run down his wrinkled cheeks over his white beard. And the little boy noticed the old fellow, and he rushed up from the--from the stern of the boat towards the middle, and said, "Sir, I'm going to ask you a question that my pastor couldn't answer, my mother couldn't answer, my Sunday school teacher can't answer." Said, "I'm going to ask you." Said, "Can anyone see God?" And the old fisherman pulled the oars into his lap, and put his arms around the little boy, said, "God bless you, honey. All I've seen for the past thirty-five years has been God." You get God in here, you can see Him out there. See? But He's got to come in here first. It's got to come here first, before you can see Him there.

L-17 Jesus said the same thing: "A little while, and the world seeth Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Now, there's going to be some "Ye's" in all the generations, in all the ages. Is that right? "Ye shall see Me." That is the believer. Now, if we were going to look for Jesus tonight, we wouldn't exactly look to see what kind of clothes He was wearing, see how much education, what degree He had out of what college, or what denomination He belonged to; for we'd never find Him in any of that. Although as good as that is, we'd never find Jesus in that, mixed up in some organization, or some wearing of some clothes, or a certain way of dressing. He dressed like an ordinary man. He walked through the streets as other men, looked no different from anyone else. And He walked through people, the crowds, and they looking for Him and couldn't recognize Him, because He looked just like an ordinary man. But yet He was God Himself. God was in--in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.

L-18 When He was here on earth there never was a birth like His. There never was a death like His. And there never was nobody raised from the dead like that. He proved what He was. When He was here on earth, He said He was God. He acted like God. He preached like God. He healed like God. He rose from the dead like God. He proved He was God. 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min He was more than a philosopher. He was more than a teacher. He was more than a scholar. He was more than a prophet; He was God. That's Who He was. And the people today are limiting Him to a good man, to a teacher, or to a scholar, or to a prophet. He was more than that. He was God Himself, our Saviour, God made and manifested in the flesh to take away sin and sickness from the human beings; and to redeem us back to God like we was in the beginning. And thanks be to God we're on our road back tonight. That's right. And we're seeing great things and rejoicing as we're going along the journey as the children of Israel did, passing through the wilderness. They had a brass serpent for their healing. They had water from a rock when they were thirsty. They had manna from heaven; signs and wonders following them all the time. And there was the others setting up there just as fundamental as they was in their teaching but had no signs and wonders. But God was a vindicating His true believers by signs and wonders, and that was a very beautiful type of the church today being led where signs and wonders are following the believer. If you notice those other nations were organized and set down in great organizations and so forth. But Israel dwelt in tents. I'd call them interdenominational then. They were setting out there without an organization, without a place, just wandering about through the wilderness, just as the Holy Spirit would lead. Isn't that a perfect type of the church today: the called out separated, set aside? How wonderful.

L-19 Now, notice again. When Jesus was here, the people knew that He healed the people, but He didn't claim to do it Himself. He said He didn't do it. Who did He say done it? "The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. It's not Me that doeth the works." Then if we would see Jesus tonight, we wouldn't say a--see a man saying, "Come to me, and I'll show you how to heal you. I'll do this." He wouldn't be that type of person, would He? Because when He was here He gave credit to the Father that was in Him doing the works. Is that right? Then we seen Him going about doing good, We seen Him persecuted, made fun of, laughed at, called His hand: somebody always at his neck, trying their best to get something on Him. They'd get Him into a corner, twist Him around and everything, trying to make Him a liar, and make Him a fake, make Him a deceiver. But every time God come on the scene and proved that that was His Son. Is that right? God's still the same tonight. Don't you believe that? Everything that takes place just set still. God's on the scene; He'll make all things right.

L-20 And then we seen Him of that type of Person. And now... And what He was here on earth, we notice the characters about Him that drawed people to Him, was first was His love for the people. He loved the people, and the people knew that He loved them, because He had something to tell them. They knew this Man was acquainted behind the curtain yonder of death. They knew that He knew something about the world beyond, the regions beyond. So they loved to talk with Him. He talked His talk with seasoned and mellow. There was something... His characters, I doubt whether there'd be a artist could ever paint it. If it's true, in a vision one time, I saw Him. I say that humbly, because I couldn't say it positive. But if it is, there's never an artist could paint that picture of His characters. He was a Man Who could be stern and speak; and yet, He was a Man Who was humble and loving. He was so many different characters in Him, that people, you couldn't paint His picture. He was God's manifestation of love, power, and deity, and everything was in Him.

L-21 Then we notice Him as He went around, He, on the earth here, He had a--a something about Him that was different from ordinary men. We see Him one day in His prayer line, at the beginning of His ministry, when His fame first started. And there was a fellow by the name of Philip who got saved. And he believed on the Lord Jesus, and he begin to tell people about Him, wanted to run, tell everybody. That's a good sign he really got saved, isn't it? When he wants to tell somebody. He ran and tell his friend Nathaniel, and when he found Nathaniel, he found him under a tree, perhaps praying. And he said, "Come, see Who I have found, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph." He said, "Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Said, "Come, see." And when He come to where He was--where He was... Now, a just fine, religious man of really perhaps orthodox in his beliefs, come walking up, said, "I'll see about this fellow." And when he walked up, Jesus said, "Ah, behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile." 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min Well now, what would you think would happen today? The believer today, or the man would say, "Say, that guy's a mind reader. He knew that I was a believer. He knew that I was a Christian." Well, He said, "In whom there is no guile." And so he thought, 'Well, I'll just ask the man.' Said, "Whence knowest Thou me, Rabbi?" "Why," He said, "before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." Why, he said, "You're the Son of God, the king of Israel." See?

L-22 And then, we see another time where He met a woman at the well. And He talked to her awhile. And He found out that she had some troubles; that was, that she'd had five husbands. And the one she lived with then wasn't her husband. And in telling her this, she run, said, "Come, see a Man, Who told me all things I did." Now, do you imagine He had a lot of critics? He was the... He said when He went to the grave of Lazarus, "I am the Resurrection and Life: He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: whosoever lives and believes in Me shall never die." He said that. That's the truth. Well if He was the Resurrection and Life, why didn't He raise up all the dead that died in Jerusalem during the time of His stay? If He'd make that statement tonight in Louisville, Kentucky, the newspapers in the morning would be publishing it everywhere: "Well, the doctors might as well just get rid of their instruments and everything. We got a man here now that can raise the dead. So it's all over." But He only raised three people in His entire ministry. Three is a confirmation. Three is a sign. The Bible said, "In the mouth of two or three witnesses, let every word be established." He raised Lazarus from the dead, Jairus' daughter, and the woman, the widow woman's son: three in His ministry for a sign. Yet if what--if He was the Resurrection and Life, probably thousands of Jews, right out of the church, orthodox in their belief, renown in their religion, and so forth, died during that time. Perhaps hundreds of people come to Him, "Come raise my son. Come raise my daughter. Raise my father." Jesus said, "Let the dead bury the dead; follow thou Me." He never went to them. And then what about that? Here's His Word said He was the Resurrection and Life and here He is failing to produce that: only with a sign now and then.

L-23 Now, we know that He, when He's possessed with powers, and God was in Him, and here He goes to the pool of Bethesda. That's Saint John the 5th chapter. Now, listen close. There lay great multitudes of people, impotent folks, lame, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at certain seasons and troubled the water: whoever stepping in first was made whole of what disease they had. Here comes Emmanuel, God Himself inveiled here before human eyes: God, made manifest in the flesh. He said to Thomas... Thomas said, " Show us the Father and it'll suffice us." He said, "I been so long with you, and you don't Me?" Said, "When you see Me, you see the Father? And why say, 'Showeth us the Father?'" Here comes then, God Jehovah in flesh, walking among, crippled, lame, blind, halt, withered people: full of love, full of compassion and yet touched none of them. "I would see Jesus. Sirs, we would see Jesus." See what I mean? He walked right by each one of them and went over to a man laying on a pallet; said, "Will you be made whole?" He said, "I have no one to put me to water." "You can walk?" "Yes. While I'm coming down, somebody can outrun me and beat me into the water; they get the blessing. I set here month after month waiting." He had a disease he wasn't going to die with it. He had it thirty-eight years. And Jesus said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" and He told Him he had no one to put him in the water. He said, "Take up your bed and go into your house."

L-24 If you'll notice the previous reading of the Scripture said, "Jesus knew that the man had been a long time in this way." See? He knew. Why didn't He go to these? He knew nothing about them. But He knew about this one. Then the Jews found this man packing his bed on the sabbath day and questioned him, and perhaps was questioning Jesus about these things. "Why won't He heal that one? Let me see Him make this one well and I'll believe it. Let me see Him heal this one; I'll believe it." And yet people were being healed everywhere. Them same critical ungodly spirits still...?... exist today. 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min "Let me see Him heal this one and I'll believe it." See? The devil takes his man, but never his spirit. God takes His man, but never His Spirit. His Spirit lives right on. God's Spirit lives on in men, on and on and on. "Ye shall see Me, for I will be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." See?

L-25 Then there's "Ye's" still living that sees it and believes it. As Brother Cauble just said, as I was standing there at the hall, that how the people right here in this church with doctor's statement. And yet the whole country criticizes Divine healing. Why is it? They try to think it's fake, it's something put up. It's because that the devil that lives in them won't let them believe. Their eyes are blinded from truth, and they can't believe. They haven't got nothing to believe with. How can I move a hand if I haven't got a hand to move with? How can I believe God when I'm just looking at a Word here and Him not in here. You got to have God in here first 'fore you can believe God. "Except a man be borned again, he can't see the Kingdom of God." Is that right? "See it" is "understand it." So how can a man that's not born again know what anything about the Kingdom of God? Jesus said Himself, "Except a man be borned of water and spirit he will, can in no wise..." He can't understand it; there's no need of looking at it. He can't do it. And many of these people who deny these know no more about God than a rabbit would know about snowshoes. They--they just simply don't know. They say, "Oh, I there's God, yes, uh-huh." That's all there is to it. But, brother, to know Jesus is to know Life, personally accepting the Person Christ Jesus, that lives in the heart of the human being. Yes, then you have a challenging faith. Then there's something in there that you know you're not standing alone. As Jesus said, "The mouth... The testimony of two is what you require." He said, "I testify and My Father speaks; and both of Us makes a true testimony."

L-26 If I stand here tonight and speak of something and God the Almighty speaks back, that's a testimony if two is a confirmation. Is that right? If God... If I say you can receive the Holy Ghost, and God comes down and gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's a confirmation of the truth. Someone said the Holy Ghost was only for years gone by. The Holy Ghost is today. There's people setting right here now, hosts of them that's baptized with the Holy Ghost right now. So no matter what the critics say, you got to expect that. Don't listen to it. Just close up your ears and go on. We're holding the services for the Lord Jesus Christ. And by God's help that's what we're going to do until Jesus comes, or He changes the order. And men who are ordained of God and sent of God, look to God for instruction, and look to God to what to do with, and God takes care of His man. He always does.

L-27 Now, Jesus passing through there and the question, "Why didn't he heal the whole bunch?" And why... Listen at His Word now: "Verily, verily, I say unto you; the Son can do nothing in Himself; but He what sees the Father doing that doeth the Son likewise." "Sirs, we would see Jesus" If you'd see Him, that's the kind of Person He would be. See? "A little while and the world seeth Me no more. Yet you'll see Me; for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Is that right? Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Then as we notice Him, He didn't claim to be any great person; He only bragged on God constantly. He said God was in Him, and God did the works. Now, if Jesus has risen from the dead... Do you believe that? Say, "Amen." say... [Congregation says "Amen"--Ed.] Every one in here will admit that Jesus, according to the Scripture, has risen from the dead. Do you believe the Scriptures to be the Truth? Does thou believe this Word to be the truth? Then if Jesus has risen from the dead, then He's just the same today as He was then. The only difference is, He lived in flesh then of His own; He lives in the flesh of us tonight. "The things that I do, shall ye also, for I will be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Amen. There you are. I hope you see it.

L-28 Jesus Christ rose from the dead this beautiful Easter now that we're just about to face now. And I think of those men coming from Emmaus, and Jesus walking with them, and didn't know it. And many people here in Louisville tonight walk with Christ daily, and yet don't know it. People setting here in this building tonight has walked today with Christ and perhaps don't know it. But when He got them inside, or Him inside with them one time, they asked Him, said, "Come in and--and stay with us. The night is far spent. Won't You come in?" And so, He--He offered their invitation. It was a little humble place perhaps. No matter how humble it is, He'll come. 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min No matter how humble your welcome is to Him, He'll come to the humblest in this building. He'll come to the poorest; He'll come to your home. He'll do something that you'll know He's there, if you'll just open up and let Him. Then Jesus, once inside with these disciples who He'd walked with, He made Hisself known to them. And if you've never believed in Divine healing, never believed in the power of the resurrection of Christ, just invite Him into your heart tonight, and He'll make Hisself known in you. Just... He'll do something, just the way He broke that bread. They said, "Why, it's been Him all the time." You see? And they were believers.

L-29 And you notice, it taken them all day to make that journey over there, and they went back just in a few minutes. How much different your step will be after you know Jesus. How much lighter your life will be, walking on clouds, rejoicing. And all that old ungodly shackled-down condition will be gone, and you'll be resurrected with Him in His resurrection: believing Him, having faith in Him, and know that all things are working to the good for you; that He's leading you, loving you, blessing you, going before you, taking you to--to heaven; making you immortal when the resurrection comes; healing your sickness along the road, performing miracles. And your--your eyes are open; then you can see. See? Until your eyes come open, you can't see. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever...

L-30 Now if Jesus has risen from the dead, He can come into this building tonight and perform and do to these people like He would if He stood here in human flesh. Is that right? Then if you'd see Jesus, open up your heart tonight. Invite Him in, like they did on their, at Emmaus. Say, "Open up my heart, Lord. You just come in. I come here tonight to criticize. But I'm going to change my opinion right now. I'm just going to open up my heart and see if You really will come in." Watch what you think when you begin to go out the door tonight. You'll think and know that Jesus Christ has--has risen from the dead and living with us now. The Lord bless you my friends. You're lovely. I could talk to you all night. But I keep talking I'll be preaching after a while and that kinda takes away from the value of praying for the sick. 'Cause that's what we're going to have for tonight. And the Lord bless you now.

L-31 Now, as these Greek said, "We would see Jesus... Now, we wouldn't hear some of His teaching, or we wouldn't hear this, or we wouldn't know where He stays at, but we would see Jesus." How many of you would like to see Him tonight? Let's see your hands, all over the building. He's looking at you. Well, my prayer is that--that He will make Hisself manifested to you tonight, each one of you: make Him manifested to you. And before I start the meeting... Now, friends, this is nothing to do with me or any individual. It... I'm trying my best with all I know how to do to make life a little easier for my fellow man: to get them to believe on the Lord, be borned again of His Spirit; and to pray for the sick when they're needy; and to help them, make life a little better. Many times people are standing... Many of you people right here in this building tonight from right around the home places here, that would've been dead in their grave if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ. And I am one of them. That's right. I'd have went years ago right here in the Jewish hospital when a doctor of this city, one of the famous doctors of this city, give me three minutes to live. And I'm here by the grace of God. Then when He let me live, I gave my heart to Him and been screaming from the housetop ever since. And I believe Him with all my heart. May He come tonight and bless your humble soul.

L-32 Now, I guess that Billy give out some prayer cards; and he just got me there in the car and I forgot... Anybody got a prayer card? What--what's the letter on it? Tell me what a letter is. Y. All right. That'll be fine. All right. That's all I have to know. All right. We can't pray for everybody at one time (You know.) in one meeting. I don't want to call too many at a time, but I want to... I just wanted to call as many as I can and pray for them. And now, remember the only thing that I can do is to pray for you. Remember, God is your Healer. Let's say that together. "God is your Healer." [Congregation says "God is your healer" with Brother Branham--Ed.] See? I only pray for you. And not only am I praying for you up here, but them out there will be praying for you too. These back here will be praying for you too. See? And together we're trying our best to help you: no other purpose at all. God knows that. It's not a financial affair. If that'd been so, I'd accepted the money a long ago, in one offering been multimillionaire, so I'd have retired. Retire? God, let me live to be a hundred and still preaching the Gospel. There's no retiring to this if He tarries. 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min

L-33 No, it's not a... It's not that, friends. It's not money. It's not popularity. God knows that. He'd take it away from me right now. It's not popularity. It's because I'm wanting to help you. That's--God knows that that's the truth. He'd... And I tell the truth. And God knows that that's the truth. He has backed me up many a hard battles and close places that I've been into, like He did my Master; but every time God has come on the scene and helped me. I have been challenged in every thing. I've been challenged about three times here in the United States that I know of. And one of those people that did the challenge is in the insane institution tonight. The other two is in the grave. And so, it didn't have to wait no week for it to happen; it happened then. See?

L-34 So then, I--I--I have never feared. I've just went humbly to preach the Gospel. As God sent me to do this. And the things that I speak of right here... Even in one of your papers here not long ago, the old "Louisville Herald," I believe it was, or something like that, declared the article when it was down here on the river, and that Light come down and hung over where I was at, when I was baptizing, a young minister many years ago out across the country. Now, they got the picture of it. Many of you have it in your homes, hanging in Washington, DC. Throughout there's thousands times thousands of pictures. And when the best of fingerprint and document can be found in the United States has checked it over and went to everywhere, and he declares it to be a supernatural Being. There's probably people setting right here tonight who seen It come right down, visible before your eyes; and I pray that it'll do it in here in Louisville this week: right down before the people. And I have told the truth. God has testified it is the truth. And the scientific world has to say it's the truth. Now, you can draw your opinion. May the Lord bless you.

L-35 Now, in seeing a vision, as you all know, that you--all of you's been in my meeting. Might be one or two that hasn't been here. It's--it's a Divine gift. It's just like a gift to play music. I was watching the little ladies here tonight and this morning it was now, when I was here how they we're playing that music so lovely. My, I wish I could do that. But I can't. I don't... Only thing I know... I don't know whether it's in tune or out of tune. I just know it's making a noise and it's music, and that's all I know about it. But let it get out a little tune, they could tell you, because they're musicians. See? Well, I--I wouldn't know. And to build this house... I was noticing the--the architect of it. I'd like to see one like this I'd build. It--it would look horrible. But you see, God has men to build houses; He has some to preach the Gospel, some to teach. God has set... God has set in the church, first, apostles, a prophets, teachers, evangelists, and gifts of healing, and working of miracles, and so forth: all for the perfecting of the saints: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever.

L-36 Now, if He stood here tonight, behind this desk where I'm standing, with His human flesh, wearing the same suit standing here, that as far as healing you, He could not do it. For He couldn't do twice, what He's done once did it. See? He's already healed you. "By His stripes you were healed," said Peter in the New Testament. Is that right? Isaiah spoke of it coming. "He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity." Isaiah... Peter afterward said that's where it was done. There's where you was forgiven of your sins at Calvary. You just accepted it. He did it two thousand years ago, and you accepted it w--last week, or two years ago, or whenever it was. He healed you two thousand years ago; you can accept it tonight. But the only thing we can do would be the preaching of the Gospel or some sign to get your faith pointed to Jesus Christ. Is that right? The Lord bless you.

L-37 Now, let's line the people up to the right over here. Let's take... Where did it begin? Was this 1 to a 100? All right. Let's start from 1 then, and start over there. Who has prayer card number 1? Hold up your hand. Prayer card number 1? Look over on your... It's a little bitty card like this, got your name and address on it, and--and over here it's got it a--a the picture and a number. Where is it number 1? [Someone asks "Y"?--Ed.] Y--Y, yes Y-1. Come right over here, lady. Y-2, who has 2? Prayer card 2? All right, lady. 3, who has 3? Raise up your hand so I'll know. 3? All right, sir, over here. 4, who has number 4? Prayer card 4? 5, who has 5? Raise up your hand. Prayer card number 5? Somebody look on the back of your card. Maybe a deaf and dumb person can't speak or hear. What? Number 5. Prayer card number 5? Pardon me. All right, number 6, who has number 6? Prayer card 6? 7. Raise up your hand as quickly as you can. 7? 7? Has somebody prayer card 7? Look at somebody who's setting next to you. It may be somebody who can't get up or 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min something. Someone will help them up if they can just get... Prayer card 7? All right. 8, who has prayer card number 8? All right, 8, 9? Prayer card 9? 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. All right, is... I... Just line up over there according to your numbers and--and let's see how many we got in there then. And all right. And if...

L-38 All right now, if the--if sister on the organ there will give us "Only Believe," let's just sing humbly and reverently. I'm going to ask you one thing. Now, it's right now about twenty after; if you'll just give me a few minutes and don't stir around... Now, listen to these instructions if you will. Don't stir during the time of the prayer. Stand still. Watch. And if on the platform something takes place, hold your peace; just set still. See? Now, ushers will see to that in the audience. See? Just set still. Now, if God does some miracle or something and you want to rejoice, rejoice. That's perfectly all right. We like for you to do that: to rejoice. But we--but we want you to be reverent. Don't stir around; keep your children near you, and so forth in the--in the meeting. All right. All things are possible, only believe. Now, like slowly now let's try to sing it. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only ... only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Wonder if we could get it this way: "Now I believe," right now. Wonder if we could just raise up our hands with our eyes closed and sing it to Him now. Now I believe, now I believe, ... possible, now I believe; Now I believe, now I believe, (Praise God)... believe.

L-39 Father in heaven, we ask that Your blessing will be with us, and may the Lord Jesus come into this church now, take over our being. And may the Holy Spirit tonight, do the work of Jesus Christ. You said in Your Word, "When He, the Holy Spirit has come, He will bring these things to your remembrance, and will show you things to come; and He will testify of Me." And I pray, God, that the Holy Spirit, in my heart, testifying of Jesus Christ, will show to the world tonight, or the people that's here present, that our Lord Jesus has risen from the dead and lives among us. Grant these blessings; in Jesus Christ's Name and for His glory. Amen. Excuse me I'm going to take this here, 'cause I'm not--don't speak too loud. Everybody in harmony believing now, say, "Amen," if you are. Everybody in harmony believing. Now, settle yourself down. Now, you can watch this way till you hear me say close your eyes.

L-40 And now remember, I have to say this according to the law of Indiana and many other places, I suppose Kentucky also. I've never asked. But I am not responsible for critics (See?), or critics or unbelievers who are setting near. Remember, if you are that person, don't stay during this part of the service; for let it be known unto you, as I speak in the Name of the Lord: these diseases go from one to another. That's right. And on an unbeliever, you can do nothing with it. That's right. So there's many persons tonight who's been in the meeting, criticizing and so forth, and we have tape recordings to show what happened. So now, may the Lord help you and bless you. And you just set quiet; be reverent. Pray for me, your brother. As I minister to the sick. All right.

L-41 Now... Patient... Now, how many in this building now, standing here, that doesn't have a prayer card and wants to be prayed for? Raise up your hands, everywhere in the building. Well, it's just a--a general everywhere. Now, I'm going to ask you something. Now, if you will believe this to be the honest truth with all your heart, I'll assure you, the Holy Spirit will move right out there in that audience to where you're at. Do you believe the same Jesus that the woman touched the hem of His garment... Her faith touched Him in such a way till He turned and looked over His audience to see who touched Him; said, "Thy faith hath saved thee." She had a blood issue. Do you believe that? That's the 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min Scripture. Well, if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, isn't He the same when He's operating in our flesh? Isn't it right? Now, let your faith touch Him; see what He does about it. The Lord bless you. Now, for God's glory, I take every spirit in this building under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the glory of God. I'm sure you understand what that means. Be reverent.

L-42 I... How do you do? I suppose now that you and I are strangers. As far as I know, I've never seen you. God has seen us both, knows both of us. And I'm just a man; you're a woman standing here. That's all I know about you. Now, are you a believer? Now, if you're a believer, all things are possible to them that believe. Now, if Jesus was standing here mythically by my side, and He was talking to you like He did the woman at the well, He would know you, know all about you. Is that right? And He'd know and could tell you just like He could out in the audience. But would you believe it then to be the truth with all your heart? You--you would believe it. [The lady speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] Is that a fact? Now, you hear the testimony; I suppose. Is there... Where was it at, lady? ...?... Connersville. That's just a couple summers ago, or last summer? Last summer. And you had, what was it? Rectal trouble, three operations. And a rectal trouble out in the audience and the Holy Spirit moved out there, and--and called you out, and healed you out there in the audience.

L-43 There's the first patient standing here. [The lady speaks to Brother Branham--Ed.] You hear her testimony, what taken place after that? What supernaturally taken place there? I knew not the woman. I don't know her now, only just what you know... And God in heaven knows that's true. Of--of on this Bible laying here before me, and God is my Judge: that's just the... That's what I know about her there. Far as I know, I never met her, never seen her in my life: seen her out there... I might not have seen her; I just seen that Light standing over her. And maybe just her thoughts, I picked up her thoughts out in the audience. You say, "You--you read her mind then." Well, you want to call it that. Jesus did the same thing. He perceived their thoughts. Is that right? Well, tell me the difference between perceiving a thought and reading a mind. Not this devil's group out here, the little, on the side of the street, and a little hand out like that, that's psychology. It has nothing to do with God.

L-44 But then if the Lord Jesus has risen from the dead, and I'm representing Him here tonight truly, then He would let me know what was wrong with you now, or what--what was wrong. And if He would, would that raise your faith to believe for healing again? It would. All right. May He grant it to you, sister, is my prayer. But it's not that now. You got some kind of an inward trouble. It's in the... It's a... It's a kidney trouble. It's in the bladder too. I see it draining...?... burning sensation coming from the bladder. Isn't that true? And you're... There's something else that you got on your mind. I... Here... No, it--it's about a loved one. It--it's a boy, your son. Isn't that right? He's got something like a--a asthmatic. He's coughing; real, dry coughing all the time. Isn't that right? And aren't you from Indianapolis? Go back home. You're going to get well now. Jesus Christ...?... God bless you. Uh-huh. Have faith in God. Only believe; all things are possible to them that believe. Now, to that woman that was here just few moments ago, she's healed. All right. Have faith in God.

L-45 Howdy do, lady? I suppose from as far as... 'Course now in doing this, standing here. I just put my hand over there, 'cause that... See? It's not... It's the anointing. See? It's anointing. And it makes me feel different than what I really am and read her life, 'cause you're in a dual condition; you're in two worlds at the same time. But I suppose we're strangers to each other. We don't know one another. As far as I know, I don't know you. And we... This is our meeting time. But God knows both of us. Do you believe me to be His servant? ...?... I--I believe that. You have a welcome feeling in your spirit in His Presence being here now. And if there's any help can come, it would have to come through Him. Wouldn't it? You realize; it wouldn't be me, your brother; it would be Him, your Saviour. Is that right? See? You believe it? I see you moving from me. You're having some kind of a, all through your body, like pains like, all through your body. That's a arthritis condition in the nerves, is what's a doing that. 'Causing sharp pains and pains ache through your--your right... You have a, something another; I notice you--you're rubbing your head. It's a--it's a sinus trouble is--is that's 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min what it is. It's come from your head, up your sinuses. And you got a, someone that you're interested in, must be your husband. He has the same thing. Isn't that right? Now, it's--it's coming from in--in here. That's a... And there's something strange about you. It seems like I keep seeing blue water and moving like that. And it's some kind of a person that's you're dealing with; that's a... It--it must be a ... It's a different people. There's something that you... It's India. You--you're a missionary to India. Is that right? It--it... From India. I--I see the... Well, go, Jesus Christ is going to make you well. God bless you, and may you go in peace. God's peace upon you...?...

L-46 Have faith in God. Don't doubt. Only believe. Are you believing with all your heart? [A brother speaks with Brother Branham--Ed.] Yes. God bless you, sir. Just keeps moving, that Light. I--I--I don't--I don't guess you can see It, but here It is standing here. No, it's over this lady here. She... Oh, she has high blood pressure. Isn't that right, lady? You accept your healing now? You don't have to have a card to be healed, but you accept your healing now? Go home then; be well, and may the Lord Jesus bless you and make you well. Oh, Christian friend, the Lord Jesus Christ anointing this audience. Only have faith in Him; you shall see the glory of God, His great manifestation of His blessing.

L-47 Are you a believer, sir, setting there? Lay your hand over on that lady with that red looking coat on setting there. She's setting there praying. She's got sort of a chest trouble that's been bothering her. Isn't that right, lady? Yes. Now, lay your hand over on her there, that she be healed. Lord Jesus, may the power of God come upon the woman and make her completely well. I ask it in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you. You believe now with all your heart? Now, you lay your hand on the lady next to you there to get rid of... She's got something wrong with her. Yes, you laid your hand in the right place. She has a--a asthmatic condition. Isn't that right, lady? Wave your hand, if that's right. I see you're trying to--to--to... All right. O Almighty God, may Your Spirit come to her now, as You're favoring her by standing here, speaking through Your servant; I ask that she be made well; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. As you believe, so will it be to you. You know something left you then. Now, just keep believing, and it won't return. But when you disbelieve, it will return...?...

L-48 Come. Oh, He is so wonderful. His blessings are upon His people. All right. How do you do, sir? 'Course, I see you got a--something on your throat there: looks awful red. I don't know what it is, but God does know. You believe me to be His prophet or His servant? You do? With all your heart you believe that, do you? Sir, that's a cancer. Isn't that right? Being that that was showing, a flashing on your neck, for the benefit of the audience, that they might know, you look to me and believe me with all your heart. Something else might be wrong, 'cause that's showing. If there's a man setting there crippled, and I said he was crippled, anybody knows that. They're looking at it. You're a stranger here. You're not from this country. You're from a country where there's a lot of hardwood and there's little lakes like. And that's a... It's kind of a lot of swamp country near you there. And you're from a small city. And that... You're from Missouri. And the name of the city starts with a K. It's Kennett, Missouri. Is that right? And you... You're--you're a stranger to me, but your name is--is Matterson or something like that. M-a-t--Matterson. Isn't it? Matteson. And your initial is I. A. Is that true? Go believe now and the cancer will leave. God bless you. Jesus Christ...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-49 ...the side, you have something wrong with your side, don't you, lady? You thought I was talking to you awhile ago and when I looked at you. Stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ makes you well. Go believing. Have faith in God. Don't doubt. All right. You believing now, lady? All right. Do you believe me to be His servant? Well, we're strangers to one another; I--I believe. I have never seen you. If I'm correctly believing right... Now, I want you come just a little more near me, because of the emotion at the platform. Well, God's going to judge us both some of these days, lady. You're aware of that. You're aware right now that you're standing in the Presence of something besides a man. And is that true? Now, that won't hurt you. That's--that's some power that you say you feel moving in. That's the Angel of the Lord. You are... You got... The... I see you moving 54-0328, Sirs, We Would See Jesus, The Church Of The Open Door, Louisville, KY, 73 min away from a table; there's something. It's--it's--it's in the stomach. You got stomach trouble. And that's caused from a liver condition. It empties into the stomach, 'causes sourness and bitterness... And--and you're with somebody. It's a... It's somebody... It's your mother. And she's here too. And she's got stomach trouble also. And she... Isn't there something wrong with her neck? She's got something wrong with her neck? And you--you come here. You're not from this city. You're from up the river: Cincinnati. And you come here by bus. And you're supposed to leave tonight at nine o'clock. Go in the Name of the Lord Jesus and be made well. And go. You won't have to worry about... Go eat your supper now; be made well now; in Jesus' Name.

L-50 Come. Lady, I see you're moving slowly. 'Course you probably perhaps very disabled. I suppose we're strangers to each other. We're not? Oh, you've been in my meetings before. Well, God knows both of us, doesn't He? I know nothing about you as far... I don't know nothing about you. But God knows all about you. You are... If God will reveal to me what you're trouble is, will you accept Him as your Healer? I--I see some kind of a white looking room. Oh, it's a hospital. You--you've just been operated. That's been about a year ago. It's caused a weakness that you've never got over it. You're suffering with a flu or something now. Isn't that right? Aren't you some--aren't you a Miss Arnold's mother, or something? I seen her standing near you. Oh, God, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I bless this poor mother for her healing. May she go tonight and recover; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, rejoicing now, being happy, believing with all your heart and receive your healing.

L-51 Come, lady. You believe? You believe that Holy Spirit, Who's going to judge us both at the day of judgment... If He would reveal your trouble, would you accept your healing? That anointing shakes me so; it makes me so weak, I... See? And I try just to see or either pray... If I didn't tell you nothing, pray for you the way you are now, you believe you'd be healed. See, your faith has met something. Before I even say anything, it's gone from you. That's right. I know it's just turned real white around you. I'll see what was wrong. You had heart trouble. Now, she can go home, thanking God, being happy. God bless you. Father, bless her I pray; in the Name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Have faith now, believing with all your heart. You believe, sir? If I would not say one word to you, just pray for you, you believe you'll get well? You... That's the way to believe. You're convinced then that I told you truth, haven't you? All that sickness would leave you and everything, you can go home and be... Is that right? It will. God bless you...?...

L-52 Let's say thanks be to God. That man believes God. Just only have faith. Believe it with all your heart; you shall receive. Come...?... lady. Are you believing with all your heart? I believe that, mother. Now, if I could heal you and wouldn't do it, I'd be a brute, wouldn't I be? But I... Blessed be the Lord.
