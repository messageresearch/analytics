--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Baxter. Good evening, friends. I'm very happy to be here tonight to worship with you, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. How we love Him; what He is to us. No wonder it was said, "Eye has not seen, ear has not heard... has entered the heart of man what God has for them, in store, that love Him." He's certainly wonderful. And... Thank you. It's kinda strange to have a metal flower, isn't it? Well, this is supposed to be something to help me to send my voice out there a little farther. I'm kindy small and I haven't got very much of a voice anyhow, so I guess they have to kinda step it up a little bit in there to it make it go out. Was some... My boy was telling me just a few moments ago that Brother Jackson is with us. Yeah, God bless you, Brother Jackson. I'm very happy to see him here with us tonight. The Lord bless Brother Jackson.

L-2 Coming up the road, when Billy come down and picked me up, he said, "Daddy," said, "Brother Jackson's up there tonight." And I was looking for him the other day. And I was thinking of Brother Jackson and I when we first met. It was up, I believe at a revival at his church, I believe it was when we met each other up in... Was that Kennet, Missouri? Thaxton, Thaxton, Missouri. Well, Brother Jackson, a lot of water went over the dam since then, hasn't it? But the Lord has been using Brother Jackson in a most unusual way. One of the great gifts that's to the church... He prays for the sick with a marvelous success. And not only that, but he--he has one of the outstanding phenomenals of the day of the baptism of the Spirit of laying on the hands.

L-3 Now when I first come to Pentecostal people, I hear them talking about seeking and tarrying for the Holy Ghost. I couldn't understand that. Why tarry when the Holy Ghost has been here for some two thousand years? I seen the word "tarry" doesn't mean pray. "Tarry" means "wait." Well, I seen they had to wait until the day of Pentecost had fully come, but after that, there was no waiting. While Peter spake this word, the Holy Ghost fell on them. Paul laid his hands upon them and they received the Holy Ghost. Well, it seemed to me like there was a little something different. When Philip went out and preached to the Samaritans, they all received the Word and was baptized, but the Holy Ghost had come upon none of them. Paul, I mean Peter, came down, he and John, and he prayed and laid hands on them. The Holy Ghost came on them. Well, I thought, "That's the way I believe it would be Apostolic. That's the way the Scripture says it." And now, that's just the thing that God has done for our Brother Jackson. I've never seen it; I've heard of it so much. My boy told me that he was up at--up at Dallas when Brother Jackson was up there. And seen him line the people up, somewhere along the altar somewhere, and went along laying hands on them and them receiving the Holy Ghost as he laid hands on them. That's what the Scripture says. That's... I just believe it. That's--that's way the Scripture says it's to be done. So I--I'm so happy about that, that God has give that to our church just before the coming of the Lord. Isn't that marvelous? Oh, my. We ought to be the happiest people on earth.

L-4 Use our armor. We've got a armor. God works with us and gives us the armor. And the whole armor is on the supernatural See, see? Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience is all in the supernatural. And if you let your faith loose to God's Spirit, it make--brings your body in subjection to God's redemptive blessing to you. And anything that Jesus died for, He's setting at the right hand of the Father, tonight, making intercessions upon your confession. Whatever you confess that He's done, and believe it, it's your personal property. Every believer, every person that's born again, has the right to any of the redemptive blessings. When you get saved, Jesus just takes and hands you a checkbook to last you all through life's journey, and His Name's signed at the bottom of every one of them. Whatever we have need of, "you ask the Father in My Name, it'll be done." Just sign a check and send it up there. Are you afraid to sign one tonight? No, fill her out; send it up; it's recognized. Yes, sir, it's recognized. He'll certainly bring it to pass.

L-5 Now, I just a little late, so... My services, I don't hold them long, as you notice, because it's under vision. And vision makes me so weak. It does anyone. And I just read a little bit here now and then we'll go right into the service. 53-0217, Only Believe, Pentecostal Holiness Church, Tallahassee, FL, 11 min In the second chapter of Saint Luke for just a Scripture reading, beginning with thee 25th verse we read this: And behold there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name is Simeon... the same man was just... devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death, before he'd seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parent brought the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law, Then took he Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, "Lord, not lettest Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy Word: For my eyes have seen thy salvation.

L-6 Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Lord Jesus, may we tonight, as Your believing people that come together here, looking for the second coming of our Lord to receive us into His glorious Kingdom where there'll be no end to that great age... And now may we tonight, as Simeon of old, lift the Saviour in our arms of faith. You promised us all these blessings and we believe that we receive them through faith. Forgive us of our shortcomings, our sins, trespasses against You, realizing that unbelief is sin. Then forgive us, Lord, of our unbelief. Help us tonight as we've gathered here: different churches, different peoples, different nationalities, but the same God working in all. And help us now to receive of Thy blessings and may the Holy Spirit come take the things of God and pass that right out to the people. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-7 Just a moment, for... First thing, if any minister comes to the platform to preach, first he must feel his congregation. You've got to get your spiritual bearing, then that helps you so much. You can feeled it out where faith is. I guess Brother Jackson's very familiar with that, to where you have faith. Now, in the Scripture reading, we find an elderly man by the name of Simeon. We, perhaps call him an old sage with his long white beard and hair, somewhere around in his eighty's. And he was a very pious, religious person. And the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he wasn't going to die until he seen the Lord's Christ. And he wasn't afraid to go around telling people that he wasn't going to die until he seen the Lord.

L-8 Now, could you imagine how fanatically that seemed to the people. Why, I can hear some of them would say, say, "The old fellow's kindly, you know he's kind of got old and his mind's give away, and--and that's the condition he's in. Why, why look. Even David looked for Him, and all down... Why, it's been four thousand years and here this old man almost ready to go into the grave now, says he isn't going to die until he sees the Christ. And here we are all over here and under the Roman Empire, under governments of the Romans and, why, we couldn't... Well, the Christ isn't going to come now."

L-9 But Simeon had a grounds to believe because it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he wasn't going to die until he seen Christ. Now that's the good way to believe: when the Holy Spirit reveals it to you, believe it. There's just a whole lot in this Book that I--much, that I don't know anything about, but yet I believe every word of It. I can't explain it, but I believe it. And I'm running a series myself now, at home, in Genesis, taking Genesis through. Why, my, would you see the inspiration in Gen... You can take the first chapter of Genesis and weave it through the last chapter of Revelations, through the Bible, every bit of it inspired; how the whole Word of God sets together. And every word of It's inspired; every bit of it is true. The Holy Spirit is overseen that through the age, that all God's Word is inspired.

L-10 And in time, the old wheel grinds slow, but it grinds sure. It's got to be just the way God said it was going to be. No matter how unclear It seems, but It's going to be that way, as we talked last night. One time they didn't have electricity, but some man believed there was such a thing. And he kept working tireless hours until he discovered what it was. And the same thing by television, by automobile, and so forth. God put all these things here for our benefit. Now, if we who are acquainted with the supernatural would just take a--a man, where the man in his senses is limited to his senses. But a man and his spirit is unlimited. The tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back, but the Tree of Life goes on, forever. And how that science has taken man farther with his five senses than we have with his soul. Well, we've got untapped resources where all things are possible.
