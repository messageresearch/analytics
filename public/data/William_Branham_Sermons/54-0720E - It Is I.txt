--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Our kind heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee tonight for the Lord Jesus Christ, our loving Saviour Who came down and redeemed us and made all these wonderful things that we're enjoying now possible through His vicarious suffering and death at Calvary. We thank Thee for this time of fellowship together, as Your people gather together to fellowship one with another, while the Blood of Thy Son, Jesus, cleanses us from all unrighteousness. We're elated tonight to know that the time is drawing near that when we shall see Him face to face, Who we have long's... all of our days to see Him. And we pray that You'll keep us humble in our hearts that we can see Him. Now, may He come tonight in great power and love. And manifest Hisself to the people here. Grant these blessings as we ask in the Name of Jesus, Thy Child. Amen.

L-2 Good evening, friends, it's a privilege to be here tonight, enjoy this fellowship with you, my dear friends. I was almost taken from my feet just now to see my good friend Brother Bosworth setting on the platform. And I kind of was a little indignant, I guess, and walked right by and notice Brother Ekberg there also, these singers, and I was sure happy to be here tonight to see those brethren. And Brother Bosworth's fixing to go to Japan right away. And before we go any farther, we are not people of form, we just do as the Spirit leads. And it's yet early yet, and maybe people yet gathering; the storm, of course, has probably hindered some of our people tonight. But I would like to introduce to this audience, to have just a word or two for us, if he would, one of my close bosom friends, a second father to me on this earth. My father died when I was young. And Brother Bosworth has been like another father to me. He's been lovely; he's been a help to me. And he's... A many, a many meeting have we stood side by side. And I seen this patriarch of the faith stand at the post of duty.

L-3 I seen him the night of the debate when this Angel of the Lord came down and had His picture taken that you see here now, they got of the meeting. It was Brother Bosworth who stood there that night, and this young fellow just out of the seminary, pointing his finger in that old saints face, and having him take his picture like this. And he shaking his fist in that old saintly man's face, and saying, "Now, take my picture. And now take my picture," like that. 'Cause he wanted six pictures taken; he could publish it in his paper in such positions as that. And Almighty God would not permit one of them to be developed. Every one of them was perfect negative. That's right. And then he run up and took the picture when I was standing there and the Angel of the Lord come. And the Angel of the Lord showed up in its place. So you see what the Lord will do.

L-4 Now, I'm going to... Brother Bosworth and I, returned from Africa together. We had a marvelous meeting down there where the Lord did blessed in great things. And Brother Bosworth was in this city, many, many, years ago with Paul Rader, Billy Sunday. He reminds me of an old pine tree that's standing on the hill alone. Only two... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Here, we just love good singing. And we're very grateful for these men who are with us, and for Sister Shakarian, the other singers, the musicians, and so forth, to bring us the Gospel in the way of singing and in music. May the Lord richly bless them. I've always said, "When I get to heaven, I sure want to get around where there's singing. That's where the place that I want to be."

L-5 Now, I just have a very few moments left to speak just a moment or two. This afternoon I think I maybe preached too long this afternoon, and I guess I almost have to apologize. When I got outside, Brother Moore said to me, he said, "Brother Branham, that maniac that you had, had his right mind when you told me... I... he... After he got healed he was going down the street acting like a maniac again, running hard and screaming, 'Glory to God,' and everything." I said, "Well, he was just clothed in his right mind then to worship. You see?" That's right. Jesus give him his right mind to worship in. He was crazy then to the people again, because that he had received his right mind.

L-6 You know, it was said of the disciples, I believe brother said it, they said, "These men turn the world upside down." 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min They didn't turn the world upside down; they just turned it back right again. It seems upside down to everybody else. It'd been upside down so long, till they just turned it back right again. And that's what the Gospel does. In the... Saint Matthew, the 14th chapter and the 27th verse, I wish to read just a portion. And watching the clock, we go right into the prayer line in a few moments, just for a few remarks, in other words, just to feel out my audience, where we're at. Come now each evening expecting God to bless, and tomorrow afternoon at two-thirty. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of a good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

L-7 Now, may the Lord add His blessings to them words. We are speaking again of Jesus. That's all we know to speak about, is Him. And we find Him this time, He was about the Father's business, doing what was--the Father bid Him to do. And we are finding Him on a ship crossing again, another storm on. We find Him this afternoon quietening the seas and giving a maniac his right mind. And now, we find Him tonight where He had been speaking, practically all day. And in His speech, or sermon, many people had followed Him out of Jerusalem. Perhaps the crowd like this, or a little more had followed Him out of Jerusalem, out into a wilderness. And it come time for food and there was no food. And Jesus said to Peter, "You give them something to eat; you feed them." Do you notice, the very things that Jesus did, He expect His Church to do the same things that He did. For He said, "The things that I do shall you also." Now, He said, "You give them bread."

L-8 They said, "Oh, it'd take more pennies, perhaps, then they could gather together to feed such a multitude." And He said, "Have you any bread among you?" And they said, "We have a--a little boy here that has his, a few loaves and fishes, about five loaves and two fishes," or something like that. And He said, "Well, bring them here." Now, if you notice, in order to do something Jesus taken something to do something with. Now, in order to bring faith in this building tonight for healing, Jesus has to take something to do something with. The first thing He has to get, is get somebody here that's got faith to be healed, and that'll strike into the audience.

L-9 I noticed last evening, when the man that was blind was brought up on the platform and received his sight, that struck fire right away. See? The deaf woman that come, while I was yet holding her hand and asking the evil to leave her, she begin quivering all over; she said, "I can hear you, I can hear you." Quickly, it struck fire. And by the time I was leaving, the whole building seemed to be illuminated with God's Presence. Jesus taken what faith the blind man had, or what faith the woman had that was deaf, and started with that, building faith. See what I mean? He takes something to do something with. Now, in order for Him to get something, someone had to surrender something. That was the little boy: he had to surrender his lunch. Now, to the little lad, the lunch in the little boy's hand wasn't very much; he could only partially feed himself, perhaps. But once placed in the hands of Jesus, it fed five thousand.

L-10 Now, maybe your faith is not very much, but if you, what little faith you got, if you'll put it in His hands, it might cause a revival to break out in all Chicago here. See? You've got to have something to do something with. And what you've got in your hand, in your hand it's not much. But in God's hand, it's wonderful what He can do with such little. One time an old sheepherder by the name of Moses, he was herding sheep one day, packing in his hand an old dry stick, and God spoke to him by the burning bush. And Moses turned away to see. And God got an audience with him and told him He was going to send him down in Egypt to take over Egypt, bring his people out. Now, what a strange thing for God to take a man at eighty years old, backslidden, running from God, and at eighty years old, to send down into Egypt to overcome a big nation like that. It would be like sending one man into Russia now to take over. Egypt was the best fortified nation in the world. Their great units of chariots, and spearmen, and horsemen, and bowmen, and slingmen, it was--had the whole world shaking at its feet. And yet, God goes to this old man with long white beard and hair, and said, "Go down, Moses, and take over." How ridiculous that would sound to reasons. You cannot reason God. You can't reason out God. God's not to be reasoned; He's to be obeyed. What God says do, don't reason with Him, just do it. Reason's to be nonsense in that state. Moses said, "What can I do about going?" Give him a sign. 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min And he had a... He said, "What is that in your hand?"

L-11 Now, Moses had less than the boy. The boy had some food; Moses had a dry stick in his hand. In Moses' hand it was nothing else but a stick that he'd picked up, perhaps, on the desert. But once, when that hand of faith taken a hold of that stick, it become God's judgment rod to the world. That dry stick became the judgment rod. Remember, Moses stretched that rod. He stretched the rod over the sea; he stretched it in the air. It was God's judgment rod. Those Egyptians could've ever get that rod from Moses, they'd had had the Israelites whipped. And that's what takes today, as the rod was in Moses' hand, so is the Name of Jesus Christ in the Church hand. If the Church will hold that Name of Jesus, esteem It and honor It, and quit using It in slang, and so forth, and use It in power and reverence, It'll conquer every enemy that God's got on earth. "In My Name they shall cast out devils; in My Name they shall lay hands on the sick," all these things in His Name.

L-12 It sounds ridiculous to the world, but could you imagine, how ridiculous that scene sound, before we leave it. There was Moses, an old man eighty years old, going down into Egypt, could you imagine, with this old stick in his hand, his wife with two children, one on each hip, setting astraddle of a mule. Here he goes, his head back, smiling, just a rejoicing. Somebody said, "Moses, where you going?" "I'm going down to Egypt to take over." A one man invasion, going to Egypt. Could you imagine such a thing as that? The world would look and said, "Ridiculous." But the great thing about it, he did it. Why? God said so. No matter how ridiculous it seems and how little, that stick in Moses' hand of faith, with the Word of God behind it, was more than all the armies Pharaoh could produce. Amen.

L-13 So was that little fishes that morning. He gave them to Jesus. And He taken this bread and broke the bread and begin to pass it out, and they'd break a piece of fish and pass it out. Want to ask you something, audience, what kind of a atom did He let loose then? Not only fish, we know that He was the Creator. Christ is the Creator. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He didn't only break the wheat, but He broke the wheat already cooked and baked. He not only broke the fish, the flesh, but He broke the flesh already cooked and made ready. What atom did He turn loose then, scientist? What accumulated this fish, every time He break off a piece they'd be some more laying there, already cooked and baked? What did He do with the bread when He broke it off and it was already brown, right behind it, out of the oven? Just hand it right out, like that. That's our God. He's the same Lord Jesus tonight that He was then. But the fish in the little boys hand wasn't much, but in Jesus' hand He fed the five thousand. Then I noticed, He sent His disciples; He said, "Now, I must go away, so you go ahead and make a ship ready and go over, 'cause we're going to cross the sea."

L-14 And they went out and got the ship ready. But they couldn't wait on Jesus. They went on anyhow. He said, "I'll go send the multitude away and I'll join you." But they went off without Him. They had confidence in their boat. They were probably all fishermen and boatmen, so they knew their boat's all right. So they went away without Jesus, trusting their boats. And that's what the Church has done today. We've went away with our church, believing it's all right because we got great organizations, great buildings, and we've left Jesus behind. We left Christ out of the Church. Some of us has went off with our pastor and left Jesus. Some of them has went off with the denomination and left Jesus. Some of them went off with the pipe organ and left Jesus. Some of them went off with the building and left Jesus. But leaving Jesus behind, trouble is certain to come.

L-15 They had confidence in their boat. Not long ago when we established this nation, we were a wonderful people. When this nation was established on Plymouth Rock, men got on their faces and they prayed and thanked God for a nation of freedom of religion, that they could worship God. We were young; we were in our infancy. Then after that, they declared a Thanksgiving Day, where God blessed their grounds; they come in and offered thanks. We were young then; the nation was young. We were a great people when we were young, crawling, while we were in the cradle. But I'm afraid, after we've got big, we've went off without Jesus. We've opened up the bar rooms. We 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min couldn't walk the straight narrow path. We make fun of the preacher, spit on his feet if we could. A Holy Spirit falls in our meetings, we know too much about it now. We know we got better churches; we got better buildings; we got better educated ministers. We got better speakers. When we were young, God could deal with us. But when we get old, we know more about it than He does. And I'm afraid that our nation is moving on in its own self, leaving God out. We're sure to hit troubles.

L-16 The Pentecostal people, when you were young, out here in these missions around... When Dr. Bosworth here, Brother Bosworth, and many of the others, were little boys, preachers out here, you had little missions; you were made fun of, called holy-rollers. You were young; you had nothing. God was with you. You wasn't ashamed of the Gospel. You'd kneel in the street and pray with anybody wanted to be prayed for. You come to the altar, call the people up around the altar and stayed there until they were filled with the Holy Ghost, tears running down their cheeks. You went out, you lived godly. But I'm afraid we've left Jesus behind. We've got bigger churches now. We got better things. We got big fine robed choirs; we got pipe organs; we got big fine buildings, and we've went off without Jesus. Don't you believe that? When you were young you believed in Divine healing, you believed in the working of miracles. You believed in all the supernatural gifts. But after we got big, we learned more about it. We went off without Jesus, just like they did. And trouble come in. I don't see how God would have mercy on us. But He has.

L-17 When Jesus come and looked at the shore, and His boat was gone, He never just turned around and left them. But He climbed up the mountain, looking to see where they were. And He looked a way out in the sea, and there they was, trying to go in their own strength, trying to go in their own power, trying to go up on their own, leaving Him out. And they were in trouble. That's where He look and see the--the church of America not long ago, when we were all tossed about with everything, and the churches being formal and denying the power and everything. Just as He did then, so has He done now. He sent us a revival. He give the Pentecostal church a revival. He gave the world a revival, a bringing back again, a blessing. He climbed up the mountain, looked out. And I'm so thankful tonight that the Lord Jesus Christ climbed the ramparts of glory, far and above all the archangels, all principalities, and setting at the right hand of the Majesty of God tonight, watching this thing as she's tossing about. He seen while this America was established on freedom of religion. He seen the churches get formal and get away, but He didn't forget us.

L-18 Right in the middle of the great night when all hopes was gone, that them little disciples would ever be saved, they realized that they'd gone off without Jesus. What did they do? All in there, no doubt, in distress, they prayed, wanting the Lord to come to them. They raised up and looked around, and here He come walking on the water. And the tragedy of it... Here it is, Chicago. Here it is, world. The tragedy of it, they didn't recognize Him. They were afraid of Him. They thought He was a spirit or spook or something. They were scared of Him. And now, you cried. The sensible thing, the reasonable thing, when you get sick is go to the doctor. That's right. When your doctor fails, then you say, "I've got to go somewhere else." When you come to the meeting and you see Jesus Christ performing these signs, you get scared of it. You say, "It's spiritualism; it's the devil; it's something like that."

L-19 The only help those disciples had, they was afraid of it. And tonight the only salvation we got for both nation, church, and individual, and its healing, is Jesus Christ. And people are afraid of Him when He comes into the Church. They're afraid. They go away; they set in the church with curious looks on their face. "I don't know what to think about that. I'm just a scared of it. I don't know; that might be psychology. That might be mental telepathy. That might be the devil. He might be a soothsayer. He might be a astrologer. He might be a witch. He might be a fortune-teller." Don't be scared. It's the Lord Jesus Christ, Who saves the sick and the afflicted. It's the only hope of salvation in this day when our nations and worlds are in a turmoil. When our nations are breaking everywhere, and when our churches are formal and indifferent, when the powers of God has failed to be preached in the pulpit, Jesus comes walking down on this troubled water. Don't be afraid of Him; accept Him. For He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, saying, "The things that I did shall you also." Don't be afraid.

L-20 Peter finally ventured enough faith to say, "Lord, You told us not long ago, 'The things that You did, we'd do also.' 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min Now, if that be You, Lord, bid me come to You on the water." He said, "Come on. The things that I do, you can do also." And Peter went walking. Notice, Jesus in His last words here on earth, some of them, He said, "A little while, and the world seeth Me no more; yet you shall see Me: for I will be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." Another statement He said, "The things that I do shall you do also; even greater for I go to My Father." And Jesus Christ can send that same ministry by man, ministered by Angels, and the world, America in whole, has looked upon it and criticized it. That's right. What's left then, but sink in the sea, hopeless. That's all. Don't be afraid, friends.

L-21 Tonight... Here Sunday night we didn't have standing room. They were packed around, because the Lord Jesus came down and done things. Some of my friends standing outside, the people went out said, "Why, he's just a soothsayer. He's just astrologist. He's just this. It's a devil." Spiritually ignorant, and don't know the power of the resurrection of God, don't realize it. You've only heard one side of the Gospel, my friend. You don't realize that that's the very same things that Jesus did Himself and said that we'd do the same things. It's not nothing out of the catalog; it's out of God's Bible. And Jesus done those same things, witnesses Himself; He said, "I can do nothing except My Father shows Me. And what I see, the Father shows Me."

L-22 He said to the woman at the well after talking to her, He revealed what her trouble was. When Philip come and found Nathanael, and Nathanael come to be a critic. And when he stood up before the Master, Jesus looked at him and said, "Why, you're a good man, honest man. Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile." He said, "When did You know me?" He said, "Why, before Philip called you. You was under a tree." He said, "I saw you." Now, what if he'd said, "Say, I believe You really are Beelzebub." Then see where he'd been cast. What if he said, "I believe that's just mental telepathy." See what would have happened. But what did the... What did this fine man do? He said, "Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel." Jesus said, "You believe because I knew that you was under that tree?" Said, "You'll see greater things than this."

L-23 If you want to believe tonight, "Be of a good cheer; it is I," He said, "be not afraid." Nothing's going to happen but good, if you'll just believe Him. If you're in trouble, set still in the boat, and when you see Jesus, say, "Yes, Lord Jesus, I believe it's You and I now accept You as my Healer or my Saviour," and everything will be all right. Shall we pray? Father, we thank Thee in the Name of Jesus, Thy Son, for all of His goodness and mercy. And now may He come tonight and confirm what has been said: that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. May His loving arms stretch out.

L-24 And we pray as those who had been persecuted one time for healing the sick. And they gathered together (in the Book of the Acts, the 4th chapter), and prayed, and said, "Lord, why did the heathens rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?" Said, "Stretch forth the hand of Thy holy Child Jesus to heal." Said, "Give Thy servants all boldness to speak this Word." And the building was shaken where they were assembled together. Lord Jesus, consider tonight, I pray Thee, Lord, in our meeting here, that the hand of Thy holy Child Jesus may be stretched out in confirmation of the Word, to bring to pass the things that He said. And grant, that this night, that the Angel of the Lord will encamp about this place, and will come to every heart, and make ready the in-filling of the Holy Spirit and Divine faith, that all sick and afflicted might be healed tonight, and sinners be saved for Your glory.

L-25 Now, Lord, I submit myself unto Thee, as Thy servant, and pray that You will use Thy servant tonight in the manner that You would have me to be used. I submit this audience to You. And ask that You'll get glory out of this audience tonight. That You'll heal Your sick children and forgive Your enemies' sins. In Jesus Christ's Name, Thy Son, we ask it for God's glory. Amen. All right. the Lord bless you all. Now, I am here contending, that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I'm sure that you believe that with me, do you? I believe that what He was yesterday, He is today. He was God yesterday; He's God today. He was a Healer yesterday; He's the Healer today. He was the Saviour yesterday; He's the 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min Saviour today. He--He performed miracles by vision and did nothing except the Father showed Him. Is that right? He said the... "A little while, and the world seeth Me no more; yet you will, for I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." I believe that. And if Jesus is in us, then we submit ourselves and get our human side out, Jesus Christ uses our bodies for His glory. Do you believe that? May He grant it, is my prayer.

L-26 All right, will someone, if they will, go to the organ now. And then we're going to call for the prayer line. We do not call for too many at a time. It gets weak and tired. (Thank you, brother.) I get... Just a moment. While the organ's playing, I want to... I got two or three letters today (I do in every meeting, pretty near every night.), criticizing me for getting weak. I can't help that. I wished I could, but I can't. But just let me ask you something, just a moment. If you're here, I want... That don't make me feel bad at you. I love you, you just want to... you're... just want to understand. You have a right to ask that. Jesus was Jehovah God inveiled in flesh. And a woman's faith out in the audience touched Him, just one woman. And the reason He knew it, virtue had went out of Him. What is virtue? It's strength. It weakened Him. Just one woman's faith touching Him, it weakened Him.

L-27 How about the prophet Daniel, who saw one vision and was troubled at his head for many days? Do you understand now? See? You can't help it. We're just human. I'm just a sinner saved by grace. And the Lord Jesus Christ comes down and gives His Holy Spirit. You should feel this once, and then you'd understand. When you break plumb out of your own being, knowing not where you are into another dimension, and see things that was and things that will be... And check them and see if they're right. God said that thing would take place in the last days and people would laugh at it. We got it. See? That's right. So here we are. We're in the last days. That's one of the great signs of the last day. Certainly, it makes me weak. I can't help it. Wished I could stand longer. I do good to stand after two or three people passes...?... then I'm--I'm just about finished. Sometimes I go out and they have to lead me. That's right. Brother Moore standing here, Brother Bosworth he's ministered with me days after days, all over the world, practically, and there has been many times that Brother Moore has got in the car and rode me around, him and Brother Brown, singing songs, and me laying in the back seat crying, trying to get to myself (That's right.), crying.

L-28 I've went home. My wife is setting present somewhere in this building, where when I go in at night time, and hold my pillow like that, and cry all night long almost, because of it. Yes, sir. [A message in tongues is given in the audience--Ed.] Now, the Lord be blessed. Now, if you notice, Christian friend (See?), in the--that those things make you weak. You can't help it. It's another--it's another world; it's another dimension. Just imagine yourself going forty years back somewhere, seeing something that taken place years before you was born (See?), and then come down. Here stands the patient, you--you wonder, "Well, now," you--you--you know you said something, but you don't know what you said.

L-29 And then after while, you see something that'll be years yet to come, and say what's going to take place with this person at a certain time. And then after while, after two or three of them, you're really wondering whether you're here or there. See? And you don't understand it. So please, just... If you don't... you may... you don't... I don't understand it myself. So let's just believe it anyhow. I don't understand how God had mercy on me and saved me, but He did it. So I'm thankful for it. All right. Now, we'll call up about fifteen of the prayer, of the people with prayer cards. Let's call from the first fifteen. Who has prayer card 1, hold up your hand, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on up. Prayer card number 1, number 2, number 3, on up to about 15... All right. From 1 to 15, wasn't it? 1 to 15. Prayer card 1 to 15 first. (No. Thank you, brother. The Lord bless you tonight in that revelation there. What say? What letter... What'd you give out?) S, S-1 to 15, I didn't think about being other prayer card. S-1 to 15, them was give out just awhile ago. We been using, the last three nights the same group we give out the first night. But now we give out some new ones tonight and it's in S. S-1 to 15, please. Yes, S-1 to 15.

L-30 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... all of your hearts... Who wrote this song? Does anyone know? [A man says, "Paul 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min Rader."--Ed.] Paul Rader is right, perhaps wrote right here. Was it at Fort Wayne, do you know, Brother Bosworth? If Paul Rader wrote that song right here in, here, right here in Chicago... Right here's where that song was born then: in Chicago. It's been my theme song. It's been sang in many different languages in different parts of the world. It's called me to the platform for the past ten years, I guess. Only believe; all things are possible, if you can only believe. Now, have faith; have faith in God and believe with all your heart while we sing slowly now, altogether. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. I wonder if the audience would do this for me. Let's just close our eyes now, and raise up our hands, and say, "Now, I believe." Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe; Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe.

L-31 I see my brother setting there weeping when he heard that song. Many times it's called us, hasn't it, Brother Bosworth, many times? As time is going on, Brother Bosworth, the clock ticking on to eternity, I wonder if Paul Rader tonight, yonder in glory... How many ever heard his last words when he was dying? He always had a sense of humor. They was singing for him, so I'm told, that he said, "Raise them curtains and sing me some good snappy Gospel songs." Said, "Who's dying, me or you?" So they raised the curtains and begin to sing the Gospel songs; he said, "That sounds better." He called his brother Luke in; he said, "Luke, we been a long ways together. But think of it, in five minutes from now I'll be standing in the Presence of Jesus Christ clothed in His righteousness." Went to meet God...

L-32 Someday we'll go over and see him, Brother Bosworth...?... God bless you, brother. You want to stand the brothers and sisters...?... Come back here; stand over here...?... Just like for him to stand here, he's got good faith; he believes me, and I--I love that. You feel that wall around you, just wonderful. Pray with me, Brother Bosworth. And all the audience pray with me, and all you brethren here, pray with me everywhere, that we can--we can be--be in one accord. Now, may the Holy Spirit come. Now, to the visitors that's with us, I ask you all to remain in your seat just for the next few moments for the service. God of heaven knows that this is not done for a stage show; it's for His glory. I do not claim to be able to perform every miracle that comes to me; I can perform no miracle. God does it all; I'm a man.

L-33 Last night in bringing the sight to the blind man, usually I'd have prayed for him, but I felt that it would catch the audience. And I asked God to do it, and He did it. And I have never seen a person pass yet, of any time in the ministry, or I don't believe my brethren has ever seen, any person but what was helped right here at the platform when they pass by, every time of the thousands that's passed. I see it happen. I've seen blind standing on the platform, not on this platform, but plat... and could read that Bible, come back two days later and couldn't see their hand before them. They got among unbelievers. When the unclean spirit's gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, returns back with seven other devils worse than he was. If the good man of the house isn't standing there to protect that man, then he will come in and by power overcome him. But the good man of your house is faith to say, "God has said so." Now, be reverent and pray with all your heart and be in one accord. I'm waiting for His Presence to anoint me. Only thing this is, friend, is a Divine gift. Comes just as natural as it would be for you if you sing. Like one of these wonderful singers here, for them to sing, they're just... It's just their voice; they were gifted that. But they had to get into the pitch of it before they can do it. The Holy Spirit has to anoint. I have to submit myself in a way, that the anointing takes me over, and then the visions come.

L-34 How many knows that Jesus Christ, when He was here on earth, said, "He could do nothing of Himself, just what 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min Father showed Him."? Is that right? He did nothing at all unless He seen a vision first. Is that right? That's His Own Words: Saint John 5:19. Did He say, "You shall do the same thing." Then it's Jesus the same yesterday, today, and forever. May He come tonight and bless us is my prayer. Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I take this congregation in the control of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

L-35 Bring the lady. How do you do, sister? Now, to the audience, to this lady, I suppose we are strangers; we have never met on earth before. But God knows both of us, does He not? Do you know anyone in that audience? You know people in that audience? All right. That you're a witness then of this, what is going on. Now, I never seen the woman. I ne... First time I ever met her in life. She's just standing there, a woman, is all I know about her; she's standing there. God knows that's the truth. Well now, God knows what she's here for. I don't. I couldn't tell you. She may have cancer; she may have tumor. I don't know what she's got. I don't even know. She may be a sinner; she may be a Christian. I don't know. She may be an alcoholic; she may be a dope addict. I--I don't know. She may be a critic. I don't know. But God does know. Then God can, if He will, reveal to me just what her trouble is. Now, how did Jesus do that when He met a woman like that? He begin to talk to her; He said, "Bring Me a drink." And she said, "Why, it's not customary for You Jews to ask we Samaritans such; You have no dealing." He said, "But if you knew who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink."

L-36 She said, "Well, the well's deep, and You have nothing to draw with." On went the conversation till Jesus found just what her trouble was. What do you think happened there? Now remember, His Words is this, "Verily, verily (that's 'absolutely, absolutely,') I say unto you, I can do nothing till the Father shows Me." Why did He send those disciples away and then go up the mountain, tonight in the text? He... Father had showed Him, He was going to walk on the water, out where they was at. Certainly. The Father had showed Him this woman. Why, He went the wrong way. He went up way around Samaria instead of going down to Jericho, right down the hill, right down the road. He went around to Samaria. 'Cause the Father had told Him, "There's going to be a woman come out there." Then He had to find out what was wrong with the woman. So Him being anointed as He was, He talked to her till He caught her spirit. And when He caught her spirit, He seen where her trouble was. He said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I have none." Said, "You've said well, for you got five."

L-37 She said, "I perceive that You're a prophet. We know that Messiah's coming will do that. We know the Messiah will do that when He comes; He will tell us all things." He said, "I'm He that speaketh." Now, if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, what would He do if this woman come here? He'd talk to her a minute, don't you think so, and see what the Father would say. Now, I shall do the same thing, ask her... If the Messiah, Christ, the Holy Spirit will come and anoint me, He will let me know what's wrong with her, what she's here for. May He grant it for His glory, and that you might believe on Him, the resurrected Son of God, is my prayer. Now, just to talk to you a moment, sister... Always before... You're conscious that the anointing of the Holy Spirit is here. Now, this woman, I've never seen her, but I--I turn my head from her, and I got away, so that--to keep from looking at her. Then I come back this way; I know that she knows that there's something going on. I guess they had that picture here awhile ago, of the Angel of the Lord, that's exactly what you--you're feeling now.

L-38 Now, to your friends out there that know you, know who you are, and perhaps know why you're up here, I don't know, but... knows what's wrong with you... Well, if you really feel a strange, not a strange, a glorious, quiet, humble, feeling around you, anointing. If that's right raise up your hand so people can see it. That's right. Last night the Angel of the Lord was seen by several people standing here at the platform. Others didn't, not all of them seen the star, the Morning Star that led the wise men to Christ, but those who were looking, to those who it was given to. And the lady is conscious, so will every person that comes here be conscious of It. They'll be conscious that something's going on. 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min Brother Bosworth, a few moments ago when that came from the right hand side here and touched me, standing near, that brother believes me so much till it struck him back over there. He was there crying.

L-39 Now, and carrying this conversation with you for to find out from God what would be your trouble, what you're here for, I just talk to you a few moments just to catch the channel of your human spirit. I'm a man; you're a woman. This is our first time meeting in life. But God knows both of us, doesn't He? You are a nervous person, but you're not standing here for that. You're standing here, and you got that handkerchief in your hand, and that's to go to a sick friend. That's right. That sick friend has a--a cancer. And that friend... That cancer is located on the breast. I see a doctor's done something; he's took one breast off; he's removed one breast. And you brought the handkerchief that I'd pray over it, and you're to send it to your friend. They live in Illinois here. Are those things right? If it is, would you...?... give me your handkerchief.

L-40 Now, Father God, may the power of the Lord Jesus Christ that's standing here now, and while this anointing is moving, I lay my hands upon her friend, and ask that the power of Jesus Christ go with this handkerchief; and may the enemy, the devil, move from the woman and may she live. In Jesus Christ's Name I send this token. Amen. God bless you, sister. Tell her to write me and give the testimony from here. All right, be reverent; have faith. Do you believe? Lady, I seen you climb up to the prayer line and go set down again with that baby. You don't have a prayer card, do you? You don't have a... The lady setting there with that baby crying, I see the little baby crying. You don't have the prayer card? All right. That's all right.

L-41 The father behind there, do you believe that the--that the baby will get well? Do you believe too, mother, that the baby will get well if I'll ask God? Now, I want you both to lay your hands on the baby. The trouble is in the head, and you all come a long ways from here, haven't you? You come from the state of Kentucky, didn't you? Come, isn't that right? All right. The Lord Jesus of Nazareth, may that demon leave that child, come out of it in the Name of Jesus Christ. When no other hand like that mother's could lay now except God. And I ask that the baby gets well in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, now. May you go, and the baby live and be normal again. God bless you. Don't doubt, sister. I don't know you, never seen you, but God knows all about you, isn't that right? Don't fear now, He Who knows all things... The evil's gone from the baby; just keep believing. And the baby, you'll notice such a difference in it the next twenty-four hours, it'll be a different child. You just believe that now and go on. Amen.

L-42 All right, every one reverent. Have... Just have faith. Just a minute. Oh, bow your head. This is a deaf spirit moving against me now. It's on this man standing here. I thought it was in the audience. Bow your head now, till we can get hearing to him and then we'll talk to him. Every one be reverent and bow your head. Lord, Creator of heavens and earth, Author of Everlasting Life, Giver of every good gift, send Thy blessing upon this our brother who stands here waiting tonight to be delivered from evil. O Almighty One, make Thy servant tonight, to be obedient to Thy Word. And I pray that You'll heal him. Take the evil from him.

L-43 And Satan, in the Name of Jesus Christ I adjure thee to leave the man; come out of him. Now, just keep your heads bowed a minute. Can you hear me, brother? Can you hear me...?... You may raise your head. Can you hear me? Say, "Yes," real loud. Hear me now? Now, you also besides that, something that you cannot see, you've got tumor. And that tumor's located in the jaw. Is that right? You believe me to be His prophet? And not only that, but you come from Zion City, Illinois, didn't you? Go home now; you're well. Jesus Christ makes you well. Amen. Just a little skeptic at first, he didn't understand. You believe with all your heart? The only thing, he just didn't understand at first, that he might know God knows all things. You see? All right. All right, bring the patient. Be reverent now. Don't doubt; just believe with all your heart.

L-44 How do you do? I suppose that you and I are strangers to each other? We are to each other. We do not know one another. This is our first time meeting in life, a very typical picture of Jesus and the--and the Samaritan woman. It was two different races. One was a Jew, and the other one was a Samaritan. Now, this is white and colored together. In 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min them days it was a little different, like a little friction has been in the days past, with the white and colored. But Jesus let them know that God was the Father of all nations. Is that right? He doesn't care whether we're yellow people, or white people, or black people, or brown people. All the wall of partition's broke down; Jesus Christ died for every human being in the world. You believe that? I do with all of my heart.

L-45 And we've just returned from Africa down there where we ministered, seen thirty thousand of your people converted in one altar call. And they really are humble and love the Lord. Our hearts burn to get back to them again. Us being strangers, knowing not one another... But you're not from this city; you have come from a city that's a--a--a country that's rolling. It's a great wheat country. It's Oklahoma. You come from Oklahoma. And you're here on a visit. You're here to see a loved one; that loved one is a sister. And you're up here to be prayed for for diabetes. And the diabetes has went to your body. And in your right foot, it's eat a hole through it. Is that right? Now, I'll send you back to Oklahoma to be well.

L-46 Almighty God, in the Name of Thy Son Jesus Christ, I condemn this blood eating demon. And may the Calvary's cross and the Blood transfusion, and may this diabetes sugar turn back normal to good rich blood; through Jesus Christ's Name, and through His Blood. Amen. Go, doubting nothing and rejoicing. All right. Praise be to God. The woman just now coming to; she didn't realize what had happened till just now. What it is. She was healed. See? When she was standing under the anointing of that Spirit, she didn't understand what It was; she just now come to herself and to know what It was. What did you think about that out there, sir, the little man setting out there with asthma? You believe? I see you reach for over there something. You believe with all your heart that God's going to heal you of that asthmatic? You also have a hay fever, don't you? I see you holding your nose all the time. Isn't that right? If that's right, raise up your hand there. All right, stand up on your feet. Accept your healing now?

L-47 Almighty God, in the Name of Jesus Christ, let the man be made well for Your glory. Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to ask you something, sir, when that woman come down the step a rejoicing like that, it made you feel real good, didn't it? It made you like that you was going to be healed yourself. That's when God answered your prayer. God bless you now. Have faith in God. Don't doubt. Believe; all things are possible.

L-48 All right, this is the lady. You're near the Kingdom, lady, setting there looking at me. That Light stands right over you, which is the Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? You have heart trouble, don't you? The lady next to you has heart trouble. Lay your hands on one another. Lord, in the Name of Jesus Christ, while You're over them women, may the heart trouble leave them and they go and be made well, through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. The blessings of God upon you. Just have faith. You have spinal trouble, don't you, sir, setting there? Yes. You don't have... You have a prayer card? You don't have a prayer card, do you? You don't have your prayer card, I say. No prayer card. Then stand up on your feet just a minute. Raise your... A man in a green shirt, is the one It's over just now, sonny, just a moment. I want to see what happens to him just a minute.

L-49 All right, you believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God? You believe me to be His prophet? His servant? You believe that? Your spinal trouble's left you, sir. Move yourself up-and-down like this. I told you; it's gone; you're free now. Go home; you're well; your faith has healed you. Amen. God bless you. Just believe with all your heart. This the patient? Excuse me. This is three or four nights in a meeting; it's I'm getting worn a whole lot now, I get so weak. You're suffering with something wrong in your chest; that's a tumor. You also are nervous, female trouble. You're from out of town. You're from Cleveland, Tennessee. Is that right? Now, go home believing the Lord Jesus Christ to be made well. I condemn the devil that torments my sister and ask him to leave her, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Now, go rejoicing, sister, and be made whole. Thank you. Just have faith out there. I--I'm sorry. To some that's wrote your letters, I'm getting weak, I--I can't help that. 54-0720E, It Is I, Be Not Afraid, Lane Tech High School, Chicago, IL, 64 min I... It's something that I have no control of. I'll explain it perhaps later.

L-50 That lady that just left, is that the lady that was healed just now, that's just setting right down over there? Are you the lady that was healed? Oh, I see. Right there? Yes. Oh, lay your hand over on that next lady to you there; she has high blood pressure, she's wanting to get rid of that high blood pressure. Isn't that right, lady? All right, lay your hand over on her, sister, you were just healed. Father, in Jesus Christ's Name, may that blood pressure drop just now for Your glory. Amen. Do you accept it, sister? With all your heart? I see. God bless you, sister.

L-51 Setting right behind you is another colored lady, setting back there, colored person. You got a stomach trouble, haven't you lady, setting out there with the little hood? And you had a stroke. You're healed. You've lost a lot of weight; I see you where you was a heavy person. You've lost several pounds of weight, haven't you? You're stroke's all gone; raise your hands up. Raise your... Bounce your feet up-and-down. Lady, you're healed; give God praise. You're well now. God's peace be with you. Hallelujah. You may think that I'm crazy, but I'm in God's provided way. So is this meeting in God's provided way. Have faith in God. Believe with all your heart and you shall be healed, each one of you.

L-52 All right, bring your patient. You believe that heart trouble left you while you was setting right there in the chair? It did. Now, just go and rejoice; that's the way to have faith and be made well. Come, lady. Do you believe that stomach trouble left you while you were setting there? Go, eat your supper then. In the Name of Jesus Christ be made well. Have faith. You believe the same thing happened to you? All right, then just go and be made well, through Jesus Christ's Name. Have faith now; believe with all your heart. Sir, do you believe you're healed, setting there in the chair? You do, come here, let me lay hands on you. That's what you wanted me to do. In the Name of Jesus Christ, be made well. Amen. God bless you, brother.

L-53 Let's say, "Praise the Lord." [The congregation says, "Praise the Lord."--Ed.] Oh, my, something went over that building then, just then, like a Light. You'll find out after I'm gone from here. Tomorrow night they're be people testifying of healing that don't realize it right now. Something's happening. All right. That female trouble's gone from you; just go rejoicing and being happy, in Jesus' Name. Have faith. Now, you're having faith rightly. Heart trouble's nothing; God can heal all things, can't He? It's gone from you, brother. Go, rejoicing and may... Let's say, "Praise be to God." [Congregation says, "Praise be to God."--Ed.]

L-54 You believe Jesus Christ healed you now as you come by? In the Name of the Lord Jesus, may she be made completely whole. Amen. Go, thanking God and rejoicing. Oh, my. (Where's that water go?) What is it to our heavenly Father to heal arthritis? Why, He can do it easy, can't He? You believe me to be His servant? Will you obey me as His servant? Raise up your hand. Raise up your feet like this, stomp them. All your arthritis is gone now. Go on the platform rejoicing. I anoint that handkerchief, 'cause you want it for a friend. In Jesus Christ's Name, may it be so. Amen. Now, go rejoicing and happy. Praise be to God.

L-55 Brother, God can heal that diabetes as easy He will heal a toothache, can't He? You believe He does it? You shall have what you ask for then. Don't doubt, in Jesus Christ's Name. The worst disease in the world is heart trouble. But God can heal it; don't you believe it? Then you shall have it, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Come, sister. Do you believe? You believe me to be His servant? With all your heart? I see between you and I is a table. You're moving back from it. You got stomach trouble. Go, eat your supper now. You're healed.
