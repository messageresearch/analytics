--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening, friends. Shall we bow our heads and speak to the King of Kings. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] service... Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for the grand privilege that we have of coming together in meeting, worshipping Thee in Spirit and truth. We thank Thee for the Lord Jesus, for His great redeeming love to us, that was so sovereignly given. And when we were sinners away from God, alienated, without hope, without God, and Christ died, the Lovely for the unlovely, to redeem us back to the Father, and now, brought us so close that we're recognized as sons and daughters of God. But it does not yet appear what we shall be in the final end, but we know that we'll have a body like His own glorious body, for we shall see Him as He is. Then, Lord, there'll be no more prayer for the sick. It'll all be over then. So help us tonight, to worship Him [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]... all that is within us and bless the Lord. For we ask it in the Name of Jesus, God's beloved Son. Amen.

L-2 Good evening, friends. And I am so happy to be with you again this evening to worship our dear blessed Saviour. If Dr. Lee Vayle, pastor of the First Baptist Church, in Ohio, if he will see my boy, Billy Paul, behind the stage right away, if--if you will, Dr. Vayle. Now, we have one more night after tonight in this lovely gathering here in the great Cadle Tabernacle. And we're so happy to be here; and for the opened door to meet together, worship the Lord. And the Lord has been blessing us tremendously, I feel. And this great convention that has come to Indianapolis, and I am so happy that they invited me to have a part of this convention: to speak to you, the purchase of the Blood of the Lord Jesus. I've often wondered what I would do if I have two drops of the literal Blood of Christ, that I could hold in my hand in a charger. How I'd walk with it so carefully that I would not spill it. But I think tonight, I have in His sight, greater than two drops of the literal Blood. I have the purchase of His Blood before me. So I'm very careful of what I say to the purchase of His Blood.

L-3 So it was... It's our intention to try to help further the cause of Christ and make people--the world, as Mr. Cadle used to say it here at the tabernacle, "A better place to do--easier to do right and harder to do wrong," something of that order. And many of you has heard the--the brother say that. And we're thinking, tonight that he is--a place where they'll never be any more wrong: in glory. The Bible said, "They rest from their labors, but their works do follow them." And that is right. The Lord bless the--this Word. Mr. Ford, that I just had the privilege of meeting, just a few moments ago, a very fine Christian gentleman... So glad that Indianapolis has a place like this.

L-4 So now, tonight we are back over in the blessed old Bible; that's just about all I know about it. And my ABC's... How many know what the ABC's of the Bible is? Always Believe Christ. That's the--that's the ABC's of the Bible. So last evening we was trying to speak on Abraham. And I got part of the way through to my text, and we had to hurry. So I thought, maybe, tonight I'd finish it up and give us a chance to dismiss a little earlier. And maybe tomorrow night, being the great press... Tomorrow night is closing of this convention, and usually on that night, there's more takes place than any other night; because it's the--the pressure, the anticipation. And many times, as far as the healing that they press hard, and they know they've got to have faith right now or not have it at all; so they press right up. And usually our Lord does great things for us. So we're expecting tomorrow night... And will you pray with me that there will not be one sick or feeble person left among us? Now, will you hold onto God for that for me tomorrow night? And I know that He was wounded for our transgressions, and with His stripes we were healed.

L-5 Someone not long ago was discussing it with me, and a very fine scholar. And he could speak words that I know nothing about. And so he said, "Brother Branham, I believe you're sincere," but said, "I am sure that you're wrong when you teach Divine healing, because you can't place Divine healing in the atonement." He said, "Do you preach Divine healing from the atonement?" 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min I said, "Every redemptive blessing is by the atonement." And He said, "Well, if--I'll prove to you that it isn't in the atonement..." I said, "Well, I--I would sure like to hear it." And He said, "You preach what Isaiah said about Christ, that bore our infirmities and so forth?" I said, "Yes, sir, that's..." He said, "If I'll prove to you that that was fulfilled, will you accept it?" I said, "If it's proved by the Bible, I--I will." And I knew he was just fresh from school, and I--I never went any farther than the seventh grade, so I--I know he was more than a match for me in--in wits like that. But I knowed Who I had believed (See?), the Lord Jesus. And I know that He's the Healer, 'cause He healed me. I was blind and now I see. So I--I know He's the Healer. And I seen Him heal tens of thousands of people, or seen people accept their healing. That's the way it is. It isn't... The Lord doesn't heal you now; He's already done it. Every redemptive blessing has already been finished at Calvary; you just look and live. That's the way it is.

L-6 It's not that anybody can heal you, or bring healing, or God bring any healing. It's your faith in His finished work. So he said, "It wasn't finished there at Calvary for healing." He said, "Now, in Matthew the 8th chapter," I believe it is. He said, "Mr. Branham," he said, "the Bible said that He healed the people that was brought to Him that it might fulfill which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He bore our infirmities and so forth." I said, "Do you apply it there, brother?" He said, "Yes." I said, "How could that be the atonement when it was a year and six months before the atonement was ever made?" He hadn't yet been glorified. The Blood had never been shed. So if that be the case, the atonement had more power before it was actually in force then it did after it was in force. So how could we do that?" I said, "That was about a year and six months before He was crucified." The Blood had never been shed yet. So how could that apply to the atonement? And so then he went to using great big words. And I said, "Kind, sir, I don't have the gift of interpretation." I said, "I--I--I can't understand what you're talking about. Just plain King James, I understand it better." So I said, "Well, let's see..." He just kept talking. I said, "Well, now brother, look, I'm going to ask you something. Will you admit that Divine healing is in the Word? 'Cause Mark 11:24 said, 'Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe.'" See? Oh, he said, "Yes." Said. Now, he said the wrong thing there. He said, "This is in the Word, 'cause whatsoever..." I said, "Jesus said, 'Whatsoever things... And the things that I do, shall you also.' What about that?" And he said, "Well, you're trying to run off on Mark 16." I said, "No, sir, I--I'm trying to get you to Mark 11."

L-7 And He said... I said... He said, "Yes, it's in the Word," but said, "not in the atonement." Well, I said, "The Word's over the atonement." "Oh," he said, "It can't be." I said, "It is." And I said, "Look. There was a king one time that made all of his laws and rules. And he had--he made all the laws and the penalties. He was a just man. He was a truthful man. And one time there was a slave committed a crime. And at the judgment seat the king said, "I'm sorry, sir, but I have to take your life, because it's written right here in my laws that you have to die for this penalty. And I'm a--a man that's just. I can't go back on my word, and here is my law says that you must die. So I have to take your life." And the poor fellow started trembling. He said, "Well, what can I do for you before I take your life. He said, "Give me a glass of water." He took the glass of water; he couldn't hold it, the man knowed his head was going to be cut off. And he just shaking. He said, "Now, wait a minute." He said, "I'm not going to take your life till you drink the water." The slave throwed it on the ground...?... I said, "What's he going to do now?" Is his word above his law? He has to stay with his word if he's just. He said. "That was a slip up on the king." I said, "Then God put it in His Word not in the atonement, He'd had a slip up too?" Not our God. He don't have no slip ups. That's right; He doesn't. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min

L-8 A lady here some time ago sent her boy away to school to learn to be a minister. So she taken real sick, and she sent to the school, and said for the boy to stand by, for the doctor said she might die. It was... She had pneumonia in the worst stage. So the boy made ready to come home on a moment's call. And so he didn't hear no more. Said the next day his mother was all right, so he let it go. So when he come home on a vacation, he said to his mother; he said, "Mother," said, "what happened to you when you was so sick and you got well so quick." Said, "What doctor did you see?" She said, "Hallelujah. Jesus." Said, "Mother." She said, "You know, there's a... You know that little mission is around the corner?" Said, "Yes." Said, "Well, there was one of those ladies down there come up to see me, said she was led to come see me. And my doctor give me up." And said, "Down at our church, we pray for the sick, and anoint them with oil, and pray for the sick." And said, "Would you let our pastor, come pray for you?" She said, "Well, I'd be glad." And so he said... Went and got the pastor; he come up, and he read out of the Bible in Mark the 16th chapter, where if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover." And said, "The minister read that to me out of the Bible and laid hands on me, and I got well." Oh, he said, "Ridiculous, mother, ridiculous." Said, "That's just the uneducated people believe that." Said, "Now, in the seminary we learned that Mark the 16th chapter, from the 9th verse on, is not inspired." Huh, the woman said, "Hallelujah." "Why," he said, "Mother, the very audacity. Well," said, "you act like one of them down there." So she said, "Hallelujah." He said, "What's the matter with you?" She said, "I was just a thinking. If God could heal me with uninspired Word, what could He do with that really is inspired?" As Billy Sunday once said, "The argument is thinner than the broth made out of the shadow of the chicken that starved to death." So it's very thin against Divine healing, because just a little too late; God's already doing it. So that... The proof of the pudding is the eating thereof.

L-9 Well, over in this blessed old Bible, the old Textbook, we'll take the same subject tonight: of Abraham. And tomorrow night, remember; come early. I'm going to have the boys giving out their cards and things early, if we can, for a great prayer line tomorrow night, the Lord willing. Now, last night we left off where Abraham, I believe had went up, and God had taken him out of the picture, showing that His covenant was wholly...?... It was no strings tied to it. It was God by His sovereign grace had promised unconditionally that He would save Abraham and his seed. And we found out last night in the reading of the Word that we are Abraham's seed when we are dead in Christ, and are heirs of the same promise. That right? Abraham's seed. Every man that's born of the Spirit of God is Abraham's seed and are heirs according to the promise. Paul said, "We...'' The Jews--not Jews outwardly but Jews inwardly... Now, the promise was to the seed, not seeds of Abraham. Abraham had several sons, but only one through Sarah was the promise.

L-10 And now, Abraham believed God. How he got this great name of being the father of nations, he believed God and believed in hope. Against hope, he still believed in hope, knowing that God was able to perform what He had promised. Oh, my young brother setting there in a wheelchair, if you could only see that promise tonight, sonny boy. Calvary's before you. And if you can just move the shadows from your mind, look there something would anchor down in here, there would be nothing in the world ever move it. You'd be pushing that wheelchair out the building and around the Cable Tabernacle, and the place where you come from. And you that's dying with heart trouble: worst killer there is... Cancer, doctors can hardly do a thing about it... I heard on the radio the other day, that it couldn't be proved that one time an operation for cancer was ever successful. They 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min call it a fourth dimension disease. But God's got the cure. Medicine is remedies. God is the cure. "I'm the Lord that healeth all of thy diseases."

L-11 Now, if Abraham believed God because God said so, then we being Abraham's seed, we have the same type of faith Abraham had. 'Cause God called Abraham by election. How did he call you? By election. The only way you could be called is by election. "No man can come to Me except My Father calls him first." God does the electing; then you just follow. And then, if He called you... "And all that comes to Me I'll give them everlasting life, and will no wise cast him out, and raise him up in the last day." Those who He foreknew, He has called. Those who He has called, He justified. Those who He justified, He has glorified. That's God's Word. I love It, because I can put my confidence in It and believe It and know that It's the truth.

L-12 I just made a remark a few moments ago: In my travels around the world I find two classes of people: two churches, as to speak. There's only one church, but this is what I mean. I find the fundamental people, who positionally know what they are in Christ Jesus. But I say this with reverence, they don't have much faith in what they believe. Now. Then the next class is the Pentecostal. They got a lot of faith but don't know who they are. That's it. Now, it's just like a man's got money in the bank and he doesn't know how to write a check. The next man can write a check, but he hasn't got no money in the bank. If you could ever get them two together, you would have it. If I could get Pentecostal faith and fundamental doctrine, or get fundamental doctrine and Pentecostal faith, the millennium would start right away. There would be something wonderful. But the Pentecostal people, with respect and knowing that probably eighty percent of this crowd is Pentecostal... Lovely people, but you--you shout all your joy away. You shout all your faith away. If you'd take that and place it solemnly in what God said, and know that's what is making you happy, and know that what gives you redemption which you're happy about and you should be... If you'd use that faith yonder at Calvary and take God and say "It's You, Lord, and there isn't one speck of me that doubts it," things would take place.

L-13 There's an intellectual faith. We are a trinity, like God is in our soul, body, and spirit. Now the--science said a few years ago that when God said, "That as a man thinketh in his heart so is he," they said that God don't know what He was talking about. And when the Bible said, "Your--your body's full of light," the old scientist said, "Oh, isn't that crazy?" the infidel. But look, God proves that your body's full of light. The x-ray proves that. It's your own light meters in your body, not the light of the x-ray. It has no light. It's your light meters that takes the--make the x-ray. So your body is full of light. And then every little cell there's a light cell in here.

L-14 Now, also, listen. Here about two years ago, I was in Chicago where science has proved now... Just about a year and six months ago, I guess it was, they had a piece in the paper (Mr. Boze's daughter and I were reading it.), that where that the doctors has proved that inside of the heart of a human, not a animal, in a human is a teeny little compartment--little bitty compartment that doesn't even have a blood cell in it. And they say it's the...?... of the soul. The soul lives in the heart. Now, intellectual faith is what... That's what's the matter with our revivals today. Now, here it is now; get it. Billy Graham, Jack Schuler, many a great man, Oral Roberts, great evangelists on the field has combed this nation back and forth. Altar calls has been made till enough to convert a thousand Americans--or Americas, rather. But the reason, it's only the people are brought to an intellectual faith. If they would go on just a little deeper till that faith come from the intellectuals and soaked down into the soul, it would last. That's the reason about eighty percent or ninety percent of the converts that comes in a revival is gone before six months is gone, is because they only have an intellectual conception. But when it becomes an experience of being born again of the Spirit of God, that anchors to eternity.

L-15 Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the next revival? I just wanted to see if you was listening to what I was talking about. "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed," how long? [Congregation replies, "day of your redemption"--Ed.] That's right. No breaking the seal... When a--a building is 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min completely--or a boxcar, I'd say, loaded and the seal put on it, don't you never touch that seal; you're in trouble with the government. And when God cleanses out by grace all the unbelief out of the heart, where a man can look God in the face and realize that he's an offspring of God, he'll believe every Word that God wrote in that Bible to be the truth. God will seal him into the Kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost until the day of his redemption. God said so. I believe the Word.

L-16 One great neglect among us, one great thing that we don't have much of is the anemic condition of the church. The condition at the church is failing and here's... Now here's one thing; we go too much upon evidences. Now, Luther said, "The just shall live by faith." He thought he had it. Wesley said, "When you got enough salvation to get sanctified..." Now, you good Methodist, that's pretty good. When you got enough faith to sanctify and get to shouting, Nazarenes, Pilgrim Holiness, Methodist, you said, "Glory, we got it." But you found out you didn't. That's right. You done a lot of things after you shouted you oughtn't have done: backslid, went on back. You Pentecostal got to speaking in tongues; you said, "Oh, brother, we got it now." But you find out you didn't. Hmm. God is Love. And the fruits of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, goodness, gentleness, mercy. Where there's knowledge, it shall vanish. Educate your preachers as much as you want to. Where it'll--knowledge, it'll vanish. Where there's prophecies, it'll fail. Where there's tongues, they shall cease. But when that which is perfect is come, which is love, it endureth forever.

L-17 Let me stop here, just a moment. We got plenty of time tonight anyhow. I'll get to this text tomorrow night maybe then. Let me just give you just a little inside of my life. Would you like to know it just a little bit? I don't like... Just to hear, just something comes in mind. I'm going to tell you, my brethren: don't make any difference how emotional you try to be. That's good. Anything without emotion is dead. You can scientifically prove that. So if your religion ain't got a little emotion about it, you better bury it, get some that's got emotion. But, look brother, the main thing, if all of your emotions isn't sealed by Divine Holy Spirit love, it won't do you any good. You know how I've had success is this, one thing I contribute it: love. That's right. Do you know love will conquer anything, no matter what it is?

L-18 How many's read the book back there--been reading my book? Let's see your hands. How many's ever read my book? Fine. Thank you. You seen the picture of the Angel of the Lord back there too. Now, notice, all scientifically. You notice in the first part at Portland, Oregon, that night when I was standing on the platform and that maniac run to the platform to kill me. You remember reading that? I was just speaking just like I am now, and this fellow run down through a crowd of people, thousands; and they were standing in the street. And his eyes bulged way out, and he was making his hands go up and down. He ran up to the platform. I thought maybe somebody was sick, and he was coming after them. It was about hundred and fifty, two hundred ministers setting behind me. And I looked at him, and he run on up that way, and preachers scattered like flies. And I... He'd just hit a preacher that day (and he was out of the insane institution.), broke his jaw and his collar bone. The police was after him.

L-19 And at the platform... He run right straight up to me and blowed real big like a goose, pushed out his chest, great big arms. I weighed a hundred and twenty eight then; he weighed about two fifty, about six foot tall, better, and let--six foot and four inches or something. And he said, "You hypocrite, you snake in the grass, standing up here imposing yourself as a servant of God. I'm going to take you apart right on this platform." Oh, I... You better know what you're talking about when it's a maniac. I just kept still, looked at him. He said, "Calling yourself a man of God..." Rolled his arm up, said, "I'm going to knock that little frame of yours plumb out over that audience; there won't be a piece of you together when you land." I knowed he was well able to carry his threats out. I just looked at him. Not a preacher said a word; they were gone. And I looked, and here come two police. I'd just led both of them to Christ. One of their mother's was healed the night before: a good Presbyterian woman. And they run out there to grab him. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min I said, "This is not a flesh and blood affair, brother. Just a moment. Thank you." The little fellows backed off. Stood there a minute, I just kept real still. And I was going to tell him, I'd say, "Sir, what's the matter?" And he went [Brother Branham makes a spitting sound--Ed.], spit right in my face. And he said, "You snake in the grass." He said, "Tonight, I'm going to break every bone in your body." And I was going to say, "I hope you don't." And as I started to say that, God in His Sovereignty... The Holy Spirit came down, and He said, just spoke in my... I...They thought it was me speaking, but it wasn't, no more than it is in the vision. He said, "Because that you've challenged the Spirit of God tonight, you'll fall over my feet." There's both prophecies. Now it had to be showed. Said, "Fall over your feet?" Said, "You hypocrite," said, "I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over." Drew back his arm, and run at me real hard, and he started to hit at me. I said, "Satan, come out of the man." And when his arm was up, he went, "Hmm, hmm," rolled around like that and fell down right across my feet and pinned me there till the police had to roll him off of my feet. They said, "Is that man dead?" I said, "No, sir. He worships that spirit." They pulled him out.

L-20 What was it? Did I hate that man? I loved him, a poor mortal in that condition. That wasn't that man speaking; that was the devil. He was possessed of the devil. And the devil made the challenge, and the Holy Spirit challenged him back. And you know what happened? There was wheelchairs, cots, stretchers; you know how it was in the first beginning. When that happened you could... When He was speaking you could've heard a pin drop, as the old saying is. But when the--all that legion saw that their chief man had been slain, every sick person rose to their feet; every cot was empty; every wheelchair emptied up; and the whole group was healed at one time, and walked out (See?), because the power of hatred and the power of love had met together, and love will overcome hatred every time. Love your enemy.

L-21 Now, you might... I hope you don't dislike me from this on, but I want to tell you a little something happened. You might say after this, Brother Branham is a fanatic. But all right; you're going to say it anyhow. So you might as well say something more. So then one day down on the Burke's farm down in Indiana here, where I come from, Jeffersonville, there'd been a big old bull had killed a colored man. They'd sold him out there near Henryville: big Guernsey bull; great long horns.

L-22 I was game warden here for years, when I was a Baptist minister. I just used to patrol. I never taken a offering in my life: never took one offering in my life. So, a brother asked me one time if I'd take him a offering. I said, "You'll starve next week." 'Cause I remember one time I said I was going to take an offering in my church and I told my wife. We got to a place where we couldn't make ends meet. Did you ever get them places? Sure you have. And I said, "Honey, I'm going to take an offering tonight." She said, "I'm going over to watch you." So I got up there, and I said... Now, because they wouldn't... They'd give me anything they had, but I was young and why couldn't I work same as anyone else. So I got up, and I said, "Brethren, I..." We didn't have even collection plate. I said, "I--I going to... Hit a little tough place, I'm going to take a offering tonight." And I said, "Would somebody get my hat?" And one the old deacons walked over to get my hat. I looked down, a little old mother setting there under--a little checkered apron. I don't know whether you ever seen the pocket on the inside of the apron. She reached down there and got out one of those--during the time of the depression, anyhow (You know?), and that little pocketbook that snaps over the top, begin to fumble around them nickels, and oh, my, I couldn't stand it. "Oh," I said, "I was just a teasing you. I didn't mean it." That was the closest I ever come to taking an offering. And Mr. Ryan, an old fellow that come down from Dowagiac, Michigan, had long hair, rode a bicycle down there, and he give it to me, and I got a ten cent can of paint and painted it, and sold it for five dollars. Didn't have to take the offering after all. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min

L-23 So that was it. I was patrolling, and I was on the conservation. And I'd been over there to a--a creek, and I remember a brother was across the other side was sick and had sent for me to come over and have prayer for him. I just thought this was a good time, so I started walking up over the hill. There was a little brush in the field like. And when I got about middle ways of this field of about five hundred yards across there or more, what raised up but that same bull that had killed that colored man. And there he was standing about thirty or forty feet from me. And you--him... Some cows was laying there. He raised up and snorted and looked at me, and I recognized the bull. Well, I's supposed to have a gun, but, huh, I didn't have one. And so I looked back to the fence; it was too far to run, and no tree to get into. So I thought this is probably the end then. So I looked at him, and you know... Now, this is not a joke. When I looked at that bull, and he lowered his head, and threw his horns on the ground, threw the dirt back over him, and he started coming... Now, instead of hating that bull, I was glad I didn't have no gun. I loved him. Now, that seems strange. I--I want you to remember this. I loved that fellow. I thought, "Poor fellow, I'm in his place. I'm on his territory. He was sleeping and I woke him up, just got him roused up." And I said to him, not knowing; I said, "Creature of God, I am the servant of God. I'm on my way to pray for one of God's sick children. Now, you can't bother me, because I'm God's servant. Now, I'm sorry I disturbed you. In Jesus' Name, go lay down." And that bull, not a bit more afraid of that bull, than I was the man that night or my brethren setting here. And that bull run right to me, till he got within about ten feet of me, and I wasn't no more afraid than I am now. And he got right close to me, and he stopped, and he looked this way and that way so depleted. And I just looked at him; I thought, "Poor fellow." He turned right around, and walked over, and laid down, and I walked right on by him. Love will conquer anything. Where there's tongues, they shall cease. Where there's prophecies, it shall vanish. But when love comes, it conquers everything. God so loved the world. There's where you're failing, friends. Don't practice so much of whether you got gifts or not, but practice that one real gift of love then you'd be better.

L-24 Being I started this far, I might as well say something else. Many of you come down and be prayed for at the house, and I want... I try to mow my yard in the front. And--and I'd mow a couple of rounds then run to... A carload of people come in and be prayed for; and I'd run around and take off my overalls and--and put on the other clothes and go and pray for them and... Well, the front was growing up before I could get the back cut. So I--I was down in the back yard, and no one back there, and I took off my shirt: real hot. And I was going mowing with the mower just hard as I could. Never thought, but there was a big old hornet's nest hanging in the corner. And I hit the fence, and brother, sister, Jehovah God knowing all things and me in this sacred desk here, I was covered over in a moment with hornets. Instead of hating those hornets, I thought, "Poor little fellows, why, I've disturbed them. That's their home. God made them. And I--I--I... That's their home." And I said, "A little creatures of God, I'm sorry I disturbed you. But now, I'm a servant of God, and I'm in a hurry. There's many of His sick children coming here to be prayed for. I must hurry." And I run that lawn mower back and forth, and those hornets humming all around me: with no shirt on they'll kill you. One of them would knock you down: great big fellows. And they--them hornets flew all around me, and I just went right on mowing with just the love of them poor little things, and they circled right around, and went right straight into that nest in a straight row, about like that in the Name of the Lord Jesus. What is it? Love conquers all things. Love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength and faith will accompany that love.

L-25 Now, notice. Abraham had to believe God in order--love God to believe Him. You love Him and more you love Him the more faith will accumulate. And so last night we left him where He was--appeared to Abraham at ninety years old as Almighty God, the Breast, El Shaddai. Now, we find out after he had been El Shaddai to Abraham... Abraham an old man, still believing, holding onto the promise... Lay hold of eternal life. Lay hold of every promise of God and hold onto it. That's what He said about being El Shaddai. The baby just lays hold of the mother's breast and satisfied as he nurses the strength of the mother into his own body. And he's nursing the mother's strength in his own body. If he's weak, fretty, run down, he nurses the mother's strength. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min Now, God's Word is His Breast, and we just lay hold of That and nurse our strength back from God's promise. Just keep quoting it over, "I'm the Lord that healeth thee." Oh, what a change it makes when you believe it.

L-26 Now, we find that Abraham... Then Lot separated himself from him and got into trouble. And a beautiful picture here, I want you to see it of God's love: Christ going after the backslider and the sinner. Kings, enemies come in and took Lot's wife, took the kings of Sodom and went out. And Abraham, as soon as he learned that his nephew Lot had been taken by the enemy (Look at it.), Abraham got all of his servants together, and went pursuing the enemy, and captured the enemy, and brought Lot back. What a picture of we fallen race of Adam. The enemy had us, and God the Father took the host of heaven and went pursuing the devil until He conquered him and brought us back safely. What a picture of salvation. And God... Wish we had a long time; wish we could just--the revival could go on for about two weeks, so we could just get right in this Word and go to digging in It, bringing faith. Got a big tent coming, seating about twelve thousand. We're going to put it up and stay four--six weeks at a time, so we can just keep on.

L-27 And now, notice another thing; after that then--after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah... We have to pass over many these great places. And then when we find then the next thing takes place that Abraham is setting out in the barren land. God has not promised us everything nice, but God's promised grace to endure. God's not promised to take us home on a flower bed of ease. Look at the patience of Job and the disciples, and down through the age, how men and women has suffered for the cause of Christ. And here was Abraham sitting upon the barren grounds under his oak, his little tent; the flock being very poor, because Lot had taken the choice grounds. And he and Sarah was setting there, and one afternoon while Abraham looked out, yet holding onto God's promise... He looked standing near the tree, there stood three men over against the... Abraham went out to them, fell down at His feet--the three man and said, "If I have found grace in Thy sight, stop by just a moment; set under the oak, under the tree, the shade, it's hot today." Courtesy. Said, "And I'll fetch a little water and wash Your feet, and I'll have a morsel of bread cooked for You. You refresh Yourself, and then You may go on." That's the way to entertain strangers.

L-28 Notice, Abraham, waiting for the promise, there was something in him that recognized that those were more than men, for One of them was Almighty God Himself, and the other one was two Angels: the other two. And so he slipped into the tent right quick and said, "Sarah, go over to the meal barrel and get some meal and knead it right quick, or sift it out, and make some unleavened cakes right quick. And he run out into the herd and felt around till he got the fattest calf he had, churned some milk right quick, and got some butter, killed the calf, and cooked it, and got some veal chops, corn bread, some butter, the buttermilk, took it out and set it down for God and two Angels to eat. Amen. Oh, my, I feel religious right now. Think of that. God visiting mortal man, oh, that kindly makes the little wheels go to turning. Look at it.

L-29 Now, Abraham set and watched Them, probably got him a little bush and shooed the flies away while They were eating. Did you ever do that? We used to have to do it at home: had a little fly bush out in the country before we had screen doors or could afford them. And there he watched the Angels and God while They're eat and God has His back turned to the door, and said, "Abraham, where's Sarah?" Said, "She's in the tent." He said, "About this time according to life I'm going to--the time of life, I'm going to visit you." Sarah nearly a hundred years old... Said, "I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." And Sarah (Here it is. Now, watch.), Sarah, in the tent, laughed, inside the tent at God's back, the Man setting there in human flesh, eating the meat of a calf, drinking the milk and butter from the cow, eating some corn bread... And He said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" (Back behind Him then.) What would some of you skeptics call that? Mental telepathy? Reading the mind of Sarah? Anyhow, God did it. Sarah got scared; she said, "No, I--I--I never laughed. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min Said, "Oh, yes, you did too." He knew what I was talk--what He was talking about. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? The Word so real and so simple. After eating, He said, "Would I keep a secret from Abraham, let him know what I'm going to do?" And He revealed to him that the sins of Sodom had already reached heaven. Their cries were great; He was going down to destroy it. Think of it, that... And then He went up, vanished from Abraham. The Angels went on.

L-30 Oh, a preacher said to me sometime ago; he said, "Brother Branham, do you really say that was God?" And I said, "It ain't whether I said it or not. The Word said it." And watch It's in capital L-O-R-D: rulership, heavens and earth, Lord God. Why, he said, "How could that happen?" Why, I said, "You limit God to your theology." Some people just can't... We may not be able to shout down the walls of Jericho; nor we might not be able to have the faith of Joshua to cross the Jordan. And we may not have the faith like Enoch did, who taken a little walk one day with God in the afternoon, a little stroll, and just got tired of the earth and walked on home with Him.

L-31 God is Almighty. So what is the body made of? A little calcium, potash. Here some time ago down in Memphis, Tennessee... I like art, and I was watching there in the museum where it said the analysis of the human body of a man weighing a hundred and fifty pounds was worth eighty-four cents. There's enough whitewash in the body to sprinkle a hen's nest, and, oh, you know just a few things like that. There was two boys standing there, they... One looked around at the other, and said, "Well, John, we're not worth very much are we?" But you'll put a five hundred dollar mink coat on that eighty-four cents and walk down the street with your nose turned up, like if it'd rained it would drowned you. And you belong to some big church and you take care of that eighty four cents, and what is it? Nothing but a little handful of ashes, and you'll stick anything in that soul which is worth ten thousand worlds. You don't think about that. Dust thou art; dust returneth was not spoken of the soul. Yes, eighty-four cents, what the human body's worth.

L-32 God just reached down and got a handful of atoms, and a handful of calcium, and a handful of cosmic light, and just blowed it together, and made three bodies, and Him and two Angels stepped down in it and they eat. That's our God. What are you... What's the resurrection so it's a mystery about then? If the God Who can come out of all space, Who fills the space of the solar system and beyond... Amen. Why, it's nothing for Him to speak and anything can happen. Then if He knows you by name... Look. As I said the other night about what my wife told me, I was getting bald headed, and I told her I hadn't lost one of my hairs. She said, "Where are they at?" And I said, "Where was they 'fore I got them? They are there waiting for me to come to them." And so is this body going away, but one day there won't be a speck of it left, but every atom that's holding it together, every bit of petroleum, all the cosmic lights, God had it when He made the world, and He'll give it back in a immortal condition at the day of the resurrection when He calls from the dead. Amen. So what you scared about? You should be the happiest people on earth. My. God Who controls all the elements... They're all His. He created them first before He created you. You're just a part of His creation when He made all those things. Then He just took a little bit of it and formed it and made you...?...

L-33 Notice, God was showing in Sarah and Abraham there, something that He is going to do for all people. You believe that? This is just a little time out for a minute again. I want to ask you something. Dad, you remember what mother looked like when you married her? And you remember what dad looked like when you married him, mother? Fine looking, handsome man, and that hair combed back. How beautiful the eyes was of mother. You walked down to the altar, and swallowed big, in looking at her. I remember when I got married. I looked at my wife and my heart beat real fast and... I couldn't; I was a little bashful; I 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min couldn't ask her to marry me, so I wrote her a letter and asked her, and she accepted it. And so then when we... Remember when I got married how pretty she was? But you know what? You'll wake up one morning, saying "Mother, there's a wrinkle under them pretty eyes." "Dad, there's some gray hairs coming in your head." Death set in. It's going to get--get you. God painted that picture, said, "There they are. Aren't they beautiful? That's My handwork. Now, death, come on, you can take the body."

L-34 Look now, Abraham and Sarah were old people. The Bible said they well stricken in age. Now, what He proved through Abraham, and what He did for Abraham and Sarah, He's going to do for all of Abraham's seed. Now, you have to read the Bible between the lines. Did you know that? That's where some of you smart scholars fail. That's right. He said, "I've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babes such as will learn." Notice. Just be a baby; forget all you ever knowed to know Christ. And notice, how my wife when I'm overseas, she'll write me a letter and say, "Dear Billy, I--here I am tonight, I'm thinking of you." Now, that's what she putting on the paper, but I love her so much I can read between the lines. See? If you love God real well (This is all hid to the scholars.), but you can read between the lines. It's a love letter. That's why I'm trying to tell you: love Him. It's a love letter you read. God wrote to you. It's all hid from the smart people now. You just have to get simple to read it. That's right.

L-35 Watch this just a moment. Maybe, sometime coming back, I'd like to take just this love letter, and may the Lord just reveal it to us. You know? So watch. Abraham, you know what God did for Abraham and Sarah there? Might be strange; you might not think it. But He not only blessed them, but He turned them back to a young man and woman again. Did you know that? He did it. He sure did. Now, watch. I can just imagine Abraham the next morning getting up, say, "Why, Sarah, you know what? Why, say--your--your--your--your--your--your--your wrinkles are going out of your face." And she said, "Well, dad, look--look, you know what? That stoop in your shoulder's coming out." They was turning back. God can do all things. Watch. They left there and went down to Gerar. Watch how far it is; about three hundred miles. Quite a trip for an old aged man and little grandma with a little cap on her head, going, shaking along down the road. And now, the strange thing was when they got down there in the land of the Philistines, Abimelech the king, was hunting a sweetheart. And all those beautiful Philistines girls down there, when he seen Sarah, grandma, coming on a cane, he fell in love with her. Nonsense. He said, "That's the one I've been waiting for." Abraham said, "Oh, you're fair to look upon, Sarah." A hundred years old. See? You have to read between the lines. She was very fair. She went back to a young woman.

L-36 Now look, readers, you might criticize this. Now look, if the woman was a hundred years old, right on a hundred, God... She had been barren all this time. God had to create something in her, because her womb was dead. Is that right? If He did that... It's a mixed audience. I don't mean to be speaking like this, but in order for the woman to have the baby, it--in that time when the baby's being born, she'd have to have a new heart. That heart couldn't beat through that woman a hundred years old; there was no milk veins. She couldn't raise it on a bottle. Women didn't smoke cigarettes and have to raise their babies on bottles them days. They had to raise it the old--the real way. That's right. So... That's the truth. You know it's the truth. The--the biggest communistic... Why, it's the worst; it's the most dirty thing you've ever done: a woman smoke cigarettes. I've got my opinion of her. That's right. I want to tell you something else. And I've got my opinion of a man that would let his wife smoke cigarettes. It shows who's the boss. Exactly. She's...?... for you. Didn't say that's to be throwing. I don't mean it that way. I mean it's the truth. It's a disgrace to see way men so... Why, their sissified or more than their women are. Who rules around your house anyhow? That's right. Sarah was a beauti... Now, you ought to feel ashamed, lady. I'm watching whose face gets red. I'm up here, way up high; I can watch you. This might burn a little bit, but it'll be good for you. 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min

L-37 Notice, Sarah, beautiful woman again, and Abimelech fell in love with her. God had changed her. She was back to a young woman again, and Abraham. Showed it. They brought the baby forth: God did for them. She was back about thirty years old. And what He showed in Abraham and them, He proved what He's going to do for you and I someday (Amen.), to those who will take His promise and call those things which are as though they wasn't, if it's contrary to God's Word. Amen. Believe God. Lay hold on it. Hold on to it. Set your course towards heaven; look at Calvary, the Author and Finisher of our faith and not some scientific book. Notice, look to Calvary. Watch just a minute now. Then talk about being a young woman, sure she was and Abraham a young man. Now, look, they brought Isaac to the world and when Isaac was a man of forty-five, Sarah died, and then Abraham married another woman; and I believe he had either seven or nine boys beside the girls after that. Certainly he did. He turned him back to a young man again. That's God's Word; I believe It. Yes, sir. Look at Abraham when he--he said it way down the line--when he was way down the line, 'fore he was a hundred and forty-five, when he was yet eighty, he considered not his own body then dead. Oh, He's wonderful.

L-38 Now, when the little boy was born, God proving that after Abraham had held on for all these years... When he was about twelve years old, God said, "Now, Abraham, I'm going to show those Cadle Tabernacle folks up there, one of these days, that I keep My promise; and I'll show the world that you got faith in Me. I want you... I've made you a father of many nations, and this boy, in him, I'm going to call the seed from Isaac. And I say this: that I want you to take Isaac out there and kill him." The only hope that he had was in Isaac. So I imagine Abraham couldn't tell poor Sarah that, was going to take this fine little twelve year--fourteen year old boy, his little curly hair hanging down around his shoulders, and... his only child, and both of them then getting up to middle age again, and... Why, how could they do it, take that poor... Couldn't tell Sarah, so he got all the wood together and put it on a mule, got a couple of servants.

L-39 And notice, he went three-day's journey and then he looked far off and he seen the mountain which he was to go to, to offer the... Isaac for a sacrifice. Now, a ordinary man can walk, anyhow, twenty-five a miles a day. I've walked thirty a many day. But ordinarily in th--those--these days when you go in your car everywhere you go, but them days they were used to walking. And if--if he went three-day's journey, he was at least seventy five miles back. And then he looked and saw the mountain far off, probably another twenty-five miles. Now he's a hundred miles back from civilization. I love this: Genesis 22. Fixing to close, listen close. Then when he come close to the mountain, he said to the servants... He took the wood, perfect type of Christ and God. He laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders, took the fire in his hand. And look at this now. Oh, I love this. Oh, He's wonderful. He said, "You stay here, the lad and I are going yonder to worship. The lad and I shall return." Glory. I just had to let that come out. Look. How did he? The Bible said that he had received him as one from the dead, knowed that God could raise him up from the dead. "How is he going to come back, Abraham? You're going up to kill him. How's he going to return with you?" But he took God's Word, knowing that God had promised him, that through Isaac God was going to do something. He didn't know what. But it wasn't his business to know what. Just walk on. Well it is... How's God going to heal me? I don't know, but walk on. "How am I going to tell my mother tonight that I got saved?" I can't tell you. "How am I going to tell my associates I received the Holy Spirit and born again?" I can't tell you. Walk on. Just keep going. Move on, laying aside everything, moving on towards Calvary.

L-40 On they went up the mountainside: the little boy with the wood on his shoulder, a type, God giving His only begotten Son in shadow years to follow. But God's showing in there what He would do. Oh, I just love it. And when he got up on top of the hill, he found a big rock for the altar, laid the wood, built the fire. Little Isaac said, "Father." He said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "Here's the wood; here's the altar; here's--here's the fire; but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" Oh, down that old patriarch's heart, trembling with the knife sticking on his side to take his own son's life, he said, "God will provide Himself a lamb for the offering. It's not my business to argue about it or this that or the other. God will provide. He made the promise." 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min If He made the promise... "How can I, Brother Branham, when I been paralyzed in this hand?" "How can I when I haven't seen for years?" I don't know, but God made the promise. Oh, my. You get that down in your heart. Let's... Are you Abraham's seed? Let that faith come into you: Abraham's seed.

L-41 Notice, then he takes his little boy, binds his hands and his feet. Isaac never said a word: obedient unto death, just like Jesus was at the cross. Laid him up on the altar, pulled out the knife, the tears, maybe, rolling down his checks, laid his hand on his little head, brushed back the curls, pulled back the knife like this, raised his hands to plunge the knife into his own son's throat, 'cause God had told him to do it. Just about the time he got ready to act upon God's commandment, the Holy Spirit grabbed his hand and said, "Abraham, stay your hand. I know you love Me." [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] About that time right over behind him a ram hooked in the wilderness with his horns, bleated. Hallelujah. Oh, my. "Hallelujah" means "Praise our God." What was it? Abraham loosed his son, went over and got this ram, and offered him instead. I want to ask you something, friends; He called the name of the place Jehovah-jireh: "the Lord will provide Himself a sacrifice." Where did that ram come from? He was a hundred miles from civilization. And beside that, the ram couldn't have been there; the wolves and lions and things would've eat it. And another thing, it's up on top of the mountain where there's no water. Where did the ram come from? Jehovah-jireh, the Creator spoke the lamb into existence. He is there at all times. He's... That lamb come into existence in one minute and died the next minute. For one man taking God's Word, God provided the thing. And He's still Jehovah-jireh tonight that'll provide the sacrifice, and every time, that a man or a woman will take His Word and step out on It and call It the truth. I felt someone say it was a vision. It wasn't a vision; it was a ram. He laid it on the altar and killed it, and blood run out of it. It was a ram. God the Creator spoke it into existence, and He can do the same thing tonight, can speak into existence the power and the operation of the Holy Ghost to transform a sinner into a saint. His omnipotence is here, His Presence. He's here. He's still Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide. "How can I be saved, Brother Branham, when I've done..." The Lord has provided. "How can I be healed?" The Lord has provided a ram. You believe it? Let us pray.

L-42 Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for all these marvelous examples. Paul, the writer of the Hebrews, said, "Seeing that we're compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses..." O God, let we tonight, living down in the closing of time... Many thousands and innumerable miracles of God since that day upon the mount where Jehovah introduced Himself as God's will provide... Thou has provided us the Holy Spirit. Thou has provided us healing. Thou has provided us salvation. Thou has provided us joy. And God, with grasping arms, may we embrace every Calvary promise tonight as our own personal property. Grant it, Father.

L-43 And while we have our heads bowed, I just feel constrained to ask this question. You been here many nights in the meeting. Are you without Christ, without God tonight, sinner friend? Would you just do this if you're convinced in your heart that He's provided a way for you to come out of that life and to live a different life? Are you convinced of it, that He's here? If you are, will you just slip up your hand and say, "God, be merciful to me a sinner. I'm now in my seat, right here, want to accept Jesus as my Saviour." Will you raise your hand anywhere in the building? May God bless you, lady. Someone else? Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling. Don't you know, maybe... God bless you, lady. Maybe before morning the doctor may come and say, "Well, it's a heart attack. She's gone--he's gone." After leaving a meeting like this where God comes every night and appears... God bless you back there, son, see your hand. "God, be merciful to me a sinner." I see you back there, son. God bless you, my brother. Say, "Will that save me?" Yes, sir. Your faith in God's what saved you. I see you, mister; God bless your heart. See your hand back there, sir. I see you there, lady. God bless you. God bless you, lady. And you, sir, God bless you. God bless you, sir. That's right. All over the building hands going up. God bless you, lady, I see and both stretched wide towards heaven. God, be merciful. He provides. God bless you, little boy. I see you, honey.

L-44 What did Jesus say? Saint John 5:24, "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath eternal 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min life, and shall never come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life." God bless you, sir. By doing that, if that comes from below the hand from a honest heart, I believe it does, you have eternal life "All that My Father has given Me, will come to Me; and no man can come except My Father draws him. And he that'll come, I will in no wise turn him out. I'll give him everlasting life, and raise him up at the last day." What a easy thing it is, just to renounce your sin, raise your hand. Now, people, don't be looking. Let God do the looking. May God bless you, sir. God sees it. What is that? "No man can come except My Father draws him." What's that knock at your heart? Could you turn an opportunity like that down, right here where you see God manifested every night? How wonderful it is.

L-45 Just have faith, don't doubt. Believe with all your heart. Someone else now? There's been many has waved... I see you, sir. God bless you, my brother. You were dead a few minutes ago and now you're alive. I don't want to argue theology, but I'm saying what the Bible said. Jesus said, "He that hearth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath (present tense) everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment but has past from death unto life." You believe it with all your heart? Be like Abraham was. He believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. Now, after he believed God it was imputed to him, God give him a sign of his faith. He give him circumcision, which was a type of the Holy Ghost, after he had believed on God. Been justified by faith, now he's to be sealed in the Kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost. How many in here would--has never been sealed, God has never recognized your faith. You've never been born again, and He's never recognized. Yet you've confessed it, but He's never give you the Holy Spirit, the new birth? Would you raise your hand and say, "God, be merciful to me tonight? I want..." Oh, God bless you; that's wonderful. Just dozens of hands...

L-46 Heavenly Father, You know from the greatest to the least of each of those. All those men, women, some young ladies and boys, just at the crossroads of life, raising their heads. What a beautiful sight. We know that the angels of God are around here now, standing near in the tabernacle. You broke down all these things which we'll have to come against us at the day of judgment if You knocked at our heart and we refused it. But all these hands has raise up, that they have received You, and they love You. And Thou...?... God, according to Thy Word, I commit them to Thee. And Thy Word, Lord, said that if they would do that, believe it, accept it, they'd have everlasting life and would not come to the judgment, but has past from death to life. We thank Thee for them, Father. We pray that You'll gather them up around the altar, and may they have a good refreshing from the Presence of God. In Christ's Name we ask it. Amen.

L-47 I don't know how you feel, but I feel like something inside of me been scoured out, just like something had held me. The--the sacred feeling of the Holy Spirit, don't you feel that, that sacred feel? I just love that. There's something about the Gospel that's cleansing, souls being saved. It's late. I was just thinking about calling... I don't believe I'll call a prayer line. I believe I'll just stand right here, just do what the Holy Spirit would have me do. Will you believe with me? Listen, your faith picked up last night. And just as I said that, something struck my heart and said, 'That's it." You believe now. You have faith in God. Do you do it? Look, every one out there, all of you people out there, I don't know you, never seen you. Instead of you coming up here, it's just a recognition that God has provided a way to declare His Word. You believe that? Now, Jesus is alive tonight and He's among us. The very same God that created that lamb there for Abraham, that took His Word, He's here to create for you anything that you'd ask Him to do that's included in His blessings. Salvation, He did create for them the baptism of the Holy Spirit; He's created healing. It's already been finished at Calvary. You have to accept it.

L-48 Now, let's bow our heads again, just a minute. Would you give us a... sister, ever who's playing there... Just be real reverent. I want you to play for us: The great physician now is near, 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min The sympathizing Jesus, He speaks the drooping hearts to cheer, No other name like Jesus. His Name expels my guilt and shame Oh, praise the Name of Jesus. He's here, the lovely One.

L-49 Now, heavenly Father, we're unworthy. We're just creatures of this earth, and we're unworthy of the things we ask, Lord. But by grace Thou has overlooked our unworthiness, and we're not confessing that we are worthy. We're confessing we're unworthy. We do not ask for judgment; we ask for mercy. And dear God, the mercies of God to be granted to us tonight upon the condition that these people, where dozens of them has raised their hands to accept You as personal Saviour. God, I'm asking You to do something in this sovereignty of Your gift, that I, Your unprofitable servant... And not saying that, Lord, to be humble; Thou knowest my heart. I'd be a hypocrite to say such a thing if it didn't come from my heart. Unworthy, but will You by Your sovereign grace tonight, just let the people have faith enough, like the woman at the well, and to prove to this audience that Thy servant's words that I have said about Your resurrection is true. Vindicate that to be truth tonight, won't You, God? Without--even people close to me... Will You grant that, Lord? Through Jesus Christ's Name, I ask it. Amen.

L-50 This is a strange thing. I don't say that God, our Father, will do it. I'm only asking for His mercy. Will you be in prayer just a few minutes? I want ask you something. How many sick people is there in the building? Raise up your hands. Just how many sick people? Now, as a... You have a right to doubt my word, but you don't have a right to doubt His Word. You're a sinner when you doubt His Word. Well now, I told you that Jesus raised from the dead and does the same things now that He did then. He stood in the audience. He knowed the woman that touched His garment, and He turned to her, said--found her where she was. He didn't know at first. Said, "Thy faith has saved thee." I want to ask some of you scholars, is that same word "saved," just the same as it is salvation or healing? The same Greek word "sozo," is that right? He's saved physically or saved spiritually. Now, believe in salvation. See? Your faith (sozo) saves you. Believe it? Oh, my. Now, be real reverent. And if God will do that to any person in the audience, will you believe? Just that you might see that it's God and not me, you just be praying and see if the Holy Spirit will. How many here will believe with all your heart? If God... If some person in there that I don't know will say the same thing like He did the woman at the well and tell what's your trouble or whatever it is, or something another, you'll believe with all your heart from right here. You won't even have to be called in a prayer line. Will you do it? May He grant it.

L-51 Now, I want you just to look to Calvary. Now, He's the High Priest of--of our confession. He's the High Priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Is that right? Don't be straining. You--you get nervous. Just let loose. Say God, "Yes, that's right." Now, in the sovereign grace of God, the Angel of the Lord is over the building, right out there now. I am not a hypocrite. I'm not a fanatic. I'm only telling truth. Now, if He is, may He grant these things that I have asked. As the audience is watching me, I'm looking right at that same Pillar of Fire that you see on the picture, right now. It's hanging over a woman and over the woman is a dark shadow. I see her falling, frothing at the mouth. She's got her head down. She's setting right back there. She has epileptic fits. She's setting on the end of the row. She's praying for God to take it away from her. Raise up your hand, lady, and accept your healing. Will you do it back there? You believe that God will take away the epilepsy and make you well? If you'll do it, believe it, you can have your healing. God will make you well. The Lord be with you, sister. Don't you love Him? Just be reverent. You're in church. Keeps moving right through this aisle, right in here. It's standing over a lady which has a--a checkered dress on. She's got arthritis. There sets a man there has got high blood pressure; looking at me. He's got his tie, striped, elderly man. You believe, sir, God will make you well? Yes, sir. You believe that He'll make you well? Just say, "Praise the Lord." That's all I 56-0614, God Provided A Lamb, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, IN, 84 min want you to do. All right, sir. God bless you. Go home now; you're healed.

L-52 Be reverent. Man and woman setting together, the lady wiping her eyes, you had high blood pressure too. And there's two of them together, so you were healed also. So don't fear no more. God bless you, lady. The little lady... That's right. You (See?), it was you. I want you to say something, lady. You were praying, wasn't you? Is that right? You... Yes, ma'am, the little hat on you. Just raise your hand so the audience can see who you are. Right. That's the lady right there. You were praying. You're healed now. You believe? Right on down the row from you there is a lady praying. She's got epilepsy. That you might know who it is, her sister sets next to her, and she's a nervous woman. If that's right, you two women stand on your feet, if you're sisters and stand on your feet--epilepsy, or... You believe? Have faith in God. Somebody over in here believe? What about down in here, you believe? Have faith. The little lady setting there with the white rose with white flower, God can heal arthritis and make well, can't He, lady? Do you believe it? Raise up. Stomp your feet up and down. Raise your feet up and down so you see it's--your arthritis... Move your hands around. The Lord Jesus healed you then, made you well. Amen. Now, He's wonderful. Do you believe that? If thou canst believe...

L-53 The lady setting next to you, lay your hands on her. She's got throat trouble. She wants to be healed too. Amen...?... That's right, isn't it, lady? Now, you can be healed also. Amen. Have faith in God. Now, I'm not reading your mind. You believe God is in the building? I want you to start praying just a minute. I'll look some other way, if you think I'm reading your mind. Just I want someone to start praying now and just pray real sincerely. Just believe on the Lord Jesus and know that it's not me; it's Him. O God, that they might know that You're Christ and raised from the dead, that You're here, Lord.

L-54 I see standing before me two. It's a man and a woman, and the man has something wrong with his spine, and the woman has a female trouble. And they're... The man's a minister. I've never seen him before, and he isn't from here. He's from Ohio. His first name is Frank. Gray is his last name. You believe that Jesus Christ makes you well now? Would you stand up, glorify God? God bless you. Have faith in God. How many more wants to healed? Put your hands over on one another. Ministers of the Gospel, you keep me at my word tonight. Your people will be coming to you weeks after I'm gone, telling you that their troubles was healed. It's just going from one to another, from one to another. It's right around in the audience...?...

L-55 Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee for Thy sovereignty, for Thy blessings. And I pray, heavenly Father, that You will come and minister, and bless each one of these; and may The Holy Ghost come upon this people just now and heal them, each one. May your loving arms... May they realize that Jehovah-jireh is at the--is at the line of duty tonight. The angels of God that's gone on pursuit after these demon powers that has the--taken the people by force, that God has sent His angels, and they're here declaring the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Satan, you've lost the battle. Come out of these people. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I adjure thee by the living Word. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
