--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Thank you, Brother Reed. Good evening, friends. Very happy to be here tonight again to minister in the Name of our Lord Jesus. I am happy to say that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He... His great loving powers never fails. He's just the same as He--He always was. I trust that tonight will prove to be a blessing to many of the people who are without God, without Christ in the world, alienated, cut off. I trust that they'll come to Christ tonight and be saved and reconciled to God. And I trust it'll be a blessing for many who are sick and afflicted, that they might be made well. May our Lord grant that is my sincere prayer.

L-2 Brother Reed does the speaking. First part of the week I was speaking myself, and I was only intending to stay about three or four nights. It seemed like the Holy Spirit wanted me to stay just a little longer. I was preaching; I got just a little bit hoarse. Well, it usually accompanies along, there's such a... Something happens, you... It's in another world; you live in two worlds. There's no need of trying to explain it, because you just can't explain Him. You just have to believe it. God cannot be explained; He has to be just believed. And when we believe God, then that's by faith. We believe Him, and He heals us, saves us.

L-3 And now, tonight while there--the people are standing, and Mr. Reed, our brother here... And I was--been setting in the little room for a little while. I usually maybe try to come along about quarter of eight, something like that, seven-thirty, when they pick me up; come up and hear part of the service. And I was enjoyed that singing. And Brother Ryan that... I trust that our Lord will let me be that nimble when I'm seventy-three years old, if I live to see it. I've knowed Brother Ryan for some time now, and I know that he is a humble Christian. When I first saw him, I wondered how would he wear that hair down to his shoulder, that long beard, why was that? You have to know Brother Ryan to know the reason. If you know him, well then, you'll know why. God only made one; that's him. No one else take his place. Without the hair to his shoulders, and his... Now, someone says, "That's woman's hair." That doesn't bypass for you woman, unless, say you got hair went to your shoulder. Read the Greek on that. Feminish hair is way down; hair at the shoulder was short hair. So the man used to pull it around, cut it off, that was short hair, but women let theirs grow all the way down, way down.

L-4 So that's the reason... Jesus, His picture there shows, but He didn't have long hair, not by no means; He had short hair. But today we shore it on up closer. The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, or the wearing of apparel; it's long-suffering, goodness, meekness, patience, and the Holy Ghost, the Kingdom of God. So I want to read just a little Scripture, and then I'm going to start the prayer line and pray for the sick. And now, if the Holy Spirit shall come into our presence tonight, to bless us with His great august Being, I trust that you that are unsaved will be saved, and you that are--are sick will be healed. If there be any wayward here, may you come back to God tonight. That's what the meaning of this, these meetings are. First thing is to get the people right with God in their heart. That's the first motive. Secondarily, is those wayfaring people might be healed. And then third, is--is to--for the glory of God, that the saints might be refreshed, watching, listening, looking on.

L-5 Now, the Gospel is not altogether the Word. This is the Word of God, and all things must be based upon this Word. If it isn't, it isn't true. This is... But Jesus said, "Go ye in all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." Now, He did not say "Teach the Word," He said, "Preach the Gospel." So the Gospel consists more than teaching the Word, for Paul, confirming that, said, "The Gospel came to us, not in Word only, but through power." Demonstrations of the Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate the Gospel, bring the Word to a living reality. If you just receive the Word by knowing the Word, that doesn't do you any good. "The letter killeth; the Spirit giveth 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min life." Then you must be borned again, and then the Holy Spirit quickens the Word to you. In other words, like a grain of corn, if it's laying in my hand, it's just a grain of corn, it'll never be nothing else. But bury it, it comes contaminated, molds, and then it brings up another grain of corn just like it.

L-6 I used to look at flowers. I just love flowers. I don't believe there's anyone who could look right at a rose or flower, and say, if he's mentally balanced right, that there is no God. For all the science in the world couldn't make one little thing like that: all of our scientific research. They can make something looks like it, but they can't make that. No more than they could make that, they can make one looks like it out of paper, but it hasn't got life in it. That's got life in it. That's the secret, the life. God is Life. You watch the little flowers how that they... Summertime you woman around here now, I notice sometimes passing through Jonesboro, I notice you have a lot of beautiful flowers. I love that. And in the fall of the year, some of them are still young. You plant them late in the summer and they are young, old, middle-age, but when the frost comes as death, it kills them all, young old alike bows its little head and submits itself to death. Then the petals drop off; the leaves drop off. And out of there drops a little black seed. Then they have a regular funeral procession, God does, for the flower. He sends the fall clouds over, and they cry. The rain falls down and buries the little seed underneath the ground. Then the cold winter comes, freezes it. The pulp bursts... The little seed bursts open, the pulp runs out. The ground is all froze over with ice.

L-7 Well, now in the spring of the year, the flower's gone, the petal's gone, the bulb's gone, the--the seed's gone, the pulp's gone; everything's gone. But that's not the end of the flower. When that warm sunshine begins to bathe upon the earth, there's a little germ of life somewhere, hid away, that no science can find. It reproduces the same kind of a flower that went down. If God made a way for a flower to live again, how much more He did for a man to live again. The whole basis of Christianity is based upon the fundamental fact of resurrection. Now, if I should drop this on the floor, now to pick up this off the floor, would not be resurrection, or pick up something that looks like it, wouldn't be resurrection. Resurrection is to pick up the same thing that dropped down.

L-8 Now, in different parts of the world, in India and so forth, we find they are sane people, that they believe in God, but... Oh, they believe in--that we return back an angel, and we got wings and fly, but that's wrong. We're be men and women just like we are now. Now, only we won't be old, because when... I look here and see an elderly man and his wife setting here, perhaps, husband and wife. They're gray. All right, a few years ago, probably a young, fine looking man, and a young lady, walked down to an altar and got married; black hair both of them, fine, sturdy, young, healthy. They come from babies up to that age. About twenty-two or twenty-three years old, they was at their best. Then begin to notice one morning when mother come out to fix the dishes on the table for breakfast, there become little wrinkles begin to come under her and dad's eyes, hair begin to turn gray, dad's shoulders stooped a little. What's the matter? Death's setting in; it's going to get you. It's got to get you. It may pen you many places, and you get out, but finally it's going to win. It's going to take you.

L-9 But then it falls, like the grain of wheat, when it goes into the earth. But then on the resurrection morning, when it's resurrected again, it will not be resurrected old, and gray, and stooped over, but it'll be just what it was before death ever struck it, because all of death will be taken away from it. Isn't that wonderful? Some of us will be black-headed, some red-headed, some blonds. "Brother Branham is that..." Yes, God isn't uniform. God's without form. Look here. He makes--He makes big trees, little trees, thin trees. He makes white flowers, blue flowers. God's a God of variety. He--And He makes little people, big people, short people, thin people. That's just the way we'll be in the resurrection. And we shall know each other as we are known. Thanks be to God.

L-10 My brothers and sisters, for twenty years since being a minister of the Gospel, I've tried to give this to the poor lost mortals of this world, to let them know that they have Eternal Life, right now, by believing on the Son of God and accepting Him as personal Saviour. So simple. Jesus said... Now, listen, Saint John 5:24. "He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath (present tense) Everlasting Life, and shall not come into condemnation (or judgment), but has passed from death unto Life." I--I only 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min have His Word. "He that eats My flesh (Saint John 6) and drinks My Blood has Everlasting Life, and I will raise him up at the last days." Wonderful. That's His Word. I don't how it's going to be, but it will be.

L-11 Now, I want about ten more minutes of the time. Will it be all right? If I can. In the 20th chapter of Numbers, I read these words: And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take the rod, and gather thou the assemble together, thou, and Aaron they brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes; and it shall bring forth his... ("His" is personal pronoun now) his water, and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so that thou shall give the congregation and their beasts drink.

L-12 Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Our heavenly Father, we come to thee tonight as Thy lovely children, yet confessing that we're--we are deeply sorry for our sins. When we think of Calvary and of Jesus, and what He had to do for us to redeem us, our hearts melt. Why did that lovely One have to walk Calvary, bleeding back, bloody streak all the way through the city of Jerusalem, up the hill, there with nails pierced in His hand, and a spear at His side, to die in disgrace and shame to save us? We look to Calvary tonight and confess our wrongs. We're sorry, Lord; forgive us of our shortcomings. But in the depths of our heart, there lays happiness, because that we know that we are absolutely secure in Christ Jesus. You promised Abraham You'd save him and his seed. And we being dead in Christ, take on Abraham's Seed and are heirs according to the promise by the Holy Spirit: New Life, Life coming into us, making us believe the supernatural like Abraham did, taking God at His full value, His promise. We thank Thee.

L-13 Now, bless this people tonight. Laying here before me is a group of handkerchiefs; bless the dear people who sent these. They read in the Bible where they taken from the body of Paul, they believe that You're still the same Holy Spirit in the same church. And I know I'm not Saint Paul the apostle, but Jesus is still the same Lord. Bless these handkerchiefs for their intended purpose, the people that wear them, may they get well, Father. Bless us together, heal the sick, save the lost tonight. For we ask it in Christ's Name. Amen.

L-14 I wanted to teach some this week, but you see, when crowds are standing, and so forth, it's hard. One of these days I would like to come back to Jonesboro, go rent some big tent to seat about ten thousand people, and set it out here and stay about two months, so we could have a real revival. And then, if you notice how that God promised the children of Israel He would take them out of Egypt... After four hundred years they had been down there. Joseph had been taken down, one of the patriarchs, died down there, but made mention of a parting of Israel. All those patriarchs looked forward to the Word of God being fulfilled. How simple when you can just believe God's Word and take Him at what He says. Isn't it simple? Just love, if you love Him, love in your heart for God will create faith.

L-15 If you love your mother real well, love your father, love your husband, or your wife, it'll create a faith. The love for my wife... I, when I leave her, I don't have to have... Man has always tried to do something to save hisself. There's nothing you can do about it. God saves you unconditionally; He just calls you, predestinated you to be saved. And somebody's predestinated to be lost. The Bible said so: "Men of old, foreordained to this condemnation..." When... Esau and Jacob, both born from the same parent, before either child was born, said Romans 9, not knowing good from evil, God said... That the election might be sure, God said, "Esau have I hated, and Jacob have I loved," before either one of them done anything about it. See? See?

L-16 "No man can come to Me except the Father draws him." You said, "Oh, I sought God, I went seeking for Him." No, no, God sought for you, not you for God. Human nature proves that. When Adam sinned, he didn't start hunting God; he started hiding from God. And Jesus said, "No man can come to Me except the Father draws him." Then God drawed you first. How many in here, sinner or saint, has said this, "I have... know that God has spoke to me, trying to get me to come to His Son, Christ Jesus"? Let's see your hand. Just raise your hand, sinner or saint, don't matter who you are. 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min You mean there's only about one-third of this people that ever heard God speaking to you to become a Christian? I ought to change my text and preach the Gospel and call for a altar call. See? Sure. If it isn't... "No man can come to Me, except God, the Father, draws him," said Jesus. See? Now. "Then he that comes, I will in no wise cast out. He that comes, I will give him Everlasting Life."

L-17 Now, that's not just from one revival to another; that's Everlasting Life, forever, a imperishable. We are sowed with the incorruptible Seed of God which cannot perish. See? It's incorruptible; it can't perish. And how that God made His promise and how He brought His people. And Joseph down there when he died, he made mention of his bones, that they shouldn't bury him there. There--there's a little seed here. I'd like to drop it just for a moment, if you'll bear with me. Now, this is between the lines. You know the Bible is written, and scholars... As I heard a man on the radio this afternoon denying Divine healing, said, "Bring me a little baby over here, let me put a scratch on its arm. let these Divine healers come and make it well, them I will believe Divine healing." Oh, my. That man needs to be in the psychopathic ward. That's right. Well, that... I've got a child six years old would know better than that. But yet, there you are.

L-18 Why, certainly, that's the same spirit that said, when they put a rag around Jesus' eye and hit Him on the head, said, "Now, You're a Prophet, tell us who--who hit You." It's the same one that said to Him, hanging in the cross, said, "Now, if You be the Son of God, come down and we'll believe it." Jesus said, "I don't do nothing till the Father shows Me. And when the Father shows Me, that I do." Otherwise, He didn't clown for people. This is not a stage show, vaudeville act. It's the power of God unto salvation to those who believe. Now, but let them alone. Blind lead the blind, they'll fall in the ditch. Now, Jesus said, and the Scriptures declare that God has hid this Gospel from the eyes of the wise and prudent. So you'll never know it by theology. And will reveal it to babes such as will learn... Is that right? So just remember, it's hid from the smart people. You'll never know it. You don't know it by your theology, by education; you know it by faith, you believe it. And faith is something you can't see or know.

L-19 Look at this simple little thing now, one thing here. My back there, my little old cave at Green's Mill, how many times the Holy Spirit coming down revealing things, set there and cry. Something God making mention, hard to see... You can't see it with the natural eye. You can't look on it in the Word. Did you ever read... How many of you ever read a--a--a line from your wife? When I was in Africa, my wife would write me a letter; she would say, "Dear Husband: I am setting here tonight thinking of you." I love her. When I left home I didn't have to say, "Now, look, don't you have, don't you go with nobody else, I'm your husband. And--and don't you get out of here, and don't you do that." I don't have to do that. She loves me and I love her. And I say, "Good-bye, honey. Pray for me." I go on. She just knows that's--that's what she has... She just does it. So I--I do the same thing, because I love her. She loves me, so it's just a love affair. That's the same way it is with God. I just take His Word, and He just, we... That's all there is to it. No matter what. You see, see?

L-20 But when she writes me a letter, she might kind of hold a little back, refrain. And she'll say certain-certain things. But now, while she's talking, I--in the letter, I'm reading that letter, but I read between the lines too. I know what she's talking about. I can read between the lines. Now, there's a whole lot of that so in this great love story of the Bible. Read between the lines. There's the--there's the structure work. The Bible is the structure, but the Holy Spirit's building the building now. Certainly. It's got to frame together and look like this, and like that, and like that, but the Holy Spirit's putting it together.

L-21 Just as Solomon's temple was cut out all over the world, one block was cut this way and one cut that way. When they come together, every block went right to its place without a buzz of a saw, or a sound of a hammer. The great Church of the living God is borned again stones cut out. That's right. One of these days, persecution's going to set in a bunch of these cold, indifferent, ecclesiasticals will form themselves together with the confederation of church, and will run together, melt right together in one common thing. 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min Notice, now, like Job, when he was old. He was setting out there, and he said... His wife told him, said, "Job, why don't you curse God and die the death." Said, "You look miserable." Setting there on an ash heap, scraping himself with a piece of crock, scraping his boils, broke out all over, Satan had tempted him, had put boils all over him, killed his children, took everything he had. Some people might say, like they did then, "That man's a horrible sinner." But God was dealing with a saint, not with a sinner. So Job knew in his heart he hadn't sinned.

L-22 So then here come his church members, and set seven days with their backs turned to him. What consolation. "Days of miracles has passed, Job." But Job, he knew different. He was holding out. Then God sent Elihu down. Eli... We haven't time to go into those names: Eli, Elah...?... God representing, the representative of Christ come, and He didn't accuse Job of being a secret sinner, but He told Job... As Job noticed the trees dying, and things, and living again. He said, "A man layeth down and giveth up the ghost, yea, where is he? His sons come to mourn; he perceiveth not."

L-23 And Elihu says to him, in like so many words like this, "You see the flower never sinned. Corn and stuff, it reproduces for life here on earth, but there's coming a just One, Who will stand in the breach between man and God, and put His hand on a sinful man, and a holy God, and bridge the way. Then the man shall rise again." Then when Job noticed that, he raised up. Oh, I love this. Raised up, shook himself... The lightnings begin to flash, the thunders roar, a prophet got in the right line with God, something takes place. Stood up, said, "I know my Redeemer liveth. In the last days He will stand upon the earth, though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, mine eyes shall behold; and not another."

L-24 Notice, prophesying. Then let me drop a little between the line here for you just a moment. Them we'll close. I won't have time to get to the text. Notice, all right. When Job died, he specified his burial place, and was buried in Palestine. The oldest Book in the Bible is Job. Along came Abraham after the antediluvian destruction, and so forth, he come down out of Babylon, out of tower of Babel, down into Shinar. And there Abraham was give the promise. And then when Sarah died, Abraham's wife and sweetheart, he bought a port--parcel of ground... They wouldn't let him give it to him 'cause he wanted it to be sure.

L-25 All right, thinkers of the Scripture, get your mind working right now. Watch this. He bought a piece of ground in the same place where Job was buried, to bury his dead out of his sight. And Sarah was buried there. Abraham, when he died, he slept in the same tomb with Sarah. Abraham begot Isaac. When Isaac died, Isaac slept with Abraham. Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob died down in Egypt. But when he died, said, "Don't bury me down here. Take me back into Palestine and bury me." And he made Joseph put his hand on his hip, where he'd limped all of his life, or the biggest part of his life...

L-26 Look at him there at the river, a big, strong, healthy man, on this side running from God, on the other side a limping prince. Oh, my. How that he said, "Joseph, my son, put your hand on my hip, limping prince, and swear by God that you'll not bury me down here." I wonder why? Took him up in Palestine and buried him. Joseph, when he died, said, "Don't you bury me down here." Wonder why? Said, "Take my bones and bury them up in--up in the promised land, up in Palestine." Why? It's not written in the Word; it's between the lines. They were prophets. They knowed that, what was going to take place. Along came Jesus, the One that Job saw, his Redeemer. And they wanted to be buried the same way Job was, same place he was, same way he was. So then when Jesus came on Easter morning, when He rose from the tomb, the... Said, "Many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth, rose and come out of the grave and entered into the city and appeared to many": Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job. What was it? Look brother. They knowed there was no resurrection down in Egypt, the resurrection was in the promised land.

L-27 So that's when I say today. You can call me holy-roller if you want to, call me fanatic if you want to, but bury me in Jesus, for those who are in Jesus, God will bring with Him at the resurrection. Let them say what they want to. Let it call fanatics, anything, but those that are in Christ will God bring with Him. So it makes a difference. Sure it does. Put me amongst the fanatics then, for those that are in Christ... "Well, are they fanatics?" All that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Amen. Oh, then there they are. 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min God working with the children of Israel... When He got over there in the wilderness, bringing them out, they begin to murmur. How quickly they forgot all the signs that Moses had done, how they forgot that God told him, "Now, Moses, I'm sending you down there. I'm giving you two signs to perform, and when you do it, they're going to believe you." Moses said, "I can't speak very good, Lord."

L-28 He said, "Well, I will give you signs, and when you do these signs, they'll believe you." And he did the signs one time and all Israel followed. And what was with Moses? A Pillar of Fire. The... "I send My Angel before you, to keep you the way. Not only that, but I'm going to let Him be there so the people can see Him." Same Holy Spirit today, same Angel of God today, signs and wonders, just exactly the same, a separated people, called out, on the road to a promised land, John 14. "In My Father's House are many mansions. I will come and receive you." We're on our road.

L-29 Notice, and how quick they got--forgot the miracles just like the people do today when the trials come on. Then notice again, the waters begin to dry up in the deserts, and they couldn't find nothing to drink. And how quick the carnal mind would pick this up. God told Moses, "Go, speak to the rock." "Speak to the rock? Why that's the driest place of all the dry places." See? How foolish the carnal mind would think. "Speak to the rock? Why, that's the driest thing. That rock laying there is drier than all the rest of the desert. And if we've been everywhere and can't find water, what do you mean, that we get water out of that rock?"

L-30 That's the way they think. They say, "Well, that bunch of fanatics. If God is going to do anything, He..." Driest place, it looks. But God did it anyhow. And he spake to the rock, and the rock brought its waters; saved the perishing people. And today, that Rock is Christ Jesus that was smitten for you. Speak to Him. Maybe you've been everywhere, maybe you tried everything. But tonight, speak to the Rock. It'll bring forth it's waters for salvation, for healing, for all that you have need of. You believe this? May the Lord add His blessing to you, while we bow our heads in a moment of prayer, while Sister Reed, or some of them will come to the piano, or the organ, rather.

L-31 Oh, my, tonight, if we were looking to see Jesus... You know that old song, "I Want To See Jesus, Don't You?" Well, now, He's with us. What will it be when we see Him? He said, "A little while and the world will see Me know more, but yet, you'll see Me. I will be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." How wonderful. Now, have faith. Believe with all your heart. Now, if He's here tonight, His Spirit will be working with His people. "I will be with you." The Bible said, "When the Holy Ghost is come, He will bring these things to your memory that I have taught, and will show you things to come." That's the work of the Holy Spirit. Now, He's here.

L-32 And now someday, the Jesus that's working through these poor little dim lights that we are, as a little lamp-light up side of a big million watt light He would be... But these little lights, let's let them show to the world as His power is working through us, someday He will come in a visible body form. We shall see Him then. Father, needy people setting here, needy of God, needy of salvation, needy of the Holy Spirit, needy in their bodies. Thy Word is Truth, O Lord. Now, the Word without the Spirit is dead. But germatize that Word with the Spirit tonight, and may it bring forth a hundredfold.

L-33 If You were standing there tonight, You would say to us, "I can do nothing except My Father will show Me." You know what these people are thinking about out there. The Bible said You perceived their thoughts. You know where there was a fish at, had a coin in his mouth. Certainly, the Father told You, when You got up there, to have Peter go down and catch a fish. You just told him. For You said Yourself, Lord, that You didn't do nothing till the Father showed You. "When the Father shows Me, then I work hitherto." How simple. How the unbelievers rose up in that day, and said, "Let Him do this. And let Him heal all them at Bethesda, let Him do this or that and we will believe Him. Come down off the cross. Tell us who hit You on the head." No. You only done what the Father told You. And You said, "The things that I do, You will also. And if they called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call you. But blessed are you when you are persecuted for righteousness." 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min Bless this little church tonight. You--you knew the woman's sins; You know different things. You knowed where there was some mules hitched one day, where two ways met.

L-34 And I pray, God, tonight that You'll come in Your power, and may the Son of God come in the Holy Spirit form and anoint everyone here. And may the Holy Spirit anoint Your servant, Lord, that the power and the Word of God might be fulfilled. When we see You walking on the shores of Galilee, and through the city streets, You could only do as the Father said do. And may we work the will of God tonight, by doing what the Father says do. Bless the people everywhere; heal the sick. For we ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

L-35 U 1 to 100? The boy give out prayer cards this afternoon in the building here. And he give them out to people, U 1 to 100. We're certainly squeezed for room tonight, but let's see if we could have about--about fifteen of those. We've been taking about fifteen at a time. See if we'd have about fifteen of them stand up here. Start with 50. U-50 to... That would be 50 and 10, 60... 65. From U-50 to U-65, stand first. Now, turn the card over. Look at your neighbor's card, if he's got one, 'cause he might be deaf and can't hear. You'd have to bring him up to the platform, if he's holding those cards. And if he's laying on a cot, stretcher somewhere, why you just look at it, then when his card number is called, you just come, wave your hand like that, one of the ushers. And then when his number is called, I will ask the Father here to speak to the person out there.

L-36 And now, line up here to my right, if you will. U-1... I imagine you are scattered all through the building 'cause they're just... U-50, who's got U-50, U-50? All right. U-51, 52, 53, 54, 55, on up to about 60 or 65. Let them stand first, if you will. Right up here to the right, if you will, for the prayer line. Now, how many here is sick and needy and wants to be prayed for, and does not have a prayer card, wants to be prayed for, raise your hands like this, all over the building? It's a solid mass, everywhere.

L-37 Well now, look and listen to me now. Your faith, I challenge in the Name of the Lord Jesus. You look this way and believe that story that I've told is the truth, and see if the heavenly Father doesn't re--speak right our through the audience and get you. Every person in here can be healed tonight. There's no need of... If you could only understand. I... Brother Reed and them speaks about how to receive healing, I suppose, and things, before I get here, and the great fundamentals of Divine healing. Now, this is... our con... Our group is broke up. Brother Bosworth's in Durban, South Africa, getting ready for the meeting. He's setting the inter... the national committee together. We was there a few months ago and had thirty thousand converts in one altar call: Durban, South Africa. Then we're going to India, Baron Von Blomberg, a baron of Germany, which is one of our managers, leaves the fifteenth to go to make a dinner with Nehru in India. I have a little dinner with Nehru, then we come back to have a dinner with the king of Trans-Jordan. And we go into the Mohammedans.

L-38 Then to the Palestine, to the Jew... Oh, I just have a vision here; it's wrote out. God's going to give thousand of souls to His Son during that time. Will you pray for me? And remember, at the great day of the judgment, your prayers will be counted just as much in that revival, as my efforts would be to go bring them. We're co-workers together in Christ Jesus. Is that right? Your prayers... Remember Dwight Moody, what he said when he was converted down there? That little old wash woman been praying for him. Who got the credit? The wash woman. She was the one led Moody to Christ. John Smith, Calvin, Knox, many of the great reformers, was all come by prayer.

L-39 Now, while they're getting the lines lined up, wonder if we could stand just for a moment, kind of a change of posture, and just sing: "Only Believe," with me, will you? Let's sing now, everybody together now. Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. Now, let's sing it like this, with our hands up. How many believe that Jesus, the Son of the living God, has promised to be with His Church, even in His Church, to the end of the world? Well, if He's here tonight, as He promised, as has 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min been scientifically proven, also not only that, but in the meeting He will do just what He did back there. Is that right?

L-40 Now, He said, Saint John 5, that He couldn't do nothing. They was questioning Him, I suppose, about why He didn't heal all those people, see Him pass through the pool of Bethesda. I was noticing them checking the prayer cards here of these twisted and afflicted laying here. Don't be weary. Now, if a--some unbeliever come by and say, "Heal that man that's crippled up, twisted up, then I will believe it." Look at Jesus going through the pool of Bethesda where the lame, halt, blind and withered was laying: never healed a one of them, walked right by every one of them, full of love and virtue. Is that right? And walked over to a man laying on a pallet, and said... For Jesus knew he was laying there, the Father had showed Him. And He healed that man, went away.

L-41 And the Jews questioned Him. He said, "I can do nothing except the Father shows Me. And whatever the Father shows Me, that I do?" Is that right? Now, He's the same Jesus tonight. Is that right? Now, let's believe it and raise up our hands and sing: Now, I Believe. Come on now. Now, I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe; Now, I believe, now I believe, All things are possible, now I believe.

L-42 Our heavenly Father, send Your Spirit tonight and bless us together as we wait on Thee for the farther part of the service. In the beloved Name of Jesus, Thy Son, we ask it. Amen. Of course anyone is aware now. I want you to understand this, that your brother here, doesn't claim to be a healer. I am no healer; no other man's a healer. God is the Healer. Jesus didn't claim to be a healer. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works, it's My Father dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." See? So if He didn't claim to be a Divine healer, why should I or any other man? We're not. We cast... If you're honest, you're not. There's nothing in me or any other man could heal you. Has to come from God.

L-43 The only thing, we--we have gifts that we can point to God for what He's already done for you. He saved every sinner in here now. He saved you nineteen hundred years ago. If you'll accept it tonight, you'll have pardoning and grace. He healed you nineteen hundred years ago when He was striped on His back. If you'll accept it, you'll have healing. The only thing we can do is preach or have a vindication of His Presence by Divine gifts. May the Lord grant the blessings. Now, I wish that you would be just as reverent as you can for a few moments. I don't blame you from rejoicing, but in this kind, it's a very solemn affair. So just be as reverent as you can. Be in prayer. You can watch me, but be in prayer, 'less I tell you to put your head down, then when you do, if something takes place... Sometimes, like epilepsy, it's very hard to deal with. And the thing will just carry on. Sometimes it throws the patient into spells, and I've just seen everything take place. Now, when I ask you to do that, then you keep your head bowed, and just keep in prayer. Surely, Christians know how to hold onto God in that hour. All right.

L-44 Now, let's see, are you... Line's ready, all right. Now, to him that's operating this tape... As the meetings go on each night, the anointing begins to get very deep, if you understand. You break into another dimension. See? Sometimes I don't know how loud I'm talking. Just imagine standing here now, talking, and something that happened back yonder forty years ago, and in spirit I'm back there with them, where that's a happening. And knowing I'm talking, don't know where my voice is... I know I'm supposed to be here in this tabernacle, or will... I am here, but yet out yonder somewhere. You don't know what a feeling it gives. It's no wonder Daniel said he was troubled at his head, and different things taken place. See, just like...

L-45 How many in here ever dreamed a dream? Now, you couldn't dream a dream. I tell you, "Dream me a dream; you couldn't do it." Now, that's your subconscious. Now, an ordinary person dreams, for his subconscious is about that far from him. When this conscious becomes inactive, this one takes--sets up. And how many remembers things you dreamed years ago? What caused you to remember it? You were somewhere in some kind of a condition, wasn't you, 'cause you still remember it when this conscious becomes active? 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min Well now, some people doesn't dream at all. Their subconscious would be way back, like to that wall. Now, a person... You can't make yourself what you are. I believe that gifts and callings are without repentance. God gives them sovereignly as He will. God... You couldn't come to God 'less God called you. It's God Who calls you, God Who gives you, God Who puts you in a church, God Who does everything, that in Him rests all in all. That's Scriptural as it can be. And you know that's right.

L-46 But now, look. A seer, his subconscious is not back there, neither is it here. It's right here. You don't go to sleep; you just break from one into the other: one into the other. And when you just let it alone, it comes at it's own leisure. This is... But here it's just like raising up looking through a knot hole to see something. You're praying. You're taking up a parable, which is words that God gave me alone to know. And it keep just repeating, then you break and you see the person as you're contacting them, they catch their spirit. It goes to them. Then you just see something happen, maybe it'll close off. Maybe you'll look again, you'll see something else that'll close on. But when God gives it just at His leisure, He just, looks like, raises you up over the fence, and lets you see the whole thing, what's all about it. Now, be in prayer. Now, I want to talk to the woman, and everyone be real reverent now. You watch me. Don't get too tired or weak...?..."

L-47 Now, up here, you people up here, this is the first time in years that I've ever tried to work with people sitting behind me. See, you are spirits too. Did you know that? You are... Every person in here is a spirit and a natural. So your spirit, you're actually looking this way, and you feel it this way, you feel it this way, you feel it this way, and feel it this way. How many has been in our big meetings, out somewhere else where we have big meetings? You know we don't have that, do we? No. There's no one around the platform, no one at all, just myself. Maybe the manager or somebody, ushers helping them up the platform, or something. But there's nobody there. I catch that person individually.

L-48 Now, here, maybe I would be talking to this woman, maybe somebody with real high faith out here rise, it'll throw a vision before me here. And I'm talking to this woman, yet it means that woman over there. But so far, in all the time, God has never failed to let me be straightened out on it. So I--I believe He will... He's never failed. It's never failed one time since I been born, not one time. I ask anybody to look that up. And not one thing has It ever predicted but what come just exactly the way It does. Now, because the people are prayed for here, that don't mean they are healed. No, no. When you hear that Spirit moving, say THUS SAITH THE LORD, then--then you watch what He says. I just pray for the person. It's just something to stimulate their faith. But you watch, I've noticed...

L-49 And my boys told me, and Mr. Ryan and them, that several times on the platform It spoke directly to the person and told them just what was going to happen. When It does that, you mark that down or get it off the tape in there, watch what happens. I will put my life to it; it'll be just exactly what It says. But when He say it, here It say, "It's THUS SAITH THE LORD." If I'm just praying, I'm just praying like I pray for you, or someone, or any person's out there, where it would take place. Now, I want you all be in... just... You don't have to bow your head, but just--just keep reverent, and keep praying if you will. Now, little lady, I wish you'd stand around this way, if you will, sister. No. Like here, just stand right like this and look right at me. That's it. Now, I'd like for you do that, 'cause it kind of gives more of an opening that way than it does back here.

L-50 Now, I suppose that you and I are strangers. I don't remember you. What is your name? [Sister says, "Myrtle Swaller."--Ed.] Slaughter. ["Swaller."] Swaller. Well, I'm glad to meet you, sister. And I--I trust that God will do something for you tonight, that will help you. I don't know why you're up here, I don't know nothing about you, I never seen you in my life. But God knows you, doesn't He? He knows you. You're conscious that something is going on now (See?), but that's not nothing to hurt you. Now, if you'll watch the patient, a real sincere patient... Quickly. Now, this woman is a believer. See? The Spirit's 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min already caught me, and It caught her too. Now, I don't know her, but you... Let's see if this is the true. You are aware that something is going on. Isn't that right, sister? Now, if that is, raise up your hand so... That's right.

L-51 Now, the Angel of the Lord, which you see on this picture, is right here now. Now, just be real reverent. Now, we'll see what He says. Now, He has to use a human voice. See? He uses human eyes. Now, if He... That light there, that--that bulb would say to that window glass out there, "Look here what I can do. I can light up at nighttime." No, it can't. It's the current that lights it up. It was made a light bulb, but that window gives light also from the sun. See? So neither one of them can say, "Look what I am." It's the light that shines through them. See? So no one can say, "Who am I." It's Who is He (See?) He, the lovely One? Well, now, sister, I wanted just to talk with you just a little bit, you being the first patient. And I--I guess you think that I dread that, but I--I don't. See? It's just the anointing of the Spirit catching you away first. You see what I mean? But you know that He's close and near, and it's His Presence--it's His Presence that does these things. And then He's the only One Who can help you or I, either one.

L-52 But now you, as a Christian sister, and me as your Christian brother, and God, as our Father, Who looks over both of us. Now, He knows you. He knows me. I don't know you, nor you don't know me, but He knows us both. Now, there's something wrong with you, and He's sent me to help you to believe in Him. See? Now, that's--that's... Now, if He will do that, will you accept Him? All right. I just want to... I--I'm doing this for a cause, lady. Yes, ma'am. Now, you are... You have--have been sick for some time, I know that, 'cause I see a long dark streak moving from you now. Yes, you've been very... You have heart trouble. You have a leaking of the heart. Isn't that right? The doctors hasn't even give you hope. They say you can't live but a little while. Is that right, I got... They told you that. Is that true now? I see kind of a heavy-looking fellow talking there, speaking. It left me. That was a vision. You're...

L-53 There's something else that you're trying--you got on your mind. You're thinking about somebody, something that... Oh, yes, you got some friends here tonight too, that you wanted to see get healed. Isn't that right? You have a--a lady friend that you're... No, it's--it's her husband that you're concerned about. And the man's--the man's had a stroke or something, isn't that right? And isn't he a minister, a preacher? He's had a stroke. And you're--you been... You've been worried about them, thinking on it. That's the man laying right there. Aren't you a minister, sir? His faith was pulling, that how I could tell. You--you was looking down at him; that's probably how I caught that. Well, let's pray.

L-54 Lord Jesus, bless them all. Thou knowest all things. Then may the woman be healed, may the minister get well, Lord. Bless Your servant there; heal his body. Let him come out of the stroke and preach the Gospel again from the platform, for the glory of God, in Jesus' Name. Amen. As you go down, lay your hand upon the minister, as you go down. Let's say, "Thanks be to God." [Congregation says, "Thanks be to God."--Ed.] My reverend brother, that's right, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, may God heal the man. Does he... He doesn't have a prayer card, does he? He has one. He don't have... That's okay. All right, all right.

L-55 Now, every one reverent, please now, and be in prayer. You believe the Holy Spirit is here? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] [Blank.spot.on.tape]...?... you got--it's liver trouble. And it's bothering one of your lungs also. The--the--the doctors don't know what's the matter with you. Your doctor told you he didn't know what was wrong with you. Isn't that right? Right there in the room that day. You know when I'm talking; you were standing there. And didn't they move the gallbladder? I see them taking something out of the place. Isn't that right? Amen. Well, God knows what's wrong with you. You believe if I ask Him He will let you get well? Come here, sister. Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Bless this child that comes, Lord, humbly. I pray that You'll heal her. May she go out of this building tonight, happy, rejoicing. Cursed be this disease of her body, and may it go from her in Jesus Christ's Name, I ask it for the glory and praises of God. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go, rejoicing, and may He be with you. Have faith in God.

L-56 Now, just a moment. There's another person ready for a operation right here. It's a--it's a young lady. She's got 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min varicose veins in her legs, I believe, and she's ready for an operation. God bless you, young lady. Is that true? Have faith in God. Would you stand up again just a moment? Isn't those veins on your limb between here and there, varicose veins? I... You're... It's serious. You accept your healing now of Jesus Christ? Why would He show me you, and you setting way back in that audience there if it wasn't? Have faith in God. The same God Who knew where a fish was that had a coin in his mouth, knew where you were setting. God bless you, young lady. May you get well and serve God all your days. Bless God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength, and God shall bring it to pass.

L-57 How do you do, sir? Do you believe me to be God's prophet? Our Lord is the same yesterday, today, and forever, sir. He's always full of mercy and full of compassion for those who will believe on His Name. And I trust that you do that, sir. What is your name, sir? Chapman, Mr. Chapman. I'm glad to meet you, and may the Lord bless you. Yes, sir. You're a very sick man. You have a--a rare blood disease. Isn't that right? It's--it's tumorous condition of the cells in the blood, I believe, if I understood in the vision what the doctor said. Isn't that right?

L-58 And also, my friend, you need Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour. Isn't that right? You're a sinner. Will you accept Him now? No, you've tried several times, but you just haven't got to that place where you're... Will you accept Him now? If you will, raise your hand. Almighty God, Author of Life, Giver of every gift, send Thy blessings upon the man. Heal him, Lord. Don't let him die...?... Let him go, Lord, and be healed and full of the Holy Ghost. May It come upon him, and may he be a saved man to save others from a life of sin. Grant it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's Name, I ask it. Amen.

L-59 If God, Who knew your heart, my brother, knows all about you, go in peace now, and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and be made well. God bless you. You keep praying, don't you, lady? You have to catarrh of the head, don't you lady. Isn't that right? All right, stand up and accept your healing now in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. Some kind of a running that comes from your head, the doctor told you catarrh. Have faith now, and it'll go away from you. You believing out there, all of you?

L-60 That lady setting way back there at the end of that row, would you like to get over that--that asthma, sister? Like to get over that asthma condition, setting back there? If you do, you could raise up. And God bless you. Go home now, and be well. I meant the lady back in the corner. That's right. If you want to accept it the same way, the Lord bless you. How do you do, lady? You believe? Now, as those people out in the audience there, but we're standing side by side. You believe that His Presence is here? Do you believe the Holy Spirit is here at the platform? If it is, and I be God's prophet, your life you couldn't hide. If there's anything wrong with you, God will let me know. But if you're here just as a deceiver, God will let me know. But you're not here... You're a Christian. And you got tumors. Them tumors is in your side. Is that right? You seem to have a sad heart about something. Yes, there's someone else you're interested in. Isn't that a little boy, little child about seven or eight years old? And he has rheumatic fever. Is that right? Come here.

L-61 God, bless this woman and her little boy, and may they both be made well as I bless them. May they go in the Name of the Lord Jesus and be made well, for the glory of God. God bless you. Now, you're whole. God has completely healed you...?... Have faith in God. You want to get over that asthma setting back there, lady, with that little checkered dress on here in front, looking at me like that?

L-62 If you want to get over it, you may, if you want to accept your healing, the lady next to you there. You have an asthmatic condition, don't you? Just raise up and say, "I accept my healing in the Name of the Lord Jesus." God bless you now. Go home and get well. Mister, you have heart trouble, setting right there, don't you? You been praying. You was setting there praying for me to call you next, wasn't you? God revealed your prayer to me. Stand up and accept your healing, my brother. I challenge anybody to pray and believe it. Have faith in God. 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min

L-63 A fellow setting there at the end of the row there, setting there suffering with arthritis, setting right out there. Fellow there, setting next to him has high blood pressure. That right? Rise and be healed in the Name of the Lord Jesus, accept your healing. God bless you, lady. That lady setting right back there with anemia, the anemia condition, setting right there. Raise up, sister, the Lord makes you well now. And you can go home and be made well. Have faith in God. Way back in the audience, pray. All spirits now is subject to me through Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit takes over every spirit in here: nothing can be hid.

L-64 Bring the lady. How do you do, lady? Are you well aware that you're standing in His Presence? You got a--some kind of a female disorder. It's a cancer. And that cancer's on the womb. Isn't that right? I see, looks like a table; you're walking away from a table, refusing food. You got a stomach trouble. Is that right? Do you believe if I will ask it... You believe I'm a believer? Well, He said, "If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." You believe that? Come here then. O God, laying hands on the woman in the Name of Jesus, may she go be healed. Amen. God bless you, lady...?... Don't doubt. Believe with all your soul that's with--within you. How do you do? You want to get over the heart trouble? Accept your healing then, and go on out rejoicing, saying, "Thank You, Lord Jesus," and be made well.

L-65 All right. Come, lady. Have faith now. If this audience could only see... Look here, lady. You believe me to be His prophet? You believe if God would tell me what was wrong with you, you'd have faith enough in Him then to know that He's standing here, and I've told the truth. And He has already healed you. You believe that, don't you? You've been suffering with a stomach trouble, haven't you? Now, go eat what you want to, if you believe. God bless you. Have faith. Have faith in God.

L-66 How do you do? Do you believe? You want to get over the heart trouble, be made well? All right, then go and believe God. I will lay hands upon you in the Name of my Lord Jesus Christ, that you be healed. God bless you. Have faith. Don't doubt nothing. All things are possible to them that believe. Seemingly, the Angel of the Lord has stopped right... Oh, it's that lady setting there, lady with heart trouble. You want to be made well, lady? All right. God bless you. I thought it was a little girl, but It was hanging to the lady. You have high blood pressure, don't you, sir, setting right back behind her there. Your wife has a trouble with her breathing. Looks like her breathing doesn't come and go right. Isn't that true? All right. You want to accept your healing? Then stand up and be made well, the both of you. What you need is faith.

L-67 Looks like I see some colored people standing back there. How many of you is there back there? How many? About three? Stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ died for you. Look this way. You believe me to be His prophet? I can't heal you, but Jesus Christ has healed you when He died at Calvary. Do you believe if God will reveal to me what you are, and who you are, and where you are, something about you, that you'll accept your healing? The man to the left doesn't have nothing, hardly, wrong with him. He's a pretty healthy man. The one in the middle has heart trouble. Or, no, he's blind; that man's blind. And this man... woman next to him has heart trouble. Is that right? If that's right, raise up your hands. Then the rest of... Then go home and be made well in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Have faith.

L-68 Come, lady. [Brother Branham prays for some children away from microphone--Ed.] Lord Jesus, I bless just bless this child. And may he go home and be altogether well. I pray Thee for Christ's...?... Bless His Name. If you go believing, you're...?... God make you well. If there's anything I could do to help the little thing... You just have now; God's going to make you well. Go on and just--you just keep believing and pray. All right. Come, my little boy, you want...? Bless his little heart. He's got heart trouble. God, be merciful to this dear little boy. May Your Spirit come upon him now, and may he be made completely whole, I pray in Jesus Christ's Name. 53-0512, Speak To The Rock, Bible Hour Tabernacle, Jonesboro, AR, 79 min

L-69 God bless you, honey. You're going to get well now, aren't you? You love Jesus? God bless your little heart, honey. Very sweet little boy. Now, you go and love the Lord; you're going to get all right. Don't worry, parent of the child, the baby will be all right. God accepted his little faith, and he's going... Oh, how wonderful. The Lord Jesus is here to make every one of you whole. You believe it? Dad, of course, to see, you're on a cane. Anyone can see that, that you're on a cane. But I--I can't make you whole, but God can make you whole. You believe, brother? You accept your healing? Well, just go say, "Thank You, Lord, You healed me." Go now. God bless you.

L-70 Come, sister. Poor old mother, do you believe, mother? If I wouldn't even tell you what was wrong with you, you'd still believe anyhow, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? Well, go eat what you want to now, if you want to. Your stomach troubles has left you. God bless you. Have faith in God. Come, lady. You want to get over that heart trouble? Go, say, "Thank You, Lord, for healing me today." What about you, lady? Do you believe? Tuberculous. But go believe and you'll get well. Just a minute. Something screamed from the audience. Just a minute, lady. You've had this quite awhile, have you, on to the place you just...?... A life of sorrow. They've done all they can do. It's retarded, yet you want to be well, don't you? The Lord Jesus bless you now. Go, and be made well. May the Lord be with you.

L-71 You believe, sir? Your trouble's in your--up in here, like a--a sinus or something. Isn't that right? Say, aren't you a minister of the Gospel? I seen a pulpit come before us. Go, brother, and be made well in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Sir, laying here on a cot, you suffer with TB, too don't you? Isn't that right? When that woman was healed awhile ago, God touched your body. Won't you stand up from there, and go on home and get well. Do you believe? Well, then stand up, go out of the building. If you have faith, and believe you can go stand up, then go home and be made well. If you don't, that's your chance; you'll never go.

L-72 Do you believe, in this building, all of you just now? The Lord Jesus Christ is here to make well, make whole, to heal every person in Divine Presence. If you do, I want you to do something for me. I want you to look this a way now, put your hands over on one another just a moment. All the sick and the needy, lay your hands on each other. I tell you; you might not want to believe me, but there's dozens of you healed right now. I seen Him. Something happened. You're anointed with the Holy Spirit now, and the gift of God is in the building. O God, Thou Who can make evil spirits leave, have mercy upon this audience of people tonight. Send Thy Holy Spirit, rebuke every foul, unbelieving spirit. May the devil leave every one of these sick people. Come out of them, Satan. Make them well, Lord Jesus. Stand to your feet. Raise up and accept your healing, everywhere over the building. Give God praise, give Him honor and power. Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
