--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 ... Brother Wood, just a few moments ago, he was somewhere, I believe, when I come in over there, or somewhere: Mr. and Mrs. Wood, the one that sells the books and pictures. As far as I know, that's the only people in here besides my own campaign manager and them, I know in the building. But do you know, Jesus Christ knows every one of you? He knows all that you've ever done in your life. And He could make known to me, if He so desired, something that would help you. And I pray that He will. I have been preaching a few nights, and it's... The anointing of the Angel of the Lord is kinda strange is--you're helpless without Him. And I... But He is here now, and I believe that His mercies be upon all of you, is my prayer.

L-2 Now, is this the patient? Now, to you who are in the prayer line that's coming, in order to help you, I'm your brother. I can't heal you; God has already did that; when Jesus died at Calvary He healed you. And to you people along there in the wheelchairs, have faith in God. A few nights ago, there stood a--a colored lady setting there, bound with multiple sclerosis. And a vision struck over in a corner, asked her, rise to her feet; she rose up, went out walking. He can do the same for you. Have faith; believe. Don't disbelieve; believe that God is going to do it for you. If He tells me, I'll tell you. Just start praying, anywhere. How many in here does not have a prayer card and wants to be prayed for, let's see your hands: anywhere in the building, you don't have a prayer card? That's... Thank you. Just get a general idea. Now, you just look this a way and believe with all your heart; Jesus Christ will do the rest. May the Lord bless you.

L-3 Now, sir, and to the prayer line here, if you really don't believe this with all your heart, don't stand in this prayer line; for be it assured unto you, that if you'd come up here disbelieving or leave disbelieving, the Bible said, "Go ye and sin no more (or disbelieve no more) or a worse thing come upon you." So have faith. You're strangers. Is every one in this prayer line a stranger to me? If you are raise up your hand, every one that can hear, in the prayer line? All strangers. I want the audience to be just as reverent and keep seated if you will.

L-4 Now, sir, being the first person up here tonight, I want to talk to you just as Jesus of Nazareth talked to the woman at the well. You just raised your hand that we were strangers to each other. We've never met in life. But God knows both of us, doesn't He? Now, the reason I'm talking to you for a moment, it's for a purpose. And that's to catch the anointing of the Spirit of God on you. And maybe just like our Master talked to the woman at the well, and that's what my conversation is... When He comes to us, then you just be reverent and quiet. See what He says. And I, being a stranger to you and don't know you, then if God will let me know your trouble or whatever you--what, something about you that's a secret, or whatever it is, something that you know that I do not know, then will you believe Him for you--whatever you've come for? 'Course, I don't know what you're here for. You may be here for financial troubles. You may be here for domestic troubles. You may be sick. God knows. But the thing you--it's... You--you're a believer; your spirit is welcome. See? And I know that you are a believer. And you're aware that something's going on now. Now, that's what you see on that picture. Now, that the audience might know, sir, just the last few seconds, something has been moving on you. If that's right, raise up your hand. See? It's just settling down between you and I. It becomes like a fog. I'm looking through it. And I keep seeing somebody else, 'cause it's somebody you're here for. And it's a--it's a man. And the man is a relative of yours. And he--he has a--a lung trouble. And he is not in this city. He's from a city where there's mountain. It's--it's San Bernardino. He's a relative of yours, in so much that he is a brother-in-law to you. And I see it's something strange; it's smoke or fight. It's a battle. You are a soldier or have been a soldier. And you--you've been--you've been hurt. And it--it hit in your... It's something hurt your left arm at the wrist. That is right. Your request is granted by God. You can return and make...?... in the Name of Jesus Christ.

L-5 Have faith. Don't doubt. Believe for the glory of God. Now, every one be reverent, please. Just be real reverent. 54-0812, Prayer Line, Shriner Temple, Los Angeles, CA, 24 min Lady, I would like to talk to you just a moment. We are strangers to each other, are we? But there's one day that you and I are going to meet in His Presence, and we're going to give an account for our life. You believe that? We're going to have to. Yes, you're awfully nervous, extremely nervous. 'Course, seeing you wear glasses, I'm not going to speak of that. But you got... Your trouble is... You been to a doctor, and it's something that's in the side and in your back. And you're up for an operation. But the greatest need you have tonight is Jesus Christ for your Saviour, 'cause you're not a Christian. You're a sinner; it's black all around you. I am happy that you come tonight, because you'd probably died under your operation. Do you accept Jesus now as your personal Saviour? You promise from this time on that you'll never go back and sin no more, that you'll serve Him and go and live for Him the rest of your... Do you accept Him now as your Saviour? Your sins are forgiven. God be merciful to you. You go and the peace of God be upon you; in Jesus Christ's Name.

L-6 Now, stop that criticizing that. I never forgive the woman's sins; I said, "She was forgiven." She accepted Christ. Just have faith. Believe with all your heart. The Lord Jesus Christ will bless you. Every person in here ought to believe right now for whatever thing you have need of. You ought to be a believer right now. The lovely Lord Jesus, the--the Son of God, standing with His arms stretched out over this building to bless and to give peace. I know many of you thought these Pentecostal people were wrong. They've been wrong in a many a thing, but they're right in a lot of things. You failed to see that Sacrifice before them. You failed to see the phenomenal of God working among them. They're going to deeper depths and higher heights. God will take her up someday. Have faith.

L-7 Howdy do? We are strangers to each other. You're packing a book in your hand that contains eternal life to every believer. And you are a believer, has accepted Christ, you have eternal life, born again of the Spirit. Now, your trouble is you're--you're real--you're real extremely nervous, have been recently. And you're having a--a bowel trouble in the bowels. And you just come from--it's a clinic, a TB clinic. You've gotten real weak. You just had a fall; you sprained both ankles. But Christ has healed you. Your faith has saved you. In the Name of the Lord Jesus, go and be whole for glory of God. Amen. God bless you. Have faith. Believe with all your heart. Believe that these things to be of God? Depends on what you think about it. If you believe it to be the Lord Jesus, what--exactly what He said He would do... "The same things that I do," He said. You say, "He did it?" Sure. He looked out into His audience, perceiving their thoughts, told them different things. Is that right? The Scripture. It reads that way in the blessed Bible, and that's what we know that our Lord has raised from the dead, and He's visited His people to call the Gentiles out, just before He calls the Jews and rejects the Gentile church. Amen. That were inspiration. Flee to Christ as quick as you can. Don't be double minded. Throw your whole life to Him and believe Him with all your heart.

L-8 Howdy do? Suppose, sister... I called you 'sister' because you are my sister; you're a Christian, filled with the Holy Spirit. Then you're here... How would I know that? You're just a woman walked up here. See? But the Holy Spirit let's me know that your spirit feels welcome to me, that you're here. You're in serious trouble too, sister. The doctor told you you must have an operation right away. That was the--in the female glands where the examination was. That's right. You're with someone else, aren't you? You come here in a delegation. And you come from away from here. You don't belong in this country. You're from a country where it's all green and lot of woods and--and evergreens and a lot of myrtle trees. And--and you live in a city that sets on side of a hill like this. And the main road comes up through this way, and as you go out, going towards the west, you go up a hill. And there's a park on the right hand side: it's Ashburn, Oregon. You're going back to be well. Jesus Christ makes you well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I bless my sister. Go rejoicing, my sister.

L-9 Have faith in God. Don't doubt. Come, lady. Howdy do? You believe me to be His servant? The reason I say that, He said, "If you get the people to believe you..." We are strangers to each other, are we, lady? We do not know each other. But your examination proved that you had a heart trouble. And you got a gland trouble. One works against the other. Isn't that right? You believe Him now for your healing? You do. If I talk to you a little while, you believe He would--He could reveal other things just the same as that? Would you talk to me just a moment? You're fixing to take a trip. You're going to leave the city tonight or tomorrow, one. You're going to another city, and that city sets on the 54-0812, Prayer Line, Shriner Temple, Los Angeles, CA, 24 min seacoast. And it's got hills behind it; the Golden Gate Bridge crosses this way. It's San Francisco. That is right. You're a minister's wife. Your husband is an evangelist, and he's sick. He just had to leave the field from a nervous kind of a condition, breaking down. Reverend, you can go back home, both of you well now. Stand up on your feet. Jesus Christ healed you both. God bless you.

L-10 Stand close. Stand close. A man praying for his wife, both of them together. Only believe, friend. Have faith in the God of heaven. He can do all things. If I'd say to that lady... You're a cripple, setting in a chair, that little girl there. You're a crippled setting in a chair. Sure, you see that. That is no mystery. But look at this young man standing here, just a child. What's wrong with him? That's a mystery. See? That's it. What's wrong with the child? He looks healthy. No mystery there. There's a lady setting before me, a colored lady with dark glasses on. I'd say, "Something's wrong with your eye." Sure. That's right. Howdy do, young man? Do you believe the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God? You believe for--that I am His servant? You believe that? That's a great big thing for you to answer, isn't it, son? It's a hard thing, because you're a Catholic. You're suffering with asthma, aren't you, son? Now, do you believe me? Now you do. That made a believer out of you, doesn't it? You come here with a neighbor lady, didn't you? That's her, setting right over there with that yellow dress on, isn't it? Mother, you've got a daughter that's suffering with a nervous breakdown. That's right, isn't it? Stand up. You're going to find her well. Sonny, return home. Jesus Christ healed you of the asthma. I bless the boy; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Don't cry, mother. Jesus bless you...?...

L-11 What you thinking about, lady, setting right there beh--crying behind the lady? You believe with all your heart? Just weeping so... There's something struck you, didn't it? The lady with the elderly lady, setting right behind the lady with very... You believe me to be God's prophet, His servant? You do? Well, I'm going to tell you then: your faith healed you from that liver trouble you had. That's your neighbor setting next to you there. You all chum together. She's got a goiter. Put your hand over on her. Let's ask God to make her well. Lord, I pray that in Jesus' Name that you'll heal the woman and make her well for Your glory; through Jesus Christ the Son of God. Amen. Have faith in God.

L-12 You understand English, the Spanish woman setting there with a hernia? Yes. You were praying, wasn't you? You got a hernia; you want to be healed of it, don't you? Yes, ma'am. Your lady friend setting next to you has high blood pressure too, doesn't she? Now, stand up onto your feet, both of you. Put your arms over on each other. Lord Jesus, make them well. And may Thy Spirit come upon them now. You're the One Who does these things. Their faith has touched Your garment. May You heal them, through Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Your faith bless you. God be with you, make you well. Now, there He is standing by the lady, the colored lady, setting right back here beside that white lady with the--with the little jacket on. You got arthritis, haven't you, lady, the elderly lady setting there? That's right, you, you that's turning around, you're the one's that got the arth... Yes, sir. You got arthritis, haven't you? Raise your hand if that isn't so. You did have it; you don't have it now. Your faith has healed you. God bless you. The elderly lady set there by that post, you got heart trouble, haven't you, lady? You believe God healed you? Raise up your hand and say, "I accept Him as my Healer." Hallelujah. He's here to heal everybody in here, if you believe it. Only thing you have to do is have faith in God, believe with all your heart.

L-13 You believe? I see you trying to get into an automobile. You have a hard trouble. I see you trying to set down in a chair; it's hard for you to move. Those things are true, 'cause you got arthritis. The Spirit of God that's here to discern and tell you what and where, you believe that's Him? You believe He's on me now? Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick they'll get well." You believe that? Father, this commission... You... Thou hast commissioned us to do this. And I ask it to be so for our sister; in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. 54-0812, Prayer Line, Shriner Temple, Los Angeles, CA, 24 min
