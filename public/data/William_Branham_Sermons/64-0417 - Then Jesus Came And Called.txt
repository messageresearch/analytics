--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Believe. Let us stand for just a moment now as we read the Word of the Lord. In Saint John, the 11th chapter, and beginning with the 18th verse. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. And Mary, as soon... or, Martha, as soon as she heard... Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother... not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou will ask God, God will give it thee. Jesus said unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha said unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and... life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: ... whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? She said unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. [John 11:18-28]

L-2 Let us bow our heads now for prayer.

L-3 Our Heavenly Father, as have assembled here again this evening for the purpose of serving You, reading Thy Word, taking a text, and believing that You will bring to us and reveal the context of the text. We pray, Lord, for each need that we have here tonight.

L-4 There may be some who doesn't know You. May they find You, tonight, as their Saviour and accept it so. May they be able, tonight, by something that's done, or said, that would bring Christ a real reality to them. Insomuch, that their entire life would be dedicated to Him and to His service. We thank You for the things that we have seen Him do and for the hope that we have of life beyond this shadow that we live now. Knowing this, that when He comes we shall be caught up to meet Him in the air. And with this, Lord, we pray that You'll instill this hope, this blessed hope, in everybody's heart, tonight. Those who have been on the way a long time and stood a lot of hard things, may, tonight, their faith be lifted up. Grant it, Lord, that they'll take a new view, tonight, and renew their vows and start new again.

L-5 Father, we pray for those who are sick and afflicted. May this be the night of their deliverance. Many, Lord, laying handkerchiefs up here on the platform. And we pray, Heavenly Father, as I lay hands upon these in the box. Now, we're taught, in the Bible, that, "They taken from the body of saint Paul handkerchiefs and aprons, and unclean spirits went out of the people, and diseases were healed." Now we realize that we're not saint Paul, but You still remain Jesus. And we pray, Lord, that You'll heal every one that these handkerchiefs represent. May they each be healed for Your Glory. Break to us now the Bread of Life, from the Word, as we wait, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. [Acts 19:12] You may be seated.

L-6 It's good to be back here again tonight, and to be serving the Lord. Nice to see this bottom floor about packed out, tonight, so we are very grateful for your attendance. And being the first time ever being here, I think that's real well.

L-7 Now, doesn't matter how much we speak to, we speak the same thing. I've spoke in companies of just three or four, then I've spoke five hundred thousand at one time. Two hundred and fifty thousand, another time. And it don't matter what it is, what Christ sends to me, to listen. I speak the... I wouldn't change my subject one bit, if this was a million people sitting here, tonight, just the same. Cause, I'm only sowing seed, and It has to fall on the ground somewhere. 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min And when that last seed has been brought in, there won't be any more. We know there might be...

L-8 We wonder why the revival is not going on right now, why we don't see the enthusiasm with the people. I don't know why. But let's just think, what if it's like this. Maybe there's a little boy in here, tonight, or a little girl was born over in Seattle, Washington. Now, that Book holds her name. He come to redeem whose name was on that Book. Redeem means "bring back from where it fell from." And in the human race, she was fell. And she can't accept It now; she's too young. So the church will slug right along, just play along, will have meetings, and so forth, till that last person is brought in, then that Book is closed, there's no more added. Then it's all over.

L-9 Until, when to that time will be, none of us know. But let's just keep doing all that we can, to His glory, until that time is over. We don't know who that person is. It may already be in, we're just waiting His Coming. We do not know. And it'll never be revealed to man, the time of His Coming, because not even the Angels of Heaven know when it's going to be. But we're just looking for it at any time, and waiting, watching for His Coming.

L-10 Now, you have to have faith in something. No matter what it is, you got to place your faith somewhere. Your faith, your faith might be in the... in a textbook. It might be in your creed. If that's your--if that's your faith, is in your creed, then that's--that's where your faith lays.

L-11 Say, for instance, a--a certain denomination, say, "We got a textbook." You believe that. "Well, anything outside of that, you can't believe it, you see, because that's what you believe in, is that textbook of that denomination. And it might be that you believe in certain thing, you can have your choice. That's what you, we're free American, to be.

L-12 But, to me, my faith is in the Word of God, what God has said to be the Truth. All other things that's contrary to That, as though it is not so. See? I don't say it isn't so, but, to me, if it's contrary to This, it isn't so. And we find today that so many people base their faith upon something, and upon some ism, or some happening, or some something. But, to me, it's got to be the Word of God, and the Word that He has promised for this day.

L-13 Not the law. The law was for the Jew, years ago. Today we're in the realms of grace, and we're--we're living above the law. A man that's--that's living in grace has no law. There is no law to grace.

L-14 How can you condemn me for running a stop light here, which the city has done give me a right to run any stop light I wish, too? See? You couldn't. There's no law to condemn me.

L-15 So, as long as I'm in Christ, I'm free from the law. See? I'm above the law because I'm in His grace. He's put that confidence in me, that I won't do anything that's wrong, or He wouldn't have give me that grace. That's what He does to you the same way. We're in His grace. Now, my subject, tonight.

L-16 Don't forget tomorrow night, now. We're going to try to stay just maybe a tiny bit longer. I want to get here a little earlier tomorrow night, because I want... Tomorrow night is kind of a night we give for salvation, just to make stress on an altar call, stress on those to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And one night, or one day, before I leave, I'd like to speak on the... a subject of the Blood, The Token, the Blood that's supposed to be upon the door, and if the Lord willing.

L-17 Now, tonight. Each night, I been late each night. I'll try my very best, tonight, to get out on time. I realize that we haven't got very much time left, and I'm trying to redeem what time we have, so you bear with me. The... I'll pray that God will get every soul that's under here, that's savable, may He save it. I don't know how He does it. And it's our business to send the Word, or to preach the Word. And let the... It is a seed. And when that seed goes to growing, it'll produce just exactly what the promise is.

L-18 Now from Saint John 11, tonight, we draw this text: Then Jesus Came And Called. Jesus came.

L-19 Now we get a background of this picture tonight. It was Jesus, when He was a just a--a young man, He came to live with a family at Bethany; and it was Mary and Martha and Lazarus. And they had left their--their church, or their creed of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and had taken up with Jesus, and invited Him to their home. And Lazarus was a--a bosom friend to Him. And we're told, and that Lazarus also was a great listener to John the Baptist that was 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min speaking of a coming Messiah. And so when Jesus came on the scene, and came to Bethany, they always entertained Him in this home.

L-20 Now, we're taught that Martha and Mary made little tapestries for the temple, and so forth, where Lazarus was learning to be a scribe, to write the letters of the law. On... They wrote it on skins then, like animal skin, parchments, and is rolled up in little scroll and stuck down in a little holder. And Lazarus was a very fine hand. And he could write these scrolls.

L-21 And Jesus was staying with them. And they had watched Him do so many things, had such confidence in Him, until they had just simply give their whole lives to Him. Though He was...

L-22 See, Jesus, of His day, was more ridiculed and made fun of, than the lowest cult there is on the earth today. There couldn't be anything with any lower and despised than Jesus. See? The churches hated Him. And they just didn't have no use for Him, at all, because He was constantly rebuking them, and called them all kinds of names, and breaking up their congregations. He just turned the world up-side-down, just to say. They was trying to find some fault, to accuse Him, and they couldn't find it. And yet He was... To them, "He was an illegitimate. He was born out of holy wedlock. He was an odd sort of a fellow. He had no worldly education, as to speak of, and yet called Hisself a prophet. And, oh, my, such a horrible fellow He was!" And every one of them was thumbs down on Him, everywhere.

L-23 Hasn't changed too much. See? As I said the other night, "The Devil takes his man but not his spirit." The spirit of people, that's in people, has lived before. If we was to be here for a couple of months, where we have a real study in the Scriptures, I'd like to prove to you that there isn't a cult on the face of the earth, today, but what I can't prove to you it started in Genesis, and show you its beginning. It's a seed, just like a vine growing up, all of them. And it comes right up to blossoming time now, and returning back to--to the seed again. So all these things that you see taking place on earth, they began in Genesis, for Genesis is the seed chapter of the Bible, the--the beginning.

L-24 So you see, those spirits, was upon those men back in those days, still live on men today. See? Satan takes the man, but the spirit lives on.

L-25 God takes His man, but the Spirit lives on. That makes Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He took Christ Jesus, but the Spirit, Holy Spirit, come back, has been upon the people in the Church all down through the ages. See? Because, God takes His man, but not His Spirit. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-26 Satan takes his man, and you find them same spirits. Watch their nature.

L-27 Identify yourself, tonight, in your present state now where you're standing, with some Bible character. Where would you been if you had lived in Noah's time? Where would you have been? Where would you been in the days of the Lord Jesus when He was here on earth, in His flesh? What group would you be identified with, tonight? Just think of it. See? What group would you been identified with, when Paul was correcting them back there in Corinthians for the things they were doing? What group would you be identified with? See? Just look back. It's a looking glass. We can see where we, what... Whatever we were, we are now, that's what we'd have been back there. Because, the spirit that's in us now, identified back there, that that's the same spirit was on them back there. My!

L-28 That ought to shake us and make us get out of our--our slumber that we're in, lukewarm. But you know the Bible says we have to get that way, so that He can spew the whole thing from His mouth. Did He promise it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] We all know He promised it. And He will do it. The whole church is to be spewed from His mouth. [Revelation 3:16] Then, out of the church comes the Bride. That's the Elected.

L-29 Now, Jesus had gone from His home and was staying with Martha and Mary and Lazarus. And one day, you know...

L-30 He said, in the Bible, He did nothing until the Father showed Him what to do. Saint John 5:19, Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself; but what He sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise." And if you pattern that Scripture, we had time to break it down so it would, it looked right, to you. You just run right... It just weaves through the entire Bible. And every verse in the Bible has got it in it. [John 5:19] 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-31 The Bible is in continuity. Every Word blends together. There's no contradiction in It. It all runs together. If you get a contradiction, you got (it) out of the Bible, because the Bible doesn't contradict. It's in continuity, continuity, completely. Notice.

L-32 Now this, Jesus, when... He was the greatest gift that God ever give the earth, the world. "God so loved the world," John 3:16. Now, people had faith in It. [John 3:16]

L-33 Always, God's gifts are looked down upon, by the modern religious moves. Look back at any time, in the days of Elijah, in the days of Moses, the days anywhere you want to. Wherever it is, it's always looked down upon, always. It never changes.

L-34 And then we see there, also, that, in that day, when God using Jesus...

L-35 Now, there was a time that a woman used the gift of God, through Jesus. She touched His garment, and Jesus admitted that He didn't know who did it. Now, I don't believe He was just... He joked or went on. I believe every Word that He said was meanful, had a meaning. And He said, "Who touched Me?" He didn't know. And He looked all around, over the audience, until He found the woman with that faith, and told her about her blood issue had been healed because of her faith. Now, that was the woman using God's gift. Now, you see, that one woman using His gift, He got weak from it. [Mark 5:30], [Luke 8:45]

L-36 But look at this case here, when He raised Lazarus from the dead. There wasn't nothing said about Him getting weak there. How much more was it to call a man, whose soul was four days journey away, and corruption had done set into the man's body! His nose, perhaps, in four days, had already fell in. And there He was, called him back to life again, and he lived, and eat, and drank, like any other man. How much greater was that than it was the woman touching His garment! But that was God using His gift. See?

L-37 Now, that's the difference here on the platform. Now, if you would follow the--follow the service and be out, sometimes, how It tells things that'll happen, well, years before, weeks before, months before, where to go, what to do. That's God using It.

L-38 Here, it's you using It. It's not me. It just flows through, 'cause it's just a gift to--to relax yourself, take It out of the human gear, that God can gear Hisself with It, and say things. Now, your own faith, you don't realize that, you're doing that, yourself. Your own faith is a doing that.

L-39 Now, if God wants to do anything, He just lifts you up, says, "Now, it'll be, you go to a certain place. While you're driving the street, there'll be a certain thing happen here. There'll be a man with a--with a brown suit on. He's got gray hair. He'll meet you down there. You go to him, 'cause his wife is very sick. She's at this other place. Here is what she'll look like. And go lay your hands upon her. Tell her to take that thing back, that she took here a few years ago, and do something another, do penitence, and she'll be all right." Then I'll tell it to people. We go. Here is the man there. That's just exactly what happened. About different things in the nation.

L-40 About this Marilyn Monroe when she died, they'll never believe but what that girl committed suicide. But she did not commit suicide. She died in a heart attack. I seen it, days before it happened, and told them about it. But they wouldn't listen to me.

L-41 When them fighters killed one another. Six months before it ever... Up there in New York, one killed the other one. I seen them in--in their taverns, arguing one another. And seen one kill the other, six months before it happened.

L-42 All these things the... that the Lord shows, that's Him using His gift. There's not... You don't get weak, after that. But when... That's what makes me weak, is when you use God's gift, as the Holy Ghost. I'm not His gift. The Holy Ghost is His gift. That's God's gift to the Church, is the Holy Spirit, and you use It. And It just uses wherever you can get yourself out of gear. See what I mean? And let the Holy Spirit go to using you.

L-43 Now, in this case, Jesus had been told of the Father, to leave the home and to go away.

L-44 If you notice how it worked, they, after Lazarus took sick. And no doubt, many of them said, "Uh-huh! Now let's see where that holy-roller preacher is now, that's going to pray for the sick. He isn't on the scene." 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-45 So, He went away. And they, finally, they sent for Him. When the doctor give him up, they sent for Him to come. And instead of coming, He just went right on further. They sent again. Instead of coming, He just kept on going the other way. See? And then, all at once, He stopped, looked back at the disciples; after so many days, vision fulfilled what the Father had showed Him. He said, "Lazarus sleepeth." The disciples said, "Well, he does well." See? [John 11:11-12]

L-46 "He sleepeth," not dead. There's no such a thing as a believer dying. See? And He told them in their language, "He's dead, and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there. But, I go wake him. I go wake him." See! [John 11:15]

L-47 He knew it was going to be done, now. Cause, if He didn't, then He said something wrong when He said, "I do nothing till the Father shows Me first." See? He knew it.

L-48 And then look at Him at the grave, "Father, I thank Thee, Thou hearest Me already. But I say this for those who stand by." See? "Lazarus, come forth." And he did. He come out of the grave. [John 11:42]

L-49 Now, when Jesus left the home, why, that death and trouble set in. And just remember, when He leaves your home, trouble is on the road. Now, He wasn't put out, here. Or, He was just simply left, because the Father had drawed Him away. All hopes was gone. Now, what a sad little home! Many of us, tonight, knows how to sympathize with that home, when death has struck our home. And you never know what it is until you have to go through with it once. But, you know, when they was...

L-50 Death had struck the little home. They had sent for Him. What a broken up home that was! The Man that they had confidence in, the Man that they loved, the Man that they had seen heal the sick, and make the blind to see, and prophesy, and know the thoughts of the heart, and tell the people what would happen, every time! And He fit the Scripture, to the dot, just exactly, so much, till them Scripture-loving people believed Him. See? And there was some of His most loyalist friends, and He let that happen. See? He let that happen just to see what they would do. No doubt, that was what was in the Father's mind about it. All hopes gone. The Man that they trusted in, turned out that He wasn't what they thought He was, or to--to be. And they were in desperate. Lazarus, their brother, was dead.

L-51 They could not go back to the church, because they had already accepted Jesus, "the fanatic," and they had been excommunicated, and have their letter, as it was, today, from their church, that they could no more come back. And they were left without church. They were left without a friend, looked like. The people of the city had turned them down. Their good friends that used to associate with them in church, had no more to do with them, because they accepted Jesus, "This radic' fanatic."

L-52 So, then, the Man that they had confidence in had flatly turned them down and would not do them a favor. And they sent the second time. And He still turned them down; and let the man die, and be embalmed, and put in the grave, and buried. Now, you talk about a dark hour, that was the darkest hour that little home had ever seen.

L-53 And then Jesus come along. That's Him, in that dark hour. He let's it happen, sometime. The darkest of hour, then Jesus come along. His Presence always brings new hopes.

L-54 This may be the darkest hour for some of you people. Might be, the doctor has give you up, with cancer. And the man has done all he can do to save your life, but it's beyond his--his knowledge. He has no more to work with. He's done all he can do, and you're going to die. It may be the darkest hour you've ever seen. But, just remember, it's in that dark hour when He comes along. He comes along. Then, when He comes, it brings new hope. It brings new hopes when He comes. His Presence brings hope.

L-55 Martha, she went out. She had always showed her colors, that she wasn't just exactly seen as loyal as Mary, because Mary was listening to the Word, but, Martha, when she was cooking dinner for Him, and things. She showed what she was right then.

L-56 Cause, when Jesus come back to town, no doubt but what many of them said, "Now, after the boy is done dead, and buried, now this holy-roller preacher slips back into the city." No doubt that when Martha started out, some of 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min them said, "Look, there she goes now. If I was in her place, I'd give Him a piece of my mind. I'd tell Him about it when I'd get there. Oh, no doubt but what she will. We'll go watch her do it." If she had, this story wouldn't be reading the way it is, tonight.

L-57 Now watch her. Here she goes. She might have passed by the--the--the pastor of her--of her first church. And he said, "Now, let's find out what happens now. See? He slipped away. When the hour, the crucial hour, come, He slipped away."

L-58 Now, Martha, no doubt, was a Bible reader, or she would have never accepted Jesus, at the first place. She could not accept it upon the psychology of the people, or upon the basis of the religion of that day. She could not accept it upon the church, because the church hated Him. And the religionists hated Him. And all of them hated Him. So, she must have been a Scripture reader, and she had read in the Bible.

L-59 In the days of Elijah, there was a woman by the na-... by a Shunammite woman. And she was barren. And she had faith in a man, a prophet, was of that day, in Elijah. And she had built him a little place on the side of her house. Or, she and her husband had a nice home. They built a place and put a--a water bowl in there, and a place for him to wash and clean up, and just made a real nice place, comfortable. And when he come by, he and Gehazi, his servant, and he said, "Look what kindness this Shunammite woman has--has showed to us." Said, "Go ask her if I shall speak to the chief captain I--I know about. I know him very well. Or, should I speak to the king? I've also been called on times to talk to him and consult with him." Said, "Now, I wonder if I could speak when I go before him again, or when I'm called to one of these people?" [II Kings 4:13]

L-60 So Gehazi went and ask her. And she said, "No." She said, "I abide with my own people. I don't have any reasons to ask things like that. That was just out of my heart, just 'cause I know He's a man of God. And I want to show favor to him. That's all." He said... [II Kings 4:13]

L-61 Well, come back, and Gehazi said, "But her husband is old and they have no children." [II Kings 4:14]

L-62 So, Elijah must have saw a vision. And he said, "Go, tell her, 'About the time of life, about a year from now, she'll embrace a child.'" And she did. She had a little boy. [II Kings 4:16]

L-63 The little boy was about twelve years old. He was out in the field with his father, about eleven o'clock in the day, so it must have been a sun stroke. He cried, "My head! My head!" And the father had him sent into the home, and--and so they laid him upon the mother's lap. And about noon, the little boy died, he got so sick; probably a sun stroke. No breath in him. He had died. [II Kings 4:19-20]

L-64 So she took him and laid him upon Elijah's bed. What a place to lay him! Oh, my! Just exactly right. Laid him upon Elijah's bed.

L-65 And she said to the servant, "Saddle a mule now, and go forward. And don't stop till I tell you, because we want to go to the man of God." She knowed, if she could get to that man, she would find out the reason why. If God could tell him that that baby was coming, and he would bless her with the blessing of God, that her--that her barren womb could bear a son, surely God could tell that man why He took him. She said, "Don't you stop till I tell you. Go to that man of God." [II Kings 4:24-25]

L-66 Now, when the--the rider got near the man of God, he didn't know. God don't tell His prophets everything that's going to happen. He didn't know what to do. So he said, "Here comes that Shunammite," he said to Gehazi. Said, "And--and she is sad, and God has kept it from me. I don't know what she wants." [II Kings 4:25]

L-67 So, when she come up. I like this. When she got up close to Elijah, Elijah screamed out, said, "Is all well with thee? Is all well with thy husband? Is all well with the child?" [II Kings 4:25]

L-68 Notice, a husband walking the floor, screaming. See? He didn't have the faith that she had. And him, just screaming and going on; all the neighbors, going on. And the baby, hours before that, was laying cold, on the bed.

L-69 Watch, when she got to this man of God. She said, "All is well." Amen. I like that. "Everything is all right now. I'm in the presence of His representative." Amen. There you are. "All is well." And then she fell down by his feet and 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min begin to reveal to him; not him tell her. She told him. [II Kings 4:26]

L-70 And then he said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins, and take this staff and go lay it on the child." He didn't know what to do. [II Kings 4:29]

L-71 So I think that's where... Paul, another man of the Scripture, would have never, never taken handkerchiefs from his body, if he hadn't had Scriptures to it. Elijah knowed what, everything that he touched, was blessed; but if he could get the woman to believe that! So I think that's what Paul did. Now, we anoint handkerchiefs with oil. Now, that's not Scriptural, but it's all right. That's perfectly all right. "But they taken from the body of Paul," the Bible said, "handkerchiefs or aprons." Notice. But... [Acts 19:12]

L-72 And Elijah, he said, "Take this staff, go lay it on the baby. And if anybody speaks to you, don't speak back. Just go on, lay the staff on the baby." [II Kings 4:29]

L-73 Now, the woman's faith wasn't in the staff. It was in the prophet. She said, "As the--the Lord God lives, and your soul never dies, I'm not going to leave you." And she stayed right there, persistent, until she got the answer of what she wanted to know. [II Kings 4:30]

L-74 Well, Elijah didn't have the answer, so there was only one thing to do, go with her. So, he girded up his loins, and he went.

L-75 He met Gehazi coming back. Said, "Did you carry out my orders?"

L-76 He said, "I did. I put the staff upon baby. There's no life or nothing yet." That had been hours and hours the baby was dead. [II Kings 4:31]

L-77 Well, Elijah went in. He didn't know what to do. So, remember, he walked up-and-down the floor, just back and forth, back and forth, until the Spirit come on him. And when the Spirit come on him, he laid his own body upon that baby's body, and it sneezed seven times and come to life, because of that determination and that faith of that mother. [II Kings 4:34-35]

L-78 Now, Martha, knowing that this Shunammite woman had faith in this prophet, being God's representative on the earth for that day. Elijah was the... was God's representative of his day. She knowed that she had seen enough out of Jesus that He was God's representative of that day. There you are. See? Make the Scripture run true.

L-79 Then, when she run out to Him, and seemed like that she had a right to upbraid Him, and say, "Why didn't You come? Why didn't You come? We sent for You. We left church. We done all this." No. That's the 1964 version of it. Not then, see. "We done all this. We did that. I give this. I give that." You give what? God gave a Son for you and me, the unworthy.

L-80 She must have went out there. And she knowed that God had manifested Himself. And watch when she comes. They follow her, to see what she would say. Now she went out there, and she fell down before Him, first, and said, "Lord." That's what He was. "If Thou would have been here, my brother would not have died." See? "Thy brother would not have died." And she... He said, "Thy brother shall rise again." And He... [John 11:21, 32]

L-81 "Yes, Lord. He'll rise in the last day, at the general resurrection. He was a good boy. He'll raise up at the last day." See, they believed in the general resurrection. Jesus said, "But I am that resurrection and Life." [John 11:24-25]

L-82 Oh, my, after turned her down! How could a Man, that's resurrection Life, ever treat a friend like that? Sometime He's testing you, see what you'll do. See? Put the thing before you, and see what you do with it. He might do that, tonight. He has been doing it, so just to see what you'll do about it.

L-83 Then we find out, that when this was done, she said, "I believe that You are the Son of God that was to come into the world." That's exactly what He confessed to be. "And even now, though my brother is dead, though he's embalmed, though he's buried, though he stinketh in the grave, but even now, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." There you are. There you are. That's the keynote. She believed in what He asked. If He asked God for her, God would 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min hear His prayer. "Even now, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." [John 11:27, 39]

L-84 Now could you have that kind of faith, tonight, in God's Word? Well, Jesus is His Word. Could you have that much faith in God's Word? When It's just as--just as directly identified for this day as much as It was identified in that day. Could you believe that? "Whatever You ask God, God will give it to you." See?

L-85 You say, "But the doctor turned me down, Brother Branham, said he can't do no more for me."

L-86 "But even now, Lord!" Say, "I haven't walked for years. But even now, Lord, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." He is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on High, waiting for you to ask. "Even now, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." [John 11:22]

L-87 Don't the Bible say, "He's sitting at the right hand of the Majesty"? What is the right hand? Not a hand like man, mine. It's the power, the right hand of power. He is God with us, God in us. God here now. The right hand, everliving Present, right here. When you need God, you don't have to go to Heaven. He's right here with you. Right hand of the power of His Majesty, sitting here, ready to make intercessions upon your confession, waiting to be called on.

L-88 "Even now, Lord!" Though the doctor told me I couldn't live but another week, "Even now, Lord, whatever You ask God, God will give it to You." [John 11:22]

L-89 No wonder He said, "Thy brother shall rise again." He said, "I am that resurrection and Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?" She said, "Yea, Lord, I believe it." That's it. [John 11:23-25]

L-90 Now, when you have real faith, when those cogs go to meeting together like that, the wheel is going to turn. Something is going to happen, 'cause there's power on both sides. Power, in faith! And power... The little wheel turned by faith. The big turned by the power of God. When them things goes to turning, something has got to happen.

L-91 To make that light up there, it takes two pieces of material, and a dynamo, turning together. It's just like you. It'll make light. It'll make faith. It'll make--it'll make power. It'll make healing. When the believer and God gets turning together, it generates the power of His resurrection. When believer takes His Word in their heart and begin to generate it. It brings forth faith, 'cause He has promised. Everything is in line. The only thing you have to do to get electricity is push the button. That's all you have to do when this Scripture is supposed to be fulfilled now. Press the button. Don't be afraid.

L-92 That's what's the matter with the people. I've often said... It's a little ridiculous to say it. I find two classes of people as I travel, the fundamentalists and the Pentecostals. Outside of that, I don't know about it. And the fundamentalists are people who positionally knows where they stand, but they haven't got any faith in what they're doing. And the Pentecostals is the people who they have... has got that faith but they don't know who they are.

L-93 It's just like a man that's got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check, and hasn't got no money in the bank. If you could ever get it together. If you get the Pentecostals to wake up, that the Holy Spirit that you claim to have, that's Him identifying His Name and His Word. Then sign your name across the check and hand it in. Watch it be--watch it be recognized by the banks of Heaven.

L-94 "Ask the Father in My name, anything." See? Don't be afraid to ask it. He promised He would do it. Why, there, that's... You don't have to worry about it. He promised it. [John 16:23]

L-95 Notice it now. And she was right, when she knowed if God was in Elijah. He was. He was. He was Christ, too. You believe that? Jesus said he was, said he was a god, 'cause the Word of God came to him. If God was in Elijah, how much more was He in His Son! And if God, by that little portion, could raise up a dead baby, how much more, God in His fullness!

L-96 Well, how much more now, God identifying with us and in us! The atonement is made. It wasn't made then. They was still under the atonement of the--of the sacrificed ram. And now we're under the atonement of the Blood of God; not Jewish blood, not Gentile blood. He was neither one. He was God's Blood. 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-97 The blood comes from the male sex. A hen can lay an egg, but if she hasn't been with the male bird, it won't hatch. It's not fertile. Fertility comes from the hemoglobin, that's blood that's in the male sex, always. The woman is only the egg.

L-98 And in this case, Jesus was the Blood of God, a created Blood cell. He was neither Jew nor Gentile. He was God. The Bible said, "We're saved by the Blood of God," not Jewish or Gentile, the created Blood. That's where, if He was a Jew, my faith is gone. If He was a Gentile, my faith is gone. He was a God. He was the immortal God manifested in flesh, that He created a Blood cell and made His Own body. Amen. That makes devils tremble and run. That puts him on the move. When you see the real genuine thing. Praise the Lord. [Congregation applauds--Ed.] God manifested in the flesh. He is the Blood of God. Therefore, the Life comes from that germ. And now by that Blood...

L-99 On the old sacrifice, a worshiper put his hands upon a ram, and they cut the throat. The priests got the blood and burnt it. And the worshiper, feeling the pains of the death upon the--the ram, his hands all bloody from the little, dying ram, dying, or little sheep, as it died, but he went back out with the same conscience he had coming in. Because, when that blood cell was broke, it was the blood of some other, male ram, see, and the egg from the female. And the life that was in that could not come back upon his life, because it's an animal life. Animal life doesn't have a soul, so it doesn't know right from wrong. So it could not come back.

L-100 But on This, when we really place our hands upon our Sacrifice, Jesus, and feel in our hearts that we're guilty, and know what we're doing. The Blood of that Sacrifice, the Life that was in that Blood was God Himself, so He comes back upon you, the Holy Spirit. You become a son of God, then, with no more conscious of sin. He that's born of God does not commit sin. He can't sin. Seed of God is in him. He can't sin. Has no more desire of sin, at all. So, long as you're desiring to sin, you're guilty of it. But when you have no more desire, if you do anything wrong, then you don't willfully do it. [I John 3:9]

L-101 Hebrews 6 said, "If we sin willfully after received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin." Sin willfully. So if you continually want to sin, willfully, there is something wrong with your experience. [Hebrews 6:4]

L-102 Now, when she heard Him. She was right... When He said, "I am the resurrection and the Life. I AM." Oh! What an assurance of the promised Word, for He was that I AM that was in the wilderness with Moses, back there in the burning bush! Even when all hopes was gone, yet she was satisfied. If she could only get Him to ask, it would take place. Now, how we need faith like that today! [John 11:25]

L-103 Now, she had to believe for the impossibles, to the modern mind, modern way of thinking. She had to believe for the impossible. But impossible things are made real when God is took at His Word. The impossibles is made realities when God is taken at His Word.

L-104 Notice, how beautiful, "But even now, Lord, even now," no matter what the--the situation is. "Even now, whatever You ask God, God will do it," in that dark hour.

L-105 Let's just review a couple people here, or so, in the Bible, just a minute, just to get that dark hour before we call the prayer line.

L-106 Let's think of Job. He was the most righteous man on earth, and Satan come upon him. And come to God, first, and accused Job of being just God's pet. Said, "Sure, got him all fenced up. Break the hedge. I'll make him curse You to Your face." God said, "You can't do it." See? [Job 2:5], [Job 1:10-11]

L-107 And now, Job got into all kinds of trouble. Remember, He lost all of his wealth. He lost all of his popularity.

L-108 He was a prince, you know, in the East, and all the young prince used to come bow before him because he was a man of wisdom. He was a prophet. And everybody wanted to see him and talk with him, just a moment. Just a moment of his time would just mean so much. And how he used to walk down the street, an honor in his heart for God, because God had made him a prophet. 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-109 And the wise men would come up and say, "Job, sir, we know that the great God of Heaven is with you. Just one piece of advice we'd like to have. We've done a certain-certain thing. What should we have." And God would reveal it to Job. And they'd go do that that way, and that's just the way it would be. That was fine.

L-110 But, all at once, all the people got against him. Yeah. Everybody turned him down. Then the cyclones come, killed his children and killed all of his animals. Everything he had was gone. Then come some of his very best, maybe the deacons of his church, see, come to give him comfort. And they was accusing him. "Now, Job, you know, a man that was favored with God, like you, and all this has happened to him, there has got to be something wrong. You've done something wrong."

L-111 Job said, "I am satisfied that I never. My heart is clean before God, and I've made my sacrifice." Amen. [Job 33:9]

L-112 There you are, then stand on it. If you met God's requirements, stay right there. Don't you move. Abraham called everything contrary to that promise as though it wasn't. He staggered not at the promise through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise to God. [Romans 4:20]

L-113 Job stayed right with it. After while, his own wife kind of turned against him. Job got broke out with boils, his own health failed. He went out and sit on an ash heap, and scrapped himself with a piece of crock or something, scrap. You just imagine what a miserable shape that man was in!

L-114 I remember taking that one time, at my tabernacle, years ago. And I was on it for a year, just the Book of Job. That's the way. We just break it down, just lace the whole Word together. And then I had him on that ash heap there for about five straight Sundays. And I never... After while, a little sister wrote me a letter. She said, "Brother Branham, when you going to get Job off that ash heap?" But I--I was trying to make a point. See? I--I was. I was trying to get this settled, that, why he was there.

L-115 And his wife come out and said, "Job, you're miserable. Why don't you curse God and die the death?" [Job 2:9]

L-116 Now look. He didn't call her a foolish woman. He said, "Thou speakest like a foolish woman." In other words, "You--you--you speak foolish." He said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away. Blessed be the Name of the Lord." [Job 2:10], [Job 1:21]

L-117 Then, he knowed he was going to die. And he said, "Lord..." The 14th chapter of Job, he said, "There is hope in a tree, if it blows down." He knowed he had been... It influenced people. His life had been useful. God never give us our lives just to hang around, this, that. He give it, to be useful for Him. Do something. Tell somebody else. You can't talk? Whistle a hymn, or something. Give some impression, somewhere. And Job was the type of man that was useful. [Job 14:7]

L-118 He said, "If a tree goes down in the grave; a--a scent of rain, the roots come out again. If a flower dies, the little seed lays there and bursts open, the pulp runs out of it. There ain't a way you can find the life in it. But when spring comes around, up comes that little flower again. "Now, there's hope, if a flower dies, if a tree dies. But a man," said, "he layeth down, he giveth up the ghost. His sons come to honor him, and he perceive it not." Job want to know. "When they plant a seed in the ground, and it comes up. But they plant a man in the ground, and he don't come up." Now he said, "What about all of this?" [Job 14:9]

L-119 And he couldn't understand it. "How a man, much more glory than a flower; a man, much more glory than a tree, in the image of God; and yet he planted him in the ground, and that--that settled it. His sons come to mourn, and he perceive it not. O that Thou would hide me in the grave, Thou would keep me in the secret place till Thy wrath be passed. Thou appointest me a time and place; I cannot pass." [Job 14:13]

L-120 Notice now, when all this distress come. And his friends turned their back upon him, and accused him of being a secret sinner. Wife had turned him down. Everybody had turned him down. Said, "His breath was strange to his wife." And all the things that happened to him! And looked like God turned him down. And he's going to die and go into the ground. [Job 19:17]

L-121 God spoke to him, as much as it is to say, "Job, now gird up your loins. I'm going to talk to you." And then when 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min He said, "You see, the tree never sinned. The--the flower never sinned. It served My purpose. Therefore it was germitized, one to the other, and it didn't sin, so it rises up again. But a man sinned, therefore he's cut off." [Job 38:3]

L-122 So, then, Job begin to wonder, and then he got in distress just like Martha did. In the darkest hour, when, all of his influence, had he lived it in vain? How would He speak to Job? He's a prophet. How will He speak to him? In a vision.

L-123 Then he looked up, and the thunders roared, the lightnings flashed, and Jesus came along. Then he seen Him in the last days. He said, "I know my Redeemer liveth, and at the last days He'll stand upon this earth. Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see." The darkest hour, then Jesus come along. [Job 19:25-26]

L-124 Now, that's the oldest Book in the Bible. Job, it was wrote before Genesis was written, they claim.

L-125 Notice now Moses, in his dark hour. He had knowed. His mother had told him how Jehovah had raised him up, how he was going to be the deliverer of the people. And he had tried to do it in a military standpoint, 'cause he was a military man, raised up with Pharaoh, become a--a leader. He was the next pharaoh to be. And he went out to try to deliver them with his own hand. But God don't deliver like that. God delivers by His hand.

L-126 So he got smart, educated, learned all the... got his Ph. D., and LL.D. and all the LL's and DD's that went with it, I guess. So he thought, "I really got her now. I'm just fresh out of the seminary." So he goes out there, and he failed.

L-127 Then God took him out there for forty year and took all that education out of him, see, forty years. Now he's an old man, whiskers hanging way down at his waistline, a stick in his hand, all hopes of delivering the people is done gone. Them poor Hebrews down there, suffering with them taskmasters, and beaten backs, and--and mud daubers in that mud. All hopes of delivering was gone. And then one day, on the back side of the desert, Jesus came along, a Pillar of Fire. He said, "I AM." That's Who He was. One day He was talking...

L-128 He said, "Well, You say You 'seen Abraham'? Why, he said, "Why, You're not over fifty years old. And say... We know You're mad. You're--You're got a devil." He said, "Before Abraham was, I AM." [Exodus 3:14], [John 8:57-58]

L-129 So, it was Jesus came along, in a Pillar of Fire, in his darkest hour. And he went down, then.

L-130 You know, when Jesus gets a hold of you, it makes you do things that sound crazy, to the world. Could you imagine that old man going down there to take that city over, or that country over? And he did it, with a crooked stick in his hand, but he himself was in the hand of God. That's what made the difference.

L-131 Well, let's talk of another character just a moment. Let's talk about Jairus, in the Bible, the days of Jesus. He, he was a fine little fellow. He was a--a believer, a secret believer. I'd call him something like a borderline believer, like the spies that went over and tasted the good things and come back and said it couldn't be done. But Jairus was a secret believer. He believed the Lord Jesus, 'cause he was a fine fellow. He probably studied the scrolls, and see where Jesus met all these requirements, and He was that prophet that was supposed to be raised up, according to Moses. But he couldn't make his confession, because, that, anybody that made a confession that they had been with Je-... been out with Jesus, well, right then they was excommunicated. And he was a priest.

L-132 But, you know, God has a way of forcing the issue, sometime, to make you do it. So, you know, he had a little girl, his only child. And she got real sick, and they called the doctor. And the doctor done all he could do, and the little kid got sicker and sicker. Now the doctor called him out, said, "Jairus, I hate to tell you this, Dr. or Rev. Jairus. But you know what? That baby is going to die. It's just got about an hour more to live." I can imagine, all hysterically, and the people standing around, weeping. And they laid her out on a little cot, little sofa there, like. And then Je-... [Luke 8:42], [Mark 5:23]

L-133 I can see little Jairus go around, get his little ministerial hat and coat on. His wife say, "Where you going?"

L-134 "You know, I guess it's forced to me." Then he walked out the door. And said, "Where..." His pastor was standing 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min there, said, "Jairus, where are you going?" "Uh, well, I thought I'd take a walk."

L-135 You know, it's his darkest of hour. Here come somebody up the road, said, "Hey, Jairus! You know Who is down at the wharf? Jesus of Nazareth, that prophet, just arrived." It was his darkest of hour, then Jesus come along just at the dark hour. I can see him pull that little hat down over his face, and take down the road as hard as he can go.

L-136 He said, "Lord, come lay Your hands upon my child, and she'll live." When he was on his road going back, the first thing you know, somebody else said, "Don't trouble Him. He... She has already died. She died yesterday, and she's laying out now." Oh, and he's... His little heart was about to break. [Mark 5:23]

L-137 I can see Jesus look at him, said, "Did not I tell you, 'Fear not and you'll see the glory of God'?" I imagine his heart went back to beating right. Went up the road, watching every move. He got in the house, they said, "Oh, she's dead." He said, "She's not dead. She's asleep." [Mark 5:39]

L-138 "Well," they said, "now we... We've heard You were crazy; now we know You are."

L-139 He said, "Get out, all of you unbelievers. I can't do nothing while you unbelievers are sitting here." He put them all out. Then He walked over to the child, said, "Rise up, maiden," and she rose up. The darkest of hour, death done struck the home, then Jesus come along. [Mark 5:40]

L-140 Now we notice, when his little girl was sick, he didn't wait, like Nicodemus, for a private interview at night. The need was right then. He had to go to action right now. The same right now. If there's ever a time you want to get healed, right now is the time. Don't wait for some other time. This is the time to go in action. Yes, sir. He got desperate, then Jesus come and called her from the dead.

L-141 Blind Bartimaeus, one more character we'd speak of, just for a minute. I'd like to give you his life's story, how he--he was, how he made his living by little doves a tumbling. And so, in them days, they had a lamb that would lead a blind man, just like they have today a dog that leads the blind.

L-142 And so one day, the story told about blind Bartimaeus, that, Jesus, before He had come on the scene, and that he had a little girl that was sick. And he told... went out and cried and prayed to the Lord, said, "Lord, if You'll... if You just give me this life of my little girl! I've never been able to see her. But if You'll just let her live, I promise You, tomorrow, that I'll give You my two turtledoves." That's what he had to entertain the people. So many beggar, he had to have something unusual. So two little turtledoves would tumble over one another. So he said, well, he'd... He offered, give the offering, because the child got well.

L-143 Few nights after that, the wife got sick. And he made his way around, side of the house, said, "Lord, I haven't got nothing else but my little lamb that leads me." He said, "If You'll let her get well," said "I'll--I'll--I'll give You this lamb." And so, the next day, his wife got well.

L-144 So here he was, going down. And said, the priest said, "Where goest thou, blind Bartimaeus?"

L-145 He said, "I'm going down to offer this lamb." Said, "My wife; Jehovah healed my wife." And said, "I'm going to offer this lamb."

L-146 Said, "You can't offer that lamb, Bartimaeus." Said, "That lamb is your eyes."

L-147 He said, "But if Bartimaeus will obey his promise to God, God will provide a lamb for Bartimaeus' eye."

L-148 One day, he heard a racket coming through the city, some of them hollering, "Say, You prophet of Galilee, they tell me that You raise the dead." That was the priest. "We got a graveyard full of them up here. Come up and raise some of them. They tell me You raise the dead. Let's see You go, raise one of them. Some good men laying up there. Let's see You raise them." Others said, "If Thou be a prophet, tell me what I done yesterday."

L-149 Some of them said, "Glory to God in the highest! Make way for the King of Israel."

L-150 All kinds of fusses, and hundreds of them. Now, if you'll go, ever go to Jericho, and mark where he was sitting, 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min he was almost two hundred yards from where they went out the gate. Now, no doubt, people crumbling over him. And the poor old fellow set there in the wind, with shivering, and the rags around him. And no lamb to lead him, and no--and no doves. And he was probably no fuel in for the winter, and is... might have been around in October, and was cold. And there he sit, in that condition. And he... Some kind lady must have said to him, when...

L-151 He said, "Who? What's all the noise about?" You know, there is something strange. Where Jesus is, there's always a lot of noise. Yeah. Right. He said, "What's all the noise about?" Well, they said...

L-152 This kind lady, she must have been a follower of Jesus. She said, "You know, it's Jesus of Nazareth." "Well, who is Jesus of Nazareth?"

L-153 "Well, you know, the Scripture says that the Lord God is going to raise up a prophet." "Oh, yes! You mean the Son of David? Is He on earth?" "I have seen Him do just exactly. He is the Word. That's exactly."

L-154 He cried, "Oh, Jesus, have... Oh, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" Now, he knowed. He had done got a passed. He knowed his physical cry could not be heard. But he knowed, if He was the Word, and He was that Messiah, He would have to be a prophet, 'cause Messiah was a prophet. And he knowed that he could... his faith in God. No doubt but what He screamed out, "Jehovah, have mercy on me! Have mercy! Now let me be able to stop Him." And he cried, "Thou son of David, have mercy upon me!" Probably, all the screams, He couldn't hear it. But his faith stopped Him. Jesus said so. [Mark 10:47]

L-155 "And Jesus stood still." I want to preach on that, maybe, one time, day. "And then Jesus stood still."

L-156 And He stood still. He looked around. And He said, "Your faith has made you whole." At the darkest hour, then Jesus come along. [Mark 5:34]

L-157 The morning just before that, there was a... when He... the morning just before He come in, coming out the gate that afternoon. He had come into the city, there was a man in there named Zacchaeus. And he was the business man of the city. And his wife, Rebekah, was a--a fine woman, a believer on the Lord Jesus.

L-158 But he didn't believe it, hisself, 'cause rabbi had told him, "There is no prophets. We ain't had prophets. That's a bunch of nonsense. Don't you believe such a thing as that. You're too much of a fine cultured man; your business here. Why, don't you never do that. Look at your standing in the church."

L-159 And so he had told Rebekah, said, "Oh, there's nonsense. There is no such a things as prophet."

L-160 But, you know, Rebekah had prayed; till his little heart was about to break. He wanted to see for himself. So he knowed He was to be in the city that day. So you know what he done? He was little in statue, so he couldn't be able to--to see Him when He passed by, on account of the crowd. So he said, "I'll find out whether He's a prophet or not. If I look at Him in the face, I'll tell you if He looks different from any other man." So he climbed up in a tree, and pulled all the leaves around him, and things, and sit there. And said, "Now, you know, when He passes by, I'll see Him

L-161 So as He come around the corner, walking like this, walking down the street, got right under the tree. And He stopped, looked up, said, "Zacchaeus, come down. I'm going home with you." Oh, his darkest hour. Was He a prophet or wasn't He a prophet? In the darkest of hour, Jesus come along. He knowed who he was. "Zacchaeus, come down." [Luke 19:5]

L-162 Zacchaeus said, "If I done any wrong, I'll pay it back. I'll do anything." He was convinced. Jesus came along. [Luke 19:8]

L-163 The woman with the blood issue had went. The Bible said, "She spent all of her money with the doctors. None of them could help her." No doubt, the doctors tried hard, but they fail. They couldn't help her. She had had this blood issue for years and years, probably since menopause. And she was an old woman now, and just kept going on. Couldn't do it. Oh, she had... She was in desperate. Because, no doubt, that morning when the little--little boat pushed into the willows down there, somebody... She lived up on the hill, above. Probably her husband done sold the horses, and--and the farm had mortgaged, and everything, trying to get his poor little wife healed. And not... She had heard about Him. 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min She said, "Who is that down there?" Said, "That's that prophet from Galilee."

L-164 She said within her heart, no Scripture for it, "I believe Him. And if I can only touch that righteous Man's garment, I'll be made well." If she could do that without a Scripture promise, what ought we to do with the Scripture promise? She pushed through. [Mark 5:28], [Luke 8:44]

L-165 There was the pastor, all of them, standing there to criticize her, making fun of Him and trying to get Him to leave the land. They didn't want their people all disturbed in their minds. They couldn't cooperate in the meeting. There wasn't nothing they could do.

L-166 But He come over to have a meeting, anyhow. See? And so He was going to have it, anyhow. So we find out, there was two or three there would help Him, so bring Him across the river, anyhow. So then we find out, that on... as He started walking up.

L-167 This little woman, she said, "Well, such a Man as that, so important, I'm too insignificant for Him."

L-168 And many, some of them started saying, "Uh, introduce me to Him, because I--I want to find out if He's a prophet or not." Uh, so, well, introduce me, Simon," so-and-so. Everyone, "Hello, Rabbi! Why, they say You're a prophet."

L-169 "Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Lord bless you." Go on, on like that, as He went walking on.

L-170 First thing, this little woman kept squeezing between them men, and around, till she touched His outer garment now. The Palestinian garment swings free; it's got an in--inward garment, too, to keep the dust from the limbs. And He would never felt that physically. Then, she touched Him. That's exactly what she want to do. She went back out and sit down. [Luke 8:44]

L-171 That was her darkest hour, all the money was gone, everything else, and Jesus come along. Jesus turned and said, "Who touched Me?" He looked out there, and there she was. He said, "Thy faith has saved thee." [Mark 5:30, 34], [Luke 8:48]

L-172 The little woman at the well morally, she couldn't been any worse. She had... She just taken her sixth husband, so morally she couldn't been any worse. Her darkest of hour, no doubt, going up there and say, "What a wretch am I! I'm a young, beautiful woman, but I'm beginning to age just a little bit. I'm getting in my twenties now, so my... can't go..."

L-173 Now just remember, sister, when you leave that twenty, when you leave twenty-two-years old, you're failing, no matter whether you think you're not, or not. You are. Yeah. You're failing. Every man is, too. You, when you get about... you're...

L-174 That's what I asked at a Kiwanis meeting one time. I said, "Tell me how it is, that, when I eat food, it makes blood cells and I get bigger and stronger. When I was sixteen years old, I eat the same thing I eat right now. I got bigger and stronger all the time. Now, ever since I passed twenty-two, no matter how much I eat, how well I've taken myself, I'm getting weaker and older. Why is it, if I renew my life now, would it be? Every time I eat, I renew my life, 'cause I put blood cells in. Why won't it build me now like it did then?" You can't scientifically prove it, if you had to.

L-175 It's appointment that God made. And you're going to meet it, too. Just remember that. You're coming to it. Pour water out of a jug, into a glass, it gets half full, and then pour faster and it goes down; tell me where it goes and what happens. See? It's because God made the appointment.

L-176 And this little woman, she knowed that her days was about finished up then. Her occupation would be ruined. So she was thinking about, "What will I do? But," she said, "you know, I've always thought that someday there might be the Messiah come along." She walked up there, the well. It's usually when you're thinking about Him, when He comes along. See? And so she walked up there; darkness. All the women was gone away. And she was immoral, couldn't speak with them, or nothing. Had the hooks, and she let the windle down. And she started... She heard a Man say, "Go get your husband and come here." She said, "I don't have any husband." [John 4:16-17]

L-177 He said, "That's right. You've had five, and the one you're living with now is not yours." [John 4:18] 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-178 Then she got desperate. She said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. I know that when the Messiah cometh, that's what He will do." He said, "I am He." [John 4:19, 25-26]

L-179 Oh, the disciples was up on the sea, one night, and all hopes was gone. Maybe you're sitting here, tonight, in this same way, all hopes gone. Their little boat was water-logged and everything. And, Jesus, they went away without Him.

L-180 And then when they was screaming and crying, and wondering what was going to happen, what taken place next? They seen Him come walking upon the sea. You know what? They were scared of Him. It looked spooky, looked something like might be some kind of spiritualism or something. See? Here come a Man walking out there, like a shadow on the water, and they begin to scream out. The only thing that could help them, and then they were afraid of It.

L-181 If that ain't just exactly the way it is today, they're afraid of It, afraid of It.

L-182 But what happened? Just in the hour of their fear, a Voice came, said, "Fear not. It is I." Then, Jesus came along. Oh, my! Jesus came along. "Fear not. It is I." [Matthew 14:27]

L-183 Now, Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I wonder, tonight... I've got to omit some of my text here. But I wonder, tonight, if we, in this hour... The Master is come as He has promised, and is calling for His believing children to recognize Him in His Word, making It manifest. I wonder if Jesus has come to us. This is--this is the darkest hour the church has ever seen. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-184 Now, you know what? Every church, soon, is going to have to belong to that--that World Council of Churches. And when you do, you'll forfeit your evangelical rights when you do that. And if you don't, then you can't be a denomination no more. Cause, every denomination has to come into it. You read of it, just the same as I have. It's the darkest hour the little church has ever had. Everything has went out for it. Pentecost, oh, wake yourself up!

L-185 And right in this darkest of hour, then here comes Jesus along, to vindicate He is with you. He is here, see, the darkest of hour.

L-186 I heard a little story, just take me a minute to tell it. A woman was--was called, the county come to look at her, 'cause she was poverty-stricken. She had a son, and he had went to India sometime ago. And he, a very nice friend, and fine boy. And so the woman just got so, without food and everything, till the county had to come to investigate, for county food for her. And when they was there, the man said, "Well, don't you have any loved ones to help you?" She said, "Oh, I have a son." Said "What does he do?" Said, "Oh, he's a--a--a electrical engineer in India." "Well, who is he working for?" Said, "United States government." "Why," said, "don't he help you?" Said, "Well," said, "he--he doesn't help me. But..."

L-187 Said, "Well, so why don't you ask him instead of calling the county?"

L-188 She said, "He's such a sweet boy. He writes me such sweet letters." And said, "You know, I love him, so I can't tell him that I--I'm in need like this."

L-189 They said, "He--he writes you letters, and you hear from him, and everything?" "Yes." "And still he don't help you?"

L-190 Said, "No." Said, "But he sends me some of the prettiest pictures I ever seen in my life." And she said... So the man said, "Let me see some of the pictures."

L-191 She said, "All right, sir. I got them right here in the Bible." And she opened them up, and begin to bring them out. You know what they was? Money orders from India, with pictures. They all got pictures, you see, money orders. She had thousands of dollars, but just didn't know what she was worth. It was all hid in the Bible. 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-192 I wonder, tonight, if Jesus wouldn't reveal to us what's hid in this Bible, for us. We're rich in His grace and His mercy. I wonder if He would come and call for us. Let's look through the Bible and see what we have in Him, while we bow our heads just a moment.

L-193 Heavenly Father, let Thy mercy... You're here, Father. Why, I'm just as conscious of that. Why, You said, "Wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in their midst." Now, that, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but That never will." Help us, tonight, now, as we pray for these sick people, for the next few minutes. Make Yourself known, Lord. Jesus, come and call the sick, (will You?) that they might know that You're--You're omnipresent God. You're here, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Through Jesus' Name, I pray. Amen. [Matthew 18:20], [Mark 13:31], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-194 Friends, just a moment or two till it'll really be dismissing time, but let's call just a little prayer line. Would you like to have it? Raise up your hand, if you're--you're willing to stay another ten, fifteen minutes. All right. God bless you. Just--just... Is it all right with the custodian there, all right for us to have that? Thank you, very much.

L-195 Now, where is Billy? How many cards you got out? A, B, C. What did we have out first, A's? Did we call through A's, the first night here? [Someone said, "Yes."--Ed.] Let's call from A's again. Let's see, where did we start from, Billy? Remember? One, wasn't it? Yeah. ["One."] One to about... Let's call from somewhere else. Let's see, where will we call from? Let's say seventy-five.

L-196 Who has prayer card A seventy-five? Raise up your hand. So that's good, fine. We got it. Come right down here, then, seventy-five.

L-197 Seventy-six, raise your hand. Seventy-six, right quick. All right. Who? Can't get up? Or, no, it's way back in the back. Excuse me. Seventy-six.

L-198 Seventy-seven, seventy-seven, would you raise your hand. Whoever has got prayer card... Oh, someone here. All right. Right over here, sir, seventy-seven.

L-199 Seventy-eight. Quickly now, raise up your hand, seventy-eight. Seventy-eight.

L-200 Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one, -two, -three, -four, -five. Let that... Just stand up there, right quick. Just have a...

L-201 Now, will the rest of you just sit real still, reverent? Don't move around now. Let those, just was called.

L-202 Seventy-nine, eighty. Eighty to eighty-five. It look like they're not... Maybe some of them is the cards give out four or five nights ago. They might be now... Eighty-five to ninety, come here, come up from that. In A's now, A, a prayer card A, from seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five, ninety. That'll be fifteen people. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... There they are. Fine. That's good. That will be fine, just for a minute now.

L-203 Now how many, rest of you out there, that's... that believes that--that you can do like that little woman did, touch the border of His garment? Raise up your hand, say, "I--I--I--I believe. I really believe I can touch the border of His garment."

L-204 Now the Master has come. Now He'll... He's ready to call you, if you'll just believe Him. Now don't doubt Him. Believe Him. Just have faith now. Be real reverent. Believe with all your heart now that the Master has come and is calling for you.

L-205 Now, as the prayer line lines up down there, I think some of the brethren are helping to get the prayer line lined up the--the way they're in their numbers. Now everybody has got a card. Is... How many more cards is in here? Let's see your hands. Hold them. We're going to pray for every one of them. I don't care who they are, we're... If the Lord let's me live, I'm going to pray for every one before I leave Sunday.

L-206 Now remember, there is a ministerial breakfast in the morning. And have you announced it, where it's at? It's been announced. All right. Which, if you can, come down. Would be... I suppose I'm supposed to speak, early in the morning there? [Someone says, "Yes, breakfast."--Ed.] All right. Okay. Fine. All right.

L-207 What, say, "Never heard you"? I called about, I think, fifteen. Seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five, ninety, something 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min like that. That... That'll be all right. Just like... All right. Start sending them up. If you're looking, now that's... See?

L-208 Now, everybody real reverent. Now, now listen. I know you got to go to work in the morning. Your job is important. I know that. Your children is waiting for you. Baby-sitters; said she'd leave at nine-thirty. But let's just wait. What's more important, to know whether this is the Truth or not? What's more important than your soul? Now, if this Bible has promised this, God does it, that's the most important thing that I can think of. See? Have a chair over there, with the sound system, and that's what was making that noise.

L-209 Now look. Now, remember, let everybody rest surely now. I hope I haven't impressed you to make you think that I'm some kind of a cult or something, that I would be that Person, the Lord Jesus. You don't believe that, do you? Surely you don't. I am His servant. I am a sinner that's been saved by grace. But, in this, the hour has come to where He has given a gift.

L-210 I just had an examination just recently, when a bunch of medical doctors take me under advisement, to put me on a test, for a wave test. And you know what they come out and told me?

L-211 Said, "I never seen such in my life." He said, "You know, you're..." Said, "A person, that when your five senses that you... the body is controlled in." Said, "Now, now, your..." Said, "That's your first, conscious. You live in it. But when your five senses become in--inactive, then you have a subconscious. That's way off from you. You have to be dead to this feelings or anything here, as you go back off here to this subconscious and you dream." Said, "There is some part of you that goes somewhere. And you, when you wake up, back into this conscious again, you're shook back to here, you remember what you dreamed."

L-212 How many ever had a dream? Sure, years ago, all of you. Well, there is some part of you somewhere, 'cause you still remember it in your mind. Is that right? So that was your subconscious.

L-213 He said, "That's the ordinary. But," said, "Rev. Branham," said, "the tens of thousands times thousands of people we ever examine, we never found a character like you." I said, "Am I crazy?"

L-214 He said, "I don't think people come all over the world, to talk to a crazy man." And I said, "Well, am I? I know I'm nervous."

L-215 He said, "No more than any other minister or doctor, anybody that deals with the public." I said, "What's so strange?"

L-216 He said, "You know what? Your two consciouses lay right straight together." Said, "You could dream a dream with your eyes open." See? He didn't know what he was, what about it. I said, "Is that right?"

L-217 He said, "Yeah. You wouldn't have to go to sleep to dream a dream."

L-218 I said, "Doctor, did you ever read in the... about a vision? You know what a vision is?" He said, "Is that a Bible term, Mr. Branham?" I said, "Yes."

L-219 He said, "Well, I don't know nothing about the Bible." He said, "I wouldn't know what you was talking about." I said, "Did you ever read the Bible?" He said, "Yeah." "Read back in the Bible about the old prophets of the Old." "Oh," he said, "that! What? They foresaw things?" "Yeah." I said, "That happens to me, sir."

L-220 He said, "That, I'm glad you... That settles it. Well, that's it, see." He said, "You know what? You ought--you ought to go in and let us examine this." Said, "This would be a great scientific research." I said, "Wait a minute, doctor. Did you ever have a dream?" He said, "Yes." 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-221 I said, "Then dream me a dream. Tell me what's going to happen tomorrow. You couldn't do it if you had to. See? Ever who let you have that dream has to do it."

L-222 Neither can I see a vision. It's got to be Him that let's visions. I can't see them till He tells me. I don't know what to say till He tells me to say. But it's a gift, you see, that I was born with that. The first thing I ever remember in my life was seeing a vision. And not one time has it ever been wrong." See? It's your--your... That's the reason you see people...

L-223 We do have a lot of impersonation. That's exactly right. But we'll always have that. Sure.

L-224 I read the story of Martin Luther, to your Lutherans. The history of Martin Luther said, "It wasn't so strange that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it; but he could hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his revival, and still stay clear with the Scripture." That's it. Yeah.

L-225 That don't have nothing to do with them. You're responsible before God... For, see, it's just a gift. See? You drop yourself over here, and then the Lord speaks.

L-226 Now, here. Here, is this the woman? Now, here, this ought to prove it, now to everybody. Be real reverent, just a few minutes. May be a newcomer is here. Now here is a--a young woman, I--I have never seen her in my life. She's a stranger to me. I don't know her.

L-227 But here we meet, just like Saint John 11... I been there, tonight, see, when... Saint John 4, I mean, where Jesus met the woman at the well. I was speaking about her. She was probably much younger than Him. And He told her where her trouble was. And by that, she said, "Now, Sir, You, I perceive that You are a prophet." [John 4:19]

L-228 Now, see, a prophet is one who the Word of God has come to. The prophecy for that day, the Word that's to be fulfilled in that day, come to that man, and He is that living Word for that day.

L-229 She said, "I perceive that You are a prophet. Now we're waiting for that prophet." If you'll run that reference back, it refers you right back to--to that prophet. Said, "We know when Messiah cometh, that's what He'll do. He'll tell us those things." He said, "I am He, that speaks to you." [John 4:19, 25, 26]

L-230 And she went and said "Come, see a Man that told me the things I done. Isn't this the Messiah?" And all the people believed it. [John 4:29]

L-231 Now, He promised that, "The works that He did, the believers would also." And now, in this last day, vindicated His near Coming by it, when He reveals Himself in the same way as He did at Sodom."

L-232 Have you been listening to the Messages this week? You believe that to be the Truth? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] Now, we being strangers to one another, that's right, is it? ["Yes."] Just so that the people see, raise your hand, so that the people see.

L-233 I've never seen the woman, in my life. I don't know no more about her than nothing. See? She's just a young woman, much younger than I. Born years apart, miles apart, and here we meet, the first time. Here we both stand here, people all around, lights, everything else. We're standing here in the Presence of God. And I'm talking to you, to find out, first, if that anointing will come upon me. And if it does, then I'll be able to do it. Without That, I cannot do it. Now, only thing I do is just pray and lay hands on you, like your pastor would, or whoever it would be, and go on. See? It's a gift. I got myself, as far as I know, relaxed to It. But, then, I can't make It come. He has to come. It has to come, Itself.

L-234 Now just be reverent. It is here. Now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, I take every spirit in here under my control, for the glory of God. Now sit quiet. If anything happens, I'll be able to control it, if you just don't jump up and start carrying on. Sit still. Epilepsy and things sometime get in the meeting and just swing out a dozen of them, like that. How many seen such as that happen in my meeting? Sure. See? Sure. But you just sit still. I'm responsible for that. But if you're arrogant, I'm not responsible, 'cause it's a punishment.

L-235 Now, I have no more idea what the woman is here for. Now, she knows of it now, at this time, that something is 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min going on. See? 'Cause, right between she and I, she just begins fading out. It's that Light coming in.

L-236 Now, the woman is really, her main thing that she's here for, she's standing for somebody else. She's got somebody she's--she's praying for. And that's a--a--a--a person that's real bad off, in a nervous breakdown. It's a sister. That's right. That's right, raise up your hands. With a nervous breakdown. Now look.

L-237 So the people say, "I think he just guessed that." No, no. See? Never guessed it.

L-238 Now watch. She's a very fine person, a good spirit. Now just a moment. Now look on me. And that's what Peter and John said, at the gate, "Now look on me." See? There seemed to be something else in your heart. Yes. You suffer, yourself, with some sort of a dizzy spells, like you get. You have that. That's right.

L-239 You got something else on your heart, that you want to know about, and that's for that brother. He's in the hospital here. [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] You want me to tell you how he come to being there? He was in an automobile accident. That's right. Huh! Do you believe you receive what you asked for? Then go on your road. It's all over, then. See? "If thou canst believe, all things are possible."

L-240 How do you do, lady? Now, do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the same yesterday, today, and forever? [The sister says, "I do."--Ed.] If He would reveal to me what your trouble is, you believe that He could do that? ["I sure do."] All right. Now may He grant it.

L-241 One thing that you suffer, yes, uh-huh, first, you've had some surgery. And you've had a breast removed, amputated. Then, you've hurt your breast, your other breast, and that's what your trouble is. You're not from here. [The sister says, "No."--Ed.] You're from around a river of some... You're from Louisville, Kentucky. ["And close to you."] And your name is Mrs. Lumpkins. God bless you. That, that's right. You have been in the tabernacle. I didn't recognize you. But that's exactly right. Go on your road, believing now. God bless you. That's fine. All right.

L-242 Come now. Do you believe with all your heart, sir? You believe me to be His servant? [The brother says, "I believe."--Ed.] Do you believe that--that you, when you come, you're coming just like Simon Peter did that time? See? You're not coming to me. You're coming to Him. And I'm just His representative. See? He... I... We are the--the--the branches; He's the Vine. Now, if the Lord Jesus... Us being total strangers to one another, I suppose we are. And if--and if we be total strangers, and the Lord Jesus can reveal to me something that like He did to Simon Peter, some of the rest of them, when they come, will it make you believe, with all your heart? You'd believe it? ["Yes."] Now, all right, sir. Now you look on me just a moment.

L-243 Now, your trouble, I see you. It's something about the stomach. It's in... It's a tumor in the stomach. [The brother says, "That's right."--Ed.] That's right, a tumor in your stomach. Say, by the way, you are a minister, too. ["Yes."] Yes, sir. You believe God can tell me who you are? You believe God knows you? ["I do, with all my heart."] All, with all your heart. All right. Rev. Brown, go on, be well, Jesus Christ...

L-244 Believe. You believe God can heal your arthritis and make you well? Go, believing it then. Say, "Thank You, Lord Jesus."

L-245 Come, lady. You suffer with a nervous trouble. You believe that God can make you well of that? [The sister says, "Amen."--Ed.] All right. Just go, saying, "Praise the Lord!" See, a little wheel turning way down here. It used to turn up here. You used to be a happy little person when you were young, full of joy and jolly. And all at once, something happened. Now just go up there, and believe that again. Just start, happy, rejoicing, Jesus Christ will bring you to it. God bless you. Go, believe it now, with all your heart. All right.

L-246 You believe? You're crippling up, too. You believe that God can heal it and make you well? [The sister says, "Yes."--Ed.] All right. Just go, say, "Thank You, Lord Jesus," and with all your heart.

L-247 Do you believe God can heal that asthma and make you well, son? Go on your road, rejoicing, being healthy and happy. Also, weakness, prostrate, and arthritis. You believe that God can make that well, heal you? [The brother says, "Yes."--Ed.] If you believe it with all your heart, go on your road, rejoicing, saying, "Thank You, Lord." 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min

L-248 Just a moment now. Just one moment. Something happened. Different person from this. Just believe now, all your heart.

L-249 It's this lady sitting right here, suffering with a back trouble. You believe that Jesus Christ make you well, with all your heart? All right. You can have what you ask for, then. See? The Lord Jesus heal you and make you well.

L-250 "If you can believe it, all things are possible to them that believes." Do you believe that with all your heart? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] What do you think about it, sitting there, suffering with that hernia? Do you believe that God will heal you of that hernia and make you well? Yes. You believe He will? All right. You can have what you ask for. The Lord bless you. [Mark 9:23]

L-251 See, He's out there just the same as He's here. That ought to just tear us to pieces, oughtn't it? You think God will heal that diabetic and make you get well, and you go home, the blood condition will be... Go to Calvary, for a blood transfusion, it'll all be over. Go, believe it with all your heart. Don't doubt. Just believe, with all your heart, that God will make you well.

L-252 Come here. You got the most dangerous disease there is in the world. That's heart trouble. But Jesus lives in the heart. Do you believe He will heal you in that heart? All right. Go on your road, saying, "Thank You, Lord Jesus," and make you well.

L-253 Go, eat your supper. Jesus Christ healed you from that stomach trouble, makes you well. All right.

L-254 You believe? You believe, if I don't say a word, just lay hands on you, you'll get well, anyhow? Lord bless you. Just believe with all your heart.

[The sister says, "I'm not going to have it taken out."--Ed.] All right. All right. Go right ahead then, believe God, you'll get well and be all right.

["I'll never have it taken out."] Praise the Lord.

Thou the Stream of all my comfort, 64-0417, Then Jesus Came And Called, Mckay Auditorium, Tampa ,FL, 86 min More than life to me; Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Or whom in Heaven but Thee?

L-267 Is He identified among you enough that you can accept Him? Do you believe He's here? You believe that that's Him? Friends, if I could come down there in that audience and heal any of you people, I'd sure do it. I would gladly do it. With all my heart, I would do it. But I--I can't do that. I--I don't have any--any way of doing it. But only thing I have, is this little gift that I was showing you, and that identifies the Scripture promise that Jesus Christ is right here with us, keeping His promise. Oh, that ought to set our hearts a fire. My, just think of Jesus, that wonderful Name!

L-268 When, when that Name was first spoke, when Mary come up into Judah. And Elisabeth had conceived, and little John was six months old, in his mother's womb, and had not moved yet. Now, anybody knows, about three months, or four, at the most, the baby is moving. And Elisabeth was strange, she... It hadn't moved. She had hid herself. And when she seen Mary coming, her little face all lit, up with the glory of God. And she said, "You know..." And she seen she was to be mother, and she said, "I suppose you and Joseph are married?" "No. We're not married." "Well, uh, and you're going to have a baby?"

L-269 "Yes. The Holy Ghost overshadowed me, and He said that Thing would be born in me would be called 'the Son of God.' And I would call His Name 'Jesus.'" [Matthew 1:20], [Luke 1:41]

L-270 And just as soon as she said, "Jesus," the first time that the Name of Jesus Christ was ever spoke through a human lip, the little dead baby in its mother's womb received the Holy Ghost and begin to jump for joy, in the womb of a mother.

L-271 What ought the Name of Jesus to do to a born-again Church? I don't get it. Glory to God! He's Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Life-giver. Amen. Let's give Him praise. Just raise up your hands. And I'll praise Him. Hallelujah! Courtesy of Living Word Broadcast P. O.
