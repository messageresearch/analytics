--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Just prayed over those handkerchiefs now, Brother Willis. They're all right now. I just prayed. Good evening, Christian friends. I am very happy to be here tonight, and to be in the service of the Lord. I want to say first that I certainly appreciate all your fine cooperation through these days [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ...?... the same time. You must serve God. And I--I appreciate the... I love those little tots. They just set along here and reach and shake your hand. There's something about them, I just love them. I've got two of them in here of my own tonight. And to all you people, many of you... How many's from away from Conners--... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ... shadow of a doubt, has taken place in the meetings. We'll never forget the meeting. In and above all of this, there's been hundreds of souls walked down this place seeking salvation of God. Think of that. Where one soul is worth ten thousand worlds. And just think, there's been hundreds that stood and accepted Jesus Christ as personal Saviour, come to the altar and been prayed for and accepted Christ, made their confession, gone back to the churches [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ... Lord Jesus. E-1a And God has set in the church some apostles, secondarily prophets, gifts, so forth, in the church, for one purpose: the perfecting of the body. And now, if you happen to get sick, wherever you are, and your pastor is a man who believes that we should pray for the sick, have him to come pray for you. It'll be just the same as you was standing on this platform or anywhere. And then if your pastor's not there, get some of the deacons. If the deacons are not there, get your neighbor that's a good Christian woman to come in and pray with you. The Bible said, "Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another, that you might be healed; for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." E-1b And now, this is my first meeting for about six or seven years that I've ever had to--ever had to touch any finances in the meeting. That's been for the last four or five days since Brother Baxter's been gone. They take care of the finances. I never even--never even see a nickel of it. See? It goes for expenses and things, then they give me a love offering. That love offering is given to me. It's my wife, my secretary, many of them who's setting present now, many friends from my church, many of them are setting in here tonight from down at Jeffersonville where I used to be pastor. And they know this to be the truth. For you can come and investigate it, try it, plumb through the--the anywhere you want to: through the income tax, any way. For the past two or three years I've been income tax free. And they keep a close track. I have to turn in a receipt for everything that I get and every penny that's taken up in the campaign; and a public accountant turns it in; it goes in to Indianapolis and Mr. Shaeffer, himself takes care of it. So I have to give an account for all. They know where my meetings are. Where I rent something, they... The person... Like I rent an auditorium, they turn in that rent that is by me and they know where I was at. For I keep account of everything. E-1c One time, through a mix up, I was just one night in a meeting. They turned in that I was there. I didn't turn it in, 'cause they taken up a love offering, and cost... They give me about five hundred dollars, and it cost exactly that for me to go down there and back--an airplane ticket, and I just never turned it in. It was over in Foursquare Church in Fresno, California. And you know what? Two years later, they called me in on the carpet about it, said, "Where was you at? Was you in Fresno?" I said, "Yes." They said, "Did they give you a love offering?" I said, "Yes, sir." Said, "So what'd you do with it?" I said, "I bought an airplane ticket." Said, "You got the stub?" I said, "Yes, Sir." 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min Said, "All right, then." They knowed where I was at because the man that had the meeting, turned it in that I was there that night, and the hall was rented. They taken up an offering that day, expense offering, and paid it in as my campaign. That's how they picked it up. Every penny that I don't have to eat with (and I usually wear clothes that people give me), goes straight in to foreign missions. E-1d If I never see you again, I'll have to say that I've tried to be honest before people and before God. Meetings, I realize there's been so much pressure put on meetings for money. And that is something that ought not to be done. I found three things that hurts ministers. First, is money, then popularity. When he begins to think he's something, then that's when he's on his road out. Then women. That's right. Money, women, and popularity. And I tell you, that's what wrecks a many a good preacher and puts him up on the shelf. Shun the appearance of those things. And by God's grace, to this day, if I was laying across the pulpit now, saying my last words, by God's grace, He's helped me do that. And I--if I stand at the judgment, I want to have a good clear conscience when I as--answer for my stewardship, that I've done the best that I know how before God. E-1e And every penny that you give in these meetings... We was averaged it the other night, some nights it would average around a cent and a half a person, sometimes it would--got up one night maybe, to two cents a person or better. But you remember, two cents a person and three thousand people make a hundred and something dollars (You see?), in an offering. And every penny that we didn't use for expenses and so forth, went straight for overseas missions. And tonight, they took a love offering for me. And everything that I don't have to have for my... will go straight overseas for missions to carry out the Gospel: the general orders of Jesus Christ, preach the Gospel to all the world. E-1f And then I pray that at the great end of time, that every one of you will receive a hundredfold for everything that you've done in the meeting. God bless you every one. I pray that someday, in God's great providence, I'll get to come back to Connersville again and be with you. If I have to hurry off overseas (Tomorrow night, I've got to be in Utica, Indiana, in a little Methodist tent meeting.), can I depend on you praying for me while I'm there? Will you pledge to do that? Thank you. And I'll promise you this: I'll remember Connersville and this meeting. God be with you is my prayer. E-1g That brother said he was from Germany. I'm fixing to go to Germany now, to Luxemburg and... Are you close from there, brother? What part of Germany are you from? Oh, is that near Luxemburg, I don't know too much. Oh, to the Russian border. Well, I'm--I hope I get up close to it. I've preached in four miles of it one time in Finland. It sure was pretty shaky, but the Lord raised that dead boy there (You know?), and they even know that behind the iron curtain. E-1h A little German boy, Baron Von Blomberg, I guess you know of him here. And he's one of the managers of the meeting now. And he--he had a little German boy with him the other day; I met him. We was eating lunch together in Saint Petersburg. And if you'd hear that little boy talk, I'm telling you it'd make you people appreciate the land of the free and the home of the brave. His sisters, two young virgin girls, the Russian soldiers run in and was ravishing those girls on the floor. The father run out to take up for them and the officers shot the father and taken the--the two boys--the two girls and the boy, and taken them girls and made them work in a--a mine; heavy, way down, pushing coal carts, and at night time them soldiers get them up and strip them before them like that, and make them do dances. One girl died and the other one lost her mind. That poor kid setting there trying to eat, and the tears running down his cheeks. I'm telling you, brother... E-1j But he said, "The strange thing, Brother Branham, your meetings are better known behind the Iron Curtain, than they are this side. They heard of the resurrection of that boy. It went down through behind there. Some glorious day... Them Russians are no more; they're just human like you and I. When them Russians stood there that day, and they seen that miracle of God performed, and they heard the testimony and everything, why, they put their arms out, "We'll accept a God like that." Sure, something that's got a reality to it. But they're tired of reading, writing, and arithmetic, called "God." See? I don't blame them; I'd be too. E-1k Well, it all has to do with this, friends; there's no matter how much you pray, how much you pray for wars to 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min cease, just remember this coming from me if you believe me to tell the truth: It won't do any good. We're at the end of the road, and God said the world would get in this condition, so here we are. It's a sign post. When you see these things begin to come to pass, lift up your head; your redemption's drawing nigh. Then let's be ready. Let's meet our Lord in peace if we can. May God bless you, 'till I meet you again. E-1m Now, I want to read some Scripture, which I feel that every meeting, there should be Scriptures from the Bible read. Saint John, I read these verses out of Saint John the 4th chapter. Jesus' conversation with the woman. I don't know whether I might've read that before here. I don't know. I never have any program lined out. I just come in, and whatever I feel like doing, I do it. And this has been the first meeting that I have ever had in years, where I just call the people up to the platform and pray for them, just at ransom, as they come.

L-2 Last night, we got around two hundred people through the line. Everything that had prayer cards was prayed for last night. And they had groups that didn't even have prayer cards come to the platform and was prayed for. Is that right? And the Holy Spirit would move right on among the people: stop this and that, and tell them what they'd done and where their sins was, and what they'd ought to do, and what was the cause of their sickness, and all about it. Isn't that right? And it's just the same as He always was. And that is the truth. Now, I want to read this conversation, 14th verse. Whosoever drinks... the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give unto him shall be in him... well of water springing up unto everlasting life. The woman said unto him... Give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw. Jesus said unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast said well, I have no husband: For thou has... five husbands; and... thou... who now... thou now has is not thy husband: And thou saidst right. The woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Shall we bow our heads just a moment. Do you have a special need just now? Raise up your hand; God knows it. God knows it.

L-3 Father, service, it's fixing to turn the page now to history. I pray, God, that You'll bless everything that's been done. May Your great blessings be upon the entire service. Bless all the ministers. God, may their little churches just grow, and may their ministry be so great. Grant it, Father. May they win many thousands of souls to You. I know that's the desire of their heart. Bless all the members of the different churches who's out and from different parts of the country. And the... I pray that You'll be with them. Bless this city here, Father. The mayor of the city, I understand that he has a sick one. I pray that You'll bless her and heal her. I pray God, that You'll be with all the officials, with all that's helped us to get this grounds and this place.

L-4 Now, I ask that You'll come tonight in great redeeming love and power. Save the lost. Make believers out of the unbelievers. And heal the sick and the afflicted tonight. And may the Angel of God, Who has guided me since the day I was born, may He come tonight and bless the people in a manifestation of a gift of God. For I ask it in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Is there anyone here for your first time? Let's see. First time you've ever been in a meeting, raise up your hands. Let's see. Oh, a great host for your first time... There's always the first comers, first timers, we call them. Now, being that we're going to put the most of the time tonight in the healing service... I'm very tired, been driving back and forth, a hundred and twenty miles down, a hundred and twenty miles back, a hundred and twenty miles down, a hundred and twenty...

L-5 [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] ... people. Now, the Scripture says, which has been the theme of our meetings always, that He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, remember this, dear Christian friend, and to you people maybe who doesn't understand Divine healing and has some criticism against it, we have plenty you could criticize, certainly. And sometimes when I'm a speaking of criticism, it always makes us feel like that we duly deserve it. A few nights ago in another meeting, a man wrote me a letter, a very fine letter, yet it was sharp criticism. But I 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min appreciate it. I believe the man done it for my good. He loved me. He was telling me about how the meetings was, and how they were carried on. And... But he said, "Brother Branham, you just don't pray for enough people." And he--he told me why. He said, "I believe if you'd just let the people come on and pray for them, it would be a more success." I give it my first try out in this meeting to see.

L-6 Now, when the Angel of the Lord first came to me... My mother's setting somewhere in the building here tonight. I don't whether she got a seat close or where she's at. She's in here somewhere. She could testify of this. I was a little boy of about three minutes old when the Angel of the Lord come the first time. My people was not religious. We lived in a little shanty up in mountains of Kentucky. You've got it in the book. And there He came. And down through life it's always been something that has foretold me things that would come to pass. Now, that wasn't because that I--it was anything that I deserved. It's because God ordained it to be that way. Gifts and callings are without repentance. Is that so? The Bible said so. So God foreordained things to be. And then if a man comes around and says something another, God said a certain thing, well, now, you have a right to hold that in question until God confirms it to be the truth.

L-7 Now, if the man... As we been studying this week, about the ways that God answers... God in the Old Testament answered either by prophecy, by the prophet, by a dream, or by the Urim Thummim. And if the--if the prophet said something and the Urim Thummim did not record that right, the Voice of God flashing those colors on the Urim Thummim, then it was not right. And if a dreamer dreamed something and they give an interpretation, it went before the Urim Thummim and It did not answer, then that dream was not right. And it wasn't interpreted right. And any man, or any person that comes with anything that cannot be backed up by this, which is today, God's Urim Thummim, the Word, it's wrong. It's got to be in the Bible, THUS SAITH THE LORD (See?), got to be absolutely in the Scriptures. Now, people talking of Divine healing... I know that people has said I have a gift of healing. Well, I believe there's just many, many gifts of healing. How many here believe deeply in your heart, without a shadow of doubt, that God's a Healer just the same today as He ever was? Let's see. There's the gift of healing in the church tonight, every one of them.

L-8 For no matter how much I would pray for you, if you yourself didn't have the faith, it wouldn't do any good. That's right. It takes your faith. And no matter how much I preach to you and how well I brought the Gospel to you, if ye yourself... It's your own personal faith in Christ that saves you. Is that right? I couldn't save you, no matter how bad I'd want to. I've got brothers that's not saved. And I've tried my best and persuaded, and cried, and begged, and tried to stand in the breach for them. But they've got to have their own faith in God. Many of you Christian people here has brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and fathers, and children, and everything, unsaved. Is that right? Raise your hand. Well, you can't save them. You can't do what Christ has already done. Christ has saved them. Now, the only thing they have to do is accept that salvation, God's free gift.

L-9 Now, you couldn't heal them. No other man could heal them. They have to accept their healing as God's free gift to them. He was wounded for our transgressions, with His stripes we were healed. Then, see, there's nothing at all that you can do towards salvation or Divine healing. It's the individual's faith in Christ. Now, to bring up this faith in Christ, there's ministers. That's the most important thing of the day, is a good God-sent preacher. I admire them. And their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else, is a preacher, a man who knows how to rightly divide the Word of God. It's the most wonderful gift in the world, is to be a minister. Which is a... Which was a New Testament modern day prophet, a preacher. "Prophesy" means "to foretell, or to tell some personal thing." In other words, if you read the Bible and start tell... Then that's a teacher. See? But a "prophesy" is "to testify or foretell." All right. Now... And the Spirit of Christ is prophecy.

L-10 Now, in this Church that we're living in today, and the times the way they are, a minister can go forth and explain 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min to you about salvation, you accept it, you'd be saved. Now, the only thing that minister could do to save you would be explain it to you. Now, the only way a man could do to get you healed, is to explain it out of the Bible, so perfectly, that you would see it and believe it and be--accept your healing and be healed. Is that right? That's the only way: through preaching. Now, the next thing would be... Now, I know this. I believe that everybody that shouts hasn't got salvation. I believe there's many of them shouts that hasn't got salvation. Yet that's one of the attributes of salvation, is shouting.

L-11 I believe that everything speaks with tongues hasn't got the Holy Ghost. But yet, I believe the Holy Ghost can speak with tongues. See? Sure. But then if there be someone speak with tongues, like a gift of speaking in tongues, would speak in tongues, then there'd be one interpret it. Well, then, that one that interpret it would speak something to one of the congregation or tell them something that happened. Three or four judges get before that, and the Church accepts it. Then if that comes to pass, that's the truth. See? That's right. Now, that gift of prophecy or gift of interpretation and things, is in--ought to be in every local body. Every local church should have... It'd be on one tonight, on another one the next night, another one the next night, another one this time, another one that time. It's in every local body.

L-12 And if you'll excuse it, and please don't think I say wrong here, that's where in the little break-up that come amongst the Pentecostal people recently, called Latter Rain, that's where they got off the line, right there. For a when a gift of prophecy come to a man, they declared him to be a prophet. Now, that's wrong. There's quite a difference between a gift of prophecy and prophet. A gift of prophecy is in the church. But a prophet is borned a prophet. See? That's the difference. So as any man at... This man might prophesy tonight; he might never prophesy no more. It might be on that woman over there the next night, and this man back here the next night, and that one over there. See?

L-13 But when the gift of prophecy is operating, it cannot be received unless two or three judge it, to see whether it's right or not. But a prophet, singular, p-r-o-p-h-e-t is borned a prophet, comes up a prophet. Everything he says in the Name of the Lord is absolutely truth, if he's prophesying. Now, you say, "That was for the Old Testament." Oh, no. They had prophets in the New Testament. Agabus and many of them were prophets in the New Testament. But now, it doesn't come by laying on of hands. If you lay on of hands... I know what you're thinking about, about the presbyters down there. But that's just like some boy who raised up in a church, and they know he is going to be a preacher. They see the gift working on him and things like that. They just lay their hands on him for ordination. That's what...?... what they lay their hands on. Now... of that... So it just was something... Now, they did a great work. One thing, they made the organization realize that they wasn't the only one on the beach. So it done some good. But nevertheless, God's Spirit, one of these days, will take--cull all that out and take the Church, just as certain as anything. That's right.

L-14 Now, a gift has to first be recognized to be in the Bible. And then if it's in the Bible, and the man claims it, then if God confirms that gift, that it's the truth, then he ought to believe that the man is true. But if God--God doesn't testify of that gift... Hebrews 11:2 said, "God testifies of His gifts." Well, then, if that gift is testified by God, then God's give the man the gift. If God says so, you have no right to doubt. Well, now, a gift of prophecy, gift of discernment, gift of wisdom, gift of knowledge, and all those things are Divine gifts that sets in the Church.

L-15 And O God, grant today, that when we can all come together, and see all those nine spiritual gifts moving through the Church, operating the whole Church Body. Then we'll have the rapture. Then it will be culled out, and we'll have the rapture. If we can't have faith for Divine healing, how we going to have faith for rapturing faith? The Church has got a ways to go yet. But I believe God will do it. Now, concerning my little feeble ministry for our Lord, it wasn't my choice. No, sir. You know what I wanted to be in life? A trapper out in the mountains. That's what I had made up my mind, that I was going to be that, regardless. But God changed my mind when I was laying on the Jewish Hospital there, dying. He let me know that I... He'd do what... 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min I'd do what He said do. So one night when this Angel came and told me to go pray for sick people, it was just as startling. Well, how would I go out there before a modern world and introduce something like that, when people would say I was crazy? I didn't want to do that. But He told me to go. And I started.

L-16 And one of my first cases that I prayed for, where He told me... I told Him I couldn't go. A grammar school education, seventh grade, how could I do it? He said, "As the prophet Moses was given signs for a vindication, so will you." And He told me how Moses healed and how he done, and what these things was. And He told me about this discernment that was give when I was a boy. And that's what the time had come. He said I'd be praying for kings and monarchs and so forth. And that's the truth. I couldn't believe it then, but I know now. My first case, I remember, if the woman will forgive me for saying it, she's here in the building somewhere tonight, was a nurse, a cancer case, a woman, one of the finest nurses I believe I ever met in my life. She's a twenty-one year graduate. Cancer had eat her up, nothing but just bones. And her husband met me. And he's a--works at the Churchill Downs there, something about wiring. He's a very fine--an electrician. And a man had been healed by the name of McDowell, with a flash in his eyes. And the doctor told him he had to stay in for about a week or ten days. And that had been about three or four days after the Angel had told me; I explained it to my church.

L-17 And then, I went over to pray for this Mr. McDowell. And the second day, he went to work. The doctor said, "It just can't be so." He examined his eyes, and I believe Mr. Morgan was his boss. So he sent him to the doctor, and the doctor said, "He's okay. Put him to work." He couldn't understand how it was done. So, Mr. Morgan said to Mr. McDowell, "Would that work on my wife? She's dying with cancer out here in the Baptist Hospital in Louisville." Said, "I don't know." Said, "The man's just an ordinary man. Go ask him." Said, "He said an Angel appeared to him." The man come and asked me. I said, "What do you think about it?" And the woman was brought there, and she was prayed for. Nothing but skin and bones, the cancer had absolutely... The doctor that played golf with her husband, that done the surgery, said, "It was just like a mass of tree roots wrapped around her, till her intestines was so tightened up with cancer, until they couldn't even wash her out with an enema."

L-18 They'd give her, I forget how many, deep x-ray treatments and things, and just burnt her up till she was mentally out of her head even. And nothing... The cancer moved right on just the same. So Mr. Morgan asked the doctor. He said, "Oh, it won't do her no good. Let her go on over. Maybe she can look at the river as she goes by. She's always talked of it." And God healed that woman that night, when I was standing there. The Spirit of God come down, told her what was wrong with her, and said that she'd be well in a time. And the woman's perfectly normal, seven years ago or more. Mrs. Morgan, where are you at? You're--you're here in the building here somewhere. I wish you'd stand up just for an example, wherever you ever at, Mrs. Morgan. Here she is right down here, waving her hand. There's Mrs. Morgan now: a nurse, that weighing about a hundred and fifty-five pounds, still nursing at Clark County Memorial Hospital, in perfect health. About a twenty-five years experience of nursing, since a child, all the doctors throughout the country calling her...

L-19 Through that, doctors has come to my house and everything, right around and locally. God is a Healer of all diseases. Here sets a woman, sitting right before me, from my church: dying with cancer. Stand up, lady, just let them see what God can do for a person after He healed them with cancer, who was eat up with a cancer. There's one from the tabernacle. If we could call the lame, halt, blind... It was through Mrs. Morgan. She went with me to Fort Wayne. Was anybody at the Fort Wayne meeting? Mr... A man was up there, that was prayed for and was something another about... caused me to go over... King George of England called to be prayed for with multiple sclerosis. And then... Here's a man sitting here, with the letter in his hand from King George of England, who called me come from pray him 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min with multiple sclerosis. And the king was healed: King George of England. All right. God is still God. Congressman Upshaw, who had been an invalid for sixty-six years, how many remembers him, his healing? Been in a wheelchair for sixty-six years, God instantly made the man whole, walked out perfectly normal and well. Florence Nightingale, her mother was the founder... Grandmother founded the Red Cross in England. Her statue is all over, was in Durban, South Africa. Flew up there when I went in there to--to London, England, to the Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace.

L-20 And as we went there, this Mrs. Florence Nightingale, weighing less than thirty-five pounds... Five-foot, eight-inches tall, weighed less than thirty-five pounds, nothing but just a bunch of bones, was healed of that cancer on the duodenum of the stomach. And today weighs about a hundred and sixty-five pounds in perfect health, Florence Nightingale. She spread the news throughout South Africa, which caused a revival that sent a hundred thousand souls to Christ. Truly. One of the most outstanding things that I can think of, before I close to... now.

L-21 Back in the old red letter days, I was at a little old city I just left recently, Jonesboro, Arkansas. Never forget that meeting. The paper said... The "Arkansas Sun" said there was twenty-eight thousand people there. They were all there if the "Arkansas Sun" said they were there. It was in the early day about six years ago. They were laying... I was there a few weeks ago, when we had thousands packed in. They was laying under wagons and everything, accepting Christ. I remember that was the first... I'd left home. When I come back, well, I'd lost pretty near all of my hair, and my shoulders was stooped over, and I lost about twenty-five, thirty pounds of weight. I prayed day and night with the people. I said, "I'll stay right here till I pray for every person."

L-22 And I prayed eight days and nights without leaving the platform. Took my meals and laid against the side of the pulpit and sleep. And when I left, there was about ten times as many to be prayed for as there was when I started: no end to it, on and on. But, brother, God confirmed His Word. And the other day when I was standing there, literally hundreds and hundreds of them raising their voices to God, "I was healed in that meeting, Brother Branham." A little woman said, "Don't you remember me?" And I said, "No." Her husband... Her boy, rather, is an exterminator over at--at Texarkana. She come through the line, had her hand up like this; I thought she was weeping. And I stopped. It was early one morning. And I said, "Say, you got a cancer, haven't you, lady?" She moved back the handkerchief, and there was no nose there, it had done eat it off. The cancer had eat her face off, a young woman, about thirty-five years old.

L-23 And I said, "Do you believe?" She said, "Brother Branham, I've got to believe." I said, "Well, then sister, just accept it and believe with all your heart. I'll pray with all my heart for you. It's all I can do." She said, "Ask God. That's all I want you to do. He will do it." She'd seen this John Rhyn, not the old man with the white hair, when he set on the street begging nickels. God made him well. He'd come through the line a few nights before that. And he walked through the line, and I said, "I see that you're--that you're blind." He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Aren't you a Catholic?" And he said, "I am." And I said, "Do you believe that God will heal you?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "I hear some woman over there was screaming, that said a goiter had left her throat."

L-24 I said, "Yes, sir. That's right." He said... And I said, "Do you believe me to be God's servant?" I have to say that, 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min 'cause the Angel told me if you get the people to believe you. See? So not believe me as Him. Believe that He sent me to pray for you. See? Like Peter and John said, "Look on us." And I--I said, "All right." And I had prayer for him. And I seen a vision before the old man. I said, "Now, you have received your sight. Go and be made whole." He went away. In a few minutes, here he come back, two men leading. He said, "Preacher, you told me I'd received my sight." I said... "That I'm healed." I said, "You are." "Why," he said, "I can't see a thing." I said, "That don't have nothing to do with your healing. You're already healed." He said, "Well, if--if I was healed, I could see, couldn't I?" I said, "Not right now, you might not. But God said you was going to see." I said, "I told you, I seen a vision and you're going to receive your sight."

L-25 He may be setting right here tonight, for all I know. The same man. I said, "God said... I seen a vision. You're going to receive your sight." He said, "Well, looks like if I was healed that I'd be able to see." I said, "Not exactly, it might not happen now, it might happen a week from now, a month from now, a year from now. But it's got to come to pass." And he said, "Well, I don't understand that." And away he went. Few minutes, here he come back again. Said, "I can't see yet." And I said, "Well, that don't have nothing to do with it." He said, "Well, you told me I was healed." I said, "Look, sir, you're fixing to--to lose what you have received." I said, "You told me you believed me." He said, "I do." I said, "What are you questioning me about then? If you believe me, believe what I've told you." "Oh," he said, "I--I understand what you mean." See, he'd just got it. He said, "What must I do, preacher?" I said, "Just go home and but say, 'Praise the Lord' and go on." Well now, he--raised in a--in a Catholic church, he'd never been used to anything like that. So, he just gets out and kept hollering, "Praise the Lord."

L-26 And the next night, I was holding a service. He was setting way up in the balcony. He'd holler, "Everybody keep still." He'd raise up and holler, "Praise the Lord for healing me," set back down. I'd preach a little bit. He'd say, "Now, everybody keep still." He'd raise up, "Praise the Lord for healing me." He just kept on. He was doing just what he was told to do. And listen, if you Protestants would obey the Scriptures, and things, as well a Catholic obeys his commands, we'd have a different Church. Right. You ever get one of them to see the truth, brother, that settles it. That's it. He will do what you tell him.

L-27 I said, "Just keep on saying, 'Thank God, Praise the Lord.'" Well, two or three nights later, he was still doing the same thing. He'd do it every night. He'd disturb the meeting even. When I'd be having a prayer line, he'd stand up and holler, "Praise the Lord for healing me." And everybody'd turn around and look. He'd go on. And then I'd been gone away from the place for about two or three weeks. And he was standing on the corner, selling papers. He'd holler, "Extra! Praise the Lord for healing me. Extra! Praise the Lord for healing me." Well, the people thought, "The old man is kind of, a little slipped in the mind." So, they just never paid any attention.

L-28 He asked another little newsboy, if he'd lead him across to the barbershop where some smart-aleck was going to shave him. And so he got one side of his face lathered. He said, "Say, dad, I heard when this fellow, Branham, that divine healer was down here, you was up to the meeting." Said, "Yep. I was up there." He was shaving him along you know, getting his beard down. He said, "I heard you went over to the meeting." He said, "Yep. I went over." 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min Said, "I heard the Lord healed you." He said, "Yep. Praise the Lord. He healed me." And his eyes come open. He looked around. He said, "I am healed now."

L-29 And out of that chair he went with a towel around his neck, the barber trying to grab him with a razor in his hand. Down the street he went as hard as he could go. And that man is preaching Divine healing, holding campaigns tonight. He said, "I know this one thing, that God is true. I was blind and now I see." Ought... Up at the House of David in Benton Harbor, Michigan, I was setting up there... This Jew that knew him... And he said, "Why, a notable deed has been done to John." He said, "What authority did you do that by?" I said, "In the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." He said, "He wasn't the Son of God." "Why," I said, "He done the work just the same." And he said, "Oh..." I said, "Don't you believe He was the Son of God?" He said, "No." Said, "I believe He was a good Man." And I said, "Well, He was the Son of God."

L-30 He said, "No doubt a notable deed has been done to John here." He said, "But--but it couldn't have been Jesus Christ." Said, "It could've..." Said, "Because Jesus wasn't the Christ." He said, "You Gentiles can't chop God in three pieces and hand Him to a Jew." I said, "Some of them might chop Him in three pieces, but I don't." No, sir. I said, "There's one God. And that God Jehovah was manifested in flesh here in His Son, Christ Jesus." I said, "You just got the wrong slant to it." I begin to quote to him Scripture, Isaiah 9:6, and so forth. Come over and after a while he said... stood there and looked around. He said, "Oh, I believe He was a good Man." I said, "Will you stay with that?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Well, I believe He was a Prophet." I said, "If He was a good Man, He wouldn't lie. If He was a Prophet, He couldn't hardly lie and still be a Prophet. So, you believe He was the Son of God."

L-31 He turned around a little bit, pulled his hat down, tears running down over his red beard. Turned around and said, "God's able of these stones to rise children to Abraham." Started to walk away, I caught him by the arm. I said, "Just a minute. You believe He was the Christ?" He said, "Looky here, preacher. You see that sign that says, "Israel," across there?" I said, "Yes." He said, "I make a good living there." I said, "And knowing the truth and yet would sacrifice?" He said, "If I wasn't there, I'd be out there on the street begging." I said, "I'd rather be laying on my stomach, drinking branch water, and eating soda crackers, and tell the truth, than to have fried chicken three times a day and stay behind a lie." Right. He said, "I'll see you some other time," ducked his head and run.

L-32 Now, John's still preaching Divine healing tonight. And in that meeting down there, he'd been healed. And how God was pouring out His blessings. And I remember, my wife come down to see me. And there was about four city blocks up, the people were ready for a revival. They were standing, and my wife said, "You don't mean all those people come to hear you preach." I said, "No, they come to learn of Jesus." I don't know where she ever went that night. Four men come took me in. I got into the pulpit. And I happened to look and oh, it was half as deep as this place is here with just ambulances, and chairs, and stretchers laying. I was speaking to them. The little girl here, just coming in... her faith. She was a tubercular. She had two nurses setting by her.

L-33 Someone motioned over there. He had a suit like a chauffeur. And I knew he was a ambulance driver, supposing. 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min And he had about sixteen or eighteen ambulances lined up outside. And I went over there to see what... I asked him what he wanted. He said, "Preacher," said, "the house doctor isn't here." And said, "I think my patient's died. Would you come to her?" Four men got around us and we went out there. And I got in there. A very typical old Arkansas dad, down on his knees, hat sewed up with twine cord, shirt with a patch up on top of a patch, soles of his shoes out when he was kneeling down, hat rolled up in his hand, screaming to God to let his wife speak to him one more time. There laid the patient. Now, they claimed she was dead. I couldn't say. I don't know. But I got in and they... And the driver said, "Here's Brother Branham."

L-34 Thousand or two people was pressed against--from between the auditorium and where the stretchers was--or where the ambulance was. And when I got in there, I looked at him; I said, "What's the matter, dad?" He said, "Are you Brother Branham?" I said, "Yes." There'd been a man from Kennett, Missouri, had been healed that night--the night before that, rather, with blind... had been blind for... had been drawing a blind pension for ten, twelve years. And the next day, he went up through the city. He run into the Methodist church with his hat on a cane, his blind cane, praising God, screaming till they had to put him out. He run down at the Catholic church, and they put him out. And he was hanging over the back of the--a man's shoulders with a cane on his... rolling around like that, just a praising God, as they throwed him out of the church. Well, he about tore the town up, up there, the way he was going on. Been blind for ten years and received his sight, well, sure. I would be too, wouldn't you? Certainly.

L-35 And then the... this lady... somebody... He said, "Brother Branham," said, "I've done all that a man can do." Said, "She's harrowed over them old clods out there. She's made me what I am. We've raised our children." And said, "She's got cancer; it's on the liver." And said, "She was dying." And said, "The blackberries that we picked last summer, we sold them, and a couple of her quilts that she'd quilted," and said, "to get the money to pay the ambulance to come down here and bring her down here." Said, "She's dead." And he was just a screaming and crying.

L-36 I said, "Well dad!" I looked down. Now, the woman, all indications looked like she was dead. But I don't know whether she was or not. I can't say. They'd taken her false teeth out and her lips was drawed in. Her eyes were watery, you know, and set back in the back of her head. She was laying perfectly still with sticky perspiration over her, cold. So, he said, "And she's gone, Brother Branham." Said, "She wanted to see you so bad. And we couldn't even get her through this crowd." Said, "She's so sick. And she's gone." And she was cry, or he was crying. I said, "Well, let's just kneel down and have prayer, dad, for consolation." So I took her by the hand. And I said, "Heavenly Father, I pray that You'll help this poor old man, and bless her, Lord. And I pray that You'll make it peaceful for her in a better land."

L-37 And while I was praying, I--I felt her hand grip mine. The devil said, "That's her muscles, after they dead, twitching." So I just kept on praying, and she gripped again. He said, "That's just the muscles a twitching." So I kept on praying, but I looked at her. And the skin on her forehead, well, it begin to wrinkle. That wasn't muscles twitching. I looked down at her, and she was looking at me. She said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm Brother Branham." She said, "Are you Brother Branham?" I said, "Yes." And she raised up and her husband was crying, praying. He said, "Mother, mother, mother." And he grabbed her around the waist like that. And they begin screaming and shouting. What a time.

L-38 About two years later, I met her over in California. She was following the meetings, testifying everywhere she could. The ambulance driver said, "Preacher? My, they're packed against the side of that of ambulance." Said, "You couldn't get out there." Said, "I sent them men on back in the back of the parking lot, back there." Said, "It's standing full of people, been standing back there for days." pouring down rain, didn't matter to them. 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min So, he said, "I'm going to act like I'm taking off my coat now, like this. So they can't see. And you go out this side of the ambulance, and go around, and go in the back part, and come in through the back yard." Said, "Them preachers will be around there to pick you up," them ushers, rather. And I said, "All right." So looked like a hypocritical trick, but that's all I could do. I couldn't get through that press. So I went out and went along these ambulances and come back.

L-39 The other day I stood back there and just raised up my hands and screamed out to God. I went around through the back, was coming, pushing through the crowd, you know, just hard as I could. And I'd push, somebody would say, "Quit pushing." I just kept pushing on, you know. Somebody said, "Stop. Set down." I just kept pushing on, you know, trying to get up there where them man was meeting. Directly, I pushed up against a great big guy. He laid his hand on my shoulder, said, "I said quit pushing." I did, for I was afraid he was going to push. So I--I said, "Yes, sir. Excuse me." Nobody knowed me. I hadn't been out of the building for days. They couldn't get in. So we was just there. They'd bring me some orange juice and things. I just laid right against the altar and prayed for the people as they'd come by, like that.

L-40 So then, he was swindling. It was kind of drizzling rain out there then. He was--he was swindling like this, and he went ahead talking. And I thought, "Well, I hope you've quieten down." Well, I looked at him a little bit. And I looked all around. I thought, "Where's them fellows at? I got to get back in that building. Won't they come?" Nobody knew me. I was standing there, you know. And after while, I heard somebody hollering, "Daddy, daddy?" I thought, "Where's that?" And there was as many people, practically, standing in them back places there, as there is seated in here tonight, right in that parking lot, right there in the light. And coming down through the people... Now, down in the South, they have the Jim Crow law: that is colored and white can't mix together. So here come the--a colored girl, about seventeen, eighteen years old. And oh, she was in a... her... this... her eyes was as white with cataract as my shirt is. And she was coming, pressing through that crowd, saying, "Somebody please help me. Daddy."

L-41 And I thought, "Why don't some of those people help that poor girl?" So I thought while he wasn't looking, I'd move along a little. So I got over there. I kept getting right in her way. And watching for these men to come. And she come right up, and I stood like that. And she bumped into me. She--her hands tugged me. She said, "Excuse me, sir. Excuse me." Said, "Daddy?" I thought... I said, "What you looking for?" She said, "Sir, I've lost my daddy. I'm blind." She said, "And I can't find him. I don't know what to do." Said, "Nobody will help me. Will you help me, kind sir?" And I said, "Well, I don't see no more colored people around here." I said, "Where you from?" She said, "Memphis."

L-42 And I looked and there was a bunch of chartered buses setting there. I knowed one of them was Memphis, and that's how... I said, "What you doing over here?" She said, "I's listening to the radio this morning." She said, "I heard about all those deaf and dumb people they had up there, that was deaf and dumb last night, speaking on the radio." And I said, "And you're blind?" See? I said, "What'd you come over here for?" She said, "I come to see the healah." I said, "The what?" She said, "The healah." And I said, "You don't believe that, do you?" "Oh, yes, suh."

L-43 Now, that--that looked like a hypocrite too, taking advantage of a blind woman. See? But I wanted to see whether she really believed it. I said, "Do you believe that's the truth?" She said, "Yes, suh." And I begin to feel little. And she said--she said, "Yes, suh. I believes it." 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min And I said, "Why, you believe that God would do something like that, as far advanced as medical science is?" She said, "Suh," said, "when I was a little girl, I got cataracts on my eyes. The doctor told me when they got ripe," I don't know what that means, but, "when it got ripe that they'd take them off." And said, "Now, that they're ripe," said, "they say if they'd take them out, they'd pull the optical nerves out of my eyes." And said, "I--I--I can't see, and the only hope I got is to get in there. And this is the man's last night here, and they tell me I can't even get near the building. I lost my daddy. I don't know what to do." And I said, "Do you believe if you'd get in there, you'd be healed?" She said, "Why, I heard of a man on the radio this morning, from up at Kennett, Missouri, had been blind for ten years, and he received his sight." Said, "Well, couldn't I be healed too?" I said, "Do you believe that?"

L-44 She said, "Sir, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll just get me in where that man's at, I'll be able to find my daddy after that." Oh, my. I felt my heart drop right away from me. I thought poor, old blind thing. I said, "Look lady, do you mean that?" She said, "Yes." "Oh," I said, "maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see." And she grabbed me like that. She said, "Is you the healah?" I said, "No, ma'am." I said, "I'm Brother Branham. Jesus is the Healer." And she grabbed me. She said, "Oh, Brother Branham, has mercy on me. Has mercy on me." And I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby. Pass Me Not, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

L-45 And I looked, and I thought, "Her only hope, Christ." I said, "Now, I don't want to be recognized in the crowd, lady. You bow your head and we'll have a word of prayer." I said, "First, I want to hold your hand while I'm praying." I couldn't get her hand off of my coat. She wasn't going to let me go. And I said, "Now, let me have your hand." She said, "Don't pass me." And I took a hold of her hand, pulled it off, and held her hand. And while I was praying... Now, you can mark this fanaticism if you want to; that would be between you and God. See? I could only tell the truth. Something happened. I knew the woman was healed. I was waiting for the shrinkage of that cataract.

L-46 I said, "Now, you keep your lids closed over your eyes." I said, "Now, you raise your head just about to where you think my voice is coming. And I'll tell you what to do. She said, "Yes, suh." Said, "Something cold went over me." I said, "Just raise your head." I said, "Now, open your eyes for THUS SAITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, you've received your sight." And she opened her eyes. And she said, "Is that lights?" And I said, "Yes." She said, "Is them black dots there, is that people?" And it begin coming plainer. "O," she says, "O Lord, I who was once blind can now see." She let out a big scream. And then... they'd been... some people had been standing there watching it. And here they come. My! You talk about...

L-47 And I happened to look. And there was an old man standing there with a cane, an old club in his hand. His leg was twisted sideways. He said, "Brother Branham, I know you." He said, "I been standing in this rain for eight or ten days here." Said, "You wouldn't pass me, would you, Brother Branham?" Said, "I got a bunch of kiddies at home." Said, "They need me." Said, "A wagon run over me and I'm... twisted my leg like this." I said, "Do you believe?" "With all my heart." I said, "Then in the Name of the Lord Jesus, give me your cane." 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min And God, Who is my sovereign Judge, when the man in an act of faith handed the cane, his leg come straight, and he jumped into the air and screamed to the top of his voice.

L-48 I looked and here come the men, just pressing their way through, getting to me. And about that time, women, men, just pressing every way, and women trying to hold their little babies over to touch me. Or... It's a pathetic thing. I got babies setting here tonight too. If one of them was sick, I'd feel the same way if some help could come from somewhere. You might say it's crazy and... No, it wasn't. You get in a desperate condition and you'll do something...?... too. Like Jairus was... At that time, I'll tell you the truth, my wife setting present over here now... I couldn't afford a suit of clothes to that time.

L-49 My brother, which is here tonight, give me one of his suits. He was a young man. He'd been in a automobile wreck, and he'd tore the pocket off it. And the trousers had been tore in several places. My wife and I went down to the ten cents store and got some of these patches, you iron on with a hot iron. And we ironed them on the clothes. And this coat here was tore down around the pocket, and I took a needle and thread and sewed it up myself. And I'm a long ways from being a seamstress. It was a horrible looking thing. And I was ashamed of that old coat. And when I'd go to meet preachers, I'd hold my right arm down over this coat like this and reach over with my left hand, shake hands with them. I'd say, "Excuse the left hand; it's closer to my heart." And I--I'd shake hands with them. The thing of it was. I didn't want them to see that old ragged coat.

L-50 But that bunch of what... Arkansas people, who'd stood there and saw the Angel of God moving amongst the people, they were trying to touch that old ragged coat. And as many was touching, was getting healed, not because it was a ragged coat, because they believed that God was in their midst. Let me say this tonight: I may not have that old ragged coat on, but the same God was there that night, is here tonight to do the same thing. He's the same yesterday, today and forever. The only way you'll ever be able to draw dividends from anything, God's got to have faith in it, to approach it right, to believe it. That's the reason they were getting healed, because they were coming in the right mental attitude, believing that the truth was there, and if they could get near it, they'd be healed. And God was confirming His Word with them. E-50a Amen! Oh, when I think about those grand old red-letter days and back yonder, sometime in the way beyond, in the ages that's to come, we'll set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus in a new kingdom. Have faith. Not long ago, I met that blind girl again, seeing as well as... then didn't even wear glasses, giving God praise. Let's bow our heads. E-50b Our heavenly Father, setting out here tonight, I--little babies crying, cool wind blowing down across these people setting here in the open air. Just as that air's a blowing unseen force, so is the Holy Spirit brooding over this place. Thou knowest my heart, the integrity of my heart. Thou knowest whether I'm telling truth or not, Lord. And how that You've blessed down through the ministry days, confirming it now around the world. God be near tonight. O Great Angel, coming down from God as a Messenger, come near tonight and speak to the people. And may Your power move the people, and may the Holy Spirit speak into every heart, and may there not be a feeble person among us when we leave tonight. Grant it, Almighty God. I'm thinking now, Father, of that poor old blind colored girl. There she was staggering in total darkness. Thinking of the day that when there come an old rugged cross, dragging down through Jerusalem, dragging out the bloody footprints of the Bearer, on the road up the hill, His little weak body fell under the load of the big old cross. Simon, the Cyrene, the colored man came and helped Him bear the cross along. O God, You're no respect of person, color, creed. God bless these people tonight. And may we say like those coming from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us..." They'd walked with Him all day. And just the way He done something, they recognized it was He. Do something tonight, Lord, that these people will realize that You're the same. We see You stand talking to that woman there at the well. You told her where her trouble was. She was surprised, because she knew. When Philip come to You, You knew that he'd been under a fig tree praying. He was surprised to know that You knew all about him. And yet, the Pharisee said that You were Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. God, have mercy tonight. 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min May many great things be wrought because we ask it in Jesus Name, God's Son. Amen. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] E-50c ...?... today and forever. Is that true? If He is the same... When He was here on earth, He didn't claim to be a great person. He didn't claim to be a healer. How many knows that's true? He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works, it's My Father that dwelleth in Me." And when He passed through the pool of Bethesda, and there laid all those crippled, and blind, and halt, and lame people, He never healed a one of them. He went right on by, and healed a man laying on a pallet. And the Jews questioned, He said, "Verily, verily I say unto you (Saint John 5:19), the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing. Whatever things the Father doeth, He showeth the Son. The Father worketh, and I worketh hitherto. He'll show you greater than this (or the healing of that diabetic, ever what it was), that you may marvel." E-50d But Jesus claimed He couldn't do nothing until the Father showed Him by vision what to do. That Scripture? If He's the same today as He was yesterday, it's the same. "Yet a little while, the world won't see Me. Yet you will, for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Is that true? E-50e Now here's a woman. Are we strangers to each other, sister? First time ever in a meeting. Well, that's fine. All right. This woman's a total stranger to me and to the meetings; first time she's been ever been around at all. She's never seen nothing about the Angel of the Lord. She knows nothing about it at all. She's just a stranger, just walked in here. Where you come from, lady? Chillicothe, Ohio. Is anybody else here with the woman that knows her? Raise... Here's people along here that knows her. All right. Then everyone knows that that's true. She's just a woman standing here before us. We know nothing of her. She just got a prayer card a few minutes ago or while ago. And the-the boy give out the prayer cards, and your number just happened to be called. And she happened to be the first one to the platform. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] E-50f ... same yesterday, today, and forever and how He's proved it in His meetings. If He was standing here, wearing my suit, or the suit that He gave me, rather, and was standing before you, He couldn't heal you, 'cause He did that when He died at Calvary. But He couldn't do no more for you than what He can working through His church right now. He could only give faith to something to make you have faith to--to believe Him. Is that right? Do something? E-50g Well then, if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, let's look what type of person He was. Let's take our text tonight. One time when He was ministering, He just got started good. There was a fellow by name of Philip got saved, and he went and got a fellow named Nathanael. He said, "Come, see Who we found: Jesus of Nazareth." And he--"Why," he said, "Could anything good come out of Nazareth?" Said, "Come, see." And when he met Jesus, Jesus standing in a prayer line like this, he come up. He said, "Behold, an Israelite in whom there's no guile." Why, it astonished him. He said, "When did You know me, Rabbi?" or teacher, master. He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." Why he said, "You're the Son of God, the King of Israel." Is that right, sister? ...?... E-50h Now, if He's the same tonight, that would be me telling you, saying, "You are a Christian." Whether you are or not, I don't know. But say you are a Christian, then it would tell you something that you did maybe before you come to the meeting, or some other time, or something like that. That would make Him just the same yesterday, today, and forever. He talked to a woman at the well. He said, "Bring Me a drink," get a conversation. I wonder why? Said, "Bring Me a drink." Why, she said, "It's not customary for you Jews to ask Samaritans such. We have no dealings." He said, "But if you knew Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink, and I'd give you water you didn't come here to draw." She said, "When can you get the water? The well's deep," and so forth. What was He doing? He was contacting her spirit. He found... As soon as He found just exactly what her trouble was, 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min He went right straight and told her: said, "Go get your husband." She said, "I have no husband." Said, "No, you got five." Why, she said, "You're a prophet." And she run into the city, all excited, and said, "Come, see a Man that told me everything I ever done." Why, He never told her everything she ever done. Why, He just told her one thing. But if God could reveal that to you, He could reveal everything. Is that right? E-50j Now, you believe He's the same yesterday, today, and forever? You do? And do you believe that I'm His servant, His prophet? Then if I declare Him to be the same, then He--if He will, in His sovereign grace, He can let me know what's wrong with you. But if He doesn't, well, that's--that's God. See? If He wants to He can. But being that you are a Christian woman, I believe that He will. Now, I just want you to listen to me as I talk to you for a few minutes and try... Everyone be just as reverent as you can now. Don't... See? You realize there's people standing here: spirit, and there's spirit there; everybody praying and drawing at one time. To single out one to a vision, it's kindly hard. E-50k But you are--you're a needy person, very much in need. You're suffering with a nervous trouble. Isn't that right? You are a nervous... Really, you--you've had a nervous breakdown. Isn't that right? Well, I'm going to tell you something, lady. I see you as a little child. You got some kind of an injury when you was a little child in the neck. Is that right? You--you got a injury in the neck, and it's caused you to be extremely nervous. Is that the truth? Yes. Now, I lost the vision (See?), when you were talking to me. You couldn't... You don't know... That's all right. That's... See? There was something about... What was it He was telling you? What was I telling you, talking to you about? Oh, He told you what you've done, is that right? It told you something you had done or something that happened to you? What did It say to you? I mean, what was I telling you? See, lady, it's a vision. I'm in another--another world. [The woman tells Brother Branham what was said--Ed.] Un-huh. Is that the truth? I see. All right. That's--that's wonderful. Now, that--me not knowing you, and He said that. Now, see? You heard me speaking it, but that wasn't me. I couldn't have been. I wasn't back when you was a little girl and seen what happened to you. I couldn't have been. Then you know you're in the--the Presence of some supernatural Being. Is that right? E-50m Here's something else. I see you getting little and going away from me again. There's something else He wants... No, you--you got a daughter that you're thinking about, a daughter that had a calling or something another to be a preacher or something. Isn't that right? Yes, sir. And then she--she backslid and went away from it. Isn't that the truth? And she's a... She tried again. She made two tries and now on account of some kind of a love affair or some boy or something's called her away. You believe? Is that the truth? If it's the truth, raise up your hand. Then is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? Come here then. Almighty God, Author of Life, give mercy to this poor woman. I pray that You'll heal her. I lay Your--my hands upon her, Lord, in a representative way, and ask that she can return home and get well, and give glory to God throughout that neighborhood. May it cause an old fashion revival to strike that neighborhood, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, now, sister. Look. Now, if He's able to know what you was from childhood up... Now that's true isn't it? All right. I never seen you and knowed you; we was born in two different parts of the country, raised up two different parts of the country. Now, if He told you truth there, He knows truth what will be. Is that right? If that's truth, what I'll tell you now is the truth. Is that right? You go rejoicing and being happy and you'll get over that and be normal and well. God bless you. E-50n Let's say, "Thanks be to God." Every person in here ought to believe right now and accept their healing. Have faith. God will grant it to you. All right, come, sir. Are we strangers, sir? You've been in some of the meetings, but I've never met you before. All right. Do you believe that the things that I testify about is the truth? And you believe that--that God has sent me to be His servant to help sick people? You do? With a faith like that, you should receive what you want, because He told me, if you get the people to believe you, and then be sincere, nothing shall stand before the prayer. E-50p You've had an awful time. You've been operated on for something in the stomach: an ulcer. You've had two 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min operations for it. Ulcers in the stomach and it's come back again. Here's something in your life. You've never got to a place to where you've ever been satisfied with your experience with Christ. You've always wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but you haven't got it to this time. Will you promise God... Your experiences hasn't met up to what God's requirement is, your life hasn't. But will you promise God, if He'll let you get well, that you'll forsake everything that's called sin, in every way, and serve Him as long as you live? All right, sir, come here. Almighty God, be merciful to this man whom I bless in Thy Name. And may this evil thing that Your servants, the doctor, has tried to cure for him, but constantly, he's persistent and determined to take the man's life. He might've hid from the doctor, but he can't hide from You, Lord. You're the God of all heavens and earth. So by the Name of Your holy Son, Jesus Christ, I ask for the healing of this man's body. Amen. God bless you, brother. Go rejoicing and happy and thanking the dear Lord Jesus for His mercy. Amen. All right. Have faith.

L-51 All right, bow your head. Here's a deaf spirit on a man. Lord Jesus, Creator of heavens and earth, have mercy upon the man and heal him of this spirit of deafness. Satan tried to get him to be killed or something by a vehicle, but Thou art here to make him well. Come out of him, Satan, in Jesus' Name. Amen. Can you hear me now all right? Do you... Hear me? Hear me now? You hear me now? I'm just barely whispering. You hear me all right? That's fine. That's wonderful. Now, you're healed. Say, aren't you a preacher? I thought you were. Yes, sir. That... You're a preacher. And you're seeking to see me about a meeting. Is that right? And in your neighborhood where you live, they'd been somebody in there that's caused a lot of disgrace upon the cause of Divine healing. Is that right? If that's right, raise up your hand. All right, go and I'll be seeing you. God bless you. Let's say, "Praise be to God." All right. Everyone just as reverent as you can be now.

L-52 Now, are we strangers, lady, don't know each other? Know nothing of each other? All right. Do you believe that God is here at the platform to--to help you? You don't believe nothing... the... You've--you accept it to be God, is that right? You're a Christian woman, you should. You have some sort of a fever, rheumatic fever. Is that right? That's a dangerous killer, sister. It goes to the heart and that takes it. But come here just a moment. I want to ask you something. I want you to look this way at me. Now, don't fear. Have faith. I want you just... wait just a moment see, so I... your spirit can be in the right position to catch the anointing of God. Faith. See, faith triumphs, knows no defeat; it'll walk right over everything. See? You've got some trouble in your home too. The child, I believe it's a girl. Isn't that right? And that girl's got something wrong. She's about, oh, ten or eleven years old. Is that true? And she's got something wrong with her stomach. When she eats, she can't hold it on her stomach.

L-53 Is that right? It's a nervous regurgitation in her stomach. She's nervous. You're nervous too. That's where it come from. Is that the truth, lady? [The lady says, "She was sick this morning."--Ed.] That's when I seen her vomiting. Now, do you believe that the same God was with our Lord Jesus Christ, is here with His people tonight, manifesting Himself? Do you firmly believe that with all your heart? Then my sister, I bless thee. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may this condition of yours leave, and may all your troubles at home be straightened up and made right, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. Go now, believing, and you shall receive what you ask for. Let's say, "Praise be to God." [Congregation says, "Praise be to God."--Ed.] Have faith in Jesus Christ's Name. All right. Come, lady. Little fellow... No, it's you. It's not the baby. It's you. And sister, are you aware of what's wrong? You're in a dangerous condition. You have cancer. That cancer, I believe the doctor says, is a blood cancer, seriously. Is that right? You want to receive your healing? You want to raise that baby, don't you, mother? Then look to Jesus Christ. Almighty God, save this woman's life, and heal her in Jesus Christ's Name, I ask that her faith will mount up, go on up. And may this demon, heartless thing that would take a mother from her baby, come out of her, in Jesus Christ's Name. God bless you. Go have faith now, and get well.

L-54 You want to get over that rupture? Stand up, God healed you then, while you were setting there. Go home. Amen. 53-0614E, I Perceive That Thou Art A Prophet, Roberts Park Amphitheater, Connersville, IN, 58 min Have faith in God. Believe with all your heart. Just a minute, lady.

You've took some kind of a medicine for nose or something another... You was putting drops in your nose for sinus trouble, is that right? And it's caused this condition to come: poisoning, is that right? God bless you. Come here. Lord God, heal the woman. I lay hands upon her and bless her for her healing. May it all leave her, the color leave, the poison go out. And may she be normal again in Jesus' Name. Amen. Get a picture like you are now, and then get a picture after it leaves and send it to me. All right. Let's say "Thanks be to God." [Congregation says, "Thanks be to God."--Ed.]
