--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee, tonight, that Thou art still the great I AM, not the "I was" or "will be." You are present tense, our God. And You're the same yesterday, today, and forever, the unchangeable God. We thank Thee because that we have this privilege of knowing this, that's been revealed to us by the Holy Spirit. And He has sealed us into the Kingdom of God, with Him, by the Token that He left us. We're so grateful for It. Bless us, tonight, as we wait on You. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen. May be seated.

L-2 I have, just to lay a few of these handkerchiefs over to the side here, just... We're going to pray for the sick, for the rest of the nights, the Lord willing. We're going to. However, I told Billy that he was a little late, tonight, and he didn't get to give out the prayer cards, but yet we thought we would might do it while I was maybe making an altar call, or something, we could do it.

L-3 Now everybody feeling good? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] That's fine. I'm--I'm sure glad to hear that.

L-4 Now, I believe it's been announced that the Business Men's breakfast is in the morning. I believe that they, it's, they've announced the time, and so forth. Now let's be prepared for anything the Lord would have us to do. We realize that this is the night that anything could happen, so we want to be prepared for it, and quickly get into the Message. So, tomorrow we got a real busy day.

L-5 And Sunday, as the Sunday morning, I think I'm to speak here after Sunday school, Sunday morning; and Sunday night. So, you're invited to all these meetings. If, course, if you have a post of duty somewhere, that you're supposed to be there, well, we wouldn't want you to miss that.

L-6 I got a wedding, sometime, either tomorrow or the next day. Sunday morning, yes, I got to marry a couple from my tabernacle. And so we're expecting to see this also.

L-7 And now pray for us as we endeavor to read some of God's Word just now, and get right into the Message, quickly. They wanted me to come early because of the standing crowd. And so we will read from Isaiah, the 7th chapter. I want to read, beginning at the 10th verse. Moreover the LORD spake unto Ahaz saying, Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depths, or in the heights above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. And he said, Hear ye... O house of David; It is a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? Therefore the LORD himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. [Isaiah 7:10-14]

L-8 If I should call this for a subject, tonight, to speak on for a few moments, on some notes that I written down this afternoon here, I would like to speak on, take the subject of, The Super Sign.

L-9 You know, this is a super day, everything is super. And we see that the--the forked lightning in the skies on a cloudy night, certainly declares to us that there can be light in darkness. We're aware of that.

L-10 God knowed the end from the beginning, therefore He could plan everything, that it would work out just to His glory. And that gives us courage, to know that no matter what comes or goes, God is making everything, the clock is ticking just exactly on time.

L-11 Sometimes we get weary, upset. We get hastily. We think, "Oh, we must do this, or do that."

L-12 But, remember, God's clock will be just exactly on time. All these things has to be this way. It has to all be done according to His great knowledge, His foreknowledge, for by foreknowledge He could predestinate; not by His desire, 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min but by His knowledge. God doesn't predestinate by His desire. He is not willing that any should perish, but by His foreknowledge He knew who would accept it and who would not. Therefore He can make everything work according to His big time clock that's ticking away, for He could foretell the end from the beginning. And, therefore, He knew that we would live in this day. He knew that this would be our day. He had plans for this day. He has had plans for every day. And never has one of His plans ever failed. He is always on time. [II Peter 3:9], [Romans 8:28-30]

L-13 And this is what we call a super age. Everything that you see now days must be a "super," or it won't go over, if you haven't got something super, because it's a super age. They've had their age, and they've had, now they got the super age, everything we see.

L-14 You can't go down to the corner store anymore, and find a big block of cheese laying up there like you used to. And--and the way it used to be, the old corner stores, if you had even the food ever so good, everybody wants to go to a classical, air-conditioned market, called the super market. They must go there even if they pay more for their food. They've got to go to the super market. That's right. Because it's a super. See? Everybody wants something super.

L-15 And, today, you can't take an ordinary automobile. The old T-model would get run over, out on the street now. They got a super car. Ford has to make them a super. Chevy has to make them a super. The rest of them, expects to stays in the race, they have to make them a super. Everything is a super, super, super.

L-16 After a while, we come to the air age. Now they had the propel plane. Then, the first thing you know, they come along with a jet. And now they got a super jet. See, it has to be a super. If it don't, it ain't--it ain't in time. Everything in this age must be super.

L-17 We used to have the old highways we used to travel, now you got super highways. Has to be four or five lanes going one way, and four or five lanes coming the other way, or you get run over. See? You have to have it, 'cause this is the super age, super time. Everything is in the super.

L-18 We even think we got super people, or some people think they're super, and they try to act like that, anyhow. Super race, one race wanting to rule over the other.

L-19 Super churches, super denominations, everything is coming to super. "If it isn't super, well, it isn't so."

L-20 I think even the women is getting super dressing, modern age. The old-fashion shoes, they had some leather in them, you buy them about three dollars a pair, the very best kind, had more leather in them than a dozen pair has got today, that you pay twenty-five dollars for. But it has to be the super type, you know, heels about like that, and no toes in it, but it's super. You see, it's the thing. You have to almost be in super curves to walk in it, you see. That's right. Everything has got crazy, to me, see. But it's a--it's a super age. It's a super time.

L-21 All these signs are the--are the marking of a spiritual darkness. All these things that we see happening in these super, super, super, if we only know! We're in a hurry, we got to get there, and what do we do when we get there? Used to take, walk home from the work, used to be the kids had to walk to school, and now they have a bus to come to the door and pick them up and escort them in to school and out of school, and then pay a half a million dollars for a recreation room, to give them a little exercise, or they die. Well, they used to get it walking to school. Super age! Now isn't that right? Even the churches has to have, they ain't got enough activity among them, they have to have them a--a--a room where they can all play and jump up-and-down. Used to be the Spirit made them do that, but now they have to get out there, sort of a super time. See, all leading to a spiritual darkness, a great day that we're living in. [Ephesians 6:12]

L-22 You know, His people, God's people of the Bible, has always been warned, of God, to watch for the signs of the time. Jesus, when He was on earth, He said to the Pharisees of His day, He said, "You blind Pharisees." Said, "You go out in the evening and you look and see the skies are clear and red," said, "'Tomorrow,' you'll say, 'it'll be a clear day.'" And He said, "Then you go out and they're lowering, angry looking, then, 'Tomorrow it'll be foul weather.'" He said, "You can discern the face of the skies, but the sign of the time you can't discern." Said, "If you would have known Me, you would have knowed my day. If you'd knowed Moses," He said, "you'd knowed Me, because Moses wrote of Me." [Matthew 23:26], [Matthew 16:3], [John 5:46] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-23 In other wise, as I have been saying, they would have knowed that the Scripture that must be fulfilled in that day was being fulfilled, and they didn't know it. They had their--their eyes so set on their traditions, and things, until they couldn't see the actual Scripture unfolding before them.

L-24 I would liken this age to that. That even amongst the--the fine people, sometime, they fail to see it. They just walk away, and, honestly, I--I... It would discourage me if I didn't know that Jesus said what He did about it, that, "No man can come except My Father draws him, and all the Father has given Me will come." They'll never be able to see It. He said, "Well did Isaiah speak of you, saying, 'You have eyes and can't see, ears and can't hear.'" It's a pitiful sight, but that's the way they were. [John 6:37, 44], [Jeremiah 5:21]

L-25 And now we find just about the same thing existing today, when we know that we're living in the hour that gross darkness is to cover the earth and the people. And we find, that all these modern achievements, of super age, and so forth, that we're living in, is only the sign of gross darkness in the spiritual realm. We're in the Laodicea church age, where they're just lukewarm. They could go to church, and people does, and--and seems to have a zeal to go to church; but to know anything about the Spirit, the time that they're living in, some of them are as blind as they can be about those things. No matter what God would do, and how well it would be proved by His Word, still they just can't see it. I wonder if it isn't just about like what He said, "We have eyes, but we can't see." We ought to look around and see all these things that's happening are a sign that the end is at hand, because these are the things that was predicted to be at that time. [Jeremiah 5:21], [Isaiah 60:2]

L-26 I want you to notice the unchanging continuity of God's Word and His works. See, He never changes His--His program. He never changes His ways. Just as perfectly, the Scripture is in perfect continuity. Everything that God does is in continuity with what He done. See? And what He did first, that's, He'll do it the second time the same way. [Malachi 3:6]

L-27 And just to prove it to you, He has made laws in the earth. And He has always given His people a sign before the event happens. Now He has always done it. And He will always do it, because He is the unchangeable God. "I am God," He said, "I change not." The way He sets His program at the beginning, that's the way it is in each age. He never changes it. [Malachi 3:6]

L-28 When He put the world to turn on a twenty-four hour basis; we might have daylight-saving times, and all kinds of times, but it never changes the turning of the world. She makes her complete circle every twenty-four hours, turns around. Never changes the seasons, God has spring, summer, winter, just exactly like it always was. That's the way He done it first, that's the way He does it every time. The continuity of His laws, and of His Word, and of His works, how it all just perfectly blends together!

L-29 Therefore, if we could look what was, we can know what is and what will be. You can base your thoughts upon that, for the Scripture says, "He's the same yesterday, today, and forever." [Hebrews 13:8]

L-30 We notice before springtime comes. Watch some of His laws. "When you see the trees putting forth buds," He said, "you know that summer is nigh." Springtime is a sign of the introduction of summer coming on. That's a law. It always happens that way. You don't have summer, and then about the time it gets winter then the leaves come on. No, you have the leaves first, because it's an introduction of His laws of nature, that springtime is coming. It never fails. When you see the trees begin to get tender, around on the bark, and the little buds begin to swell, you know that it's a sign that springtime is here, is coming in. [Matthew 24:32], [Mark 13:28]

L-31 When you see the fall of the year before we have frost or anything, and the leaves fall from the trees, you say, "Well, autumn is near." How do you know? Because the leaves are falling. Nature is getting ready for it. Every year is the same.

L-32 He also gives us a sign in the changing of the weather. You can go out and watch, like He said, "You see the sky is red and lowering, tomorrow will be foul weather." And He never changes it. He always warns us. You can take, feel the air begin to get damp, a long time before the storm, and watch nature all play in with that. It's a sign.

L-33 As I've often said, "If there was no Bible, I'd know there was a God, just to watch the way nature works." It's His 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min laws, they're all in continuity with one another. His Word is in continuity; It cannot fail. His signs are in continuity with the time. The signs are right with the Bible. The signs are right in the moon. The signs are right in the sky. The signs are right on earth. The signs are right in the church. And we can look around the church, today, and see the sign is just right for Him to come.

L-34 For instance, how it works upon nature. I've been up in the north woods, where I'd be hunting, before we ever had a--a cold spell; little ducks go out of Louisiana, go up there and make their nests, and hatch out their little ones. Just let the first little cold breeze come off the top of that hill when the snow caps the mountains, and them little ducks raise up from there, and never been off that pond, and come just as straight back to Louisiana as they can come. It's a nature, see, the laws of nature. They do it every year. And then let, the first thing you know, down here in Louisiana the hot sun begin to start pouring down, down here in Louisiana, watch them all get together, swarm again, and take right back to the mountains again.

L-35 Watch the geese over here in Texas, where many of them go. I've seen the time that we'd have to stop the car, on the road. They are not bothered about nobody. They're thinking about going. They got a revival going on. All of them together, you never heard such a noise. It's worse than the Pentecostals, when they get together. See? What is it? It's the laws of nature. See, they, every year they get together, then swarm, and away they go. When them ducks leave, and geese leave Texas, summer is on the road. That's right.

L-36 And when they leave northern British Columbia, winter is on the way; hear them geese going over, screaming the way they do, going south. I can listen at them and cry, because I see God guiding them. What is it guides them through the pathless air, when he's nothing but a dumb brute? What is it that does it? When I hear him going down, screaming, that leader out there, kind of taking his way; maybe he's never winged his way to Louisiana before, but he'll get there. Don't you worry. He's got something in him that tells him where to go. He is taking his flight. He is leading the herd. The whole swarm of them is coming. They may never been here before. But he knows right exactly where the--the rice paddies has got the rice, because he's got something that leads him. It's a nature.

L-37 Then the spring, when it's nice and warm down here through the winter, he'll go right straight back again. Why? It's nature displaying itself. It's the laws of God.

L-38 His signs always foreruns His events, just as that does. When you see the geese going, see the buds coming on, see the leaves falling off, see, it's the continuity of nature blending in. God's law of nature blends in, and He foreruns His events. It always has been, it never has failed, and it never will fail.

L-39 If we just follow the continuity of God's Word, we will never fail, either. If we'll not take the--the modern trend of the day and--and try to inject something else into it, but just follow the continuity of it for this age, watch what takes place. We'll go straight home, too, one of these days. Always does that, and never fails.

L-40 Prophets are the chief sign. God's chief sign is a prophet. Now I'm going to speak a few minutes about that. They are His Word made manifest for that age, and that's the reason a prophet is always God's chief sign. He has never sent a judgment upon the earth without first sending a prophet. Just see, and search the Scriptures. A prophet is the chief sign of God, to His people, that He has sent this person, this certain person, like Noah, like Moses, and--and Elijah and the prophets. He sends them to manifest the Word for that age, to give His people a warning. [Amos 3:7]

L-41 Just the same as He sends a cold spell upon the ducks, to run them from the North to the South; continuity in nature, continuity in the Word, He never fails to do it. If it takes cold weather to run them down, next year it takes cold weather to run them down. If it takes hot weather to run them back, the next year it takes hot weather to run them back.

L-42 And when God gets ready to send judgment, before He sends judgment, He sends a prophet and manifests His Word, vindicates the Word of that age. He did it in all other ages. He promised to do it in this age. And He will do it in this age, regardless of what people says about it. He'll do it, anyhow, because He cannot break His continuity. It's the way He planned, He always does it the same way. He never fails to do it like He did it at the first time. [Amos 3:7]

L-43 Like John the Baptist, now, we had had four hundred years, from Malachi to John, there had been no sign, a prophet of the Old Testament, about as long a space (lest the time the judges) that there ever was without a prophet. 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min What was the matter, why didn't they have a prophet during that time? There was no Word placed for that time. They had to wait until the time got right. They had to wait. The prophecy in Malachi said, was Malachi 3, "Behold, I send My messenger before My face, he'll prepare My way before Me," Malachi 3:1. Now, that was Malachi's prophecy of the coming of the Lord Jesus. Nothing was to take place between that time, so the church just got slothful and went on in its own way, until the time of the promise drew nigh. [Malachi 3:1]

L-44 And when the time of the promise drew nigh, God, in a supernatural way, brought John on the earth. He was a man borned of a woman, of course, and we know his mother was called "Elisabeth" and his father was called "Zacharias." They were good people. And his father was a priest. It was a custom of the boys of that day to follow the--the work of their father, but we're taught that John, when he was nine years old, after the death of his father, went into the wilderness and stayed alone until he was thirty. [Luke 1:5-25]

L-45 See, if he'd turned to what his father had, they'd have had him so messed up that he'd not knowed how to see that Messiah when He come. He'd have never knowed Him. But he stayed in the wilderness. If he'd went to the seminary, with his father's line of thought, then every one of them would have said, "Now, John, we understand that you're going to be the one that'll know the Messiah when He comes. Now, don't you think that Brother So-and-so here just fits the figure exactly? What about Caiaphas, our high priest today, don't you think he's just a wonderful man?" All that into his holy mind, he would have never been able to have thought it straight. [Matthew 3:1-3], [John 1:23]

L-46 He went out in the wilderness, and waited! His job was too great for education. His job was too great for theology. He had to announce the Messiah. And he stayed in the wilderness. [John 1:23]

L-47 Watch his preaching. His preaching wasn't ethics of--of that day's theology. You notice that it wasn't. What did he talk about? Axe at the tree, serpents. See, that's all he knowed. He was raised in the wilderness. That's what he knowed: serpents, and trees, and axes, and so forth. And that's what his message was based upon, nature. When he said, "You generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath that's to come? Don't think that you got Abraham to your father, because God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham. And also the axe is laid to the root of the tree; and every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire." Said, "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. But there comes One after me Whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear, He'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and fire. His fan is in His hand; He'll thoroughly purge his floors, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire, and take the wheat to the garner." Amen. [Luke 3:9, 16], [Matthew 3:7, 11, 12], [Matthew 12:34], [Matthew 23:33], [Luke 3:9], [Mark 1:8]

L-48 There is a man, a prophet indeed. He had a sign that he had to watch. And when he seen the Messiah, he was so sure that He was coming in his day, he was so positive. Oh, if the Church could only get Its positive position, if It would only know Its stand in the hour! For, according to the Scripture, he was the one to introduce the Messiah, and he knowed He had to be on earth in the days of his prophecy. Therefore He was lingering near to where he was preaching, so much that he said, "There is One standing among you now, that you don't know, One among you right now." He knew it. He was there. The hour was at hand. He knew it. [John 1:23-26]

L-49 One day he looked, coming down from Heaven... And he saw a--a Light, like a dove coming down from Heaven. And the One It lit upon, he said, "I bare record that this is the Son of God." He saw It. "For He, in the wilderness, told me, 'Upon Whom thou shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on, that's the One that will baptize with the Holy Ghost and Fire.'" [Matthew 3:11, 16], [Mark 1:10]

L-50 He was a man sent from God, trained by God, and worked for God, till God and he became... He was the prophet, and the Word came to him, as I said the other night, in the water. He was the Word for the... of God, for the time of the prophecy of Malachi. Malachi said there would be such a person, and John came on the scene, a prophet, to fulfill the Word of the Lord, for that day. So, it, he was the sign to Israel, if they'd have only knowed the sign. [Amos 3:7], [Malachi 3:1]

L-51 Even the disciples said, "Why is it the scribes say that the prophet must, Elijah must come first?" He said, "He has already come, and you didn't know him." [Matthew 17:10, 12] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-52 God does it in such a simple way, just to pick up that elected seed, until the others never see it. That's the truth.

L-53 How many wise man were in Babylon, studying astronomy, when these three wise men knew that when, though, in that solar system, when them three stars lined up, it was a sign the Messiah was on the earth? They knew it. They believed it. And they was the one who saw the stars. The rest of them didn't see them. They were in their right constellation, but they saw them in the way that God had presented them to them. [Matthew 2:1-4]

L-54 That's the way the Gospel is today. It can only be seen in the way that God presents it to you. And if it's presented to you outside of the continuity of the Bible, then it's not God telling you that. Amen. You can't make the Bible lie. It's the infallible Word of God. And it has to agree with the continuity of His, rest of His Word. It just can't say this one place, and this something else; and do this over, hit, scatter. He hits the target every time, the Word does, so you have to make it in the continuity of the rest of the Word. Therefore, His way has always been, in the Word, to send a prophet before that time, before He makes His Word vindicated.

L-55 Now we might speak here, just a minute, what is a prophet. Now in the English terms, according to the English terms of it, it means a "preacher." Well, that's the English terms. But in the Hebrew terms, it's called "seer."

L-56 And a seer was the one who had the interpretation of the written Word, and he foresaw things that was to come. And when he spoke of the things that was to come, and proved that he was a seer, then he knowed. They knowed he had the right interpretation of the Scripture, because God, through him, manifested the written Scripture for that day. Amen. Don't be slothful. Wake up! That was the plain identification, a seer, a forth-teller and a teller-forth. And the only way that they knowed he was getting the right interpretation to the Scripture, because what he said come to pass. Then they knowed he was called of God, God said that. And then they noticed that it did, it come right back in continuity with the Word for that day. [Amos 3:7]

L-57 Jesus said, "Search the Scriptures!" When they seen He could discern the thoughts that was in their mind, and they called Him Beelzebub, He said, "Search the Scriptures, They are the Ones that testify of Me." The continuity of the Scriptures running perfectly with the sign of the time! He was God's sign of the time. He was the manifestation of the written Word, and also could foretell what would happen, and they could not deny it. He was the super sign of the day. He certainly was. [John 5:39], [Hebrews 12:4], [John 5:39]

L-58 Notice the continuity of His unchanging Word, also the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, "When the Holy Ghost is come upon you, He will remind you, or reveal these things that I have told you, and also will show you things to come." Now the Bible... [John 16:13]

L-59 The people say today, "There is no such a thing as a prophet, in the world."

L-60 Well, why is it Paul set it in the church? "There were first apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, and evangelists." Certainly, there was. [Ephesians 4:11]

L-61 The Holy Ghost is the Prophet. "When He the Holy Ghost is come upon you, He will reveal, or teach you, show you. These things that I've told you has all been in a riddle, you don't understand them now because it's not for your age now. But when the Holy Ghost is come, He will make those things live out, right to the promise. Not only that, but He'll show you things that is to come." [John 16:13]

L-62 Glory! The continuity of God's Word, God's promise, God's Spirit. We're living in the hour, watching the unfolding of the prophecies of the age, coming to pass. What a great time that we're living in! The Holy Spirit was to show us things that was to come.

L-63 Man has ever tried to achieve and make for himself a name by making him a super sign. What makes a man try to make himself something super over the other? Why does he do that? Because, in him, he is a nature. He, by nature, he's a sinner, but in stature he's a fallen Son of God.

L-64 Why does he make himself such a pretty home, making it better all the time? Is be-... The bird don't make his home any different. The groundhog still lives in the ground, like he did a thousand years ago. See? The bird still builds a nest like he did a thousand years ago. See? But man is increasing. Why? He's... and he--and he is a fallen son of God. 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min There is something in him that tells him that a palace, more beautiful, and there is something in him is trying to find it. It's searching for it. Oh, if we look at some of these homes today, what will them be on the other side? When a fallen nature can do a thing like this, what will it be?

L-65 But that's what makes him do that, his nature inside of him. Though he is fallen, he tries to make something in himself. He tries to do that. It's been from the beginning.

L-66 Adam, he tried to make a super religion without an atonement. They're still trying to do it. A super religion, make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to, without an atonement, and still have a covering. He tried to do it in the beginning, and he is still trying to do it.

L-67 But God's provided way was an atonement, and it'll never work no other way. It has to come back to an atonement.

L-68 Nimrod tried to build a super tower, a religious tower. Whether there would be anybody that would... A little tower might have been thirty feet high, but he wanted to make something super, something greater, so he built him a tower. That was in his day. [Genesis 10:7-9]

L-69 Nebuchadnezzar wanted to build a super city. He took the pattern off of Heaven, the swinging gardens, the river Euphrates, by the throne; just like the Water of Life, the River of Life, running by the Throne of God. He tried to make a super city. [Revelation 22:1]

L-70 The United States, a few years ago, tried to make a super ship. They made it, so they said, "It would never sink. It couldn't be sank." God put the Titanic in the bottom of the sea. Shows that man's achievements will never amount to anything. It's all dust and going back to the dust, what's in him.

L-71 Russia, today, is trying to raise up a super scientist that can do some scientific things, to conquer the world.

L-72 France, not long ago, thought they could still have their women, wine, and big time; so they made themself, called, a Maginot Line, had their guns all towards Germany, the archenemy. "If they ever come this way! We'll just live any way we want to. And we'll make a big super line out here, make it out of concrete, point our guns. If they ever come, we'll touch a button; it'll all fire and blow them back in Germany." Germany marched right around behind it. They forgot.

L-73 So have we forgot! God, with His mighty hand, shows this world it cannot stand. But they want a super sign.

L-74 They made them a Maginot Line, and Germany marched right up behind it, because they forgot. So, they could put the gun on a turret, could roll it back around the other way and shoot. They forgot that.

L-75 That's just what the church is forgetting today. They got a super church. They got a super denomination. They got super-dressed people. They got everything they want, and super ministers with super education. But you forget that God's Word cannot fail. It's got to come the way God said it was going to come. There is no way of getting around it.

L-76 Along come Germany, later on. They thought that was a good idea, so they would fix it so they could turn their guns the other way. So they built themselves a line, called the Siegfried Line, but American blockbusters blowed them out of the ground. See? They're trying to make something super, super, all the time.

L-77 Churches today wanting their super denomination. We've tried for a long time, Methodists take all, Baptists take all. Then the Pentecostal come in the race, they take all. Catholics try to take all. So they find out, a little scattered group, they can't do it. But put them together, how Scriptural it sounds! "Put us together! Put us together, we'll do it then. We'll run communism out in the ocean."

L-78 Not knowing that God raised up communism to defeat them. That's a big word for a preacher to say. But I get so sick of hearing this, "Communism! Communism!" You know the signs of communism. But the hour you're living in, you don't know nothing about it. Don't you know God promised to do that? The same as He started, raise up Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel, because they didn't walk in His way. The Bible plainly teaches that, and this is the hour for it to happen.

L-79 We find out, in the day that we're living, all these things. They're not nothing hid, it's something that God has 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min revealed in the Word, but people are too blind to see it.

L-80 Today we think, "Well, now, if we can all get together in the unity there is, or in a council, 'the multitude of counsel there is safety.'"

L-81 That is true, but what kind of a multitude are you counseling in? How can you walk together? How can you throw these denominations together? Some of them believers, and some unbelievers, and some make-believers, how you going to put them together and walk together? "How can two walk together except they be agreed?" it's also written. Look at here what they do, they make themself a multitude. [Amos 3:3]

L-82 One time they did the same thing in the Bible, when Ahab was in trouble, and, or Ahab sent down for Jehoshaphat to come down from--from Judaea and--and to find out if he would take his armies and help him fight the battle. And Jehoshaphat, a believer out of connection with his God, went down there and said, "Yes." [I Kings 22:30-32]

L-83 Said, "There is a piece of ground up there that belongs to us. That's ours. God gave it to us. The prophet Joshua lotted us that ground, and now we find out that it belongs to the enemy. The enemy is growing wheat on there, that should go in the bellies of us Hebrews, and now they're taking it over there with the enemy." Said, "Shall we go up? Will you go up with me?"

L-84 Well, now, Jehoshaphat, not taking a second thought, said, "Why, sure. My chariots is your chariots. My horsemen is your horsemen. My footmen is your footmen. We are brothers. Let's agree together, we'll make an alliance and we'll go up." Then it struck him, "We had better seek God, first." Oh, my! [II Samuel 8:4]

L-85 Before you join that thing, you better seek God, first. You better find out before you throw your church in such a Babylon as that. You'll have to do it, or either take the mark of the beast. But go ahead.

L-86 They said, Ahab said, "Certainly, I ought to have thought of that." Said, "I've got four hundred down here at the seminary, Hebrew prophets, the best there is in the country. There is no better, anywhere. We'll go get them."

L-87 And up come the prophets, and they all prophesied. Sure, they was exactly with the--the right idea, they thought. They said, "Certainly, that belongs to Israel. If God gave that to Israel, it belongs to Israel."

L-88 But God only gives you these things on conditions. That's what I think about the gifts of the Spirit, in the Church, today. So many says it needs to be in there. But it'll only come in there under conditions.

L-89 A noted minister said to me, not long ago, "Won't you quit picking on them women and men, about this, that, or the other?" Said, "They'd regard you as a seer, or prophet." Said, "Why don't you teach them how to receive the Holy Ghost and great gifts?" I said, "What would they do with them?"

L-90 Said, "You, you ought to teach them better things than trying to tell them how to cut their hair and wear their clothes, and so forth like that. You shouldn't do that."

L-91 I said, "How am I going to teach them algebra when they won't even listen to their ABC's?" See? How you going to do that? They got the... God gives these gifts on conditions.

L-92 And that land belonged to Israel, on conditions that it stayed true to God. But look what a renegade they had in there for a pastor, just letting idolatry and everything else be swept in. But the prophets, thinking that that belonged to God, belonged to Israel, was a gift to Israel, they ought to possess it. That's the same thing taking place today.

L-93 But remember when they all prophesied with one accord, and one of them, I believe, Zedekiah, made him a great big set of iron horns. He said, "You'll take these and push the Syrians plumb out of the country, with them." [I Kings 22:11]

L-94 And it just didn't suit this religious, good, moral man, Jehoshaphat. He said, "Well, haven't you got one more?"

L-95 "One more, when we got four hundred? Four hundred, with one accord, say, 'We'll have the Council of Churches. We'll--we'll just do it.'" See, they were all in unity. Said, "They're, every one, in agreement." Said, "Why don't you go 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min ahead then and just go on up with me?"

L-96 He said, "Isn't there just one more that you could consult about this, that has contact with God?" [I Kings 22:10]

L-97 He said, "Yes, there is one more, but I sure hate him." That's it. [I Kings 22:7]

L-98 "Oh, let not the king say so," said Jehoshaphat. "Let--let's go consult him and--and see what it would be."

L-99 He said, "There is one, yeah, I know him, the son of Imlah," said, "Micaiah. But," said, "I hate him." Said, "He is always putting curses on me. He is always telling me I'm wrong and--and hell is waiting for me." Said, "I hate to even hear him preach. None of the rest of the ministers won't even have him in their churches." Said, "We've kicked him out, a long time ago, out of the association." Said, "I don't even know where you'd find him." "Oh," he said, "don't let the king say so. Let's go get him." [I Kings 22:9]

L-100 So then one of the association went after him. He said, "Now, Micaiah, you've got a chance to get your membership card back again, if you'll say the same thing they say. See, if you just will do it, if you'll agree with us, that we all should join the council and all go in together, we'll just... you'll be one of us."

L-101 Oh, but God's always got somebody who will stand true. He said, "As the Lord God lives, I'll only say what He tells me to say." Amen. [I Kings 22:16]

L-102 That was the sign to Jehoshaphat. You know how the story goes. And he said, "Why, God said!" Although four hundred in a council was against him, yet he stood. And it was a sign to Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat wouldn't go out there. [I Kings 22:6]

L-103 So we find out how the outcome was, because that man's word was exactly with the prophet's word that had been prophesied for Ahab's day, "Because he took the righteous Naboth and slayed him, and things, God told him, through the prophet Elijah, that, 'The dogs will lick your own blood,' that's right, and what would take place, and how they'd eat Jezebel." He prophesied. That was the Word, and Micaiah was the one who could bring it to pass. Amen. [I Kings 21:19]

L-104 He was a prophet sign of that day, if they'd only listened to him. It has never failed. God always sends it.

L-105 Everybody is always wanting a sign. We're supposed to look for signs. That's right. But religious... Scriptural signs, not religious signs; Bible signs.

L-106 Everybody was going to look for a sign, and they knowed this would be a super day, God seeing the end from the beginning, so He said, "I'll give them a sign, a super sign. I'll give them an Eternal sign." Amen. "I'll give them one that will never fail and never pass away." Amen. "They want a sign, so I'm going to give them one, a super sign." [I Kings 13:3]

L-107 He didn't come in the polish of the world, the way they expected Him to come. But what did He say? "A virgin shall conceive." Amen. That was a sign. That was a super sign. "A virgin shall conceive." Amen. A super, a super sign; not a natural sign, but a super sign; a virgin conceiving, see, a supernatural sign. Supernatural! It was a super sign, for a virgin had never did it before, but, "She shall conceive." [Matthew 1:23]

L-108 What was it to be? "His Name shall be called Immanuel." How will it be? "God and man will become one." That's the super sign. [Matthew 1:23]

L-109 O God, if the world could only see that, that God and man are one! The super sign was that first Man that God could come into; all that God was He poured into Christ. And all Christ was He poured into the Church. Super sign, God and man, together, that was to be the super sign of the last day, when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days.

L-110 A super sign, "A virgin shall conceive. And this conception, when It's brought forth, will be God manifested in the flesh," a super sign. They still don't believe it, but it was anyhow. It's still a super sign. [Matthew 1:23]

L-111 Notice, super sign! They've got super man today, they got fictions of super man, all these other kind of super things. But the Church has got a super sign, God back in the Church, manifested in human flesh. God united with man, His sure super sign! 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-112 Notice the Eternal sign, an unfailing sign, It will never fail. Man and... The Word and man become one. When God's Word and man become one, as St. John the 1st chapter says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," that's the super sign. [John 1:1, 14]

L-113 Oh, if that was the super sign of that day, when that same Spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into His Church, to manifest the written Word for today, that is still the super sign.

L-114 The church can have the sign of the Council, all of them getting together for a fake world peace, and all they want to be. The Baptists can say, "We got a million more in '44." The Methodists can make any kind of brags they want to, Oneness, or Trinities, whatever they may be.

L-115 But the super sign is, still, God ever remains true to that super sign: it's God in man, manifesting His written Word. His Word, "When He the Holy Ghost is come upon you, He'll reveal these things, show them to you, and will show you things to come." Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." Exactly. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-116 Abraham's super Seed, He was, super Son. Abraham had one son, he begot that by the natural flesh, that was Isaac. Then he had another Son, and that Son was by faith, that was Jesus; He was the Son of Abraham, Son of David, Son of God. He foresaw it in the vision. Faith in His promised Word, showed in the last... to show forth, in these last days, Abraham. We're supposed to be Abraham's Seed. If we are dead in Christ, we are Abraham's Seed; and heir with Him, according to the promise. Now, why was this super sign given to Abraham? Because that it would bring forth the super sign of the last day. It has to be displayed.

L-117 God showed Abraham the end from the beginning, and what was going to take place; God manifested in Man, His super faith Son. Man that could not destroy this Son; they could destroy Isaac, they could destroy Jacob, and the successors after them, but this super Son could not be destroyed. Abraham, the Seed of Abraham, this faith, that, not the natural seed, but the faith that Abraham received, not by the law of circumcision; but by the faith in the Word, Abraham's super faith Son, which was Jesus Christ. Now, all his other sons died, but this Son could not be killed. He was killed, but could not stay dead. The grave could not hold Him. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-118 Notice Genesis 22:16 and 17, up on the mount where God showed Abraham to go, and there He saw a ram hooked by his horns, in the wilderness. Notice, quickly now. After he had took Isaac and bound him, which was his natural son, laid him upon the--the altar, to take his life; and then he started to take his life, in obedience of love to God. And, when he did, something happened. He heard a Voice, saying, "Abraham, stay your hand, for I know that thou loves Me." And then he heard a--a ram blat, hooked by its horns in the wilderness, behind him. And he called the name of the place Jehovah-jireh. [Genesis 22:12, 13]

L-119 Notice, God said, "And your seed," the seed of Abraham now, "would possess the gates of its enemies." He would take the gates, possess the gates. He promised it. Now, his natural seed did just that. All of Abraham's natural seed was the prophets that come after him. [Genesis 22:17]

L-120 There was Moses, Abraham's seed, and, when he did, he came to the gate, in a line of duty. He come to the gate of the Red Sea, after teaching the children of Israel of the promised land that God had promised. He was God's prophet. He had been manifested before the people, as God's prophet. God created, by him. God did all kinds of signs and wonders, by him. And he stayed just exactly with God's Word, because he sought God, first. And he knew his position. He knowed he was born for that age, to manifest the Word of God at that time. And then, right in the line of duty, he come up against something that he knowed not what to do, that was the Red Sea. Well, what happened? The seed of Abraham was promised to possess the enemies' gates. So when the Red Sea become a gate that he couldn't come through, God moved upon the scene and took the gate and went away with it, and Moses walked across the sea on dry land. His seed possessed the gate. [Exodus 14:14-31]

L-121 The Hebrew children possessed the gates at the fiery furnace that could not even burn them. [Daniel 3:19-28]

L-122 Daniel possessed the enemies' gates at the lions' mouths that could not be opened to eat him. [Daniel 6:16-23] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-123 Samson, one time caught in the... A bunch of people had fenced him in the city. And, when he did, he pulled those great big gates out of the rocks, put them upon his shoulders and walked up the top of the hill. Why was he? He was still in the covenant, his locks was still hanging on him. The promise was still there, "And he'll possess the gates of his enemy." Amen. Sure, certainly. [Judges 16:3] All these died, fine warriors of the faith. They all died.

L-124 Then come on the scene the super Seed of Abraham, the royal Seed, the super, royal Seed, Jesus Christ, which was Abraham's faith Son; that he saw by faith, through a promise of God, that he would bless all, be the father of many nations. His super Seed come on the scene.

L-125 What did these others do? They possessed the gates of lions, the gates of fire, the gates of the sea, the gates of the city. And everywhere they come, they was able to possess the gates because they were promised it. But, when it come to death, they all had to die. [Hebrews 11:32-40]

L-126 Now here comes the royal Seed on. Not only did He possess the gates of the enemy, but He possessed the gates of death, hell, and the grave, rose up on the third day and opened up the way; rent the veil from top to bottom, and made a way for every man or woman who desired to come to Him, could come. He possessed the gates. Not only did He that; but those who had died, in faith, He led captivity captive, ascended on High, and give gifts unto men. That's Abraham's super Seed. That's the royal Seed, Jesus Christ, the super sign. Remember, it was an everlasting sign, a supernatural everlasting sign, Jesus was. He arose from the dead, they could not hold Him. Death, hell, nor the grave, could not hold Him. [Luke 18:33], [Luke 24:7, 46], [Revelation 1:18], [Psalms 68:18]

L-127 Hebrews 13:8, as I said, "He's the same yesterday, today, and ever," to show, to show this super sign in this age. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-128 Watch, let's take the path of Abraham, just for a moment, a type of his seed. Abraham, the prophet, watch. God had spoken to him in many ways since he had left the Chaldea, the city of Ur. He had traveled along. And God had showed him many great signs, appeared to him, showed him all kinds of things that would happen, told him what would take place. All these things He had told him. But before he received his promised son, he was standing near the gates of the Gentiles, just above Sodom. And before he received his--his super son, or his son that was to be borned a super son, of course, before he received him (not the royal One now), but, before he received him, he received the super sign.

L-129 What was it? God came down to him, in the form of a Man. Notice that Man that talked with him, that stood at the tent where he was at and performed a super sign.

L-130 And when his super Son came on the scene, his super Son performed the same sign, to show that He was Abraham's super Seed. Glory!

L-131 And He promised the same thing in the last days. Do you see what I mean? Abraham, before, just before the promised son arrived; as we're looking for now, Abraham's Seed, royal Seed. That was the natural seed; this is the royal Seed. When the natural seed got their sign, they--they rejected it; so have, will... nothing but the Royal Seed, still that church seed will reject It again. They've always done it. But, notice, what kind of a sign was it?

L-132 Let's just look and see what the super sign was. There was a Man came up, three of them. And did you notice, when--when Abraham saw three men coming, he went out and he said, "My Lord, will You pass by me? Come in and sit down. Let me fetch a little water and wash Your feet. And take a morsel of bread, then go about Your business." He saw three coming, and called the three, One, "Lord." [Genesis 18:2, 3, 4]

L-133 Lot, the church nominal, down--down there in Sodom, he saw two coming, and he said, "My lords."

L-134 Abraham knowed "these three are one." There was actually only One, of them. Watch, two of them went down in Sodom, and the One stayed with him. He said, "My Lord." Notice the One that stayed with him; Abraham, being a type of the called-out, not in Sodom, the elected for that hour. [Genesis 18:3]

L-135 Now, remember, the Gentiles were fixing to be burned, just like it is now. The Gentile world is to be destroyed by 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min fire. We know that.

L-136 Now watch the super sign. God came down in the form of a Man and performed a sign, with His back turned to the tent, and asked where Sarah was. And Abraham said, "She is in the tent behind You." [Genesis 18:9, 10]

L-137 And He said, "I am going to visit you according to the time of life." Watch that "I," see, "I will visit you."

L-138 And, watch, He didn't call him Abram. Just a few days before that, he was Abram. But God changed his name, in the Spirit, talking to him. But here is God in flesh; had just eat a calf that Abraham killed, drinking the milk from the cow, and eat bread. Think of it. A Man, dusty clothes, dirty feet, amen, God! You say, "That wasn't God."

L-139 Abraham said It was, he said He was "Elohim," the One that created the heavens and the earth, the all-sufficient One, God in a human form. Amen.

L-140 And He performed a sign to Abraham, to let him know that, that the Gentile world was at end. And He was that super Seed. He said, "Where is Sarah?" Said, "She is in the tent behind You." He said, "I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." [Genesis 18:9, 10]

L-141 And Sarah did something. She kind of laughed. He said, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'These things can't be'?" He perceived the thoughts that was in Sarah's mind, in the tent behind Him. And he knew that was God. [Genesis 18:10, 13]

L-142 Now look. Jesus, when He come on the earth, He was that super Seed. And, when He come, He declared to the people the very same thing. Is that right? Now, knowing that this end time was coming, and said, "The things that I do shall you the same, because God said I'm going to give you an Eternal, everlasting sign." Amen. There is the super sign. [John 14:12]

L-143 Look at the track of the church. It's come up through Luther, Wesley, Pentecostals, denominations. We've had revelations and all other kinds of things. We had speaking in tongues. We've had gifts of healing. We have everything manifested.

L-144 But, look, right at the end time, before the burning and the destroying, the super sign appears mysteriously, right on the scene again before us, amen, God Himself. Not a man, but God made manifest; a super sign, an everlasting sign, an Eternal sign, a super sign, God manifested in the flesh! Same sign that His Son did, His super Son promised the same at the end, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the Coming of the Son of man." The super sign will return. [Luke 17:26]

L-145 We've had all these other things, the path of Abraham's royal Seed has come up that same path that Abraham come up.

L-146 But just before the destroying of the world, the super sign must appear again, an Eternal, everlasting resurrection sign that proves that the royal Seed could not be killed like Daniel and like the rest of the prophets was. The grave couldn't hold Him. Because He... The others conquered the gates of the enemy, such as fire, and lion, and--and sword, and so forth. They conquered that. But this royal Seed conquered death, hell, and the grave. Nothing could hold Him. Why? He's an everlasting super sign! What is a super sign? The resurrection of Jesus Christ, after being dead for two thousand years, still stands in the midst of us, the same as He did then, manifesting Himself in His Church, in human flesh. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. [Revelation 1:18], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-147 "A virgin shall conceive. And from that time, God and man will be one, united together," an everlasting, Eternal sign, a super sign. He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today! You may ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart. [Matthew 1:23] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-148 I see Him among us. All of His elected Seed will see it. Yes, sir.

L-149 The elected in His day saw it. The predestinated got to see it. In the midst of unbelief, they still believed it. They set right amongst unbelievers and still confessed it publicly, "Yeah, You are the Son of God, the King of Israel." Oh, my!

L-150 Right in amongst thousands of unbelievers, one man, by the name of Simon Peter, walked out. And He said, "Your name is Simon, and you're the son of Joseph." What was that? That super sign. There was the Prophet standing there, there was the super sign, and Simon Peter accepted it regardless of what anybody said. The big old husky bully become a meek lamb before God. [John 1:42]

L-151 Notice, there was Nathanael, a teacher, a scholar indeed, who believed God. And Philip went over and brought him back from his--his city, brought him over. When he come where Jesus was standing, Jesus said, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile." [John 1:47]

L-152 He said, "Rabbi, when did You know me? This is astonishing. I've heard my great-great-great-great-grandfathers talk about So-and-so and So-and-so, way back. I never heard of it in my... How did You know me?" [John 1:48]

L-153 Jesus said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." A super sign! Amen. Priests and rabbis was finished. There was God's Eternal super sign. Yes. [John 1:48]

L-154 He had to go by Samaria. Remember, there is three races of people; Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people. He went by the Samaritans. There come a little woman out, at the well, to get some water. Jesus, as soon as He spoke to her, said, "Bring Me a drink." [Genesis 6:10], [John 4:7]

L-155 She said, "You have nothing to draw with," and so forth. And the conversation went on. They talked about the racial problem, and so forth. [John 4:11]

L-156 After a while, He said to her, "Go get your husband and come here." [John 4:16]

L-157 Now she said, ("this Man is trying to get smart with me,") see, "I don't have any husband." [John 4:17]

L-158 Said, "You've told the truth. You've had five, and the one you're living with now is not your husband." Super sign! [John 4:18]

L-159 Listen at her, "Sir, I perceive that Thou art a Prophet," super sign, a manifestation of the Word for that day. Watch. "You're a Prophet, but I don't see in the Bible where any prophet is supposed to be at this time. But we are looking for the Messiah, and, when He comes, He will manifest God's promised Word. That will be Him." [John 4:19, 25, 26]

L-160 That poor little woman knowed more about God than half the preachers of the day, in that estate. Why? She was predestinated to it. When that Light struck it, that seed come to Life. You can't hide it. No.

L-161 Look at Nathanael, he didn't care--he didn't care who stood there. He stood right before his priest and all, said, "Rabbi, You're the Son of God. You are the King of Israel that we look for." He saw the super sign. [John 4:25]

L-162 This little woman, in the midst of all the trouble she was in, run down through the city, and said, "Come see a Man that's told me what I've done. Isn't this the very Messiah? Isn't that what we're looking for?" Super sign! [John 4:29]

L-163 Now, remember, the Gentiles never got it then, but they have to receive it 'cause God can't change His continuity. He has to. Remember, He promised it. He said He would do it. He promised He would do it. And in the last days, He would do it. Jesus said so, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man." We are promised, in the last days, according to Malachi 4, that someone would raise up in the last days that would try to bring back, and shake back all the coldness and all their traditions, and things, "and restore the Faith of the people back to the apostolic fathers again, to the original Word." Yes. You say, "That was--that was Elijah in John." Oh, no, not. [Luke 17:26], [Malachi 4:6]

L-164 Elijah in John's time was Malachi 3, "I send My messenger before My face." [Malachi 3:1]

L-165 Because, immediately after this prophecy went forth, the whole world was burnt up. Two thousand years has 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min passed, and the world wasn't burnt up. "And the righteous walk out on the dust of the--of the ashes of the wicked." [Malachi 4:3]

L-166 Brother, sister, we are living in the days of super markets, super jets, super highways, super races, super everything else. And there is a super sign! We've had the sign of religion. We've had the sign of revivals. We've had the sign of getting together. We've had the sign of speaking in tongues. We've had the sign of healing the sick. We've had all these signs.

L-167 But, yet, we find in the Bible that, the last sign before the promised Son arrived, it was a super sign. Jesus said, "As it was then; before the promised Son arrives again, that super sign would come on the earth again." I declare to you, tonight, in the Name of Jesus Christ, it's on earth now. Not only that, but it's right here among us tonight. The Holy Ghost, God's super sign, the resurrected Jesus Christ, It cannot fail. It's an Eternal sign. It can never be changed. "Heavens and earth will pass away, but That'll never change." It's an Eternal, everlasting sign, God manifested in human flesh. God made Hisself known in human flesh. [Luke 21:33]

L-168 Do you believe that to be the Truth? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] With all your heart, you believe it? ["Amen."] Don't shut yourself up like a turtle in a shell. If there is any turtle in you, take the shell out. Let the Holy Spirit come in. Don't close yourself to some creed or denomination. Brother, sister, the hour has arrived. I believe that God has done as much as He's going to do. The next thing is action of the church or either we're going to be lost.

L-169 I just ask anybody to dispute that to be so. I've asked it around and around the world, and not one time has everybody, anybody ever tried it. They know better. They know better, because it's the Word, and God proves It's His Word. Then why not accept it? Amen. If it's the time, don't put it off too long.

L-170 Many people wanted to accept Jesus. They thought they would do it, "in some other convenient time," one said. They want accept Christ, but they put it off too long. Some of them tried to get Him off their hands, and tried to wash it off with water, pass the buck on to somebody else, but it backfired.

L-171 It's on your hands, tonight, throwed right back in your lap! Hebrews 13:8, regardless of how many Council of Churches we have, still remains as "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." "The works that I do!" If--if His Life is in you, it'll manifest Jesus Christ. Amen. [Hebrews 13:8]

L-172 Now you all can't be that one, but you can be a part of that, with your faith.

L-173 All of them couldn't be a Jesus, when they was on earth, but they could believe Him and accept the message. There was one Moses, one Elijah, one Noah, on down, always been that, but the rest of them could accept it. And they woul had no ministry unless there had been somebody believe it. Jesus would had no ministry unless somebody believed it. Paul would had no ministry unless somebody believed it.

L-174 The Holy Ghost has got no ministry by the Word, today, unless somebody is willing to get away from their creed and come back to the Word again, no matter how well it's here and how real it's here. It's here now. I know it's here. I feel it. I know it's here. The Word says it's here. "Wherever two or three are gathered in My Name, I am in the midst of them." And I truly believe that He is here, "the same yesterday, today, and forever." [Matthew 18:20], [Hebrews 13:8]

L-175 Oh, if I could get this little tabernacle... I love you. And I don't believe there is a man on earth that I could say I loved any better than Jack Moore, and, that's right, Young Brown, and Lyle, and these men here. I read an article today, that Anna Jean wrote, I was going to ask her permission to reprint it again, of the nice things that they can say. And--and, look, but if you don't wake up, quickly, it's going to be too late. The Life Tabernacle, I'm part of you, and that's the reason I cry out. Year by year, I find it cooling. You might not notice it, you live right in it, but stay on the field and then return back with the memories of the year before. Didn't I tell you that out there in that little tent, one night, "From this hour on"? What'd I say about Shreveport when that woman give me that dirty write-up that time?

L-176 Remember what I said that time about the United States, three or four years ago, five, then run all through the papers? I said, "This year the United States will accept the Gospel or they'll never do it." They've declined since that time. And there will never be a--a big revival in America no more like that. If you believe me to be a prophet, you remember that's the Word of the Lord. Just watch and see if it isn't dying. The churches are dying. They are withering 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min away. And it kills me, inside of me, to know that, men and women that I love better than I love my own life, that I've give my life.

L-177 I've come among you as your brother, not your God; your brother, not your enemy; your brother! I've told you the Truth, and God has declared the same. With every word I've preached, He's declared it to be the... exactly the Truth. [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Then why not accept It, brother, sister? In the love of Jesus Christ, why don't you accept It? If you will just believe that to be the Truth, just accept It to be the Truth, that's all I ask you to do.

L-178 Let's bow our heads just a moment. I'm going to stop there on them notes right there. I said I was going to make an altar call, and let Billy Paul give out prayer cards. We didn't have any prayer cards, tonight, it was too late to give them out. I--I forgot my promise. I'll have him here tomorrow night, about six o'clock. We don't need the prayer cards, anyhow. I've always tried to get you away from that tradition, always of laying hands on like the Jews did. Jairus said, "Come lay Your hands on my daughter and she'll live." The Roman said, "Just speak the word," that was the Gentile way of believing it. [Luke 8:50]

L-179 If I've told you the Truth, now listen to this challenge; if I have told you the Truth, then I've got to stand here on this platform before you and tell you this. And what good does it do to tell you, if God isn't in it? And if it's God's Truth, He's--He's duty bound to back It up. He's got to back It up. He promised He would.

L-180 But are--are we going to sit numb like? Has the Spirit... Is it "Ichabod" on the Life Tabernacle? Has that been wrote across the tabernacle? Has that been wrote across the churches that I've been visiting across the nation? Is it so dark and dense now that that "one here and one there; one in the field, 'I'll take one,' and maybe one over across the other side of the world, and, 'I'll take one'"? "As it was in the days of Noah, wherein eight souls were saved by water, so shall it be in the coming of the Son," have we reached that place? [Luke 17:26]

L-181 Has the ministry of Jesus Christ, in this day, patterned the day that He was here when He preached first? When He was a young Galilean Prophet, everybody wanted Him in their church, when He healed the sick, and everything. But when He went to prophesying and rebuking them, and calling them "a bunch of vipers," right then He started declining, and finally led to His crucifixion, assassination.

L-182 But, remember, He had another ministry, He preached to the Eternal lost and damned, that didn't repent in the days that they had a chance to repent. Will that ministry return like that, that the ministry will continue to go on to a lost and damned people, where there is no mercy to be gotten for them? Think of it, what if it could.

L-183 You say, "Is it, Brother Branham?" I don't know. It could be later than we think.

L-184 If you see the shadow of anything, you know what it will be when it be positive. You had your hands up, and see four fingers, five fingers, whatever your hand will be when the negative is made positive, that's what it is in the shadow.

L-185 Believe, friends. Oh, God help you! My, how many times... You've bought me suits of clothes. I have, out yonder now, presents, boxes of candy, buckets of syrup. You've even give, my--my family, towels; my children, clothes. You've fed me. You've done everything that you could do. And now let me do something for you. Let--let--let's let...

L-186 Oh, if God could only break in, some way, right now! To you upstairs, downstairs, wherever you are, in the balcony, if God doesn't back up what I say, then I've lied. But if He does back it up! I know you've seen a lot of carnal impersonations, but that ought to make the real thing shine better to you. Have faith, and believe.

L-187 Of course, there is not a prayer card in the building. If there is, raise your hand, ever who has got a prayer card from this meeting. See, there is not a one. But there is sick people sitting here. And if the Holy Spirit, right here on this platform, will reveal and go through this audience and around through here to you people...

L-188 Watch what the Bible said. What is the super sign? Is the Word made manifest in every age. Is that right? Well, why couldn't they believe Jesus? When, Hebrews 4 said that, "The Word of God is quicker, more powerful than a two-edged sword, cutting asunder." That is when It's preached in Its power, It cuts right and left, two-edged, cuts both ways. What is it? "Cuts plumb to the marrow of the bone." And what else does it do? "Discerns the thoughts that's in the heart." [Hebrews 4:12] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-189 Jesus standing there, and His prophecy cutting them religious people to pieces, and called them "a bunch of devils," upon people; and cried for their pardon when they crucified Him. [Luke 11:15]

L-190 As Brother Jack once said, made a remark, "His Own children crying for His Blood." That is right.

L-191 He was trying to save them from a devil's hell. And when they seen that discernment go on, why didn't know, they know that was God's super sign? The same reason the church don't know it today. But wherever that Light strikes on that predestinated seed, it'll come to Life. Yes, indeed, you can't keep it.

L-192 The solar sun up there, s-u-n, has control of all botany life. When a seed is laying there and that sun strikes it, it'll come to life. Yes, sir.

L-193 And the S-o-n of God is the controller of all Eternal Life. And if you've got a seed of Life in you, brother, when that S-o-n strikes there and shows you what He is, it comes to Life. There is no way of keeping it from it.

L-194 You believe now. Only believe. Have faith in God while we reverently pray.

L-195 Heavenly Father, here lays before me here a bunch of cloths, handkerchiefs. O God, everybody believes You as a healer. Sure. All full-Gospel people believe You that way. You're a healer, and You're so kind and merciful to them. Right in the hours of Your crucifixion, You still healed, put the--the Roman centurion's ear back on again, that Simon cut off with his sword. The enemy that come to get You, You were still kind and merciful to heal. You still do the same thing.

L-196 But, Lord, can the people's eyes come open and see that what we're trying to tell them, that it's--it's the end time! I pray, God, I pray in Jesus' Name, let it happen tonight, Lord. Let Life Tabernacle take on its name tonight, Life, Eternal Life. The whole group that's beneath its banners here tonight, may Life come, abundantly.

L-197 After the Word being layed out here, just as plain as It can be, the promise of the day, You promised It in this day. We're aware of that, Lord.

L-198 And we're Abraham's children, have come up, down through like Abraham did. From crossing over; profession. Coming over into a strange land; we did that, we've had visions and revelations, and everything, of God. How He has talked to us and healed us, and done the same things He did to Abraham! But at that end time, just before the promised Son, then God showed what the end time would be, by the super sign.

L-199 And then the super Seed, Jesus Christ, the faith Seed, comes down and does that same thing at the end of the Jews, as they did there at that end.

L-200 And now at the end of all things, He promised to come again. "As it was in the days of Noah, and in the days of Sodom." "The works that I do, shall you also." If His Life is in us, It reflects Him. It reflects the builder, the maker of the product; his work always reflects him, hisself. And God was reflected in Christ, "If you can't believe Me, believe the works." [Luke 17:26], [John 14:11, 12], [John 10:38]

L-201 And now I pray, God, that You'll heal each one of these that I pray over with sincerity. Heal them, Lord. Grant it.

L-202 And now, dear Heavenly Father, here I stand. I realize I--I can't be around here too much longer, and I see my natural life fading away. Help, tonight, Lord, this one time. Once more, Lord, grant that--that the people will forget the past now, and press towards the mark of the high calling. Grant it, Lord.

L-203 I'm going to ask You to do something that it's going to be a hard thing, Father. I realize that. But I'm going to ask You to let Jesus come into us. And, Father, just to anoint me, it wouldn't do much good for this congregation unless You anoint them, too. We--we are one, together. And anoint them with faith, that somebody here... There is surely somebody got enough faith to do that, like that woman that touched His garment. "And He is the High Priest right now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities," to show that He is still that super sign, God in man, God working through man, the illiterate and them who will forget theirselves, and just let the Spirit work through them. There is little women sitting in here, that is suffering, maybe, with the same thing that that woman had. There is Simons sitting in here, tonight, Lord, the--the sons of Jonases, as it was. They're sitting here. Help now, Lord, that the people might know. [Hebrews 4:15] 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-204 And answer my prayer as I... Not through emotion; I know I'm emotionally, but I'm all... I'm disturbed, Lord, as I see things going the way they do. It--it wearies me that the... Let the people get back to the Word, and forget all these fantastic things of the hour, the popular opinions of the world; come back to the Word, the Word manifested in the hour now that we're living. Grant it, Lord.

L-205 And while we have our heads bowed, I want each of you to pray, just--just simply. Don't... Just keep your heads bowed and just keep praying, say, "Lord, help me now."

L-206 And have something on your mind that you want to pray for. And if the Lord Jesus is still alive, then certainly, friends, that would be the super sign. And some people has said, "Oh, there is no doubt that can be done, Brother Branham has a great gift of the Lord. And I believe, when he's under the anointing, he's a prophet of the Lord, but don't you listen to his Teaching." Now anybody would do that, would say that, and supposed to be a scholar? When, that's the very sign that the Teaching is right, according to the Bible.

L-207 And if you're a sinner, the pool is waiting there. If you've never been baptized in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, the pool is waiting. If you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet, you must have that Token sign on you or you won't go through the Gate. You must be the Life of Christ in you.

L-208 Now you pray and ask God to help you, while we pray now. And the sisters at the--the instruments there, "Only Believe."

L-209 Just think, coming down the hill come Jesus. Just in your imaginary mind, see Him come walking in the door, and walk down here and stand up in the pulpit here, and saying, "Children." Just imagine it in your mind now.

L-210 And everybody be real reverent, and keep real still and pray. Everywhere, just keep praying, saying, "Lord Jesus, be merciful to me. Lord, I believe."

L-211 Father, God, they are quiet now. This solemn moment, I believe that You're here. I believe that, that great Pillar of Fire that led Israel through the wilderness, that was manifested in flesh. He said He was. "Before Abraham was, I AM. I come from God, and I go to God." [John 8:58]

L-212 After His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension; Paul met Him on the road, going down to Damascus. A great Light struck him down. That Hebrew would have never called Him "Lord" if he didn't know that was that same Pillar of Fire. "Who are You, Lord?" He said, "I am Jesus." [Acts 9:5]

L-213 And here You are tonight, with us, the same Life in us. I thank You for It, Father. Now let it be known that I've told the Truth. And it... That virgin conceiving, to bring man and God together, is the same sign that's among us tonight at the end of the age, the super sign. Let it be once more, Father. I pray through Jesus Christ's Name. Now just keep praying. [Matthew 1:23]

L-214 Now I take every spirit in here under my control, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now if you want to pray, continue pray; if you want to look up, do whatever you wish now. Keep holding your testimony. Keep holding your faith, if you're praying.

L-215 I see, out in front of me now, in this middle aisle here, a little lady, woman, sitting right back here, that's just bringing up her head; in this middle aisle, way back towards the back. She is suffering with a back trouble. Yes. Do you believe that God will heal your back? You do? All right. That's what you was praying about. Is that right? Raise up your hand. You're both healed. The lady right next to her had a back trouble, too, cause she raised her hand. I seen it come from her to her. Now, I don't know you, do I, neither one of you? But that's what was right. If that's right, raise your hand. Now is that the super sign?

L-216 Here, right straight back this aisle, on my... this side right back towards the back, there is a little woman that can't swallow, hardly. There is something wrong with her--with her--her swallow. She can't hardly swallow. But she believes. She is from out of town. Will you believe, sister, that you will be that you can swallow? Will you accept your 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min healing? Raise up your hand if you'll... All right, now you can be healed. Now, if that, if I'm a stranger to you, wave your hand like that. That's right, see. But, that's what, she was sitting there right then trying to swallow. Now, swallow now and you can swallow right. See if that's right.

L-217 Do you believe that the Angel of the Lord is here? Do you believe that, the super sign? Them people, all the way in the building. Somebody up here, close. I'll turn my back, just to let you know, in every figure, that It is the Lord Jesus. I'll turn my back. And somebody pray, believe. If you think I'm looking at you, to like reading your mind, or something, you just believe. If He could tell what that Sarah was praying about, or what she was doing in the tent behind Him, 'cause God was manifested in the flesh of a being, a human being that was eating, drinking, a sign! I've told you it was a super sign.

L-218 Yes, here is a man coming up before me now. He is standing right behind me. He is right back here. He is going blind. His name is Maclusky. If he will believe with all of his heart, God will heal him. Stand up. I never seen the man in my life. Believe, sir.

L-219 What about over in this way, will you believe over here? You believe with all your heart? You pray.

L-220 I see a woman, and she is suffering from something. She thinks it's epilepsy, because she blacks out. She come from the Southeast, from... She is from Florida. And her name is Mrs. Kinney. If you'll believe, Mrs. Kinney, and stand up on your feet, you'll be healed of them black-out spells. Stand on your feet. I never seen the woman in my life. She's a total stranger. Ask her.

L-221 Do you believe He is the super sign? What about in this section, do you believe?

L-222 A woman suffering, almost to a nervous breakdown, right over this way. Her name is Mrs. Jones. If she'll believe with all of her heart, she can be healed. Mrs. Jones, if you'll believe, and stand to your feet and believe that Jesus Christ makes you well, you can have your healing. She, a total stranger to me, I never seen her in my life. God knows that's true.

L-223 "A virgin shall conceive and shall bear a Son, and His Name shall be called Immanuel, which by interpretation is, 'God with us,'" God here in us, God's super sign! [Matthew 1:23]

L-224 Do you believe it? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Well, we're at the end time. If He is here, why don't you accept Him now? Do you see what ought to happen? You see what should take place? Every person right now should be totally healed. There is Somebody, there is Something here to do that. Everybody knows that.

L-225 God in Heaven knows I know none of these people. They're--they're total strangers. Ask them and see. I don't know nothing about them. I don't know who they are, where they come from, or nothing.

L-226 But if you'll take my word for it, if that's true, I'll say right now, to you, the Holy Spirit is just circling this place around. That Light is just all around here. Now if the Word is right, and the Word is manifested before you, what's the matter that we don't receive It? What's next, brother?

L-227 You're in trouble, too, something about... Why, it's your wife. [Someone says, "Yes, sir."--Ed.] That's right. Just a minute till I see what it is. You've confessed it, let it go at that. I challenge you to believe God right now, the super sign!

L-228 Only thing I know about that boy, I shook his hands. I can't tell you his name right now. But that's exactly what's wrong. I know not that. I was there the day he was married, but something has happened. I don't want to say it here.

L-229 But, all right, don't you believe God? He said this super sign would take place. How many wants to see Him? Let's see your hand, say, "I, I'll believe Him." Amen. Downstairs, wherever you are, up in the balcony, remember God's super sign, the Word of promise, is made manifest right here today before you, this day.

L-230 Jesus read the Scriptures, and turned around and said, "This day this prophecy is fulfilled in the midst of you." [Luke 4:16-21]

L-231 I say, in Jesus Christ's Name, this day the end-time sign is manifested before you. 63-1129, The Super Sign, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 86 min

L-232 How many is sick? Raise your hands. In the Name of Jesus Christ, in His Presence, if you can believe what you've seen, to be the Truth and coming from God, I ask you in Jesus Christ's Name, stand up and accept It then, say, "I will accept It. I'll, it'll settle it for me. I believe." I don't care where you're at. That's good. Raise up your hands now. Now just give God praise. [Someone says, "Handkerchiefs?"--Ed.] I done prayed for them.

L-233 Now just praise Him, stand there. The super sign, the super sign right--right in the midst of you, God's super sign for the last day! Amen. God bless you, brother.
