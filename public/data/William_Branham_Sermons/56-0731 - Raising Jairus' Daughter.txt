--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Therefore, in praying for the sick, we like to make the--the service, the preaching service just as short as possible, because of--of keeping the prayer line going. And then I think it's much more forceful if we don't wear out just preaching. So... And as I've always said to pray for the sick in the manner of the gift that the Lord has given to me, His unworthy servant, I--I... My strength so quickly depletes anyhow in that, under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, that I like to put all my strength to the prayer for the sick. Now, that's what it's announced for. And now, it's... Maybe tomorrow night, I suppose maybe we'd better have prayer for the sick. I think it's kinda questionable before Brother Moore tonight anyhow about us having to leave tomorrow, and... For Canada or they would have to cancel the Canadian meeting, 'cause we won't have time to make it. That'll be the... Their decision. So now, we'll announce healing service or prayer for the sick tomorrow night anyhow. So now, you pray, and come early to get your tickets tomorrow night, and then we can announce farther from there the way the Lord has given it out to us.

L-2 And now, how many love Him? All of you love Him. Isn't He wonderful? We're so unworthy of these things. I just think of how good He is to let us fellowship with these great things, and we're so unworthy. I was thinking last night. I was so tore up when I come to the platform last night, and I didn't even have a text to read hardly, when I come here. That hot weather was just about to melt me. I'm coming down to Shreveport when it gets wintertime. We'll put up this tent out here in the wintertime, so we can really raise up the sides so we can just breeze again. I'll get a block of ice and set on it awhile...?... I tell you. I don't see how you live. Well, you're accustomed to it; that's all.

L-3 And up north, why, my, we just love that cold weather. I get up and have the services there, where they come to hear me preach in the sled domes. It's ten to fifteen below zero. Why, they just wrap up in them blankets, and come, and set out there, and every time I preach, they just look like they put off, they're going to freeze like that, and you blow your breath out. That's just right for me. I just love that. I've preached to Indians and them... See them come and set by the thousands, just set on the blankets like that, and just be way below zero. Oh, we don't pay no attention to that. Just set there, and little one get up, and put their little blanket around them, and set there and listen...?... I preached till look like it--it would... Your breath would be freezing as it went out, but if the... But when you come down into where you--you're perishing, that just makes a difference.

L-4 But now, it just seems vice versa to you all, but we love you. And, oh, if you'll only ask if...?... willing to move the north down to Shreveport here (See?), move the mountains to the north down to Shreveport here, I'd love to live in Shreveport for the people. The nicest people I've ever met in my life are these southern people. And I don't say that because I'm down here. I'd be a hypocrite, but that's right. I don't care... I went into a store; little old boy there about fourteen years old. In my country walk in just as... "Well, what do you want?" See? That'd been all of it. Never said, "Thank you. Come back again." Why, I thought that little boy was going to tell me I was his brother. I... Why, he was just so nice. He said, "Now, now come back and see us again."

L-5 Why, you know, there's just something that affects me. I like that. I like that old fashion kind, you know. Like they used to say... I was down in a meeting, down in Miami, Florida, one time. Brother Bosworth said, "Brother Branham," said, "As you go out in the back," said, "As you go through the little tent in the back," said, "They... The Duchess has let us have this ground here. Wants to shake hands with you." I said, "Well, who's she?" He said, "Why, she's a duchess." I said, "What's that?" And I didn't know where that was a different variety of woman or what it was...?... I said, "Tell 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min me." So he said, "No, she's a great woman." Uh-huh. So I said, "Well, now what about all these sick people that wants to see me though." Said, "Well, she just wants to shake your hand. She's just there at the door...?..."

L-6 So then I went out, there stood a woman. And my, my, if I had the money with all them diamonds she had on her fingers, I could missionary the world almost. Standing there, and she had a pair of specks on a stick. Yes, she did. Now, she didn't have them on her nose where they belonged. She had them on a stick. Had all kinds of bracelets around her arm, you know, like that, and she looked at me like this when I walked out. She said, "Are you Doctor Branham?" I said, "No, ma'am. I'm not." I said, "I'm Brother Branham." She said, "Well, I am charmed." And she raised her hand way up like this. And I... You know who'd want... You know how you... Now, she was just putting-on. You know human beings don't act like that naturally, do they? Is that right? Now, they don't. Now, "I am charmed." Now, what did I know about that, a Kentucky hillbilly? So I--I looked at her, and I said... I got a hold of her big fat hand, and I said, "Well, get down here so I know you when I see you. " Now, that's... You know, I think people just putting-on. Now, I like their good old southern pump handle handshake...?... I like that. I really do. Said, "Hello, dere preachur."...?...

L-7 My wife one time, we was riding downtown. Oh, it's been two or three years ago, and there was a young lady on the street which knew her. She said, "Hello, Sister Branham." And Meda was looking that way. And I--I didn't hear her speak to her. And I said, "Hey, that--that--that girl spoke to you." Said, "I spoke to her." I said, "I didn't hear you, and I'm sure she didn't." And--and said, "Well," she said, "I--I--I smiled at her." And I said, "You mean to tell me a little silly grin will take the place of...?..." I--I--I like to hear you say it, don't you." I like to not grin about it. Just really say it out...?... and I just like that way that you all have around here. See? Up from the north you're cold and different way... I went to visit my uncle, and they went in to a--to a place, and I said, "Uncle Charlie, who lives over..." I said, "You know who's that's the neighbor." "Yeah." And I said, "How long you lived here?" Said, "Twenty years." I said, "Who is he?" Said, "I don't know." I said, "You don't know. Has he lived here as long as you?" "Yeah." Oh, my, my. I'd have to get acquainted with him or something in that much time. And so, they don't say nothing to one another up there. They don't talk to each other. So this is at Plattsburgh, New York. And so that's now, the Catholic side of our family come. And my great aunt founded the convent at Montreal and is buried there. And so they were real royal Catholics.

L-8 So then coming... I said, "Uncle Charlie, I want to get some thirty-two specials for my rifle. I'm going deer hunting." And he said, "Well, go downtown for a certain store I could get it." So, I said, "All right." Now, I went out, and I couldn't find the place, so I looked around. There was a--a man standing on the corner. He looked like an intelligent looking gentleman. I said, "How do you do?" Looked at me, and started walking on down the street, and I thought, "Well, something wrong. Maybe it was me." So I walked up, and it was a fellow walking out a cigar shop; and he was striking his match for his cigar, and he had on a little derby hat and dressed up like a gentleman. Said, "Good morning, sir. Could you tell me where such-and-such a hardware store?" He straightened up. I looked at him. Started walking on. I said, "Somebody's crazy. It might be me." 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min So I--I--I just don't like that. I--I like to... Why, even here your police will try to direct you around and everything. I like what you got, a wonderful group of people. If you just had some good cool weather, it would be fine.

L-9 So, Brother Jack, gives me the assurance that it's going to be cool. So--so... But the one thing about it, friends, and everywhere you go when you meet borned-again children of God, they're all the same, no matter what country. We've went into the Hottentots of Africa to... And we've went into the Germans; we've went to the French; we've went to the Swiss; we've went to the Swedes, the Norwegians, and Finns, and everywhere around the world, about. And everywhere you meet borned-again Christians, they everyone act alike. Yes, sir. They've been borned again. That's what makes it. So they all get that good southern spirit on them. Somebody said "Amen" to that. I said that good southern spirit. That's what they get, so that's very fine.

L-10 Now, we're going to approach His Word tonight, and read from His Word, and get right into the service. Now, I want you to pray for me now as we go into the Word. But first of all, let's--let's address Him and...?... let us have His grace...?... His Word. Something went wrong somewhere. [Microphone made a loud noise--Ed.] Brother L. T.? Now, he's supposed to be my partner. See? One time down in Texas where the Angel of the Lord had His picture taken up where He was standing, that the Pillar of Fire. Well Brother L. C., the Baptist preacher, walked over and slapped another man right in the mouth, and Brother L. T. had his picture in the paper next day holding them apart, so... and then come and step on the something down there to... Oh, is it me doing it? Oh, you got it there? I don't want to condemn him unjustly. No, sir. He's a good brother. So I see Anna Jean smiling tonight. I... Have you heard from Brother Don today? No? That's all right. Faith is what we believe. If God will give Brother Don a safe trip, a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit down there where he's going in South America. All right. Shall we bow our heads now for a word of prayer.

L-11 Most gracious Lord, these happy-hearted people tonight, full of joy is, because of Your Presence and Your visitation to us. We thank You for sending the air conditioning tonight, fixed it up for us, so we could feel most comfortable to worship Thee. We pray tonight, God, that You'll forgive us of every sin, every shortcoming that we have in life. We pray that Your great grace will reach down and forgive us. Forgive every sin that's under the tent tonight, God, we... I pray as standing between the living and dead, that You will forgive every trespass. And all of our little differences, we pray that--that You'll just forgive us for having those things, and lay it aside and worship Thee tonight in Spirit and Truth. When the prayer's line called, O God, make Your choice. Call every one we pray tonight and heal every sick person. Save every sinner tonight. Call back every backslider to the way of truth and life, for we ask it in the Name of Thy beloved Child, Lord Jesus. Amen. I feel so, the Presence of the Lord so close tonight. I believe we could just--just start a prayer line without saying anything out of the Word. Just to read a portion of His Word here and talk just for a few moments on an incident that happened in the Bible. We find this in Saint Luke the 8th chapter, and we'll begin at the 48th verse and read just a little portion of the Scripture here for a context tonight: And he said unto her, Daughter, be of a good comfort: thy faith has made thee whole; go at peace. And while he yet spake these words, there come one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and thou shalt be made whole... And she shall be made whole... (Excuse me.)... And she shall be made whole.

L-12 Now, our subject tonight is a great outstanding instance in the Bible. I love to rehearse His works here on earth, and when He was here in a corporal body, and as He hath said that He would be with us and manifest Himself to us until the end of the age... And the Bible says, that, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and for ever." And if we can rehearse some of His 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min instance just before we pray for the sick, and declare to the sick, and to all that He's not dead but alive... See? For we're... We see of His actions and His attitudes in the days gone by, then we could expect the same thing in this day now. Don't you think so, if He is the same? Now, I would to God with this lovely feeling of spirit around the--this little group of people tonight, if each one of you would get into your mind, into your heart, that our Saviour is not dead, but He's alive and present now, just as present as He ever was in any age gone by, just as present as He was with Noah, just as present as He was with Abraham, just as present as He was with the Hebrew children, present as He was with--with all the patriarchs, and all the apostles, and all through the age. He's the same yesterday, today, and for ever, the same.

L-13 Now, let's get that in our minds, and remember that He is ever present; and there's no other creature that could be omnipresent except God Himself, no other creature. The devil is a great force. The devil has a great power, and the devil is great in his power; but he's under the power of God. And the devil can only be one place at a time. His imps can be everywhere, scattered out, his demons, his co-workers. But God Himself is alone in this field of omnipresence, not an Angel, but God Himself. Hallelujah. Then that gives us courage. "Wherever two or three are gathered together, I'll be in their midst." That's universal, everywhere. And now, let's watch His actions for a few moments. See what kind of an attitude He taken towards the sick, and towards the sinner. And then if we find His attitude towards them in the way that He works, then if He does the same thing here, that's a absolutely infallible proof that He has raised from the dead.

L-14 Aren't you glad tonight? With the thousands of different religions in the world; and yet there's none of them can take the stand and prove that their god is a living, outside of Christianity. Christianity is the only one that takes the claim of their God has raised up from the dead. Their God came to earth and was made flesh and died for them to take away their sins and appeared back again in their flesh to manifest Hisself until we're all made manifest in His glory when He sets on His throne, David's throne and takes rule for the millennium. Then we shall see Him, the very Lord Jesus that was crucified, and we'll look upon Him and know Him. And we are His Kingdom, and His domain is from eternity to eternity...?... I think of that. All powers and every word is given unto His hand. That's right. How wonderful.

L-15 Now, we could go down and being a missionary... Now, you say, "Brother Branham, you'd take the claim as a missionary and just going back and forth overseas?" Oh, yeah. That is a missionary. One who goes and stays is not a missionary. He just changed residence. If you go over there and stay four or five, eight and ten, twelve years, you just changed residence. Paul was the greatest missionary we've ever had, and he'd just go over here for a few weeks and there for a few weeks. That's a missionary. See? But one that goes and stays, just makes his home over there, he's just changed his residence. He's just living in Germany, or he's living in Africa, somewhere like that. He's a pastor or--or evangelist over there. Now, we want to notice that in our text tonight, it says here that it was on the instance of the healing or raising from the dead, Jairus' daughter, the little priest.

L-16 Now, our Lord Jesus was a very busy Man when He was here on earth. He was--He was in greatly in demand. He never stayed one place but just a little bit at a time, then away He would go somewhere else. They persuaded Him to stay in the city the different places. "Stay with us." But He said, "I've got to go to this other city; for that's what I've been sent for." And He didn't stay in one city but just a day, or a maybe an hour or two at a time, and performed a miracle, leaving the rest of the meeting for His disciples that was to follow Him.

L-17 Now, we find Him a few days before this, great things He had done. And just a few hours before the instant that we're speaking of, He'd been crossing a sea. Tired, weary, virtue had been going out of Him; people had been healed. He'd been preaching the Gospel, and on His road across the sea, the--over to the land of Gadara, He'd got so tired and weary until He laid down in the back end of the boat. Some of them had fixed Him a little pillow back there because they loved Him, and when they was rowing in the... 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Sails a going, and all the apostles moving with their oars, He'd gotten so sleepy, and so tired and wore... See? He was Man in one sense; He was God in another sense. He was Man in flesh; in Spirit He was God. We just went through that. The Dove came on the Lamb, and they two became one. The Lamb was one Creature, and the Dove was another Creature; and when the Dove and the Man--the Dove and the Lamb united together, God was manifested in the flesh. That's right. And now, He's manifested in your flesh by being adopted sons and daughters to the Kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's right, and you become joint-heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, Church, you got the power if you got the faith to use it with. That's it.

L-18 Last evening in speaking of the Noah, how that the ark was built; how that one tree had to be cut down. And then they beat the rosin out of the tree which the rosin is the sap. The life of the tree had to be beat out to make an atonement to save the life of Noah and his family. And the gopher wood that the ark was made out of... The gopher wood first had to be cut down and dried out. All life in the gopher wood which was not good, not preserved... Very beautiful type of the sinner as though you're standing, yet the life that's in you, my friend, is not worth nothing. Your good works and all that you are in your goodness cannot atone for your sins. There had to be Another of your kind cut down, the Lord Jesus, the perfect One; and out of His body was beaten with a cat-o'-nine-tails across His back, beat on the head, spit in the face, nails drove through Him, pierced in the side; and the life of Him had to run out in order to be a Saviour for your life.

L-19 Now, we find out that the gopher wood, the first thing the ark being made out of gopher wood, it had to be cut down, and its own life dried out. That's the sign of the sinner. The sinner before he can get right with God has to dispel all...?... with sin, get white. Then the gopher wood was the lightest wood there is, and a sinner that's repented and laying before God is the most receptacle things that there can be. Then the Holy Spirit comes down. Now, if you put that gopher wood in the water it would sink in a few minutes. That's right. Now, the sinner's all emptied out, and then when the gopher wood emptied out, it become light, flexible. Then we find out... Did you ever get real light when you got down there and God forgive your sins, and it seemed like--like you was walking on clouds? Sure. Emptied out your own life; then God took you to the tabernacle to the gathering of the people, and He made you a piece of timber or a stone in a house.

L-20 And then when you were nailed on like the gopher wood was, then they took the rosin out of this tree, the pine tree, the evergreen, and put it... Boiled it and poured it into these pores that was once was sap of no use, no effect, and poured the rosin out of the other tree into that and made it as strong as steel. And it could stand the judgment. And then when you poured out, all your sinful life, and the Holy Spirit, boiled in the fires of Calvary, had been poured into you, it sealed you into the Kingdom of God. "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption." Amen. Let the world bounce, and the chunks, and all the other things will never touch a borned again Christian. Amen. The Bible said, Ephesians 4:30, "You're sealed until the day of your redemption." Amen. That boat run on through the waters. Amen. The old ship of Zion will surely pull in one day (Right.), protected.

L-21 Christ laying on this ship, both God and Man, God was in Him. A woman here not long ago was speaking to me. She was a wo... Well, I don't mean to make light of anybody's religion. That's up to them; but she belonged to the group that said... Don't believe in the virgin birth and believes that Christ was just simply a--a good man, a prophet. If He was a Prophet only, then His Blood is no more than mine or yours. He was either God or the biggest deceiver the world ever had. She said, "I'll prove to you He wasn't nothing but a man by the Bible." I said, "Lady, I don't believe you can do it. I've read it many times through and studied it prayerfully." I said, "If you can prove to me that the Bible said He wasn't nothing but a Man, then I want to see your Scripture for it." And she said, "In Saint John the 11th chapter, the Bible said that when Jesus went down to the grave of Lazarus, the 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Bible plainly stated He wept." I said, "Well, what's that got to do with it?" Said, "He could not be a immortal. He could not be any more than a man and cry at a funeral." I said, "You just didn't see all of it." I said, "It is true. He was a Man in flesh, for God was in His Son reconciling the world to Himself. He was a Lamb in one place, but He was a Dove in the other. The Dove was in the Lamb. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself."

L-22 I said, "He was a Man when He went down to the--the grave of Lazarus, crying. He was a man then, but when He straightened up His little figure and said, 'Lazarus, come forth'; and a man that had been dead four days stood on his feet. That was more than a Man; that was Christ; that was God speaking out of there." I said, "He was a Man when He come down off the hill that night, hungry, looking around on that fig tree for something to eat. He was a Man; He was hungry; hunting for something to eat, He was a Man; but when He took five biscuits and a few little pieces of fish and broke it and fed five thousand, that was more than a man. That was God's hands when that bread was breaking through there." Did you notice not only raw--raw, live fish, not wheat, but already cooked, baked, fried and ready to eat. Amen. What kind of an atom did He turn loose when He done it? That was more than a Man. That was a God of the atom. That was a God that made the atom. That was a God that made the calcium. That was a God that made the life. That was the God that made the creation. He was in the world and the world knew Him not. And the world was made by Him. "That was more than a Man," I said. Yes, sir. He was--He was a Man tonight that I'm speaking of. The night when He was laying there in the back of that boat, so tired physically that He couldn't even get up. He was so tired, till the waves didn't even wake Him up. He was a Man when He was laying in the back of that boat asleep. That was... When He raised up and put His foot upon the brail of the boat, looked up and said, "Peace be still," and the winds and the waves ceased, that was more than a Man speaking; that was God speaking through the lips of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-23 It's true. He hung on Calvary begging for mercy. That was a Man. When He hung on Calvary begging for mercy, that was a Man. When on Easter morning, when the Angel of the Lord rolled the stone away, and He come up, He proved He was God. No wonder the poet said: Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; Buried, He carried my sins far away; Rising, He justified freely forever; Someday He's coming--oh, glorious day! Sure He was. He was a God Man. He was Divine. He was virgin born. God, Jehovah, God overshadowed a little virgin and brought forth the virgin born Son of God. And that was a Tabernacle or the dwelling place of Jehovah Himself. Jehovah walked in a tabernacle of flesh, and paid the price for sin. Don't you never let Him be a prophet. He was the God of the prophets. Sure was. He was more than a good man. He was the God of the good men.

L-24 Now, out here on this little old sea, tossed about, ten thousand devils of the sea swore they'd drown Him, while He was laying back there tired. You know the devil takes advantage of you when you get tired or wore out. He does you the same way. You just get a little tired and wore out, and get discouraged. Certainly. He caught Jesus right that weak spot, tried and weary. He was laying back in the back of the boat, rocking around; and the Bible said that the storm came down upon the sea and begin to toss the boat. The disciples said, "Carest Thou not that we perish?" He said, "Oh, where's your faith?" Looked around and the great winds and waves obeyed Him. What was He doing? Crossing a rough sea that night, because one soul in Gadara was ready to receive Him: one soul in Gadara. He would come from glory to Shreveport for one soul that was ready to receive Him. And remember this man that was ready to receive Him was a sick man. He was mentally sick. He was a maniac. He'd lost his mind. The doctors could do nothing for him. He was out into the--out into the caves, in the graveyard. That's the place the devil will take you. He 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min will put you in the graveyard.

L-25 An insurance agent here some time ago, come to me and said, "Billy, I want to sell you some insurance." I said... I haven't got any of that kind. So I said to him, "I've got insurance." And my wife stopped and looked around at me. She knowed I didn't have any insurance, especially what he was selling. She said, "Billy." And I said, "Well, I've got insurance." He said, "Who you... What is your insurance? What policy is it? Who you hold it with?" I said, "With the Lord Jesus." I said, "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory Divine: heir of salvation, purchase of God, borned of His Spirit, washed in His Blood." He said, "That's good, Billy. I'm glad to hear that," but said, "that won't put me in the graveyard." I said, "But it'll take me out. I'm not worrying about getting in there. It'll take me out of there...?..." That's right. It sure... I ain't worried about getting in the graveyard; it's getting out.

L-26 And I know one thing, brother, that when the good old fashion baptism of the Holy Ghost and every time when the heart beats we're going one step closer to that great place called death. Now, I want to say this, when I come to the end of the road I know Him in the power of His resurrection, that when He calls from among the dead, He will know my name, like He did Lazarus. That's what we're striving for tonight. To honestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Then we'll know Him in the power of His resurrection, not in a dead God, not a God in the manger, but a God that reigns among His people tonight working signs and wonders, showing forth His great power.

L-27 This poor maniac out there in the graveyard. That's where a lot of churches go, right to the graveyard. Then when he got out of there, cutting himself. When they get away from Lord Jesus, they do. And Jesus crossed the sea to bring deliverance to this one poor man. And as soon as this maniac saw Him, he run to Him and fell down, and he was so submitted to the devil till the devil used his tongue. You can be submitted to the devil, and he will use your tongue. If you'd be submitted to God, God will use your tongue. And He can get control of you. But you first you have to let Him get control of you. Now if you're cursing and damning and going on like the sinners does, the devil's got you in complete sway. Let God have a hold of you one time and watch what you're going to say.

L-28 Oh, how wonderful. Then this maniac run down to Him and the Lord Jesus rebuked them spirits. And a lot of people say that religion will run you crazy, not the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ won't. It'll give you your right mind. And you're not in your right mind until you have met the Lord Jesus. That's true. Why, some people that call themselves gentleman, but so beastly till they'd throw a baby out of the mother's arms to ravish her or beast brute lust in his heart. Maybe weigh two hundred and fifty pounds of muscles like some kind of an animal; that ain't a man. That's a beast. Certainly. Man is not measured by his muscles or by his statue. A man is measured by his character. Whatever he is, he is by character. There was no beauty that as I said, we should desire Jesus but what a character. It's never been duplicated in all the world. That's right. So a Bible even said when we looked upon Him, they... He wasn't no beauty we should desire Him. We all turned our heads from Him and everything, but a character has never been measured to Him. What a wonder.

L-29 Then this maniac when he came to his right mind as the devils left him, he wanted to follow the Lord Jesus. Everybody that ever gets in their right mind wants to follow the Lord Jesus. I don't want to hurt your feelings, sinner, but that's true. You come to your right mind, you'll follow the Lord Jesus. Jesus don't take your mind from you. He gives you your right mind. True. Now, notice, then when they come, going to have a revival over there. But you know what, them people there were hog raisers. And they never want no revival, because it cost them two thousand hogs to have a revival. So they wasn't interested in a revival, as long as it was going to cost them some hogs.

L-30 I just wonder if people around in the country today just, about got the same attitude. That's right. Going to cost a 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min little something, why--why, they don't want it. Want everything on a silver platter. That's the reason you don't enjoy it. One of the greatest meetings that was ever held, I guess it was... I just... I don't whether it was Moody. I forget just who it was now. Well, anyhow, an old wash woman, God laid it upon her heart. Brother Moore might remember the instance. Oh, it's back couple hundred years ago and so... I'm not meaning he's that old, but I mean that he might knowed it by his history. So I didn't mean Brother Moore was just quite that old anyway.

L-31 But when this old wash woman had prayed, and God had told her that she was going to have a revival. And she went around on the street passed out little tract, hired some preacher to come. She took her wash bench down and cleaned out the livery stable, and hired it, and rented it with her money that she had washed with. And when everybody throwed the--the pamphlets down on the street and wouldn't receive it, a little old boy come by with his daddy's suspenders on and hair hanging down his face and, "What are you giving away, lady?" Give him one of the little tracts and invited him to the meeting and that night when the preacher come, that old lady and that boy was the only one at the meeting. And when the preacher, true of God, preached just like they was ten thousand setting there. And the little boy came to the altar that night, was that A. B. Simpson? A. B. Simpson who almost led a half a million souls to God. Who gets credit for it? Amen.

L-32 You see it's not the big things you do. It's the little things you leave undone. You've got to sacrifice. Why, that's the reason the people...?... come into a meeting. Why, they come by the thousands times thousands. They like to get out in the cold way; they like to do something for God. That's what we ought to do. Don't make any difference what it is. Let's do something for God. Make a sacrifice. For the Bible said that we are priests of God making spiritual sacrifices, the fruits of our lips giving praise to His Name. All right. But when them people thought it was going to cost them a few hogs, they come down and asked Him to leave the country. So if you ask Him to go, He will go. He won't stay around very long. No, no. He will never stay where He's not welcome. He always comes where He's welcome. You remember the sermon not long ago of the woman washing Jesus' feet. He always stays where He's welcome. He feels at home when you welcome Him.

L-33 You pray like everything for a revival to come to Shreveport. Then Jesus can come to Shreveport, and a great revival starts, and somebody; and my, my, instead of talking and trying to get people in, the bigger part of them says it's fanaticism. The churches... Here in the country, not Shreveport, all over the country, pray for a revival. The first thing you know, a little revival spirit breaks out in some old sister's heart, and say, "Well, praise the Lord." "Hrmph." [Brother Branham clears his throat--Ed.] Put her out, say, "How it interrupts me when I'm preaching? Why, you're making...?..." Oh, you might talk to Him once in a while down in the cellar, or--or up in the other room or something like that. When you go to have a prayer meeting, you'd rather go shopping than to have a prayer meeting. No sacrifice, that's the reason we don't enjoy what we get.

L-34 I found out in my children. Billy Paul... I was working for forty cents an hour, and I knowed how I had to be treated when I was a boy, just pulled up, with nothing at all, not even clothes to wear to school or nothing. I said if I had to work till I dropped dead, I mean to have the best. I went out, and I'd buy him little...?... I'd buy him little bows and arrows and everything that I couldn't do when I had... or did... Had when I was a child. You know what I found out one time. Ever... Every week I'd try to get... Save out a little money and buy him something. First thing you know I found him in the back yard with all of his play things in the house with a teaspoon digging in the yard. See? You got so much you don't appreciate it. The rest of them, I had better do with the best they could. So that makes better. Oh, it's better.

L-35 How many will have to sacrifice? But He's never too tired. You know what I want to do? When I get to glory, I want to go over and find how much pressure that legion's testimony had on the hog raisers around Gadara when he got over it. I imagine he burnt that country up with them hog raisers, don't you imagine so, with his testimony, clothed and in his 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min right mind? See? I don't mean to hurt you, sister, if you that strip off yourself out here in these little old clothes. You see, you ain't got your right mind yet. If you ever meet the Lord Jesus, you'll get your right mind, and put on your clothes, and not act like that. So you... When you meet Jesus, you put on your clothes, not take them off. And preacher, I hope that goes in below your heart so that you'll know that that's the truth. Why do you let your people do that? Tell them the truth about it. All right.

L-36 Now, here He is crossing the sea and on although tossed banks up by the sea. When He first hit the...?... and begin to come back over to the other side again. Oh, great tired--how tired He was when He hit the bank. There was a little woman up there that had made up in her mind if she ever got close to Him that she was going to ask Him to give her of His grace. But she found out she couldn't get close to Him. She had a blood issue. So she just touched the border of His garment and was healed. Now, there was a little man over there by the name of Jairus. I always kinda felt sorry for Jairus, 'cause I believe that he was a secret believer. And you know Jairus is setting under this tent tonight? That's right. Oh, if it wasn't for social prestige. That old dirty thing of social prestige. What is social prestige, anyhow? "Oh, it's culture. Our preachers has got culture. How they can present themselves." You know what I think culture is? Culture is this: a man that hasn't got nerve enough to kill a chicken, but can eat a belly full of it when somebody else kills it. And that's what I think, my estimation of culture. Yes.

L-37 Oh, brother, what we need is Bible salvation, and back to the old hewing lines, back to the Bible. And here was old Jairus over them; it was around his heart. They had him in a general meeting, and they had taken a vote whether they should let Jesus of Nazareth ever come over in their country. No! Had nothing to do with Him. "And any man that professes faith in Him, he will be excommunicated right away. Now, Jairus, do you understand?" And in the meeting, little Jairus couldn't even say, "Amen." I guess that's right (See?), but in his heart he wanted to believe it all the time. "So," he said, "Now, Jairus, you remember this. If anybody comes of your congregation and professes that any miracle has been done by Jesus of Nazareth, excommunicate him right away. Now, you know that was a Jewish order. Yes sir. Take him out of the synagogue. You know the High Priest, the bishop and the district superintendent and all of them come from place to place, making a proclamation; and if anybody receives Jesus of Nazareth would be excommunicated right quick." So, you know, when you're really a secret believer, way down in your heart you want to say, "I want that old time religion, but you know, you just... So many around that don't believe in it. God will make a way for you to get it. Yes, He will. He will make a way.

L-38 So He made a way for Jairus. And one day his little girl got sick. You know God can get right next to you with your children. And so his little girl got sick. Well, the reasonable thing for anybody to do when a child gets sick or anybody, send for your doctor. And the doctor come, looked her over, and said, "Well, I'll give her my herb tonic, and I'll see what we can do." The next day come back, she was getting, oh, my, sicker and sicker all the time, fever getting higher all the time. So when he come back the next day, and he listened to her heart beat. He said, "Oh, my. Her heart's beating faster, Jairus. Now Pastor Jairus, I'm sorry to tell you, but you know, I've tried about every remedy I can on that girl, and there's not a thing I can do for her. She's getting sicker all the time, and I'm afraid that--that you're going to have to give her up, Jairus." He said, "Oh, doctor, you don't mean to tell me that I'm going to have to." "Yeah, Jairus, I'm sorry, but I am... In my medical profession let's me know that there's nothing in the world that I can do in my medicine for her. The only thing that I can say is, 'God, be merciful to her soul.'"

L-39 That doctor was... Done all that he could do. He walked away from the house. I can see little Jairus walking up-and-down the floor. All the time in his heart, he was thinking, "If I only knew where Jesus was. If I only could find 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Jesus." All right. Walks back and forth. So he thinks, "I believe I'll go over and see the... My district superintendent to see what he thinks about... If I should send for Jesus of Nazareth." Now, that was in his heart. He had faith that Jesus could do it. Have you? He had faith that He could do it. So he thought he'd go over and see the district superintendent to find out if it would be all right to bring Jesus over. So he went to see the head man of the synagogues and so forth. They said, "Why, Jairus, why, it's ridiculous. Why, we're disciples of Moses. We know Moses done miracles; but, Jairus, do you know that's been hundreds of years ago? The days of miracles are past. So there's no such thing as that in this day. The only thing you can do is we come over and give her the last rites of the church, and let her die in peace. That's the only thing to do. That'd be the will of God. If your doctor can't help her, it's the will of God for her to die."

L-40 How wrong that is. But all the time while that was going on, Jesus had a tugging, 'cause the faith of Jairus has pulled Him over there. That's what you're here for. All the time He felt like that He would cross the sea. And now we had a night or two ago that Jesus said in the Gospel, "I do nothing until the Father shows Me by a vision first." Is that right? Saint John 5:19: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself, but what He sees the Father doing first." Jesus knowed just exactly what He was going for. Again a call for one soul, and He crosses the sea.

L-41 And so first thing you know, Jairus, he come back and he said... I can hear his wife say, "Where'd you go?" "I was just over at the church saying a prayer for the girl?" "Well, she's already unconscious now." "Oh, my." I can just imagine him saying, "If I could only find Jesus. If I only knew where He was, I believe that Prophet. I just believe Him. I seen Him do things. I've followed it up in the Scriptures. This is my bread ticket. Here being pastor of this church, but if I could only find Him. If I could only find where He's at."

L-42 Well, the first thing you know. Somebody come running up around the street and said, "Hey, you know what's happening, pastor?" "What?" Why, all the people are around, of course, weeping and sympathizing with him, the good, honest people of the church. He's going to lose his daughter, and as one come by and said, "You know what? After all the trouble we got around here, this girl dying; and yet I understand that that fanatic prophet of Galilee has just hit the shore down here." The hope begin to jump in little Jairus' chest right then. If... You know faith cometh by hearing. Is that right? Somebody told him that Jesus had come. Somebody says tonight that Jesus was raised from the dead: what a hope. Amen. Old Jairus thought, "If I could only see Him now. I will express my... Oh, oh, oh, oh. What will I do. I will lose my job. I will lose my congregation. What will I do? Well, maybe I'd better not go." Walked in and looked at the little girl. She's almost gone. What had happened? Right down in his heart, God begin to work. "Jairus, this is your time." You know God gets Christ a vision, and God works on both ends of the line. See?

L-43 And he begin to get in his heart. "Oh, I believe I'll go see Him." So he calls Mrs. Jairus out, and he said, "You know, honey, I have been thinking of something." "Yes, dear, what is it?" "Well, of course, you know I'm pastor here." "Yes, uh-huh. Who are we going to get to preach her funeral?" "Well, I--I'm not thinking about it, you know, honey. I--you know what? I... Sometime ago, I was over the other side of the lake, and I seen this prophet of Galilee. And I seen Him do a miracle there one day that just startled me; and you know, I believe that He could help my daughter, our child. Don't you believe so, honey?" She said, "You know... I want to tell you, sweetheart. I--I--I believe that same thing." "Why, honey, do you mean you've been believing all the time?" "Yes." "So have I." 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Oh, my. Peace is going to come to that home pretty soon. When father and mother can get right with God, something's going to happen. "Why," he said, "Are you willing, if they excommunicate me, are you willing to stick by me?" "Dear, I'll stick by you through thick and thin. That's my marriage vow. I'll stick by you. If you want to go get Him, I'll be here on my knees praying till you come back. Let the congregation say anything they want to. We believe God." Amen That's it. Now you're getting right. That's it. That's the vision. "We'll believe God." Amen. All right, let the rest of them then... David said, "As for me and my house, we'll serve the Lord." That's right. No matter what the neighbors said, what anybody else said; serve the Lord.

L-44 So we find out then, little old Jairus he thought... He reached over, and he got his little priest hat and put it on like that. He started walking out. First thing you know, he met some of the congregation. "Where are you going, Jairus?" Oh, my. What am I going to do now? Show my colors? Am I going to have to be a traitor? I'm afraid if I deny it, then He won't come with me. I've got to be a real soldier. That's the way. That's it. "Well, congregation, I want to announce to you now. I'm going down by the lake. I just heard that Jesus is here. (Amen.) I just heard that Jesus has arrived." Oh, my. I--I feel very religious. "Jesus has arrived. I'm going down to get Him." "Why, the very audacity, pastor. Do you mean to tell me that you're going to degrade yourself as a scholar as you are, with all the B.A.'s, the Bachelor of Arts, and the everything. Your new degree that was just give to you, LL.D., and you mean to tell me that you're going to mix yourself with that bunch of holy-rollers?" What was it? He didn't say, "Well, I'll go like Nicodemus by night." Huh-uh. The need was right then. Brother, he couldn't wait. And that's what it is tonight. We can't wait.

L-45 Did you hear the newscast tonight? Did you read your newspapers? The whole world is in a turmoil, on the Suez Canal, there's a third world war coming up, an atomic war. And while she's brewing, what can happen? It lays in who shoots the first atomic bomb. Your paper said that this country here was way hotter than it'd ever been for this time of year. Many places are hottest it ever been in that time. Why? Their atomic bombs has already got this world moving from its orbit into the sun. It's like God said it would be. The time is at hand. There's no time for waiting. Let's get to Jesus right quick. They say, "Well now, Brother Branham, do you have an education? Know what you..." I might not have an education, but I know what I'm talking about. I may not know the Book too well, but I know the Writer, the Author, real well. I know the time is at hand. We can't wait any longer. Let them that's filthy, be filthy still; and them that's holy, be holy still. The hour of your decision is now. This may be the last night that you'll have the opportunity. You don't know. Many's got to stick their chest out, like Jairus did.

L-46 Said, "I don't care if you expel me, if you excommunicate me." Oh, he got some holy boldness in him. That's what everybody needs. Stand for your rights. "But I'm going after Jesus of Nazareth." And somebody slipped around and told the--the main superintendent and them, "Cut him off down on the side of the road. He's lost his mind. He's gone crazy. He's gone down there with that bunch of holy-rollers, just as sure as the world. He's gone down." They wasn't? Sure, they was. Sure, that's what the world called them. That's called them heretics, crazy. So then the first thing you know down the road come the... All the chief executives, all the general council, all of them may now was in one row, and said, "Looky, here, fellow. Where you going?" Oh, he--he done had something moving in his heart. If you ever get it moving in your heart, you won't care who tries to stop you. That's right. If God begins to tug at that heart, and you begin to move with that tug, there ain't nothing in the world in that's in hell going to hold you down. You're going anyhow.

L-47 I can hear him give them a real good word. Saying, "Stand up. I'm on my way to see Jesus of Nazareth." Amen. 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Hallelujah. "I'm on my way. He's the only One that can provide help for me now; and I'm on my way, and I don't care what you do. If you want my preacher's license, you can have them. There they are. Take them. I'm on my way." Amen. That's what the church ought to start tonight. That's what the people ought to start. Throw away that old dead, dry theology you've been worshipping for a long time and find the resurrected Lord Jesus, He that's the same yesterday, today, and forever, He that's omnipotent, all powerful, omnipresent. Same as His--resurrection as He was the days He walked the banks of Galilee.

L-48 "On my road..." When he sees Jesus, that woman has just been healed. I can see Jesus standing there, saying, "Daughter, be of a good cheer. Thy faith has made thee whole." Jairus said, "Oh, what's happened? What's He doing? What's He saying?" I can see this little pale woman coming by, saying, "Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise the Lord." Here she comes, just a shouting. Jairus says, "Just--just--just--just a minute, madam. I want to--I want to talk to you just a little bit. What is it? What's happened?" "Well, I had a blood issue." "Oh, you--you associated with this gang?" "Yes. Uh-huh. And I'm a... I just got healed with a blood issue." Oh, how happy she was. He started walking on. He told Jesus, "Now, I want you to come and lay Your hands upon my little girl. She's laying at the point of death, and she'll be made well."

L-49 Now, look at Jairus. He said, "Come, and lay Your hands on her." That was his faith. That was a Jew. They were taught laying on of hands. The Roman, he didn't want it. He said, "I'm not worthy You come under my roof. Just speak the Word." He said, "I'm a man under authority. I have... I'm a centurion, and I have a hundred men under me. And they have to do everything I tell them. If I tell one to go and another one to come, they do just as I tell them. I have my power and authority over them." And what was he saying to Jesus? "I recognize You to be God in flesh." That's right. "I recognize that every disease and every sin is in Your power." Hallelujah. "It's under Your jurisdiction. You can speak to it. That's all You have to do, and every devil will mind You." Amen. He turned around and said, "I've not seen that kind of faith in Israel." But said, "Go your way, as you have believed, so be unto you." And the boy was healed.

L-50 Peter one night, he had to have the Word preached to him. He was out on the sea in a little old boat that was just about all ready to sink, and all hopes was gone. And the first thing you knowed, while they was screaming and going on and afraid they was going to die on the sea, why, Jesus come walking to them on the water. And they got scared of Him. The only thing that could help them; the only thing that could save them, and they was a scared of it. They thought it was a spook. That's what they thought He was, a ghost. And they were a scared of it. Now, that's no worse than people in Shreveport. That's right. The only thing that can help you, the only thing that can save you, the only thing that could heal you, the only thing that'll ever liberate you from sin, the only thing that'll ever take you from habits is the baptism of the Holy Ghost; and you're a scared of It. That's right.

L-51 In this perplexed of time... Did you ever hear of the airplane wrecks, the ships running together, perplexed of times, distress in the nations, great sights, and sea a roaring, tidal waves that's never been knowed of? You're at the end time. Here's the Holy Ghost here spreading forth It's Light just like It did back there in the days of the Jews. As it was back there, so is it now. They were the eastern people. The sun rose on them and showed signs and wonders of the living Lord Jesus. He promised in the last days it would be light in the evening, and here we are in the western world at the west coast. It's all over, and the Light is shining down, and Christ raised from the dead proving Himself alive among us.

L-52 Simple, uneducated ministers speaking the truth, God confirming the Word... Oh, we got a lot of quacks; I know that. We have to admit that. We got a lot of fanatics there's nothing to. That's right, but just remember. Every time you 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min see a bogus dollar, remember, there's a real one it was made off of. It only vindicates the truth. That's right. Only shows that there's a real one right in this evening time. Peter said, "Lord, I'm scared of You. I don't know what to think about it; but if it be You, let me see it in the Word. Bid me come to You on the water. Let me hear Your Word." Now, if you're scared of this baptism of the Holy Ghost, let me show It to you in the Word. See if It's for you. When the Holy Ghost there fell on the day of Pentecost, they begin to scream and act what you call, like what you call holy-rollers today. They were jumping, dancing, falling.

L-53 The Bible said they act like they were drunk. Is that right? Well, Peter stood up on a little old stump there, soap box, or whatever he was standing on, said, "You men of Judaea, you that dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known unto you and hearken unto my words: These are not drunk, like ye suppose, seeing it's the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoke of by the prophet Joel: It'll come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh." On he went, "And they shall prophesy, and all the signs," he said. "And when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts." They wasn't scared of the spook any more. They said, "Men, what can we do to be saved?" Peter said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that's afar off." Them in Shreveport, Louisiana, if you want to say it that way, or the uttermost parts of the world. Wherever the Gospel is preached, and God is calling people, the Holy Ghost is still the same for them. That's the Word. "Even as many as the Lord our God shall call..." That's the Word.

L-54 Then step out in the open and start walking. Amen. Step out of the--the little old theology you're wrapped around tonight and say, "God, I want the Holy Ghost. I don't care what anybody says." Peter said, "Lord, if It's You..." You say, "I'm afraid I'll make a mistake." Well, you'll sure make a mistake setting where you are. That's right. You'll... I'll have...?... for man. I have--I have a lot of respect for Peter when he stepped out of that boat, and he did make a mistake. He started to look around and said, "See, I got it, boys, I got it." And he started sinking. It ain't nothing you have to go around bragging about. It's something you want to run along and testify about and tell the world that Jesus Christ...?... Amen. Don't brag on yourself. Brag on Him. Put Deity to Him where it belongs for His power and praise to Him, not on some preacher or upon anything else. Don't think that you're something great. It's God's mercy that called you to it. That's right.

L-55 Here he starts walking, walk on the waters, just as soon as he heard the Word. Faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word. See, Peter heard the Word. That's right. Martha heard that Jesus was coming. She went to Him and got the resurrection of her brother. See? It's according to your faith. The priest that packed the ark. Faith for them was sticking their foot in the water; as soon as their foot hit the water, the sea--the Jordan opened up. Their faith was touch the water. A blind man one time, the Word told him to wash in the pool of Siloam with spit over his eyes. Jesus spit in some ground and made a patty cake out of it, from spit. What would the health authorities say about that in Shreveport today? Standing there talking to him and [Brother Branham makes spitting sound--Ed.] spit on the ground and kept talking to him [Brother Branham makes spitting sound] spit on the ground. Then when He got done, rubbed it up in His hands like that and put plaster over his eyes and said, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam and come see." Amen. To find a pool of Divine...?... Hallelujah. To find the Holy Ghost is to find Life, find healing, find joy, find peace, find Christ tonight. Amen.

L-56 Where your faith lays; whatever you believe. It's according to your faith. Jairus' was, "Come, lay Your hands on my girl. She'll be all right. You just lay Your hands on her." Here He come. They was going on a little drive. His heart 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min got settled down. Walked along side of Jesus with his head up. "Oh, I'm so glad I made my decision, Lord." Don't worry. Soon as you make your decision, the devil's going to give you a shock. Don't worry. He's the biggest bluff I know of, but he is only a bluff. Did you hear me? He's a bluff. That's all he is. He ain't got one legal power; Jesus Christ stripped him of every thing he had, on Calvary. The full sin penalty was paid at Calvary, and the devil has no legal rights at all. He's just a big bluff. You say, "Well, my mother would turn me down. My daddy would... I--I don't care what the devil tells you. Jesus will receive you. You'll be happy and peaceful. Just a bluff...

L-57 So Jairus got to feeling pretty good after he'd met Jesus. Went walking along. Said, "I got a real hope now. My girl's going to be all right. Yep. He will go in there, and He will minister some way; and He will lay His hands on her, and first thing you know that girl will start getting better. She get all right. Yes, sir." And make hisself believe that, pushing right along with the crowd, feeling pretty good. "Who's this coming?" Here comes a man as usually a--a message of sorrow they had ashes on their head or dirt, and they come running. Here he had... "Oh--oh--wonder what's happened up the street? Wonder what's taking place?" And here comes this runner. Said, "Jairus, do you know me?" "Yes." "Trouble not the Master any more, Jairus." "Oh, why--oh why, why? What's happened?" "Your daughter's already dead. Don't trouble Him." Oh, I can see him just go back down, but just as he starts to sink like Peter did in the boat, he turns his eyes to see what Jesus is going to say about it. Why don't you see what He says about it? If you say, "Well, the world turn me down." See what He says about it. Doctor says, "I'm going to die." See what He says about it. See what He says about it.

L-58 So Jairus turned his little head to see what Jesus said about it. I can see those lovely eyes looked over to him, said, "Fear not. Only believe, and thou shalt see the glory of God." Glory. That was the Word. Jairus stuck his chest out, just as brave as he could be and walked over yonder. And here come some mourners, "Boo-hoo, she's gone. Hoo, she's gone." Jesus looked over at Jairus;he had his chest sticking out, going right on, paying no attention to it, walking right on down the road. First thing you know, here stood Rabbi Levinski. Here stood all the rest of the rabbis around with their hands folded like this. "Aha, now you're excommunicated and your--your girl's done died. The doctor just left at her. The undertaker's there now. Got her embalmed. Laying out on the str... Out. You see what you got. Now you're without a job." Jairus just passed them on by just as if they didn't even say a word, on by. Here come all the church, "We're ashamed of you, of our pastor." Well, he had already heard the Word of Jesus. He'd already come in contact with Him. He had an assurance. If Jesus said so, that's right. That's all that's necessary.

L-59 Walks on up the house. Them saying, "Oh, she's gone. She's gone. Poor little thing she died yesterday...?... been embalmed, the blood out of her."[Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] All of a sudden the lips begins to turn pink. The wrinkle into her forehead starts... Her big blue eyes opens up. She said, "Daddy." Looked around. Jesus took her by the hand and said, "Give her something to eat now." Glory. That's the Lord Jesus. He's the omnipotent. "I am He that was dead and is alive again forevermore. I'm raised from the dead." And He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And nineteen hundred years has past. That same Lord Jesus is down here at Shreveport, Louisiana, tonight, under this tent. Without one fear to know that I'd have to answer at the day of judgment if I make that statement, because He's here. I feel Him. I see the reaction of His Word to them that's filled with the Spirit. They're children "that eat not by bread alone, but by the Words that proceeds out of the mouth of God." And when the Word goes forth, the hungry children 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min gather and say, "Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Oh, I love You, Father; I love You. Eating, not only biscuits and grits and brown gravy, they're feeding on the eternal Word of God filling their soul with a spiritual atmosphere.

L-60 He's here. Oh, it seems crazy to the world. Sure, did in all ages and it will in this age; but just wait for that age that is to come. This is man's day. The day of the Lord will come. Let us serve Him so now, that in the day when He does come, we'll be found faithful. Whether we live or whether we sleep; we'll be wakened up at the sound of the trumpet and will rise in the beauty of His resurrection, and shall be partakers of His holiness, and of His power of His resurrection. We are now enjoying the earnest of our salvation. Amen. Amen. Let us pray. While we have our heads bowed, every eye is closed, please, while Christians are praying, I wonder tonight upon the raw Gospel without gloves on, just pushed out the way the Holy Spirit would let us say it... I wonder if tonight if there would be one under the tent that would raise up your hands and say, "Lord Jesus, by this I want to say to You that I believe You and want to serve You, want to accept You as my Saviour tonight." Is there a one that would raise your hand?

L-61 God bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you, young man. God bless you, young lady. God bless you, mister. God bless you, sister. Oh, God bless you, lady. God bless you. That's fine. Over here. God bless you. That's right. Someone else? Raise your hand. Someone that hasn't raised your hand? "God be merciful to me, a sinner. I now want to accept Christ as my Saviour. I'm now ready to follow Him in everything. I'll go with Him to the garden. I'll go with Him to the--to the river of death. I'll go with Him to the grave. I'll go with Him on the other side. I'll go with Him wherever He leads me. I'll go." Will you say that from your heart and raise your hand to Him at the sign that you now accept Him as your Saviour? Someone else that hasn't raised their hand? God bless you. I see you, mister. I see you, lady. I see you, son. God bless you. God sees you too.

L-62 What happens when you raise your hand? Jesus said, "He that heareth My words (I've been preaching it) and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath Everlasting life and shall not come into judgment, but's passed from death to Life." Someone here that's been a backslider and would want to come back to Christ tonight. Saying, "Oh, Brother Branham, I tell you, I'm like Jairus. I've been a secret believer all my life. God's been dealing with me, and I made trials where I never did come. But tonight I think that this is the time. I think that I was led here in this little old tent tonight, that I might find the Lord Jesus, and before I see His manifestation and His power, like Thomas had to see to believe..." How much greater is their reward who's never seen and yet believed. "I want to raise my hand to Him and say, 'Accept me, Christ. Right now, I come home to You.'" Is there another one that hasn't raised their hand? God bless you, lady. God bless you, lady. God bless you, sir. That's wonderful. Someone else? God bless you. That's right, young lady. That's fine.

L-63 Way over to my left over here, somebody in there wants to receive Christ, maybe they're a backslider? God bless you, little fellow. I see your hand. God bless you, little boy. I see you. God bless you, sister. I see you, honey. A whole group of little... Two little boys, two little girls and a boy. Just along little teen-aged, raised their hands just now to receive the Lord Jesus. Coming home to Him, they're convinced that it's right. And if Jesus Christ doesn't appear here in all of His power, then I'm a false prophet. If He doesn't manifest Hisself tonight, right here among us, as He did in the days gone by, then I'm a false prophet. I believe Him. I know He is. Now before you see Him appear, will you accept Him as your Saviour, while He is standing here, His power, His moving of the Spirit. Some fifteen or twenty has raised their hands, of sinners wanting to come to Christ. Someone else now just before closing? How many here is without the Holy Ghost and would want to be baptized? You've been believers, and you've got Eternal Life, because you believed on the Lord Jesus, but you want to now be baptized into the Body of Christ by the Holy Ghost. Would you raise your hands while He's present? God bless you. Oh, multitudes. Great groups of people. God bless you all. Sure, that wants to be baptized in the Holy Ghost.

L-64 Now, you strangers, you Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterians, over in these Full Gospel realms, I--I come 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min from where you are. I'm still there. We're all one. We're not divided, Not a bit. I'm just as much Lutheran as I am Pentecostal. I'm just as much Baptist as I was the day I was ordained in the Baptist church. I've just found something better, something more. Not... It's just more of what you got. It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You received Christ, sure, when you believed, but the Bible said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" We were going through Moody Bible Institute the other day. They said, "Brother Branham, did you... Would you quote that out of the Bible?" I said, "Why, certainly. Acts the 19th chapter. Paul asked a Baptist, the Baptist people, 'Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?' Why," I said, "I'm a Baptist. I know I was taught I received the Holy Ghost when I believed." But the Bible said, "Have you received It since you believed?" They said, "Not, we know whether there be any Holy Ghost." He said, "Then to how was you baptized?" They said, "Unto John." Said, "John baptized unto repentance (Not for remission of sin), unto repentance, saying you believe on Him that's coming." When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus. And Paul laid his hands on them, and the Holy Ghost come on them, and they received the Holy Ghost, and spoke in tongues, and magnified God, and prophesied.

L-65 That's what the Baptist church needs tonight. Amen. Sure. That's what Dr. Reedhead said when he received It. That's what Don Wells said he received It. That's what all these other great men said when they received It: Presbyterian, Lutheran, many of them. The day is on; the hour is here. You want the Holy Ghost, It's yours. You've been saved, then expect to get the Holy Ghost. God bless you, sir. That's right. God bless you. That's good. All right. Our heavenly Father, I now bring each one, the recording Angel standing here taking down every name that raised their hands tonight to receive Eternal Life and taken those names who are candidates for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Word said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."

L-66 Think what they'll be five hundred years from tonight. Somewhere, somewhere, when the atomic bombs done blowed every mountain into powder. The howling hot scorching winds out of the atoms of the sun will be blazing this old earth. Their tombstones even as the dust, their bones are done turned to dust, but their soul will be somewhere enjoying the Presence of God. That great peaceful heaven. If they're rejected, in hell they'll be forever. Oh, God, what a time of decision. How You've made it for men to make their choice this night. And this little group that You've presented to me, I give them Your Gospel. Many of them, dozens of them, Father, is raised their hands, You know. I pray as the minister could pray. I intercede for each soul from the least to the oldest, from the richest to the poorest. I pray, God, that You'll give them the deep desires of their heart and fill their soul with the Holy Ghost, heal their sick bodies, and take them into Your Kingdom at the end of this life. I ask in Christ's Name. Amen.

L-67 How wonderful, how marvelous the Lord Jesus. I'm going to ask you something. Each one that raised your hand... I promised to pray for the sick tonight, and each one that raised your hand, will you do me a favor? And you that thought you should've raised your hand, as soon as the healing service is over, will you walk up here and pray a little while around the--around the altar here with the brothers and... Will you do it? I want you to. You do that. That'll strengthen... You got Life. If you raised your hand and accepted Jesus, He promised to give you Eternal Life. "He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me has Everlasting Life." That's right. Jesus said that, and I'm want you tonight to come up and to give your heart to Christ and meet me after the prayer service for the sick.

L-68 Now, how many in here has got prayer cards? Let's see your hands. How many card did you give out? Hundred in what--what number? What's the letter? "R" A hundred... This brother here while he stands here, he raised his hand awhile ago seeking God. Isn't that right, brother? God bless you. You want to be filled with the Holy Ghost. I'm going 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min to pray for you, brother, and lay hands upon you; I want you to believe for you are going to receive the Holy Ghost. Now, I believe that God will fill you with the Holy Ghost tonight. Do you believe that? Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. This man comes to receive the Holy Ghost. I lay my hands upon him in the Name of Jesus Christ. May he now receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. May he never leave from under this tent until the Holy Ghost has taken over, full surrender to Him, and He has taken his life and made Him a new creature in Christ Jesus. Grant it, Lord. This blessing I ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, brother. Now, go rejoicing; go happy. God, give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost.

L-69 What is the Holy Ghost? What is the Holy Ghost? Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience, faith. Is that right? That's the Holy Ghost. What's a little apple tree; how do you know it's an apple tree? 'Cause it's got apples on it. How do you know you got the Holy Ghost? 'Cause you bear the fruits of the Spirit. Is that right? That's the Holy Ghost. All right. How many believes that Jesus raised from the dead is here tonight to give every redemptive blessing? If He will come to this platform tonight and do exactly the way He did when He was here in a corporal body, using our flesh, through faith, through gifts, will you accept Him and believe Him? How many will do that? Raise your hands. All right. That's good. [The PA system makes a buzzing noise--Ed.] Something got wet... And they got the... Microphones is mixed up. Will this... See if you cut through on this one here. All right. That's better. All right now. I want to ask you something. Say, I never hooked one of these things on. I don't know whether I'm doing this right or not. That it? I--I choke myself with it...?... Oh, thank you, brother. All right. All right.

L-70 I'm here tonight to represent something. I'm here to tell you that Jesus has raised from the dead, that Jesus said when He was here on earth that in Himself He could do nothing. Did He say it? He said, "I can do nothing in Myself. The Son can do nothing but what the Father shows Me to do, that I do." Is that right? Then He... A woman could touch His garment and could pull God through Christ. That was His flesh. That's the reason He got weak. God never got weak, but God in Christ went out of Him and made Him weak: virtue. Is that right? His strength from the Spirit went out of Him. That's how He got weak. He set down and talked to a woman at a well and told her where her secrets was. Is that right? All right. That was... Was that Jesus yesterday? That's Jesus today. Is that right?

L-71 A Jew come to Him, a staunch Jew, and another Jew had got saved and went and found him, about several miles around behind the mountain. Maybe took him a day's journey. When he come on, he said, "Come, see Who we found, Jesus of Nazareth, Son of Joseph." And that staunch Jew, real good, full... Oh, I'd say a evangelical brother. He said, "Now, could there be any good thing come out of Nazareth?" He said, "Come, see." They went arm and arm, walked up where Jesus was standing. Jesus looked at him. Said, "Behold an Israelite, in whom there's no guile." How did He know him? He might be a deceiver. Might've been anything else but an Israelite and no guile, honest and upright. And it astonished him. He said, "Rabbi, how did You know me?" "Why," He said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under that tree, when he come up, I saw you." What did he say? "Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel."

L-72 Now, what did the self-starchy Pharisee said. They said, "He's a fortune-teller. He's Beelzebub, the chief of the devils." And Jesus said, "You can say that about Me, and I will forgive you, but down in Shreveport, Louisiana (in so many words, or anywhere in the world), when the Holy Ghost is come and does the same things that you speak against It, it'll never be forgiven again you in this world or the world to come." You be the choice... You make your choice. See? Christ has raised from the dead and is doing the same tonight that He did then. He didn't heal everybody He come to. I ask you to show me in the Bible where He healed everybody. I show you where He went through a pool where the most crippled up masses of people that you ever seen or heard of: 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min lame, halt, blind, withered, twisted, and everything else a laying. And went to a man that had an infirmity, thirty eight years, TB or something. He could walk around. Said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" The Father showed Him to go there. He hunted through the crowd till He found him. Said, "There he is." Said, "Will you be made whole?"

L-73 Now, watch. Jesus knew he was there and knew how long he'd been sick. Is that right? Said, "Take up your bed and go to the house." Walked right away and went... Multitudes, thousands times thousands of twisted, lame, halt, and blind. He did just as the Father showed Him. And if that's what He did then, He will do the same thing tonight. Do you believe it? Then did everybody that was healed by Jesus, did He know they was going to be healed? No, sir. Many of them was healed upon their own faith. Blind man followed Him one day; two of them. Saying, "Have mercy on us, thou Son of David; have mercy, have mercy." He just went on down the street, no vision, went into the house. They brought the blind man in the house. Said, "Have mercy on us." He turned around to him and touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith (Is that right?), be it unto you." They believed, and their eyes were open.

L-74 One woman couldn't even get to Him. She just touched the border of His garment. He didn't feel it, not by His physical feeling, but He turned and told her, and she was healed. Said her faith made her well. Many places in the Bible, certainly. It's based upon your faith. When the blind... When the epileptic child come to the Lord Jesus, the father brought him, said, "I brought him to the disciples and they could do nothing. Can You have mercy on us?" And He placed it right back on the man. He said, "I can if ye believe." Responsibility on him, he said, "Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief." Is that right? Then Jesus cast the spirit out of the boy. See? Jesus worked as the Father showed Him. Saint John 5:19. May He do the same thing here tonight and prove to you that He's raised from the dead.

L-75 Now, He don't have to do this, and let everybody know that through this Divine gift that the Lord has given; I do not do this for a show-off. God knows that. God don't do it to show you He's God. He does it that the Word might be fulfilled. The Bible said that He took their infirmities, and done these things, and healed the sick, that it might be fulfilled (Is that right?) which was spoken by the law and the prophets. And He's doing it tonight, that this might be fulfilled, that people will be without an excuse in the day of the judgment. If you want to shut up your compassions like a turtle in its shell, that's up to you. See? If you will believe, you'll see great things. So just believe. Have faith and believe God. For what? "All things are possible to them that believe." Is that right? All right.

L-76 Now heavenly Father, I commit myself unto Thee with this audience of people, praying that the great Holy Spirit will come tonight, and through this... Nothing that I ever deserved; gifts and calling are without repentance. Born in a cradle, Lord, You was there. The great Pillar of Fire has followed all down along through my age. Nothing in my... I'm worse than the least in Your Kingdom, not worthy to be called Your servant. Not praying this prayer that this audience would hear it, Lord. For I'm not trying to be humble. Thou knowest my heart. I'd be a hypocrite, but Lord, I pray this that You know my heart, and I only yield myself to You, that You'll work through my mind, and through my heart, and through my body, and all my innermost beings and my--and my outward being that it might manifest Your lovely Son, the Lord Jesus Christ to fulfill the Word which said, "These things that I do, shall you also." Now, Father this we ask in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen.

L-77 Now, was that Q, or what was it? R's, prayer card R's. We've been calling all around, remember last night I called different places; 1 to 20 and...?... 40 to 50 or... And all around. So tonight let's call where? Let's say... Let's take 85 to 100. Who has... Did you say a hundred? Give out a hundred? Is there--is there prayer card 85 here. Let's see. Prayer card R, big "R" on it, of 85. Is that person here? Right there. All right. That's okay. We'll call from there then. All right. 85, 86. R-86, who has R-86? Would you raise your hand? 86? All right, lady. 87? Now, if your number's called and you're in a chair and can't get up, just raise your hands; we'll come get you. See? Somebody will get you. 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min What was it? All right, 85, 86, 87, somebody with prayer card R-87? Is the lady... Right there, lady. All right. 87, 88, who has prayer card R-88? Would you raise you hand? 88, all right, sir. 89, raise your hand? 89, all right. 90?

L-78 Now, the prayer cards are give out at six o'clock in the afternoon to whosoever wants them. Just as... Billy says there's hardly anybody here. Can't give them all out. There's nobody here to get them. My, used to be rally for prayer cards get in line, but he said he has an awful time trying to get enough people to give them to. Let's see, 89. Who has 89? 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let them line up. We'll see how many we've got. Prayer line goes good, then we'll start after this group is formed, if we get to go a little farther, the Lord will bless us, give us a lot of good faith... Let's start then... We'll start back fifteen ahead of that and come down. So look at your--your person's card, and find out. Sometimes we got as many as fifty through a line: visions, of course, they pack me out afterward, but... Let... If we get fifty through, be fine. All right.

L-79 We don't want to stand too many at a time, because you just come as your number's called. 'Cause you... We might not get but two or three. We don't know just where it'll be. But now, we're calling for prayer card 85 to a 100 of them, 85 to a 100, 85 to a 100. All right. Now, let's all bow our heads real sweetly and quickly to the Lord, and then just say so many words, "Lord Jesus, I am bowing to Thee. I bow to Thee, my Lord. I'm going to believe Thee tonight. I'm sick and needy. I don't even have a prayer card, but Lord Jesus, You speak to Your servant, and let him speak to me, and it will increase my faith to believe in You, and I'll do all that's in--within me to serve You the rest of my days."

L-80 Heavenly Father, I pray that through Christ's Name that You'll give us a marvelous service now. Now, Lord, here stands people in this prayer line under this tent that I've never seen in my life. I don't know them, and here I stand, a boy with a seventh grade education. O God, what a... How--how... I'm just helpless without You, Lord.

L-81 These people, many of them know me for years and years. Brother Moore, Your servant, Brother Brown, and others that's followed me across the world in meetings to people I couldn't even speak their language. Hear the Holy Spirit come right down, tell them all about them. And Father, it's for Your glory. Tens of thousands times thousands has come to worship the Lord Jesus through it, and in this I humbly thank Thee that You gave me the privilege, I have a part in serving You; and let me come into this world to show my appreciations of my Saviour that You let me serve Your people while I'm serving You. Now, help me again tonight, won't You, Lord, as a vindication of Your Presence, and Thou knowest my heart that all praise and all glory and all honor goes to Thee. In Jesus' Name, I pray. Amen. [Brother Branham speaks to someone away from microphone--Ed.]...?... Oh, yeah. I just rather wait till He gets on me. Brother just asked me for what about praying for these handkerchiefs. I happen to miss your handkerchiefs, just send up home, Jeffersonville, Indiana, I'll send you one. And we have great success in praying for the sick that way. But I--I'd rather feel the anointing of the Spirit of that than I--I feel more like sending it to you. Now, I want to look on the prayer line. I want all you prayer line look this way to me, you that's in the prayer line. I suppose... Is brother--is brother out...?... now in prayer line...?... See?...?... All right. I don't think there is a person there that I know. Are you all strangers to me, raise your hands. I don't now you? All right. There you are. How many out there you know that I don't know you, raise your hands, I don't know you? Now, if there's unbelievers here, look at that. Now, watch the Holy Spirit... If He does come... Now, Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now keep this down.

L-82 I've just been announced by my boy that tomorrow night is the last of the healing services for me. So you get your sick out tomorrow night. Look. Now, look, friends. I want you to look this a way and believe with all your heart. If Jesus Christ died at Calvary and there He settled to God the full penalty for sin and sickness, then it's all settled. Is that right? It's all settled. Then there's not a person in the world that could do anything towards healing you. It's already been done. No one could save you. It's already been done. The only thing that you have to do is confess your faith in it. Is that right? How many knows the work is finished? 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min When Jesus died and then said it's finished, it was finished forever. That's right. Then as far as any man coming through saying, "I have power to heal you." He's telling you something wrong. "I got something here I can put on you to heal you." That's wrong. Only thing that ever be done to heal you was done there at Calvary. He was wounded for your transgressions; by His stripes you were healed. You were healed.

L-83 Now, the only thing you were saved. Many here got saved awhile ago, raised up their hands. They were saved nineteen hundred years ago. They just accepted it now. Fountain was opened, whosoever will. There's where it was paid for. You just now accepted it. Now, the only thing that a man could do towards healing would be to preach to you the Bible. Some of the elders and pastors anoint you with oil. That's their ministry. Others lay hands on you. That's their ministry, and if my humble ministry that the Lord has given me since birth is this: to see visions, foresee things before they happen, and see things that's already happened. And by that, it brings the people to a realization. Now, preaching the Gospel; that's the Holy Spirit does that. Teach them the Bible; that's the Holy Spirit does that. Foreseeing things and foretelling things; that's the Holy Spirit. It's all God. It's gifts in the Church. It's a shame it cuts so many of them out, valuable gifts. There's gifts of speaking in tongues; there's gifts of interpretation of tongues. It's been misused greatly, but that don't take it out of the Church. It's there anyhow.

L-84 There's gifts of prophecy; there's prophets and gifts of prophecy. Now, there's gifts of prophecy; that's just in the Church, but a prophet is born a prophet. Every prophet that was ever in the world was born a prophet. Gifts and callings are without repentance. That's the five major gifts of the body: apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists. God puts them in the Church Himself. See? We will... Got a lot of make-believe preachers, and a lot of make-believe prophets, but God puts them in, then Himself. And He speaks of His gifts. He testifies of them. Now, looky here. Here's a bunch of people standing in this line, fifteen or twenty or what was called. There's people setting out there that I know nothing about, and if the Holy Spirit will come down and anoint me, and if they don't believe me, it won't happen anyhow. It's not me; it's you. You're the one that... It wasn't Jesus that healed the woman. It was the woman got healing herself by believing in Him. See? She touched Him. Now, He's the High Priest tonight that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. You can touch Him if you're sick. Say, "Lord, touch me. I'm touching You." Watch Him turn around and speak to you.

L-85 Now, if He will do that, and these people here that I know nothing about, if He will do the same things that He did when He was here on earth, every person that raised their hand that you'd believe on Him and worship Him, is that right? The Lord bless you. I have to talk to you just a minute, lady, if you'll come. Give the ushers or some of them your prayer card 'fore to come up and come close. Now, I just want you to stand here, lady, and I'm waiting. Now, I'm going to ask the audience... Now, it's raining outside. I want you to be just as quiet as you can for just a few moments. Just--just a little bit and see what the Holy Spirit will do.

L-86 Now, everyone be expecting. Just don't say, "Oh, oh, oh." Don't do that. Just set quiet. "You hear, God. With all my heart, I come to You. I come believing." Watch Him turn around and call me out. See? Watch Him in prayer... If you come in the prayer line critically, watch Him tell you your conditions. And I'd be afraid to tell you what would happen. 'Cause many setting here seen what happened. Preacher come up to the platform is paralyzed yet tonight. A man come in the meeting, and set back over in the crowd before thousands of people to hypnotize me. And was there he'd make... Go in the army camps and make boys bark like dogs and hypnotize them, and they, bunch of fanatics, brought him up there to hypnotize me in the meeting. And the Holy Spirit turned around and said, "You child of the devil." And rebuked him, and they packed him out of the building and still that way.

L-87 Another man come, when epileptic spell, and he had his church was there was unbelievers. That happened up here 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min at--at Jonesboro, Arkansas. Set in the church there with a bunch big of his people. I said, "Duck your head down." He said, "I don't have to." Epileptic spell kinda wouldn't go off the child. I said, "Lord, You see his critical condition. Don't let this child suffer for him," and I said, "Satan, leave the boy." And twenty-eight received epilepsy in the room. Phoenix, Arizona: the officials of the city setting there, wouldn't put his head, and he got furious, just real hostile about it. Brother Moore remembers the night, Brother Brown. Went about two months after that, they pulled me over, his wife and her hanging on my trouser legs like that through the mud over in California there and had him setting back there, going, "Aah, aah, aah." And whiskers hanging over his face, completely insane. We're not playing church, friends. This is the Holy Spirit. Not me; It's Him. So be careful what you do. Must come more reverent. Come expecting. Stand still now. God does something, you want to worship Him. That's wonderful, but now be real reverent.

L-88 Now, this lady, standing here. I suppose, sister, you and I are strangers? Did you raise your hand to one another? I don't know you. You don't me, and--and here we are meeting for the first time. Is that right? That's the first time. Now, the lady, now would you just raise up your hand so the people can see this our first time meeting in life. All right. I know nothing of her. She knows nothing of me. Now, what if she's sick. What if there's something else wrong. I--I couldn't tell you. I don't know.

L-89 But here is a very similar picture of what happened up at Samaria one day. The Lord Jesus, a Man in flesh and a Samaritan woman, and they met and begin to talk to one another. And Jesus carried a conversation with her. He said, "Bring Me a drink." She said, "It's not customary for Jews to have anything to do with Samaritans." Did you ever read that? You know the story. And He said, "But if you know Who you talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink." Well, the conversation went on...?... After while, Jesus looked right at her and said, "Go get your husband." He found her trouble wasn't it? He said go get... That's what was the matter with her. Is that right? Is that what was the matter with her then? All right, said, "Go, get your husband." She said, "I don't have any." He said, "That's right. You got five." She said, "Sir, I perceive that You are a Prophet." She said, "Now, we know that when the Messiah cometh." (You believe Jesus was the Messiah?) Said, "When the Messiah cometh, He will tell us these things. Tell us all things, but Who are You?" He said, "I'm He." See?

L-90 Now, if that was the sign of the Messiah (the Messiah is the anointed of God), if that was the sign of the Messiah in Galilee nineteen hundred years ago, and if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, it's the sign of the Messiah tonight after nineteen hundred years. Is that right? Now, the unbelievers never will believe, but the believers will believe. Now, I'm just talking to you in this same manner, knowing that I'm just a--a--a man standing here talking to you and don't know you. But I perceive that you are a believer. You're a Christian. If it was a sinner or a critic, seems like there's something cold about them. The Spirit that's on me now, and I'm waiting for It to move to you so I can see what's happened. Now, if the Lord Jesus, sister, will let me know what you're standing there for, knowing that I don't know, and He will let me know, will you believe that He's going to give you what you asked Him for? You will? All right. May He grant it is my sincere prayer.

L-91 For I--I know that every person has things they need; sometimes it's--it's health; sometimes it's domestic troubles; and sometimes it's like the woman had; and sometimes it's financial troubles. And He helps us in finances, and feeds me and my family, and feeds us all like He does His birds. And I... He... If we're sick, He knows what's wrong with us. He knowed the man that had that infirmity for thirty-eight years. He knew about it. Turned it around and asked him what was the reason, and honest about those things. He knows all things, doesn't He? 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min Now, I'm not just--just... Jesus talking to the woman was contacting her spirit. All He was doing. Father told Him to go up there. That's all. He just went up there and that settled it. 'Cause here's when the woman come out, but for you... Now, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I take every spirit in here under control of the Holy Spirit and may they act as I see.

L-92 The lady's extremely nervous. She's suffering from a nervous condition. I can see her walking in the house, nervous, holding her hands, putting her fingers up when she sets down, moving her hands like that when she sets. There's something or other she's looking to her doctor or something. It's like... It's on her shoulder back like. And let's see. I didn't hear just what he said. It's a little place. It's a little... It's a... He called it a cyst. That's what he did, and I see you... You got a kinda of a rectal trouble. And, I see you at a... either at a clinic or a hospital or something. It was an operation of some sort. Oh, it was a fistula operation, and that's been some time ago, and it hasn't healed up yet. That's right. THUS SAITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. That's true, isn't it? Do you believe that this now that's on... Not your brother, but on me... Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. If they lay their hands on the sick, they will get well." You believe it? Heavenly Father, I curse the disease of her body and lay hands upon her in Christ's Name that she'll be made well. Amen. God bless you, my sister. Just go and have faith in God.

L-93 Do you believe? You really having faith? How do you do, lady? You and I are--are strange to each other. I do not know you, and that's right. But He does know you. You just... Somebody give you a prayer card, and your number just happened to be called. That's--that's the only thing there is. Now if that's right, raise your hand that we're total strangers, but Jesus knows you from the foundation of the world. And He knew me from the foundation of the world. And when we come on earth, we come only by His will. His Father's grace brought us here. He's fed us and brought us to this time. He give me His grace to become a Christian. He give you His--His grace to become a Christian, a believer, for you are a believer. All right. Then He give me a gift to speak to you about Him, and that's the only thing I can do, isn't it?

L-94 And you're suffering with an extremely nervous condition, very nervous. So much of that... So much that you get trembling. You want to drop things all the time. That's right. Then your... You got a lot of fluid in your body, excess fluid. Say, you've had an operation too, sometime ago. That operation was the cause of that fluid. They done the wrong thing, and that's right, and that's why fluid has gathered ever since. And now you believe that God is here to take that away from you? Dear God, if You're so present to know the human lives, how present are you, Lord? As close as our hearts is to us. And now in behalf of my sister, I pray that the prayer of intercession and ask You, Lord God, to rebuke the devil that's tormented this woman and let her be made well in Christ's Name. Amen. Now, lady, I'll tell you what I want you to do, that you know that is leaving you. Tonight when you go home, I want you to take a string put it around you, measure where--where... How--how big the string is. Then tomorrow night before coming, measure yourself again and cut off of that string, how much you shrunk between this and tomorrow night, lay here on the desk. Will you do it for me? Thank you, lady. Have faith in God. Don't doubt.

L-95 Are you believing? That's what Jesus said for you to do. All things are possible to them that believe. Amen. Praise the Lord. You believe God healed you of that back trouble, lady? You believe He make you well? You do it? All right. You can have your healing then. Your faith makes you whole. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thou canst believe, all things are possible. I don't know you. Only God knows you. Before I knowed, but we're strangers to one another, are we? I--I don't know you. You look healthy enough to me; a bit pale but you look healthy enough, but God does know your condition. God knows what you're here for. I don't, but if He will reveal to me what you're here for. Will you believe it?

L-96 There's something about the woman's strength. Yes, sir. But you're here for somebody else, and that somebody else is a relative to your husband and that is his, I believe, grandmother. That's right. Isn't that right? That's right. She's dying with cancer. That is right. Your husband would like to know that...?... If he would just throw them old cigarettes down. That's right, isn't it? Setting with a pack in his pocket now, if he'd just throw those things out and really pray for 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min his mother I believe God would hear his prayer. Not reading your mind, not at all, but Jesus Christ is standing here. You're aware of that, lady. Yes, you are anemic too. Yes you are anemic. You're extremely nervous woman and another thing you have a--a condition of your blood. It's a low blood pressure. You've tried and tried and tried to gain weight, and you can't do it. That's right. Isn't that right? That's THUS SAITH THE LORD. See? Now, you believe you're in His Presence? You accept Him now for everything you asked for. Then, heavenly Father, I lay hands upon this woman and condemn the devil that has been tormenting and ask that Jesus Christ take over in Christ's Name I ask it. Amen.

L-97 How could you disbelieve? Well, what more can He do? If thou canst believe, all things are possible, if thou canst believe. Amen. But you got to believe. Jesus said, "If you can believe, then all things are possible." Praise the Lord. How wonderful. Have faith. Something happened. I couldn't see where it was at. Somebody got healed in the audience just then. That's right. It's right through here somewhere. Stop praying. Don't let the devil get that by me. Bladder trouble, lady. Setting right back there. You believe the Lord Jesus makes you well? Then you can have your healing. God bless you. You setting behind that little girl, was standing up behind you there. I see the--the Angel of the Lord standing above here, but couldn't tell where it was at. The little girl setting up there. I couldn't tell where it was at. You were praying. You were praying that God would speak to me to speak to you. If that's right, raise up your hand? All right there you are. Hallelujah.

L-98 We worship Thee, Lord Jesus. We give Thee praise and glory. Thou art the Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the valley, the Morning Star. Amen. How wonderful He is. All right, little lady, you setting just below her there a bit got hay fever hadn't you? You believe the Lord Jesus will make you well. If you can believe it, you can receive it. God bless you. All right. Beth...?... talking with the lady said just got healed a few minutes ago. Put your hands up. Be sure it's the right... No, the little lady behind you, sister. Right behind... Black hair. There you... You turned around just then, lady. It's you the one He's over. Yes. Amen. It's gone. It isn't a disease. It's a condition in the nose. See? The thin skin. I don't believe you'll ever be bothered with it again. God can grow a new layer of skin on there. He's the Creator. Amen. Hallelujah.

L-99 How do you do, sir? Oh, I'm tired now, but I--I believe the Lord Jesus Christ is here, and I'm helping, hoping that He will help somebody, every one of you to be well. You're a fine man. I like you. Thank you. But God can heal you of your rupture, hernia and make you well. You believe that? I tell you one thing if you'd do. You got a habit you'd like to give away: smoking cigarettes, and then the other thing you ought to give your heart to Christ right now, 'cause you're not a Christian. Do you want to give your heart to Christ some... You--you come up here with that intention, didn't you? Raise your hand if that's right. Your sins are forgiven. Heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ, Thou has said, "He that heareth My words and believeth on Him that sent Me has Everlasting Life." Our brother has gone from death unto Life. O God...?... as I stand by here a witness of your power. In Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sir. Now, he's my brother, not a sinner, but my brother. God bless you. Go on your road rejoicing and be made happy. Praise the Lord. Pour out exceedingly abundantly. Oh, how wonderful. He's wonderful.

L-100 You believe the Lord Jesus heal of that bladder trouble setting back there, lady? If you believe with all your heart, you may receive it. Just as you speak it, the lady right over here got high blood pressure... Setting there on the--about two from the end; and you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ take it away from you, lady? You do? In the striped looking dress on, you believe with all your heart? Lift up your hand if you believe it. Raise up your... Right there you are. All right. The Lord bless you. You receive it. Hallelujah. I challenge you in Christ's name to believe it. Amen. Oh, my. All right. How many now believe He can wave over the assembly here and heal every person. Now, He'll do it, just watch and believe Him. Look and live. Here's a lady here, a total stranger. Never seen her in my life. God knows her. I don't. If God will reveal the secret of this woman's heart, or something other that she knows that I know nothing about... I never seen her in my life. She's a 56-0731, Raising Jairus' Daughter, Life Tabernacle, Shreveport, LA, 112 min stranger, but if God will reveal, how many in here will accept Christ right now as your Healer, Saviour, coming King...?... I just feel that the Holy Spirit is fixing to do something. Did you ever have a feeling? I just got it in my heart. I just feel that you just pray for the...?... Now just believe it. May He grant it to this poor woman.

L-101 Lady, look at me. Every time Moses met people, he didn't have to declare to them that he was sent of God by doing his sign. He done it once. I kinda believe this audience is ready to receive it. I believe this is the best He had since we've been in Shreveport. Now, God loves you, and you love Him. I don't know you. He does know you, but now the woman is going from me. She has something wrong with her throat. It's a throat disease. Not exactly a throat... You're a preacher. You're a preacher, a woman preacher, and you... When you speak, it's a... After I see you, maybe you hold a few nights you're... Something like that, then you have trouble with your throat. And you're a broken-hearted woman preacher. You got a burden on your heart, and you've come to me as your brother to intercede with you to Christ for a child, a son, that's a drinks. And you're so broken hearted, knowing that you're a woman minister and your son drinks; and you come for me to ask Christ with you to throw a block in that boy's way somewhere to stop him. Isn't that true? That's true, raise your hand.

L-102 You believe Him? Do you want to receive Him? Do you believe me to be His servant? How many of you really want to be healed? I want to know, from the bottom of your heart. I'm going to ask you to do something. I--I set here for hours. I want this altar call to come up. I've got a little strength left. It's true, but I want to see this altar call, and I want to see every one of you healed. I want to see every one of you... And listen God has proved to you that I--I--I'm not a false prophet. I am His servant, and He's declaring Hisself by a Divine gift. I say to you that every person in here, if you'll look to Christ right now, you'll be healed. Now, you believe it? Now, put your hands over on one another, no matter who you're setting by. Put your hands on one another...?... And God will raise them up...?... In Jesus Christ's Name.
