--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 Good evening, audience. This is a great privilege for me to be here tonight. I've always wanted to come to New Mexico. I'm so glad that God permitted me to come before I had to go overseas. We're here for five nights now to do all that we can for you, and minister to you in the Name of the Lord Jesus. (I'll pull this just a little closer.) 'Cause I've been speaking, traveling over much of the country, and I kinda gotten just a little bit hoarse in my throat. Maybe one week, I'm where it's real real warm, and next week where it's real cold, and constantly speaking day and night. I trust that this will be a great time for the people of God here. And I'll do all that I know how to pray that God will grant a great meeting here, while we're here. May His Spirit be present to heal all that are sick and afflicted...?... And may those who are, haven't as yet come into the covenant with God through His Son, Christ Jesus, may receive this great blessing of being saved while the services here are going on.

L-2 I trust that after the service, there'll be an old fashion revival just sweep plumb through the country here...?... 'causing every person to be with new fire. I believe we're living in a--a terrible day, yet a wonderful... a day just before the coming of Jesus. Just before they came after me a few moments ago, I was speaking to my little son; he said, "Daddy, just what will it be like when Jesus comes?" Said, "We just don't know." It'll be glorious, I know, when we, whatever we do. One said of them, "Eye has not seen; ear has not heard; or entered the heart of man what God has for them in store that love Him." And the only thing we can do is love Him and believe, and by and by He will manifest Hisself to us. Don't you believe that?

L-3 And now, many people on account of the--the newspapers and so forth, I've noticed that here, call me a Divine healer. Why, Christian friends, you know that's wrong. I'm no Divine healer; I'm your brother. Now, there's only One Healer, and that's God. He's the only One that heals. A gift of healing doesn't make you a Divine Healer, no more than the gift of preaching would make me Divine Saviour. It's a gift. Now, the gift itself will speak for itself. Anything that God does, you do not have to be ashamed of it, or think it's way off somewhere, because God shall declare Himself, His gift. Hebrews, I believe, the 11th chapter and the 2nd verse, said God testified of His gift. A man can say anything, a person. For a man to say anything is one thing; then for God to say something, it's something different. And if I should testify of something, and God would not back that up, then you and me are... I told you something falsely. But if I tell you something, and God has declared that to be so, then you believe it's so, for the very works say so. You believe that it is God.

L-4 Now, the way this works, is not to heal anybody. There's no mortal ever lived on earth that was a Divine healer. If anybody could have taken credit for being a Healer, would've been our Lord Jesus Christ. But He said He wasn't no Healer. He said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; it's My Father that dwelleth in Me; He doeth the works." And if He would not take credit for being a Healer, but give all praise to the Father; then how much more ought we mortals to do so. Only God can heal. This is just as strange to me as it will be with you. To my belief, the gifts and callings are without repentance, that they're gifts of God, that they're born here on the earth through foreknowledge of God. It isn't what I could desire; it isn't what that I can work myself to or you. It's what God in His foreknowledge has done.

L-5 I couldn't help because that I was born with--with blue eyes, or small in figure, but it's the way that God brought me here. If I had wanted to be... I tell you; I want to be a great big man. But God didn't intend for me be a--a large man. He knew me just the way I am, so I could... I'm satisfied with the way God made me, and I move the best that I know how to glorify Him with this body while I'm here on earth. If He had made me a large man, I'd been a large man and...?... And when He sends something for us to do, well, let us do it with all of our heart, giving Him glory for whatever He done for you. 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min The gift itself doesn't do anything. There's no way for anybody to ever have anything from God except by faith. God has made that His way; that was from the beginning for people to believe God by faith. That was given to Adam and Eve to believe God's Word. And when Eve disbelieved God's Word, then it brought death, and sorrow, and sickness to disbelieve God.

L-6 Jesus said, "I can, if you believe." Now, in order to believe God, most people have to have something to look at, some visible, something to look at to represent God. I believe one of the hardest things that God has ever had to do, was to get one mortal to believe another mortal. We won't believe one another. And we are God's agency. We know that. Now, when God made His first statue of healing, it was piece of brass on a pole out in the wilderness. Is that true? In the wilderness... Now, there was no virtue in the brass or in a pole, but it was a ordinance of God. Again He... No one knew just how it worked; it was just look by faith. It represented something; it was a foreshadow of Jesus Christ Who would come to the earth to be our sin and sickness Bearer.

L-7 Later on after the days of the serpent, God sent a Angel down from heaven and troubled the water on a pool called Bethesda, and ever who stepped in that water first, having faith, was healed of whatsoever disease they had. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] Into the waters... Now, the brass serpent done no healing. It was their faith in what God had done by the brass serpent. Is that right? The water done no healing. It was the Angel of God on the water that done the healing. The water couldn't say, "See, I'm healing water." No, it was the Angel doing the healing. When the Angel left, the water was water.

L-8 And a man is just a man until he's fully submitted to God, and then Deity dwells in that man, the Holy Spirit. Not the man, but God in the man does the work. So Jesus then, when He came, He was a Man born of a virgin birth. His mother was Mary; His Father was Jehovah God. You believe that? And then in that body God dwelled. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. Jesus said, "It's not Me that doeth the works; It's My Father that dwelleth in Me; He doeth the work." And that was God speaking through mortal lips, that could raise the dead, still the waters, and so forth. Then when He ascended on high, He gave gifts to men. One man received a great gift of healing, so the people that laid in his shadow and were healed. Not the man, but their faith in God that was in the man. Do you understand?

L-9 Another one, they taken handkerchiefs from his body and aprons, and laid upon the sick people, and evil spirits went out of people. Not because it was Saint Paul; he was a man who lived in flesh like you and I. And he died. He had to be redeemed by the Blood of Christ just like we do. It wasn't the man that done the healing; it was the Spirit of God in the man that done the healing, through the faith of the people. Is that right? Well, the same Holy Spirit is with us today. Jesus said, "I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world."

L-10 If I come confessing tonight that I had the spirit of a--an artist, you would expect me to do the--the work of the artist. You'd expect me to be able to catch the vision of a roaring sea, and things of home, the sunset, if I had the spirit of an artist. Listen closely. If the spirit of some great artist come upon me, like the Spirit of Elijah--Elijah came upon Elisha... If the Spirit of Elijah was on the Elisha, he done what Elijah done. And John the Baptist came in the Spirit of Elijah, and he was, wild man, so forth like the other two had. But when... Now, he come...?... something like Elijah did, he run into the wilderness; and John then asked if this is the Messiah, should he look for another one. He come in--in that spirit.

L-11 If I came in the--the spirit of--of John Dillinger, you would expect me to have guns and--and act like Mr. Dillinger did. And if I told you I came here, and I'm a Christian, and the Spirit of Christ is upon me, you would expect me to act and do like Jesus did, for His Spirit would be upon me. Is that right? Then what He done, "These things that I do, greater shall you do; for I go to My Father." Is that the Scripture? Now, the Spirit of Christ is in the Church. It has never left the Church; It's been in the Church. And the days are growing evil, because that knowledge, man's knowledge, that he received in the garden of Eden... When he left the Tree of Life to eat from the tree of knowledge, that knowledge is increasing constantly. And as knowledge increases, 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min they get away from the Bible and get into a theory. But Jesus said, and the Bible's full, that when they came... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... And now, the power has come, for the world has become very skeptic.

L-12 And I believe that we're living in the hours just before the coming of Jesus the second time. Now, upon that, in speaking that the Spirit of Christ still is in the Church and in the people... I'll explain to you how the gift came and how it works. I was born of a humble parents, borned being a Catholic. I was born in Kentucky. And I believe that gifts and callings, as I said, are without repentance, that you're born here in the world with these gifts. Just the same as you're born to be a musician. You might give your child, give it all kinds of lessons. But if that musical talent isn't in it, it'll never do no more good. Is that right? But we're born the same way in the spiritual realms, for gifts and callings of God are without repentance. That you might know, Jesus Christ was foreordained of God. He was the One was seen from the garden of Eden. Do you believe that?

L-13 John the Baptist, seven hundred and twelve years before he was born, he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness said Isaiah. Is that true? Jeremiah, God told Jeremiah, "Before you were born from your mother's womb, I knew of you, and sanctified you, and ordained you a prophet over the nations," before he was ever born from his mother's womb. Moses and many others, foreordained of God. Not everybody, but different gifts and callings to minister to the people are the foreknowledge of God. That's the only way I can expect any understanding to the people who come and see it.

L-14 I was a little boy, first recognition. I have it in my book, it'll be out pretty soon. My mother's own words concerning what taken place, a little cabin the morning when I first came. I never come here by my own power. You never come by your own power. I never knew when I was coming. I don't know when I'm leaving, none of us do. We may yet some of us may leave the world before the night is over. I do not know. But I was seven years old; I was packing water from a well, and a voice spoke to me out of a bush, as a whirlwind in a bush, said, "Don't never smoke, or drink, or defile your body in any way. There'll be a work to do when you get older." I said, "That's sacred."

L-15 Down through life's journey, it's been time after time. I could hear the Voice... It's not Something that you imagine, not something that you dream, but brother, it was just as--just as real as you hear my voice. And then as I got older, He give me some more...?... I would see Him standing. It was going to a vision. And I would see things going to happen. And I'd just act it out like drama. It wasn't fully manifested. I did not belong to a church. I lived a clean moral life, but not the church. I finally became affiliated with this certain faith of the Baptist church. It's in the ministry.

L-16 After while, I met up with the Full Gospel people. And I... Just before then, I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then look like it just kept coming more and more. And then it, He appeared on the river, one time when I was baptizing before probably ten thousand people, like a great morning star came down where I was standing. Thousands seen It. He went back right into the heavens. I was preaching once, and while I was preaching, It came in to the room, like physical. He does many times. Here a few weeks ago in Houston, Texas, He came down, and a photographer which was present at that time caught the picture of It. Went through all kinds of examinations by some of the best men in the United States to prove scientifically that the supernatural Being was God.

L-17 Here's what's happened, when the time I met Him, when He appeared as a Man, I was setting in my study. He came... I seen the Light spread out on the floor. He came walking to me. He looked like a Man that weighed two hundred pounds. And this Light was just above me. And He had His arms folded. He had a look as you don't see on the face of mortals. He looked very calm and quiet, very loving. His voice when He spoke... I knew it was the same voice that had spoke all down through life's journey. But I'd never seen His face. He was dark complexioned, more like the Spanish, the Jewish people. He had His arms folded, and He looked to weigh two hundred pounds in statue and height, had hair to His shoulders, and a smooth face. And yet, when He walked, it seemed like that there was a power and He'd do anything. And I was setting there. And I 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min was so scared that I--I was biting my fingers. Just imagine, standing face to face with something like that. I was biting my fingers, then I went...

L-18 He said, "Do not fear." When that voice spoke, I knew it was the same One. He looked at me; His eyes looked upon me kindly. Not to look sympathizing with this Angel, but that... Said, "Do not fear." Said, "I'm sent from the Presence of God to tell you that you were born a peculiar birth, and your peculiar life has been to indicate, that you're to take the gift of Divine healing to the people of the world." I said, "Sir, I'm uneducated. I couldn't go." He said, "If you'll get them to believe you, and if you're sincere when you pray, nothing shall stand before your prayer, if you'll get them to believe you." And I said, "I bet they wouldn't believe me, Sir." He said, "You'll be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given two signs, to get the people to believe you is the really the issue." He said, "One of them was detecting diseases just by holding the person's right hand in your left." He said, "Then if you'll be sincere, it shall come to pass that you'll tell the very secrets of their hearts, and the things that they are doing wrong, to build the faith in the people to be in faith and to vindicate you that I--God will send it to you."

L-19 I said, "I--I'm uneducated, Sir. And I--I couldn't go." He said, "I'll be with you." The Light begin to catch up; the Angel went with the Light. I started off, healed a lot of sick. I come in one night, setting right in my little church, and my piano player was playing... I never heard it before, a little song "Only Believe," as I walked in my church. Something struck me. [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] My words... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]

L-20 It's not that I am with a grammar school education. You know when local game warden in the city working for a living, been preaching fifteen years...?... Never even took an offering for myself in my life, never did do anything, I didn't believe in it. But I--I worked for a living, and...?... Not if--if I took money that had been give to me, I would still was going have to ask God whether I could have it or not for an offering since it was took. Now, here not long ago somebody wanted to... I had a Chevrolet truck. My phone ring; someone wanted buy me a Cadillac car. I searched it out, come down through Arkansas, from...?... men out there audience. Those poor people knew out there with them long cotton sacks on their back, picking cotton, and come into the prayer line with a little...?... maybe eat a little corn bread and...?... at supper time, me come down the road...?... Do you understand it?...?... I didn't come for that, friends. I come to help you. That's what I'm here for, is to help you.

L-21 He told me if I get the people to believe me. That seems strange for me to have to say this, "You believe in me?" Said, "Aren't you supposed believe God?" You must believe that. You must believe God and believe Christ, and believe the Holy Ghost. Then after believing all of them, God wants you to believe me. But then there's something for you to do. Now, you can believe a man and still the gift won't work for you. Reason today people believe in God. It's still Jesus. Isn't that right? He said, "As you believe in God, believe also in Me." Did He say it? "As you have belief in God, you believe in Me." That's the only way He could help them, 'cause they believe. Now, I want you to believe me as one of them. But I want you to believe the day is coming and will to you... And I'll do all I can to help you.

L-22 Now, of course, a word for my people. Please, no matter what sin you done, it'll be knowed here at the platform. The first gift... That's the first manifestation of the gift, it made... Many people know that for about two or three years; it's worked right along. Just that I could detect diseases...?... as a doctor, whatever it is to you, it'd be the same thing. But that don't heal you. That'll encourage your faith to know that there's a supernatural Being is standing here. Then after about three years, in Canada about five months ago the other gift came down and was manifested. Now, I tell the secrets of the hearts, the things that you do, the things that you've--unconfessed sin, and so forth. See, it's perfect, because it's of God. Now, that doesn't heal you. But what it does, is let you know that the Jesus that we've all talked about, and your pastor has preached about, is only in this as something more to make you believe in Him, and have faith in Him...?... How could we discern...?... down and die for you. 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min

L-23 He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; with His stripes we are healed. It's Him. I'm merely a channel. I'm a man, just like any of these other men. Not half as much in the Kingdom of God probably as some of these brothers setting before me. Maybe not loved like they're loved, because I'm one borned out of season. I have no religious background. And I run from God many...?... 'fore this one. But it just so happens that God, once I see the works of His body. And I'm only glad here for this my life... And all the things that I had planned in life to do over to Him, that He might bless His people through the gift to help men. Do you see what I mean?

L-24 Now, someone might wonder when people come into the line, of knowing their diseases and their thoughts... I do not know them? And you might come right now, I wouldn't know it but a few moments. If the Angel of the Lord comes to me, it's God's gift. Maybe the same Angel that was on the water back there was doing the same thing; I do not know. But when Jesus came... That you might know that He is here, just before we close and start the prayer line... Jesus, when He first was manifested here on the earth to the people, there was a man by the name of Nathanael, or Philip, rather, went and found the man by the name of Nathanael. He was praying. And Philip said to Nathanael, "Come, see Who we found," said, "Jesus of Nazareth, the One Moses spoke of." He said, "Could anything good come out of Nazareth?" "Oh," he said, "You come and see."

L-25 And when they coming back to the place... In other words, if the truth would come, it'd come through the great orthodox churches somewhere. But many times God's workman came just in a different way to get...?... But I...?... perceiving their thoughts, and He will reveal it to babes such as will learn. You believe that? God will do it...?... And so when he came to where Jesus was, Jesus looked at him, and He said, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there's no guile." In other words, simplifying, He said, "You are a Christian, a devout person." And Nathanael said to Him there at the prayer line; he said, "Whence knowest Thou me, Rabbi?" He said, "Before you came here, Nathanael, you were under a tree, praying." And that little Jew, he run up to Him and said, "Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel." Was that right? ...?...[Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?... Knowing hisself, knowing he was a Christian, knowing hisself. That proves that there's nobody knowed it except Jesus, God, and Nathanael; he knew that no one...?... knew that.

L-26 Now, this... We claim that that Spirit that was on Jesus Christ, will do the same thing tonight. Is that right? Would It? The woman at the well, can you imagine He spoke to her, she had a conversations with that Being, like Nathanael. And finally said, "Go get your husband?" She said, "I have none." Said, "You've said well, when you said you have none. You've had five, and the one you have now is not your husband." She said, "I perceive that You're a prophet." She said, "Messiah cometh and tell us all things." He said, "I'm He." Now, if Jesus Christ, the Spirit of God that was upon Him, and if you... If I confess to be a Christian, and profess that His Spirit is upon me to do as He did, would It produce the same thing?

L-27 Now, the Spirit that would know you, can stand or no cripple, or no blind, or no afflicted, will be able to pass by without being healed, and when it gets to a...?... different to be here and out in the audience, then you'll... Well, I wouldn't know exactly, but if I could contact Him, and He will speak back himself, will just let us see for ourselves, and may God grant it...?... I'm not a preacher or a great public speaker. But from my heart I'm trying to introduce to you Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.

L-28 For a reading of the Word found in Exodus the 23rd chapter, 20th verse, beginning, God sending His prophet Moses: 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him... obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. But if thou will indeed obey his voice... do all that I speak; then will I be an enemy to thy enemies, an adversary to thy adversaries. For my Angel shall go before thee... Moses did nothing. It was the Angel of God. Is that right? What did It look like that led Israel? A Pillar of Fire by night, and a Cloud by day. I believe He's still leading on. We know that was the Angel of the covenant. Is that right? It was the Logos or the Christ. He's still the same, leading the people today as He was then.

L-29 Let us believe Him with all of our hearts while we bow our heads. Our heavenly Father, we just love You with all of our hearts. We're so thankful that Thou has redeemed us. To think that one time we were aliens, without God, without mercy. And Thy Son Jesus, came to the earth, and born a virgin birth, and He lived a spotless life, and was offered up as a sacrifice for us at Calvary. He was wounded for our transgressions, and with His stripes we are healed. Oh, the Blood that makes atonement. And tonight, by that Blood and His eternal Spirit, by the washing of the Word, we're brought in now to become the sons and the daughters of God. O Father, when we think of being a son and daughter of God even in this day when men of perverse mind, as Moses and Aaron was withstood by the...?... Oh, to think that we can be the sons and daughters of God, led by the Holy Spirit with power to save our lives, to cleanse us from sin, and to give us relationship with God. And it does not yet appear what we shall be, but oh, we know we'll have a body like His, for we shall see Him as He is, the glorious, the magnificent Son of God, the Redeemer, and we shall crown Him King of king and Lord of lords. Oh, that You would breathe upon us... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]...?...

L-30 God, stretch forth His mighty wings across this building for these nights and bathe it with His full dew drops of glory and mercy, and power of healing through Jesus Christ flow through our mortal bodies here, and may there not be one afflicted person left in our midst at the end of the services. Grant it, Lord. We love You. Thou knowest our hearts, more than people know our voices. You Who understand all things and know whether we love You... And, Lord, help us tonight now. And in this building that's been used for different things, Father, we pray now that as we dedicate the building and ourselves to You for service, that You'll drive back every foul spirit. May men and women that's come under this roof, come under conviction, may they come... May the Angels of God stand by every post, every seat, around the place, and take their seats. O God, may every person here that's in Your Divine Presence, may there be such a meeting that's never been known before in this country, may every minister be inspired, every member, every Christian, may sinners fall under conviction, and may there be a grace flowing on the people, and may they come to the knowledge of Christ being the same great Christ Jesus down through the ages that heals now, and will be forever. Father, we commit it all to You. As I go to call on you, send Your Angel, Lord, anoint Thy servant, and may the things that I have testified of, Lord, may You testify back tonight, and every night, with great signs and wonders. For we ask it in Jesus' Name, and Thy people will believe on You. Amen.

L-31 I'll turn the service for a little prayer line now, to my brother. He...?... and he will get your cards right here...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.] First night, we have kind of a little cruise. You know how it is, the... All of our party's not here, and everybody's...?... just exactly. I want everybody to be real reverent, just as reverent as you can be. And listen with all your--your hearts and believe on Him...?... of all your...?... Grant it. Now, if God heals at the platform, He allows me...?... And He will... He will heal right out there. Just taking the very thing that--that... And if you believe He will do it...?... Don't you believe it? It your faith; that's all it is (See?), faith to believe.

L-32 And now shall we bow our heads for a moment of prayer. Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight for Thy mercy and kindness...?... And now, may Your people come more near the One Who knows the heart of everyone here, knows all the redeemed. And I believe, Father, if You'll just let Him speak the things to the people, then their faith will 50-0300, Gifts And Callings Are Without Repentance, Carlsbad Air Base Recreation Center, Carlsbad, NM, 49 min look up to Thee and believe it. Grant it, dear Father, for I ask it in the Name of Thy Son Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, let's...?... That goes...?... by piano. If you all will chord real slowly, "Only Believe," for this first...?... Will you do that now, sister? Real slowly. And now, I want to ask everyone to bow their head. Now, I want you to bow your head and be real reverent...?... a little while, because no matter how much you're trying to believe now, there's a little expectancy there...?... And now, I know you all...?... Be reverent don't try to be kinda upset with...?... By the Spirit of God, at least...?... and they're not believers...?... more expectations, and it makes it very hard to deal with it...?... I can't make anyone believe; I can only make...?... God has to...?... You have to believe yourself then God will accept you. That's right.

L-33 Now, remember, that all people, that they might know that I do not claim to heal anyone. It only becomes when looking for...?... with our hearts and so forth. But there...?... It's coming to a place where...?... [Blank.spot.on.tape. Words are not clear--Ed.] I come to release. You don't have to tell me those things...?... after get understanding, we have to go forward. And when you...?... Now...?... Now, just...?... Only Believe mortal change to immortal..?... And Lord, let this man find You. Do you have a prayer card...?... Jesus caused all the Jews to...?... The great veil...?... God promises to heal. All things are possible to them that believe...?... Good evening, sister...?... back you look very healthy very strong, that...?... there's something wrong with you. Do you believe? That there's real strange feeling that you have now in His Presence. But there's no one ever comes near that anointing of the Holy Spirit but what they feel it...?... That's just the Presence of the Angel of God. Did you see that picture tonight? That's what--that's what's making you feel the way you are now. If you happen to lay your hand there just for a contact...?... tuberculosis. How old are you? You been saved? Father can...?... for you...?... But you have more faith just now than you've ever had in your...?... That is true. I--I'd never know those things 'less God would tell me...?... The Angel of the Lord is here to make you well. I ask God if He...?... The thing very strange to me causes a man...?... Isn't that right, sir? And now, if you notice...?... If you could only see...?... all things. Now, everyone be reverent and pray...?...

L-34 Our heavenly Father, our brethren has come in faith to believe that Thou art here to make him well. And...?... tried so hard, but tonight he's just letting down everything, coming now to...?... simple childlike faith to believe You tomorrow, to go forward testifying to everyone how You gave healing to glorify Jesus Christ. Help me now to have faith for him, that our faith together might drive this...?... shadowy spirit. Amen.
