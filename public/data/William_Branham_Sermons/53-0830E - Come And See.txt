--- TRANSCRIPT ---

L-1 All things are possible, Lord, I believe. I wonder if we could do this now, say, "Now, I believe." I won't believe after while; I believe right now, tonight, Lord. This settles it. I'm... Now, I believe." Let's sing it slowly now, and lowly now, come on. Now, I believe, now, I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe; [Brother Branham speaks to someone--Ed.]...?... Boze, I appreciate that...?... ... I believe, All things are possible, now, I believe. Now, let's bow our heads while the music continues on, if you will just a moment now.

L-2 Father, Thou has heard our pledge to Thee, that we now believe, believe the true Gospel story. And Jesus has risen from the dead, lives among the peoples. And all things are possible to them that will believe this. We can see You coming that morning, down off the mountain, Your hair blowing across Your neck. And there come a man with his boy; he said, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he's variously vexed with a devil. He throws him in the fire and in the water." As we would know it today as epilepsy... Said, "I brought him to the disciples, and they couldn't cure him; so I brought him to You." You said, "I can if you believe. For all things are possible to them that believe." He said, "Lord, I believe. Help Thou my unbelief." God, that's our cry tonight. Help Thou our unbelief. Strengthen us tonight. And may we go from here tonight and say like those coming from Emmaus, "Did not our hearts burn within us because of His Presence?" For we ask it in His Name. Amen. And be seated if you will.

L-3 The Lord bless each one of you. I know it's very warm in here tonight. When I'm really hot with coming up the street... Just one thing I want to say. I'm just wondering how that our lovely nation, America, is ever going to escape the wrath of God. While coming up the street, seeing ministers standing on the street along down through the places where wickedness was, preaching the Gospel as hard as they could, half nude women walking by, smoking cigarettes and carrying on, I wonder what God thinks about that? No one seemed to pay any attention to them, the men crying out with all their hearts: one here, and one there, and one over here. We're without an excuse. The Gospel's being preached. So we're without excuse.

L-4 Glad to have you back again tonight, Brother Tommy. Brother Tommy... last night I was seeing some pictures from overseas where he had been in meeting. We were talking about how that... Said when the good news come that a runner with a torch in his hand, a running down the trail and through the little grass village, crying, "Jesus has risen from the dead."... We here, we have our great big concrete troughs, when the power of God goes to fall, we explain it all away. And it goes off to one side. But not them, Brother Tommy, they've got their cups up ready. They want to receive it. They're hungering and thirsting for God.

L-5 And the first sign of God's goodness to them, they just scream out for victory, and they see it, receive it right then. Thousands are saved, no--no way to make--hard to make an altar call. You just--just ask how many wants to receive, and every sinner will accept Christ right then: ready to be baptized, ready to do anything you'd--you'd commission him to do. He's ready to go right then. How different it is in our country. God, be merciful to us. I was talking to a brother recently; he said, "Brother Branham, I believe you're just a little rude on that." Said, "God would not let our nation be bothered." Said, "It'll always stand this way until Jesus comes the land of the free and the home of the brave, because of our forefathers, what they did." 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min I said, "Brother Moore, blessings upon your heart, my brother. But God did not spare Israel. When they sinned, they reaped what they sowed." And we'll do the same thing: reap as we sow.

L-6 I want to read some of His blessed Word, then we'll go to prayer. And I want to say this: That I certainly appreciate you people gathering out. As I seen those ministers on the street and may... one of them of all... I forget how many I counted (going around through the street, just coming up, taking my time), how many ministers I seen, and the biggest crowd among them was about three or four people: no interest. And to see you come out and set in a hot building like this to hear the Gospel, I love you. Christian love... I have a respect for you that I can't--can't express.

L-7 Now, in Saint John the 1st chapter, and the 44th verse, I begin to read. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, a city of Andrew and Peter. Naphi... Philip findeth Nathanael, and said unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said unto him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael said unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered... him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou were under the... tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shall see greater things than these. And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, from henceforth you shall see the heavens open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

L-8 If you will believe... Just be faithful with the little things, God will show you great things. Believe Him and God will do it. Now, may He bless you, tonight, as we pray for the sick. I'll go right into the prayer line. I wish there was something more I could do to help you. But I--I can't. I'm just as helpless as any other man. I'm your brother. I'm not here tonight in the city of Chicago, not by choice but by leading of the Spirit. The very same Spirit that speaks here at nighttime, told me about six months ago that this would be this a way (See?), and just exactly where, all about it, and how the things would take place just as it's taken place.

L-9 Then He tells me then to make ready for overseas. So I know it won't be long now. I don't see. There's no arrangements made nor nothing, but I'm going overseas anyhow (See?), because He said so. See? We're ready to go. Just at His bidding now, we'll be leaving. And strange the other night, Brother Baxter and I have been talking, maybe, perhaps, going to India and just bypassing Africa, because there's two or three groups over there. One of them is Afrikaans and the other one is a English speaking. Well, the Afrikaans thinks the English... anyone speaks English... They've never got over the Boer War yet. And so they still have it at one another's neck.

L-10 And one says, "Let us sponsor it, let them help." And the other one said, "Let us sponsor it." They won't get together like they did the other time. Because we don't take finances. And we just as offerings is taken up, we put into the treasury. And somehow they--they didn't think they split it up right. The one said there was more Afrikaans than they was this other group and so... There's just two groups of them down there. One's Full Gospel and the other one Afrikaans. One thought one got the most or should have the most, because they had most people or... Now, they don't want to sponsor. I said, "Get your hearts together. I'll come set it up independent from either one of you and preach the Gospel." That's right.

L-11 Now, let them both come. We want to have unity in God's people. They must have it, friends. We are brethren. We might different one from another, but we're still brothers. The brother next to me is tall, light-headed, heavy-set, big, chunky-built, pugilist-type boy. But my mother setting out there is his mother, and my father is his father. He doesn't see--look like me; he doesn't talk like me. There is nothing about me that resembles him. Why, our habits is not alike; our ways are not alike; but still we are brethren. We are 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min brethren. His father is my... If my family will accept him with all of his peculiarities, they accept me with mine. So that's makes us brothers. So if God has accepted me with my peculiar ways and you with yours, we are brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus. No matter where we go to church, the thing of it is, have we been filled with God's Spirit? That's it. That's the main thing. And believe Him.

L-12 You wouldn't be setting here tonight if you didn't believe in the supernatural. You wouldn't set there with them little fans and fan like that just for curiosity. You've come here for a purpose: That's to know more about God. And I pray that God will grant it. I'll do all I can to pray for you, the sincerity of my heart. Now, can we pray again, if you will. I... One thing we can't do is pray too much. He said, "I would that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands."

L-13 Lord, we have no holy hands to lift up. But we lift up Jesus' hands which is holy. We lift them up, Lord, as Caleb and... did that day to Joshua, or to Moses. And we pray that the battle will go for the Lord tonight. We know that all the enemies are gathering around. They come just as close as they can. But we know, seated in this building somewhere, around in mid-air, around the platform here, are Angels of the Lord. Decisions must be made. And we stand as a representative of Jesus Christ. Now, Lord, may the enemy be defeated. Thou hast promised us that we should cast out evil spirits. That's what You said. And I believe that Lord, with all my heart. Let Thy Word be truth and every man a lie. And may it be proven here tonight, that Your power will be so predominant, that every evil spirit that would try to enter into the person or into the building, or that's got anyone bound, may they have to turn loose and get away. And may there be a shout of victory everywhere. Lord, may we break the--the pitcher tonight and let the fire fly. And the enemy will be defeated. Grant it, Father, we pray in the Name of Your holy Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.

L-14 All right. Billy? Now... All right. He's coming. All right. I... Get him and some of the ushers together if you would. And you all get me a drink. That's fine. All right. A's. All right. He give out prayer card A. All right. We can't... I don't think we could stand fifty at a time, but we can stand a few of them. All right, let's see. Let's--let's get about the first ten or fifteen to start with, and line them up over here if we can. Who's got A-number-1? A-number-2? A-number-3? A-number-4, A-number-5? A-number-6? A-number-7, 8, 9 to 10. Let's see that line up first and see how far we get along: A-number-1 to A-10.

L-15 All right. We'll see how they get lined up. I don't remember just how...?... we had. I want to know who all is going to pray tonight, now, just praying with all your heart? That's fine. All right. Can you take a few more, son? Can a few... Huh? About five? All right. Let's take to 15 then, bring another five. A-number-11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. See how that looks. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. I hate to drink that water, and I know maybe somebody is setting out there wanting a drink of water. It makes me feel little to do that, right here at the platform. But I'm... I rushed away without drinking any water. And I perspire so, till even my socks are wet, and so I... I... and just I nearly starve and I... So water, I drink much of it.

L-16 How does that look? 14 and 15 is missing. Look on your prayer cards now, if there's somebody in there might be deaf or something, or can't get up. Is there some wheelchairs setting down there? Look, check her card and see if she's got 15. Is it 15? All right. Pra... Got them. All right. Now, we'll see if we can get some more, just in a moment. Now, we'll just... If everyone will, just be seated and be real reverent, believe with all your heart, God will surely bring it to pass. Are you believing with all your heart, everywhere? Now, Brother Osborn, I'm depending on you now to pray for me. And Brother Boze, you up in here, everyone... You all pray up there tonight too. Just pray and ask God to help. It's very hard. I know that... You see, the Bible said when the Holy Spirit fell they were all with--in one place, in one accord. And probably it was... We don't why--how the building was, but there was such... If it was hot, there was such a unity of spirit, until they didn't even feel the heat, you know. Now, if we could just get that way, wouldn't it be wonderful? Yes, sir. It'd just be... We wouldn't notice the heat. 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min

L-17 Now, I pray that God will anoint every one of us. May He anoint me and my eyes to see in another dimension. And may He anoint my lips to speak just that which is pure and holy. May He anoint your ears to hear. May He anoint your heart to receive, is my prayer. And if you... Of course, now you know this is only through a Divine gift, not a gift to heal people, a gift to pray for people. And then a gift of prophetic utterance that's like a seer that sees a vision. Now, I'm trying to get your attention. See, I know it's hot and bad. Now, first I've got to have your attention right to me. And then that... It seems like it just builds a wall of faith around then (You see?), just around everywhere.

L-18 Usually in the big meetings, we never have anyone behind us up like that at all. And I have the platform, 'cause sometimes epileptic, when they come to the platform... You've seen it many times, they scream, and jump, and carry on, and demon possessed people and things. Then you have to be alone, 'cause someone could get hurt (See?), the way they carry on. 'Cause the devil is just as mean as he can be, you know. So he will do anything. So we have to--to watch and be careful. Now, we're praying and believing. Now, let me have the--the lady. I wish that everyone would just in your heart while your watching... Now, if I have to say "Bow your head," do it quickly. See? And--and close your eyes and pray if I ask you to. But when you're looking, you look with a--with a real steady faith. See?

L-19 There's something about it. People, they're, the way they're thinking, they... A spirit anoints them. If you... Now, this might seem a little strange to a person that doesn't believe this way. See? If they are unbelieving, it's the spirit of the devil anointing that person. It's--it's pulling right down, like that, with disbelief. You see? And I can feel that and tell it. Yes, sir. And it--it makes it hard. And then if a person is really believing, they're pulling in the Spirit of God. See? 'Cause it's the Word of God, we all know that. And if the devil can just put a question mark across there, he's got you. But when you erase that question mark and say, "That's every bit true and it's for me," then--then you're pulling from God. May the Lord bless us as we talk to the woman.

L-20 Now, I suppose that we're strangers, are we, lady? We are. All right. Now, I want you tonight, each one in the line, I don't believe there's anyone crippled or anything, standing very--to stand very long. Let's just take our time. Everyone just let your nerves down now, and let's just talk to the people, pray with them. And do not be excited or nervous, just closely. I'd just like to talk to you a little while, like Jesus talked to a woman one time. And now, we are strangers to each other. Then the only way that I would--that I would be able to know you, would have to be through Jesus Christ. Is that right? Well, now, of course, Satan has a way that he knows some things, but he doesn't know all things. If you watch these little old psychic readers and so forth, out on the street, it's just about one percent they're right on. They're just guessing at it. But God is perfect every time.

L-21 The devil has just got a... The devil has a pattern of everything God has real. The Babylon was made a pattern of heaven, all the natural. See? Just exactly. There is a real genuine Christian, filled with the Holy Ghost; there's a whole lot of hypocrites that just act like it. See, see? But that really... The hypocrite only declares the real person to stand out bright and shiny, doesn't it? See? All the false and bogus things only declare the real. If we picked up a bogus dollar and I looked at that dollar, and you say, "That's a bogus dollar, or counterfeit," that only tells me one thing, that there's a real one somewhere or that wouldn't be a counterfeit. As long as there's a counterfeit, there's a real one. Is that right? And long as you see a act of the devil, just remember, he's impersonating something of God, a real one somewhere. See? That's right. Just remember when you see that, that's what it is.

L-22 Now, if our Lord was here I... You perhaps are a sick person. I--I do not know. I can't tell you that. But if you was a sick person and our Lord was standing here... Now, He... What could He do for you? Nothing but just talk to you. He might lay His hand upon you. Or He would--He would be empowered with a vision. And He would be able to tell you what the Father had to say. And He could only say what the Father said. Is that right? That's all He could do. He said, "I can do nothing of Myself. Just what I see, that I speak. (See?) And My Words are true because the Father has sent Me." See? His Words are true. Because God vindicated that to be His Son.

L-23 Now, He... You believe Him, that He had died and rose again from the dead. And now, He promised the things 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min that He did, that we should do also. That's His Church, His believers. Well then, if He was standing here, He would tell you perhaps like--like Nathanael. He'd say... you... Whether you're a Christian or not, He'd tell you. And He'd tell you something that you done, maybe a year ago, maybe two years ago, maybe a week ago, or a hour ago. He'd tell you something like that, like He told Nathanael, said, "I saw you when you was under the fig tree." "Why," he said, "You're the Son of God." Well, then if He is the same today, He could do the same thing for you, could He? Do you believe He will? You do. You are suffering with a--a cancer. It's horribly... horrible condition. You've... It's in the breast. And you've... One of your breasts, it's been removed. And the cancer has crossed over into the other breast, and it's come down through the abdomen too, hasn't it...?... God bless you.

L-24 You are a Canadian, from Ontario. And you flew in here by plane... your husband... Is that true? Do you believe He... Sure you believe He's going to make you well, don't you? Come here and let's ask Him about it. Lord Jesus, poor little woman standing here, seriously ill, knowing no one can help her but Thee. She's broken-hearted. She wants an extension of life, Lord, to serve You. God, grant it tonight. Forgive us of our sins and trespasses. And let her live, Lord, to glorify Thee.

L-25 And Father, make her well. Way up in those big beautiful pines there, may her testimony stand out. If You'll heal her Lord, I'll promise You to go into that country there and preach the Gospel. This will be a sign. I ask it in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. What is your name? All right. Mrs. Parks, I want you to write to me in a few weeks from now, telling me what's taken place. I have made a vow to God. God bless you. Go and God's peace on you now. Everyone should believe right now. Everyone should never doubt no more. But the Lord Jesus Christ... Now, before the anointing gets too deep, way I'll know what was even told that woman, will be tomorrow when I pick up the tape.

L-26 Mr. Boze was testifying today about something that happened like that, wasn't it? Of a woman somewhere, it's all blank to me now. But it's something about a woman, a German woman. I seen a vision and couldn't stop or something, or seen a white man included, around a colored woman... And I couldn't make out what it was. And I was upset. Isn't that the way it was? And there's a Mohammedan, or a Hindu, or something on the platform. And I couldn't understand why I could see a--a Moslem worshipper at a platform, and me speaking somewhere at a Moslem, seeing this woman. And then recognizing I was in Chicago. I couldn't get myself straight whether I was in India speaking or in Chicago.

L-27 And then I seen a white man, looked kind of a light-looking, like a German, that was included in that. And I couldn't get it. And it shook me so, till I went ahead and prayed for the woman or something. And I looked down to another woman and told her something, and she was suffering with something. And the woman was, at that time, praying for her brother, is that right? [A man says, "That's right."--Ed.] Is that... ["Yeah!"] Brother was--was... ["Going into the Moslem religion in Germany."] going into the Moslem, in a religious... religion of Moslem, worshipped in Germany. And she was praying. And that man was standing from Germany, here before me. The Moslem was open and you could see. And I couldn't get it, 'cause being not used to being here in--in Chicago and seeing that... It kind of shook... Is that right, Brother Boze? ["That's right."] See? It's... You never know friends. But our Lord Jesus is marvelous, loving, full of compassion. Oh, my.

L-28 I wonder tonight if He was standing here in a body of flesh, where would He take the flesh to when He seen the wickedness of this world? See the end time approaching, what would Saint Paul do if he was standing in Chicago tonight? He'd probably... I don't know, they'd probably have him arrested, him seeing his words that he spoke under inspiration, how they would be having a form of godliness, denying the power thereof. And how that the things would be taking place, hard telling what he would do. All right, bring your... Oh, is this... How do you do, sir? Well, it's a very warm evening, isn't it? Yes, sir. Very warm. But our--our blessed Saviour, there's something so sweet about Him, that when we're near His Presence, we don't notice nothing but just Him. That's right.

L-29 Now, I suppose that you and I would be strangers. I probably don't know you. As far as I know, I never seen you in my life. You never met me before. Yes, sir. Well, then... But our Lord Jesus, down through the span of life, He knew 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min you when you were born, and before you was born. And He knew me the same way. And all down through life, He's fed us and taken care of us. And what we are tonight, we are by the grace of God. And that's why we're standing here tonight. And I'm standing here as your brother, to do anything in the world that I could to help you. And if I didn't think that God would answer my prayer for the sick people, under this commission of an Angel who met me, my dear brother, I would be home tonight with my family. But I'm--I'm here... And I have a little church down there, I'd be preaching in it, just have my service and go on and do my rest of my work, and be along with my babies and so forth through the week. But I believe that God has commissioned me to do these things. Therefore, I come to help you.

L-30 To help you what? To believe on the Lord Jesus. See? It's all I can do. What all that can be done for you, He's already done it. But now, the only thing... maybe just something to kind of boost your faith up to see it, you know. That's why you're here, isn't it, to try to receive something from God? That's right. Now, the... But He--He will grant it. No man ever come to Him empty and went away desiring to be filled, but what was full. And those who come full, they went away empty. See? But you've come emptying out your soul for your need. You are a sick person. And your--your trouble's in your neck. Isn't that right? Yes, sir. That was caused from an accident. I... Seem like I seen a big something drop. It was--it was a bale of hay that struck you, is that right? Yes, sir.

L-31 Yes, sir. It was... When you looked this a way, something struck. You're interested in somebody down here. It's that baby laying there. That's your son. Is that right? I see it before you again, laying in your arms. Do you believe He's here to help you, brother? Come here. O God, Author of Life, Giver of all good gifts, send Thy mercy upon this man who I ask for mercy for. Grant, Lord, the healing of him and his people also. And may Thy Spirit be upon him, Lord. May he be blessed and helped. May he be healed, Your glory be upon him, Father. I pray this blessing as I lay hands upon him in the Name of Jesus Christ. And I hold him close to my body, not that there'd be virtue in man, but we remember Elijah, who laid his body upon the dead baby and it came to life. And I pray that You heal this man, in Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God's peace be with you, brother. Go in peace. God heal you.

L-32 How do you do. My, you're... fine looking little lady. Yes. Now, do you believe the Lord Jesus Christ died to help you, honey? You do that? Now, you're just a little girl. See? And your little mind is innocent yet. But... And now, I--I--I can talk to you. See? And God will help you because you're just a child. See? But if Jesus was here tonight, standing here at the platform, now, He would... He'd come over... He loved little children. And He'd take and look at you, and He'd lay His hands upon you. And--and if there's anything wrong with you, why, you'd get well, wouldn't you? You'd get well. That's the innocence of a child. That childlike simplicity is what touches the heart of God. She knows right now that something's taking place. The little girl... The Spirit of the Lord is on the child now. And He would make you... He'd bless you and you'd get well. You believe that, don't you?

L-33 Now, do you believe that He has risen from the dead and He's here tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit? And that He lives in His Church? That may be a little deep for you, but do you believe that Jesus sent Brother Branham to--to do His work? You believe that? You do. You've got something, and it's--it's in... I can't... Yes. It's in your nose, up in here. You kinda have a--like a sneezing or a hay fever or something like that, isn't it a hay fever? I could see you keep holding your nose and your eyes turning red and things. I couldn't make out whether it was just you was subject to bad colds or what it was. But it's a hay fever. Now, honey, hay fever isn't a disease. Hay fever is a little skin that's in your nose. Some people has three layers of skin; others have two layers of skin, and some just has one layer. When them little burrs get in there, that's what causes it to burn and hurt like that, makes you sneeze and have headaches and everything. And...

L-34 Just a moment. You've had an accident too, haven't you? You fell out of a car. And it hurt you in your spine. Isn't that right? That's right. And you've got a father that's with you, that's brought you here. And he has a hernia. He was just been in a healing meeting of some sort. There's a man that's kind of tall, black hair. I believe it was Brother Freeman (Is that right?) that prayed for him. Is that true? 53-0830E, Come And See, Chicago Gospel Tabernacle, Chicago, IL, 58 min And your mother's sick. She was at the doctor and he said she had enlarging of the heart. Is that true? Do you believe God will make all of you well? Come here. My Lord, and my Father, I pray Thee to be merciful to this little girl, and bless her, Lord, in whom I bless in Thy Name. And to this innocent little child, Thou has said in Thy Word, "Whatever you bind on earth, I will bind it in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, I will loose it in heaven." We know that You're here to confirm Your Word. And You confirm not one of Your Words, but all Your Words. Therefore, as Your representative, I loose this child of this demon. In Jesus Christ's Name, may it go out of her.

L-35 Now, honey, you're all right. See? Now, you go home, and when you go to your daddy, you lay hands over on him, 'cause he hasn't gotten well yet. And when you get over home, take this same hand and lay it on mother, she'll get well too. God bless you. And you do that. Let us say, "Thanks be to the Lord Jesus Christ." [Congregation says, "Thanks be to the Lord Jesus Christ... "] Who gives us our victory tonight through Calvary, through His blessings. Oh, we say, "Praise be unto God." [Congregation responds--Ed.]

L-36 All right. Would you come? I just want to pray for your baby. Put your hand over on its little head, the water. Lord Jesus, my heart's just aching for that little one. I pray, Thee to be merciful and... The mother with the hand on the child, the very fruit of her womb, the core of her heart... O God, take away everything, and may the baby be healed. We ask this in Jesus' Name, for God's glory. Amen. All right. Be of a good courage, mother, now. I tell you what you do. When you go home tonight... The evil one left the baby. Now, it's a been prayed for and everything and you're a little bit... You're--you try to make yourself with an emotional faith. Don't do that. Just have a solid faith. You take that baby home tonight, and you see whether I've told you true. You put a string around its head and measure. Then cut that string off even.
