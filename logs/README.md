## Maintenance

Log files are automatically timestamped (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) and can be safely deleted after review. Old logs can be archived or removed to save space.

To clean up old logs:
```bash
# Remove logs older than 30 days
find logs/ -name "*.csv" -mtime +30 -delete
find logs/ -name "*.txt" -mtime +30 -delete
find logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```
