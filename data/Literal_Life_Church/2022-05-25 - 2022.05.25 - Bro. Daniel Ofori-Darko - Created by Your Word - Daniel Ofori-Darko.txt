TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we open our scripture to first king chapter 17 and then we will also read matthew chapter 17. first king chapter 17 we read verse 1. let's hear the word of god say elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gillette said unto aha as the lord god of israel leave it before whom i stand there shall not be due nor reign these years but according to my word matthew chapter 17. and 20th verse and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hands to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you the lord that is blessing to the reading of his word amen let's take our sea tonight the lord have laid something upon our hearts and uh in god will we will share together and the title of this short semon is creating by your word creating by your word hallelujah well the bible said where's our spirits things that come from our mouth they are spirits and that is the reason why as a christian anything that you say you must be very careful god bless you amen you know your words can be a blessing to someone and at the same time it can be a case so anything that proceeds out of your mouth you must check it it must be seasoned because by that same power that came from god establish every creation under this heaven um sometimes the scientists will tell us that the world has been in existence it is three million years some say billion billion years i don't know where they get that information from but thank god we have a prophet who told us the year of this earth but of course nobody can determine how long our god was in existence before one day he got up and he said let there be and there was he said let there be light and there was light all over the place and so he created all his creation by his word and after his creation the bible said that then he made man he created man also and he gave man the ability the power to also create because man was in the image of god of all the creations of god it was only man that god made him in his own image in his likeliness in fact the prophet tells you that that is why god could not cast adam because when he looked on adam he found out that if he kissed adam he has scares himself so he couldn't curse it he said adam for thy sake case is the ground hallelujah so ma was given that opportunity that ability you know we we know that even god gave adam the power and authority to name all the creations that he created all the trees all the animals in the forest the best in the world adam was the one that named all because god gave him that ability and power the bible said that at the cool of the night as we have gathered this evening god will descend into the garden and have fellowship with adam so the unfortunate happened over there and it broke the fellowship between god and man and god said because of what you have done you till the ground before you feed yourself it means from the beginning it was not so god provided for them but when sin came into the garden of eden to affect the relationship between man and god man lost that opportunity so his creative power was taken from him and man became so miserable you understand because adam didn't like the condition now let me ask you a question before i continue the whole world consider america to be the number one country is that do you know that and i think you also believe that that your country is the number one country there's money there's everything there is food everything and millions of people are always trying to enter into america you are aware of that because it's a nation that they think everything is okay now let me ask you a question will you be happy when they will tell you tomorrow morning get out from america and go and live in one of this poorest country will you be happy about that certainly not no no no no how can you leave america and forget about your pizza and the hamburgers and ice creams where would you get those things certainly you don't like it and that was the condition of adam because he lost those privileges he lost that power and he was because he became so miserable when he left the garden of eden but do you know that god was also miserable yes because god also lost his fellowship god lost his god god lost his follow you so he also became miserable god didn't like the situation amen look if the marriage could pose will be sincere the day you allow you allow the enemy to bring confusion between you how do you feel when your wife would turn her head this way and you you turn your head that way do you feel good yes sir you will not feel good because that is not what you're married for you married for fellowship so when anything break that fellowship whether the fault of the man or the woman there becomes some you know what should i use here uncertainty you lose your joy for one day or two days or three days no don't do that don't allow the devil to push you into those conditions if anything is risen at all bend it immediately and so god himself didn't like the situation so you know what he did he found another way to restore the fellowship back hallelujah i love that brother sister because that is where somebody like me i found myself god found another way to restore that fellowship you remember when you called people like enoch and noes and those all of them it was a way that he was looking to restore that fellowship and one day there was a man that was living with his father and his family and he had a voice from nowhere abram get out from among your people and go to a place that i will show you and i'll make a nation out of you my abraham didn't know the god that was talking to him but he only had a voice but by faith he followed the voice when god called abram he put in him faith you see it was a way that he was restoring the fellowship back so abraham god put in him faith because at that time the wife that he was living with was barren and everybody knew that no this this cannot be possible especially when god promised them a child but because of the faith that god restored or god put in abraham he maintain it no matter the condition the ways of abraham created the child for him in fact i like the way the prophet dramatized it he said when the promise came the first month abraham called his wife honey what is the situation what's the condition he said my lord it's the old story i don't i don't i don't see any any change and everyone say bless god there shall be a performance another time he will ask the same thing the same islam will come can you imagine abraham enter them into shops well that time i don't know whether walmart or uh maya or whatever it was and abraham will be buying baby food he will be buying baby dress hallelujah he will buy him sure that he will put their baby in the child and the people will look at abraham say this man are you serious are you buying it for your for your for your for your friends or what he said no my wife sarah is going to give me a child and i'm getting myself prepared what was that it was his weight it was his weight based on his faith in the word of god and one day he asked the same question it's why sarah what do you feel now he said my lord today i felt unusual within me i i find something moving i don't know what it is i've never experienced it before and i feel like i feel nausea you understand abraham said bless the lord this day this scripture is fulfilled his word created oh brother sister you know something and based on this faith that god put in abraham when his nephew lot okay joined himself to sodom and gomorrah and then five nations came together and attacked sodom and lord was taken captive we know the story already one man escaped and told abraham the unfortunate incident but abram didn't say that well the nephew proves stubborn and for that matter that is up to him abraham didn't do that but the bible said that abram immediately organized the 300 men in his house he said hey we are going to rescue my nephew lord now think about this how on earth can 318 men go and face five nations but by faith abraham marched against those five nations and the bible said that when they got there he divided the 318 men and they pursued these five nations they conquered them and they rescued lord in his household it was a great victory that day and this made god pull one of the bodies over there in heaven and jumped into it and descended upon this earth and he walked as a man by a name melchizedek in fact god couldn't sit on his throne but he came down to encourage abraham for the faith and love he demonstrated he said wow i have not come to see you only but i brought communion and wine i want to dine with you because you have overcome this world you have overcome every obstacle you have overcome troubles you have overcome temptation you have overcome the world and for that matter you deserve fellowship and mercy gave abraham communion he demonstrated the love he demonstrated a creative power hallelujah now let's read something in genesis genesis chapter 14 verse verse 18. and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine okay and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth he blessed abram oh hallelujah make history bless everyone because of what abraham did because the faith he demonstrated hallelujah and he promised him another time he met him again over somewhere and that was where he called him lord he don't pass come to my house let my wife prepare something for you before you continue your journey and it was that time the promise came for sarah and abram stood on his face and that thing was made manifest today people don't know who mercury was intellectuals uh their theologians they will discuss this and discuss this and discuss this but they lack revelation to see god he said that the bible say that he has no beginning of days he has no ending of days he has no father he has no mother and there is only one entity or deity that qualified for this and that is god the creator he is the only one that don't have beginning of days that don't have ending of days he doesn't have mother he doesn't have mother and so mechanic was god but when the prophet paul was explaining the characteristics of mercy we'll find out that mckisson of the old testament who had the creative power to promise to abraham was jesus christ who came in the new testament and when christ also came he demonstrated his creative power by his word so he said he that believeth in me the words that i do shall you also do by his word so if you use his word to create you can also use your word to create hallelujah because he said it was not ordinary and for that matter jesus christ was not also ordinary remember the day that he was working with his disciples and then they came to meet a certain blind man you see the disciples where those who ask jesus the question it's a master who did sin in this this man himself that he was born blind or the parents jesus says something and sometimes we look down over right he said neither this man or their parents saint but this man was born blind that the glory of god might be made manifest hallelujah you say beloved brothers and sisters let us understand that our situations and our conditions cannot be the same it varies but no matter what we go through let's give glory to god jesus said that the glory of god the man didn't have to be born blind but god knew why he was born blind just to make the glory of god manifest oh praise be the name of our god and after jesus said that he looked around and he saw that particularly we were created from the claim but the prophet said that man consists of 16 elements yes the atom the potash the potassium the petroleum and all that rather i cannot determine the type of clay god used in making my ear because if you look the texture of my ear is different from the texture of my tongue don't you see that my elbow is hot i don't know the type of clay god used to do it and for that matter i don't know the type of clay god used to make my eye but i believe that that day whereas over there he saw the clay he used innate in the eye of a man and his part on that plane and he met peter out of the clay and anointed the eye of the man he said go and wash and the man washed went and washed and he saw oh praise be the name of our god the pharisees should have rejoiced but then because of their false doctrine because of their hypocrisy they have told all the people nobody should believe on jesus rights but i can't go for the life of the blind man when they questioned him he said well he anointed my eye with mad and he told me to go and wash and i went and i watched and i did see and they asked him what do you make of that man he said he's a prophet and the bible said that they didn't believe that so they went and called the parents of this man they asked their parents are you sure this is your son whom you say you were born blind they said yes how then is he seeing now isn't that climb is it a crime that somebody should receive his or her healing now think about the mentality of the pharisees you see that is why i don't understand that today so many families are making sure that their children will not believe this message many families are making sure that their children will be remain in their denominations when their denomination cannot change their lives hallelujah brother sister we have been over there before we were just church members yes sir i know satan don't like what i'm saying but it's true we are just church madness we worship god's heart all right until god opened our eyes to know this message of the server and we started our christian journey so their parents were afraid if they said something in support of their son they would be excommunicated from the church so they asked them they said well this is our son we know he was born blind but as to how he can see now we don't know he is of age ask him they asked him the second time the man said you have already asked me i have told you i didn't believe it why do you ask me again do you also want to be his prophet or his servant they say no that man cannot be our our leader moses is our leader that man is a sinner oh the man laughed say what thing are you telling me you people have taught us already that god don't listen to sinners and this man have opened my eyes have you ever heard that somebody can open the eye of a blind man if this man is not of god he wouldn't have been able to do that they said no no he's a sinner he's a legitimate born and this is what the man said he said whether he's a sinner or not i don't want to know anything about it one time i knew i was blind once but now i can see that is all [Applause] i don't care how people will speak against this message i don't care how people throw this message away i don't care how people bend the message books one thing i know once i was a sinner but when i come face to face with the message of this hour i am okay sister sing a song right now thank god i am free we are free beloved brothers and sisters we are free from the dangers of this world because of the message of this hour amen he said once i was blind but now i can see the creative word of jesus christ is in the church today the creative power of god is in you today it only will be on line of duty anything that you say it must be made manifest that day on a mountain elijah did a miracle he said so long as i live ah there will not be any rain but according to my word this was the period that israel has entered into idolatry the worship of god was no longer there everyone was doing anything he or she could hold him and it was so much on elijah and he called other people so because of your unbelief because of your i don't watch it i am locking up the skies i am locking up the heavens it will never rain until i call for it it was his weight and when he said that god stomped it and it was filled three and a half years no reign by how are we going to grow our crops there was farming all over the land and now god have already told elijah to go to a place and he was there he was fed by ravens they brought food for him to you know make goodies of it until that food was no more coming and god said go to that widow that is the god that we are worshiping you can never understand him the only thing you can do is to believe him why will god send enlarger to a widow who don't have anything he said go there and she would take care of you now when elijah made the woman breaking sex the woman said master we don't even have anything there is only one muscle of what you call and i'm going to knead it and bake bread for myself and my son and when we eat it we'll die because there's nothing elijah said yes i know that but go and do for me first that is the god that we are worshiping you don't have to understand god you only have to believe god based on his word and when you believe on his word there must be a performance of anything that you declare and when the whole place was so much firming then elijah appeared he met obadiah it's all baday i said master we have been looking all over the place for you we don't found you he said well go and tell your master that today he will see me and when he finally met he said now call all the bad prophets let them meet me on mount carmel for today we must determine who is the god of israel he is bow is god let the people worship him if jehovah god is god let the people worship him and you see the prophet we're so much confident that they were going to challenge elijah so they met on the mountain you like i said well you are many and i'm alone just finish with your sacrifice and now attend to mine hallelujah and they took their sacrifice they dressed it on the altar and they started chanting they started calling on bar they call and call and call and call and call was not ready to respond and then elijah started mocking them he said oh where is bar is he not answering you shout and they shouted they shouted bad was nowhere to come he said oh i think bao has gone to little pizza he is going to a little caesars he's going to buy pizza so you know chance more chance more chant more they chanted enchanted enchanted bar couldn't answer and do you know that they ended up cutting themselves with knives bible said that their body was filled with blood because that was how sometimes they do sacrifice to those idols they killed human beings and they used the blood so when they called and called and baal was not answering they started cutting themselves that perhaps he may respond to them he did it and they did it and they did it it was the same story how do you think val will make that mistake if bob was a demon he recognized the presence of god on mount carmel that day so so long as elijah was standing over there on the mountain bar will never make that mistake hallelujah he knew that god was over there on the mountain how can he go there and beloved as you are filled with the holy spirit any place that you stand god is standing by you anything that you say according to the word of god god is standing by you see jesus said if we have faith like the mustard seed and we don't doubt what we say it must be because our god has not changed then after some time elijah said oh okay it's good if your god have not answered you it's my pain and then he mounted the altar with 12 stones which represent the 12 tribes of israel he killed the sacrifice he placed it upon the altar and he requested for 12 barrels of water to pour upon it to watch the sacrifice and he said lord i have done this according to your word when he said that fire came from heaven and all the people were shocked and they started shouting oh lord god our lord god god is god god is god jehovah god is god and the bad prophet was so much shaking they wanted to run away elijah said no way don't allow any of them to escape make sure you kill every one of them and that day they make sure they kill everyone of the bad prophets the day that the holy ghost came into us that day we kill every bald prophet in our lives we kill every unbelief in our hearts we kill anything that will discourage us from going forward as christians in our lives in our surroundings any environment that was full of unbelief we kill it from around us and that is the reason why by god's grace we are pressed on till today we kill jezebel by the way of elijah jezebel was killed by the word of elijah adam was killed and every unbelief surrounded him and that is what beloved beloved children of god we have to use the word of god from our mouth to create an atmosphere that will make us happy amen oh yes we all know how god used moses to bring the israelites from bondage and after all the miracles and you know pledge that god use the hand of moses to to rot in egypt finally pharaoh allowed them to leave and when they were leaving the bible said that their fellow pharaoh realized that no he had made a mistake for making the egyptian i'm sorry the israelites leave his country who was going to do their work for them so he organized his soldiers they chased israel but unfortunately israel were also stabbed before the red sea and so when they saw the egyptians suggest you know just pursuing them they became so alarmed and they started crying and shouting on moses why are there no graves in egypt that your brothers here to die on the wilderness moses this is what we told you in egypt that allowed us to be servants to the egyptians in fact they saw the dust over there by the chariots that they were pursuing them and they were melted oh my i thank god that we have those things for example why should we melt because an enemy is pursuing you have you forgotten the god that saved you from the hand of pharaoh have you forgotten that because of you god brought flocks from nowhere to torment the egyptians have you forgotten that because of you god turned water into blood and people of egypt could not drink have you forgotten that because of you god brought lookers to destroy the crops of the egyptians because of you have you forgotten that because of you there were three days darkness in egypt have people just forgotten that and more so for your sake god killed every firstborn have you forgotten that so soon have you forgotten that and the people standing at the red sea and they were crying until moses also cried oh god have mercy brother when the situation arrives don't cry well it depends upon your condition even if you cry cry because you have a god after your cry don't discourage yourself just pick the word because i know that people are emotional okay sometimes bro it's not because they pull up they have problems they cry sometimes even when they are happy they cry haven't you seen that before we've seen a lot of people crying when they are happy i've seen a man okay going to bless his marriage and when he saw his wife the father bringing the wife he started crying why so sometimes people cry when there's no trouble people cry when they be happy but i said no matter condition you found yourself after the crying you have to know that there is a god hallelujah they cried and cried and cried moses why but then look at what god did god immediately placed the pillar of fire between the israelites and the egyptians and they were not able to come and attack them do you know that every place that you are there is angels around you as a child of god do you know that the prophet said that any place that the messages the pillar of fire will be around and today where is the message the message is in your heart the message is from you that wherever you are the pillar of fire is around you let us believe that brothers and sisters don't let that just say it let us believe it and let it be part of us amen and this affected moses until moses himself started to cry oh god what can we do the egyptians are coming but then he was still encouraging the people he said wait and see the salvation of god for these egyptians that you see today you will never see them again in your life but when you are doing that you are still crying because the people of influence know so much but what did god tell him let's read the exodus exodus chapter 14. elder chapter 14 verse 10 let's see something quickly there and when pharaoh drew 9 the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians much after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt had thou taking us away to die in the wilderness wherefore her doubt dealt that's with us to carry us forth out of egypt verse 12. is it not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness verse 14 and moses said unto the people fear yeah not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace i want the believer to say amen here verse 15 and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ died unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward this is the challenge speak unto the children of israel that they'll go forward yes i know that they have come to a hindrance but speak to them let them go forward beloved brothers and sisters anything that you face in life speak to that situation and go forward don't slide back because of situations that arise in your life don't slide back because of certain you know unusual condition don't slide back and say that oh brother pastor is too much on me if anything is too much on you nothing is too much for god just turn on the word of god and tell yourself go forward god knew that the people has come to face they have come before the red sea and there was no way they were going to cross but god said tell them to go forward until you take a self beloved brother you don't know what god has prepared for you until you take a step no matter the situation i say you don't know what god has prepared for you praise the name of his of his praise the name of our god amen he said tell them to go forward but lift down up thy road and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on a dry ground through the midst of the sea amen tell them to go forward and i remember when moses said that who was going to take the first step there was just stunning at the break of this red sea and god said straightforward your road and you stretched it and the bible said that the water spotted into two and they walk on a dry ground have you thought of that beloved that the red sea was there since from creation and in fact you and i we cannot determine the volume of the mud under the water even when the rains come for just about five minutes look the way the ground becomes so muddy and these waters have been dead since creation you see god will never make a mistake he said don't walk on the dry ground no matter what and that is the god that we are serving and it is based upon how you look at on him the way and manner you consider him he will perform the same in your life the way you seek out to be that is the way he will appear to you hallelujah and immediately the grounds were dry israel walked on a dry ground to the red sea but can you imagine then the egyptians wanted to trace them in the same track and god did not prepare that trap for the egyptians he prepared it for the israelites oh hallelujah so the place that the israelites walked on a dry ground when the egyptians just got there then it turned into muddy place because god was not their god amen are you catching it beloved and they walk on it so that is the reason why they could not chase and catch the israelites because they found themselves in mud and their horses and their chariots god the bible said that god removed those wheels and they were stuck in their mouth and after the last person of israel crossed god turned the waters back and it swallowed all of them oh hallelujah brother sister don't you see what god has made you to be he has given that ability the power of creation from your word amen when jesus christ was passing on that street that day the bible said that there was a woman who had infirmities for 12 good years he has been to one hospital to another and no physician was able to to to cure her or yes but look at what this woman did nobody advised her but by a word he created a whole healing he said but if i can touch the hand of his garment i'll be made whole he created her own healing by a word oh praise be the name of our god and indeed she heard the help of the government of jesus and immediately her 12-year problem vanished jesus said wow peter virtue has gone out of me somebody has touched me and peter said master a lot of people have touched you when we're on your way and you are surrounded by a whole lot of people and people are touching you here and there so why do you make such a statement jesus said peter i know a lot of people have touched me but those touches were ordinary touches but this particular touch was a touch of faith because virtues have gone out of me healing victory has gone out of me and so while they were talking like that the woman owner jesus christ look at the woman he's a woman your word have created your own healing amen go in freedom amen so brother sister god has restored us to that power of creation the ability to do what is impossible he said with god all things are possible depending upon where you are standing amen jesus said if you no doubt you can speak to this mountain be thou removed in fact adam had the power to tell that tree hey i don't like where you are standing move and come and sunday and the prophet said that three will have obeyed eden speak to your life speak to your condition create the atmosphere that will bring joy and happiness into your life for god has nothing to be miserable he said you have given us peace hallelujah he said i left peace with you not the peace of the world amen we have the ability we have the power to let our words great for us you remember one time the prophet went with some brethren on hunting and they come and come and come they didn't get it they didn't get the game and it was almost dark so they plan you know i mean closing and getting up to go and have the arrest and this by that time the prophet have separated himself for some time and he said when he thought of going back he heard the voice speak the word he said you have that ability you have that power to create what do you want speak and look around whenever god spoke to him he knew that it was god so he knew that god has come right say lord what should i he say yes you love squirrel call them into existence the prophet was so much convinced that yes it was god that was dealing with him then all of a sudden he said well god i want one squirrel no i'm going to use some blood for example okay i want one squirrel to be on the head of brother gideon i want another spirit to be um brother josiah brad josiah's head i want another squirrel to be on my good sister sherry's head she he requested for three squirrels within no time the spirit was created upon the head of ragidian the prophet robbed his eye to see whether it was real and he found out that it was real he read to his gun and he aimed at the squirrel he shot it and he got it will not quite long he saw the second one on the head of the josiah he shot that one also he got it then he sold another one on the head of the raton and that was even closer than the previous ones he aimed at it he shot it and he missed it he shot it and he missed it he shot it and he switched it he said what this range is rather closer to me why am i missing it so much like that then all of a sudden the one guy requested us to share his head was there and he shot it and you got it oh hallelujah here's what created those creatures but then you ask yourself paul why isn't that the one that came on brother tom's head he missed it because when he was requesting when he was creating by his word he didn't ask that one should be on brother tom's head he said but i'll give your head but jose said a sister share his head oh hallelujah what you say that is what god will do for you amen so you let your word create the atmosphere for you to know that indeed as he spoke his word so is he he said i am not a man that i should lie god will never lie and today he is the same yesterday today and forever but our problem is that we normally or we don't we don't we don't recognize what god has made us to be sometimes believers we think that we are worshiping a historical god the prophet preaches a message he said lifting him out of history let god out from history and bring him into your life today and you'll be the same as he was with elijah he would be the same as he was with abraham he will be the same as what we gave it bring him out from history praise be the name of our god when you speak the word do you know what you have done you have put god into action when you speak you have put god into action hallelujah let your word create you have that ability brother sister to do that create an atmosphere that you can worship god in and be happy oh hallelujah rapper do i have still time i love her okay let me go through this quote and then we'll call it okay i am quoting from all things are possible we'll close very soon he said now just simple trying to hide behind some kind of a church doctrine instead of coming and and saying you ain't got no faith that is all satan never received the holy ghost and satan can never have the holy ghost because he cannot repent he don't have food to give to you okay it is god that has got the faith and just as you are filled with god you are filled with faith if you are the son of god you are like god oh you don't believe that amen or you didn't hear that the prophet said if you are the son of god or a daughter of god you are god amen yeah you have to say amen to declare that you believe it when you become silent here it means you don't believe it are you understanding what we are saying he just speak the word and he creates itself his wish the creative power how the world came into existence he made it out of things which were not he just said let there be and here it is he believed his word so if god believed his word for it to create you must also believe the word for it to create for you amen he said cut every obstacle from human beings that me that might be connected like in the garden of eden cut every obstacle anything that caused the downfall of adam and the woman in the garden he said cut everything out the prophet said i was going to choke it but i am going to say it man is omnipotent he says you don't believe it because the paradox but he is you are according to the prophet he said a man that is fully surrounded to god is omnipotent did not he said in matthew 11 22 that what sort of things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you've said hallelujah you can have what you have said you can have what your word will say according to the word of god now let me give a testimony before we close there is a brother that we visited and his son gave us a tremendous testimony he is elected electrician electrical engineer and he was looking for a shop and then he chanced to see an auction or is it functional auction auction of a very huge building and the price on it was eight hundred thousand dollars he didn't have that money but he called the auctioneer and said that i am interested in that building but i have only hundred thousand he said well we are waiting for others to you know call in and then we'll see what we can do about that he waited and waited and waited because he said when he saw that building he said lord i want this building in your name for my business and that was what he said some weeks passed and they called you hey brother you offered that hundred thousand for the building he said yes is it come and take it eight hundred thousand now he only gave hundred thousand for that building and you know what before they even did uh the ocean they have already pulled off all the roofing the old roofing and you have used 53 000 to put new roofing on it so it means the brother pays something about 40 something thousand for that whole building isn't wonderful his word is what created that victory for him and brother sister you are not different from that let your word create the atmosphere for you amen he said don't doubt don't doubt for the same amen what happens when two or many potentials meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he has promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and bring things to pass thing that is not it make them as though they are because two or many potents have met their distance oh it's wonderful too omnipotent you and god has met when i say you and god it is you because the word of god is in you and god you become one he said the whole world will deny me but i will not deny myself so if you don't deny god's word it means god is in you then you become an omnipotent and when you meet something has to happen that day at the beautiful gate when peter and john met the the was expecting something from them and they said silver and gold have we men but such as we have we are given to you hallelujah such as we have we are given to you but look on us peter didn't say look on me or look on the thumb he said look on us in the mind and the heart of peter he knew that there were not only two but there were three because jesus christ was standing by again he said in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise and the man arose the crippled man arose and he was jumping and was happy and was singing the word created amen what happened on a mountain in the west on a sunset mountain when we were told that rocks were cut in promiscuity what happened when the prophet said that there were some beds tiny tiny bears and they came to him in the form of a pyramid and it tends to be doves another time then they tend to be like something like jack titus no knowing they were seven angels and they pick him up to the skies within a short time they reveal everything and he said that this is the revelation of the services go and project and when they were living there formed a cloud in the skies and when the pictures were taken supernaturally we saw the face of jesus christ what happened it was because two or many potent meant on the mountain today it is not on the sunset mountain today is not on sabrina today it is you and jesus christ wherever you are something has to happen oh brother i wish i have time amen okay let me go my last quote okay now you say brother brother i need healing yes sir the promise is yours but if you get if you ever get it you aren't going to get it easy i'm going to tell you that you are going to have to take it away from satan satan captured your health you've got a right to go to satan and say give it back hand my hearing over to me i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heaven and earth and i am his heir give it back don't let satan capture your healing don't let satan put you into any frustrated condition amen he said claim it the prophet said you are not going to get it easy but claim it how do you claim it it's just by your word sometimes we go to the hospital doctors will diagnose us and you'll find now that there are some problems in our body they will find out that there are some diseases in our body it is true that diseases are in our body but don't accept it don't accept it every whatever we call it a laboratory test will prove that yes you have this you have that you have this you love that yes i say it is true but don't accept it because sickness does not belong to you sickness is of the devil the prophet said that every sickness there is a demon behind it it's only signs that are giving them names and don't accept it i was at the hospital some time back and uh they tested me and the doctor said say you have this problem in you i don't want to mention that name because if i mention that demon that demon be happy i look at the i look at the doctor a young doctor i say look at a small mouth that is telling me that i have that disease in me i said that in my mind don't use that your small mouth to tell me that and then i left them and i went to my regular hospital i normally go and there was this doctor also who have attended to me before they did the same test they said who said i think it is true i said i don't accept it they say who said you have to accept this that will start the medication i said boy i don't accept it your machines can tell you that i have that but i said i will not accept it until today i will not accept it oh hallelujah i want my words to create healing for me and by that brother i am strong like a gorilla amen it's by your word now listen it says tell the devil you took my child you got him mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy and mixed up with the wrong girl i am claiming them that is right i claim my children i claim my brother i claim my sister yes satan give them to me sometimes you are here in the church your parents don't want to serve the lord claim them from the devil that is what the prophet said he said you can claim them sometimes you the parent you are here in the church worshiping god but your children don't want to surrender claim them you have the power to tell the devil give my children to me hallelujah give my children to me have you forgotten about the testimony of sister haiti when one time the prophet went to the house and the prophet said that sister had tell me everything that you want right now if the lord don't give it to you don't believe me as his servant and the prophet was going up and down going up and down waiting to hear what sister had to demand and then sister hurt he became so confused he didn't know what to ask he said if you ask for one million dollars it will come on your life because the woman was poor but look what happened there was a sister of society in the church all the years sister heidi didn't think about her but the two sons who were making mercury of what was going on they didn't have jesus in their life they were making mercury when the prophet was going up and down and his statement to their mother and they were laughing laughing laughing laughing then sister hearty eyes caught on them he said say i asked for salvation for my two sons and the prophet said have it immediately these children rushed and nailed and they were crying calling jesus christ to come to their lives a word a word created salvation for her own sons he said claim them from the hands of the devil you have that power in you brother sister tonight you have that power what about this admirer when the son took bad company and have drunk have snuff cocaine and all those ditty elements and all his organs destroyed and he fell into you know the doctor said no there is no hope for your son take him home and he is going to die and this one brought the son home and the son was groaning in pain but the woman didn't sleep he prayed a prayer by her weight yes he said god send me your elijah to my home send me the elijah and when he played that player around 2 30 am he left the sun in the room and came out and stood on her fence from that time such a prayer you may think it was ordinary but it was full of god's word immediately the prophet was flying over memphis and can we imagine that the prayer of this woman made the airplane to develop fault and the plane has to land by force for technical reasons but it wasn't anything it was the prayer of that woman the prophet said that then he got up from because they gave them to you know relax because they were going to see their fault and he said he had some letters to post so he wanted to go to the person to go and post then immediately a voice came around he said don't go that way go this way and then he started going he started going he got he went continue to go the voice said go go ahead he said god what do you want me to come and do here he said go i said go he continued then all of a sudden he came to me this woman the woman put her hand on the fence like this right from 2 30 a.m to about seven o'clock in the morning the moment you saw the prophet he said person are you the elijah and the prophet said how did you get to know that i'm a person because in those days they said the black women the black people they call a preacher's person how do you get to know that i'm a person she said do you know the woman in the bible whose son died and the prophet elijah came and brought him back to life he said yes i know that he said i am that woman what then the prophet remove his heart he said what about that he said i have a son only son and he took bad company and found himself in drugs now he is dying the doctors have rejected him that there is no hope and i prayed to the lord and i asked god to bring me the elijah to my home and the prophet said wow then the prophet understood why they claimed how to land he said where is the boy where is your son he say in the room and the prophet entered into the room in fact he said the woman was a poor woman but there was one inscription he saw that he was very happy about that say god bless our home and this boy was groaning because he was dying and the prophet said well woman let's pray together and you all laid your hands upon this young man and they prayed and he said the power of the prayer of the woman the prophet even was silent that's right now then he said well lord if this is the reason why you brought me he then your word is fulfilled immediately the boy jumped he said mama i can see light mama i can see light mama i can see life you know why because where he got to was darkness he got into the region of the lost and there there's no light there so but god brought him back to the light and this boy was healed in fact when he embraced the mother then the prophet went away straight to the airport when he got to the airport the plane was ready waiting for him alone and he boarded it and then they flew can we imagine that the faith of a woman he spoke the word and because of her faith god made the aeroplane to develop forth immediately oh brother sister we are not different from that woman your faith can create something for you and that's what god said we should do amen he said and as long as you i'm closing okay i'm sorry about that and as long as you are in the line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do matching by the orders of god you've got a right to say to the mountain removed and they have to obey you hallelujah god keep his word if you said to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that that what you said will come to pass you can have that what you have said amen amen amen and amen yes sir you and god have met there got to be something your word can create for you your word can solve your problem your word can give you happiness your word can give you healing your work can make you what you want to be in life that is why that day joshua looked to them son he said son stop over there don't move because i want to destroy my enemies you can stop every movement that is going on contrary to your life and god will make sure that it's established praise be the name of our god he's the same god that was abraham he's the same god that work with john he's the same god that worked with david he's the same god that worked with william marion brahm and he's the same god that we are working with as he was so he is today he has never changed brothers and sisters let us make sure that we come to on duty and when we are on duty anything that we say god will make sure it is made manifest god bless all of you praise him one more time give him praise praise the lord
