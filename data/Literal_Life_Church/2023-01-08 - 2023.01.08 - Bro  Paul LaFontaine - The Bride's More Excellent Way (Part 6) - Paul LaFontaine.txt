========================================

Corinthians 13 if you'd like to read with me one verse there and then back in First Corinthians 12 we certainly appreciate all the Christmas gifts and cards that you sent I love to get pictures of the family put them all up on the house there I'd love to keep them throughout the year and thank you for your lovely words and kind kind comments and we love you all too very much and appreciate that we can serve the Lord together as a family it's just I love you very much appreciate and my most exciting thing is to take the Lord's supper together this afternoon we certainly would enjoy that praise the Lord First Corinthians 13 and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth and I'll just read where this now Divine love divine Capstone love rejoiceth not in iniquity it never rejoices in iniquity but it does Rejoice over something it rejoices it gets happy in the truth and when truth prevails and when honesty is there and the truth comes out that's where we Rejoice not in lies not in iniquity not when someone Falls not when someone makes a mistake there's no rejoicing and divine love of that but when someone finds the truth and we know that the truth shall set you free and so that is divine love and action that we rejoice in truth and and that truth prevails just add a scripture in First Corinthians 12 the chapter before verse 25 and verse 26 as Paul is talking about uh the body and how it works together and the Natural Body and then he types it with the spiritual body of Christ verse 25 and verse 26 that there be no Schism no division that there be no division in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it so there can't be any jealousy if someone suffers we don't gloat over that we're not happy over that they got what they deserved no we suffer with them so there's a point to be made here and if I don't get to it again today there's a point to be made there if somebody else in the body is suffering then you're suffering that's how much we're part of one another if someone gets honored then we're all honored and we rejoice in that that's how much we're tied together now you can act separate next I'm a I'm an island to myself all these other things but that's not what the word teaches the word teaches by the Holy Ghost I'm tied to a body of Christ somebody suffers I'm suffering that's why I pray for them that's why I lift them up that's why I encourage them because if they're suffering I'm suffering if they're going through something I want I don't want to come down with them but I want to lift them up and I want to feel the pain of their suffering because they're a part of me I'm a part of them amen I'll say it like my dad used to say it you didn't put me in the body of Christ so you can't take me out you didn't put the person sitting next to you in the body of Christ so you can't take them out so he used to say it this way as much as some of you might don't not want me or someone else you're stuck with me you stuck with me amen so learn to love one another praise the Lord and so I'll just read that again he says there be that there be no division oh God hastened the day when there would be no division in the body of Christ but that the men members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it and one member be honored and all the members Rejoice with it father we pray you'll bless your word and may you drop it in our hearts by Revelation the meaning of these things so deeply that love would manifest in our lives Divine Love Not Human love not natural love not a surface love but the Divine love that flows from Calvary we commit the service to you in these precious souls in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated last time we talked about the the more excellent way and this is the more excellent way part six hopefully we'll finish this up next Sunday but last time we talked about the more excellent way that Paul talked about it is the way of divine love and the last thing we dropped off of which I don't feel like we had plenty of time to cover the subject but the last time we learned that God's Divine love in US does not keep record of wrongs so I want you to remember that because that's probably one of the key things of all these things that we've been preaching on that that that that love does not keep records of wrongs love does not hold a grudge for years but love forgives and the reason why this is an important one to re to to refresh your memory on is because this is the one I think we struggle with the most many times and that is we are bound when we hold on to a grudge of someone else we remain bound that person may be go on but we're not released we're not we're not bounced so forgiven this releases us and can release the other person as well so it's important that we don't keep records of wrongs and to clean the Slate of others just as God does with us to clean the slate and to forgive and to give others a fresh chance to release the wrongs through the true forgiveness of God to release wrongs through the truth you can't fully release them unless you come through the channel and the Forgiveness of God but when you bring your life through the Forgiveness of God then it releases the wrongs that others have done to you it's to wash the past history away to delete the past to click delete on our past steps with people it is very important to study this again and go back and look at it and it needs more than just a study I'll tell you this needs a real Supernatural manifestation in all of our lives some of us become professionals at keeping the score fresh in our minds of the wrongs that people have done to us some of us have it locked and lodged and it's it's blocked there in our memories and we're not even making any efforts to Let It Go but it gets lodged there I'm holding that 16 years ago they said that to me and they put me down and they criticized me and we hold it right there my friend I'm encouraging you if you stay there the other person isn't bound you're bound you're the one that's Bound in the the locked up of your mind of what that is and the Bible tells us love does not keep records of wrongs love pushes delete can you say Amen how do I do it brother Paul just ask God to help you just delete it just push delete erase the debts of others can you say Amen how can we not do that when God has done it for us when he pushes delete of our sins it's gone forever in the sea of God's forgetfulness how is it that we can't do that for others you can't move on in Victory if you continue to hold on to these things and keep them in your mind and keep a record and keep these the history of people there was one married man that said to his friend you know every time my wife and I get into a conflict she gets historical and his friend said his friend said you don't mean historical you mean she gets hysterical when you have an argument she gets hysterical he said no I mean historical what do you mean by that is that when we get in this argument she rehearses anything I've ever done in the whole history of our marriage so I'm right she gets historical now I know none of you know anybody like that or your wife or husband you don't know anybody like that but listen for me I'm going to be honest if you're not I'm going to be honest is that this is a real thing is that when people get angry about something the the whole history is right there and they bring it all out and I don't know why we do but it's like a weapon it's to get back at somebody I don't know anything else to say right now but I'm mad and all of a sudden I've got a whole list of what you've done then I'm taking you from after your salvation all the way through bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and then the person listening is like he's being shot bang bang bang bang she gets historical not hysterical now you might have some wipes that actually get hysterical at the same time and I don't know why they use the example for a wife but let's not get on the wives okay the wives had an incredible memory for things that's happened in the history but and I don't know psychological what all that is but listen now I'm not speaking on that I'm saying every one of us have a certain level of keeping the history of somebody come on people say amen and this is what the Bible teaches us the gifts because we don't have a right to hold the history of somebody if they've asked forgiveness or if they haven't we don't know we pray for them that God will bring them to that but we are bound when we hold a grudge towards somebody so I'm bringing that back up again because this part of divine love we really need to ask God to help us to project this it will set us free it'll set others free as well because we are giving them a chance and we're erasing their history so that we're giving them a chance for a fresh start I wanted to mention that again now today in the part of divine love that's spoken of in verse verse six we want to study this a little bit because this this meaning today of divine love really gets to the heart of what makes us really glad or what pleases us there are things that make us happy and please us and and things that make us rejoice but as Christians there are other things that should make us rejoice and one thing in Divine love in the Christian walk is that we should never have something that triggers happiness in us when someone else Falls we should never have something in this that triggers a joy in us that swells up when someone else Falls or someone gets payback for what they've done wrong this should not be a part of us this is not part of the love of God and it shouldn't be a part of us can you say Amen this gets to the heart of what we really should be rejoicing over and this is what triggers us to rejoice and it says that it never rejoices in iniquity but it rejoices in the truth the source of our happiness joy and rejoicing and pleasing and and and gladness should be truth prevails truth comes to somebody truth is preached truth is lived can you say amen that's why when when we have this world of such uh that's in such a mess and sin is glorified and sexual sin is glorified and living together as couples is glorified it's all okay and people play around with one another and sexually give themselves another before marriage I like to at a wedding emphasize to those there to in the whole world to take something that stayed pure until marriage and kept it that way under God's holiness I like to blast it to the entire wedding ceremony and everybody listening because it's not too often that truth and Holiness get praised in this world everything else gets praised look at these NFL players I'm allowed to say this look at them look at them yesterday all in the games they're all bowing the pictures they're all Bowing in prayer and they're kneeling my son Solomon brought this up Dad did you notice they're all praying for this NFL player that's in the hospital had a heart attack or something last weekend and they're all kneeling for all the games they canceled the game last week after they're all on the my goodness it looked like a big prayer meeting in the stadium and a lot of these guys are just thugs they are they live evil lives they love lives of sexual debauchery it's terrible how they live they're greedy you know 150 million is not enough money for them you know all their lives are full of this and yet there's kneeling down and praying my son Solomon brought it up it was just six or seven years ago when the whole world was criticizing Tim Tebow because he was kneeling at games persecuting for what he did but now it's all it's okay for all these hoodlums if they kneel and pray oh that's so nice all that's so good and so we praise them for all their sinful life and now we praise them for kneeling in prayer but you see now this world's messed up because it always praises the sin all along but it doesn't praise a holy life every day it doesn't praise when truth prevails can you say Amen it doesn't acknowledge the truth it doesn't rejoice in truth but Christians should rejoice when truth prevails not when lies Prevail can you say Amen but when truth comes to a person and changes their life when truth sets somebody free I tell you we ought to be shouting and rejoicing and happy when somebody gets free we shouldn't be happy when someone gets revenge or someone sin is glorified in this world what makes God happy is what we should what makes God happy should make us happy what Grieves God should grieve us talk about a stopping at a gas station in Timbuktu somewhere and you go into the bathroom and it hasn't been taken care of in months and that dirty filthy bathroom and it was used as an example by the prophet one time that that's how sin smells and looks to God and that's the way we should live is that how it smells and looks to God and Grieves them and it comes just as a nasty smell that's how sin should be in this world that's how it should affect us whatever affects God should affect us When sin prevails it should grieve us can you say Amen when everything Turns Upside Down In This World which it has it should grieve whatever makes God grieve should make us grieve but whatever makes God happy should make us happy can you say amen and divine love rejoices in the truth not in the iniquity can you say math what Grieves God should grieve us what makes God happy should make us happy as well and when and I'll get to it at the end of the service but there are seeing things in the scripture that we know makes God happy and makes the Angels happy and whatever that is that's what we want to be rejoicing over as well Divine love does not rejoice and get happy when others fall in sin Divine love whether it's you falling in sin or making a mistake or whether it's other people iniquity is not anything to get happy about if God Grieves that Rebellion then we should grieve at Rebellion whether it's in us or someone else if God is Not gloating that someone got what they deserved do you think God gloats when he brings forth a punishment or a judgment on someone that he's promised to bring and they kept running over God and rebelling towards the word and God had to bring forth his promise that you'll reap what you sow but do you think God gloats in the fact they got what they deserve I can tell you God doesn't gloat in it I can tell you God's not happy with it I can tell you God's not saying they got what they deserved I told them I warned them they give God is not thinking that God is not willing that any should perish God's not willing that anyone should turn against his word in rebellion and he doesn't gloat or rejoice when someone does it his heart is grieved and so God is not gloating that someone get what they deserve and if he doesn't then we should not if God carries through on his judgment and by how many would raise your hands to God is the god of judgment we don't hear that in the church World very much today because we've eliminated all the scriptures about but God being a god of judgment and following through with judgment but we have too many accounts in the Bible that once he gives the warning then he does bring judgment he brought it on Sodom and Gomorrah for their sin he's brought it before and he will do it again he can't let our nation that's resisted God and this world he can't let him get by or he wouldn't be a just God judgment is coming and so so if we look at God now many people misinterpret him and they only say it's only the Grace part God is God full of grace but he's also a god of judgment he's just can you say amen and if he broke his promise and let everybody get by with it when they won't take his path for forgiveness they choose their own way then there has to be a judgment to follow that he warns them and then he God's warning and then judgment that's his pattern warning and then judgment I say to you today if you're listening online if God's warning you over and over again for the life that you're living if God's sinning you are you ought to respond to that warning because that's God's grace to correct you and to warn you you keep turning it down then the Bible shows you come under the judgments of God but I want to say about the judgments of God he carries through on his judgment but the reason that God carries through is not because he wants to it's because he must be just and he must follow his promises if he lets you get by and made a promise I'll warn you then judgment's coming and he didn't follow through we wouldn't have confidence that God keeps his word how can we trust any of this as God don't keep his word but when he says something he follows through so when he says something about judgment he will follow through but he doesn't want to do that he is not willing or gloating that any should perish how many know the scripture in Hebrews God used to be first Peter God is not willing that any should perish and I'll tell you friends that that's in the heart of God why is it in our hearts that I'm not willing to see anybody perish I don't have anything to see anybody I don't care how bad they've been I don't care if they've been in prison I don't care if they've killed someone in our hearts we are not willing to see anybody perish because of that but we look and pray for redemption in a life can you say Amen how many believe in Redemption this morning I believe in Redemption of God I believe the lowest sinner can come to God and be changed [Applause] that's how powerful Redemption is it doesn't matter how low you've gotten God can redeem you God can save you but you got to accept his way you got to give your life completely over to him so now as we get into this a little bit the Greek word for um the Greek word her for rejoicing is uh the Greek word is Cairo Caro c-h-a-i-r-o which means to Rejoice to be glad to be delighted or pleased so when it says we don't rejoice in iniquity we rejoice in truth it means to be glad to be delighted to be pleased and think about when you are delighted about something what you think about when you're delighted about something you're pleased with something you're glad about something if you're glad about something you may talk about it you probably dwell on it you'll bring it up maybe you even make a a big deal about it all the time you magnify it because you're rejoicing over it you're pleased with it you're glad about it you rejoiced in it it makes you glad so that's the the Greek word to this type of rejoicing so you should now put that do you are you glad and delighted over iniquity in someone's life or iniquity in your life are you pleased with that does that make you pleased does it make you delighted hopefully not but we magnified so look at your life today look at your life today and say is there something in me that is pleased and rejoices as in glad and is delighted when iniquity prevails when someone iniquity is unrighteousness iniquities iniquities knowing to do good and not doing it and when that happens in your friend's life or a person's life or a Brother's life sometimes what is it in your heart what's your first feeling about it think about the things that make you happy I don't know what that is things that make you glad and if that's a part of it we need to hit an altar in a heart say Lord something's wrong with me if I'm gloating and happy and get a little happy feeling when somebody gets paid back for their Rebellion that little thing that says they deserved it when we leave that after God why don't we we leave that up to God so many people lately I've been saying why are you so Bound by what that other person is doing you're being bound and they don't even know it it's between them and God what they did you pray every day for them and that's all you can do but quit living under the bonds of worrying about what they're going to do release it in the name of the Lord release what they've done to you it's time to go on it's a new year brother Bob it's the new year can you say Amen Wednesday night we're on New Year's Revelations New Year's it's a new time why don't we leave the past in the past why don't we leave it in the graveyard of all the crazy stuff why don't we set our hearts on this new year 2023 is going to be a wonderful year with the Lord and I'm going to be free of losing sleep of all of this stuff I'm going to free be free of the bitterness I have towards people I'm going to let it go it's between them and God somebody said praise the Lord amen so now we look at our life as a Christian and he's we have to see what triggers the most Delight is it when somebody gets payback is it when a lie is told because that if you have the opposite of Truth we have a lie when lies are told then do we Rejoice over that and that lie travels around lies travel around faster than truth you know we're working to get the truth out all over the world we're sending Bibles everywhere but I can guarantee you lives of the scripture of travel much faster than the truth and in a local church gossip travels faster than the truth people buy into gossip as soon as they hear it they don't know if it's full truth yeah but but but you join in with it I'm gonna talk about gossip just a minute because you see now all those lies travel around and they hurt a person because lies are going around about a person and so you hear it come back and it comes back to you and you have a little feeling well they deserve that so I'm joining do you enjoy a conversation of juicy gossip that puts others down but you don't know whether it's truth or not I say hit an altar do you give yourself permission around your family talk down anybody in the congregation what's interesting they don't hardly even know that person in their own congregation but once they hear a little something they say something they join in with it gives a little little sarcastic joke and a little laugh about it and you don't even know that person you don't even know if it's the truth of what you're saying or hearing I say shame on us shame on us for joining in Gossip what's interesting is you don't like anybody to do that to you do you you don't like lies told about you as a matter of fact I'm going to go ahead and say it is that people what almost demand an apology if somebody gossips and something said about them they need to apologize to me but what's interesting is you don't apologize for anything you gossip you talk you put down other people and not once if you went and made it right so we don't like people talking about us and we get defensive about it we get up but we give ourselves permission to talk about anybody whether we know it's the full truth or not that's when we're kind of gloating over gossip and what we don't know and we're kind of happy and we kind of get a rush out of that atmosphere talking the pastor's hitting on Gossip because the devil of Gossip is always around you know he's not left with too much to work with but he always likes to get in conversations when it's gossip you form a friendship with somebody oh this is a real good friendship a lot of times it's not a friendship it's a gossip session and you like them because they give you freedom to talk about anybody that's not a relationship of a brother and sister in Christ that's not a relationship with a sister and sister of Christ that's a gossip session that's demon-possessed to tear down the unity of the body of Christ Amen brother Paul I give you instruction to start the new year and stop talking about people when you don't know the truth about it and if you know the truth even then be careful what you say to people pray for that person and if you got something to say if God's LED you to say something to correct them there's one person you need to go talk to and that's that brother or sister no other phone call no other person not Mom not dad not sisters not brothers did you know this about this oh if that feels good to you you're wrong brother and sister you're wrong I hear back things come back sometimes even other churches and I said how did they know about that how did they hear about that down there well somebody had to say something and I'm here to say in the name of the Lord we need to stop putting down other churches we need to stop putting down other people we need to stop gossiping and giving yourself permission to talk about anyone anywhere in this message [Applause] you want to grow to adoption you'll never get there by doing that and the reason is families do it is because it becomes normal to them they've been doing it for years it's their normal but I'm here to tell you it's not normal shame on you hit an altar and repent for the things that you've said do you enjoy a conversation with juicy gossip you don't know if it's the truth or not you just talk you know it's it doesn't feel good to have others talk about you but you can easily talk about others and get a good laugh about it other people's failures other people's stupid decisions you've never made a stupid decision in your life before you do realize that people make the subject always somebody else because it takes the attention off of their own problems can I get an amen it feels so much better to what do they call that deflect I think it's the psychological thing oh don't mention psychology they deflect the conversation to someone else and they blame someone else and they blame their parents and they blame this one because it feels good because it takes the subject off of their own problems so they deflected I think what the psychologist calls it and that's what human beings do it feels better it feels better that when you take the attention off your real problems and you're wrong to get with someone and talk them down someone in the church or somewhere else or talk your husband down or talk your wife down I say shame on you you're wrong to do that that's an atmosphere that you like you feel comfortable with but pray that God makes you uncomfortable with it we should not have a glad feeling in the iniquity of others we should grieve and pray and shut our mouths but we should rejoice and Delight when truth gets out when truth gives Deliverance to somebody when truth sets free that's when we should say praise be to God I rejoice in that with them you know it's not often in the times we live in that truth prevails in our court system but when it does it's cause for celebration how many has ever seen the court and there's a final verdict on something and that family has realized that the truth has gotten out there's no greater rejoicing when the truth comes to that court and Truth prevailed in that justice system that's good but today we don't get to the truth and I don't know all the reasons for that except for man as man has become professional liars and lies sound like the truth and and people are getting off with things in our society sin gets by sin gets off the hook violence is getting off the hook read your newspaper I mean newspaper nobody reads a newspaper read your phone read the read the news sin people that are violent are getting off within days they're being released with no bail so world we live in truth is not prevailing we don't have a prophet number one if we had a prophet sitting Among Us in that discernment thing discernment you couldn't hide anything from being in front of that Prophet all the Bible prophets discernments was there and you could try to lie all you want to and you were exposed I want to remind you that the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and can discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart while I'm preaching if the holy spirit is here it can discern the secrets of your heart it can bring truth that's why we preach truth because truth will bring the truth out of our lives amen but the court system violence is getting off way off the hook way too much and we have some courts that are rejoicing not because of truth but because Revenge took place I want to get back at them as long as I can get back to them I don't care about the truth I'm rejoicing over vengeance what a shame that's not Justice and when we get to the truth of what happened that's what should be true rejoicing does not happen in our day very much because this is the age of a lying Spirit people learn to lie can you say Amen I'd like you to read about the last days in second Timothy Chapter 3 The Lord brought this scripture up to me some of you are familiar some of you're not second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 says this know also that in the last days perilous testing times shall come does anybody know that we're in the last days so this is going to Peg the last days this snow also in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers or of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy this is the characteristics of the last days without next natural affection a natural normal god-given affection for a man to a woman and a woman to man is being Twisted into some unnatural affection truce Breakers that means breaking promises false accusers incontinent no self-control false accusers in other words I'm going to accuse that person of something it's a false accusation but I enjoy doing it and I'm doing it fears despisers of those that are good and here's our text today despisers of those that are good despisers of those who are trying to live a righteous life Tim Tebow bows in prayer he gets criticism and persecution around the world now everybody else can do it and it's fine why because it's despisers of those that are righteous and good they're trying to live a holy life you will get persecuted in this world that's the world that's the spirit of the last days but it's not to be the spirit in the body of Jesus Christ can I get an amen it's not the spirit dominating your life amen despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness been denying the power thereof from such turn away it's amazing that all those characteristics we would put that's worldly people that's unbelievers no it says that they have a form of godliness religious people some in the ranks of the message and living out all of these characteristics were not to be dominated by the spirit of the world the spirit of the last days but were to be functioning and motivated by Capstone Divine love what an amazing scripture some Christian writers say it this way love is never glad when others go wrong to rejoice in the truth means to be glad about Behavior in accordance with the truth of God's word if someone you don't like falls into sin you don't gloat about it you grieve about it because God is grieved over sin if they repent then you rejoice I just want to say that my celebration comes as a person when there's dialogue there's openness there's repentance there's making things right there's there's can I have lunch with you can I have breakfast with you I need to get things out in the table and I need to make things right and the other person makes right there there's nothing that makes my heart swell more as a pastor to hear that people that hold grudges for years met with that person and cleared the air and they leave this is the truth this is what was done wrong it's under the blood I forgive you we're going on to serve the Lord It's the air the Slate has been cleared I'll tell you I just I get a rush of joy it's my personal testimony when I do it I feel better people are always thinking oh he must be perfect he never has to go to apologize to people Pastors make mistakes pastors mess up pastors don't always make the right decisions it's surprised for me to say that to you all I heard a pastor I didn't hear him but two or three weeks ago a pastor got up and fully apologized to the congregation because he acted out of place in something in a service heard of a pastor a couple months ago and somebody told me to go listen to the video took the whole service and said I was wrong in that completely wrong I apologize for it to this congregation I say praise the Lord that man's grown in the Lord he's got a lot of people within the message that can't ever apologize they know it all listen to Wednesday night there are know-it-alls Uzziah knew it all and he think he thinks he knew more than the priest the preacher and he come in with his rebellion and said I'll do this I'll take care of this and the reason leprosy struck his life is because he couldn't take correction I didn't expect to be this direct today but I'm looking at you and I'm looking at me and I'm looking at you online and I'm saying I love you enough to tell you the truth take your bitterness take your hatred take your gossip take all these things and bring them under the blood of Jesus Christ because so you can get a fresh start this year of 2023. amen rejoice writer Christian writer continues to say if is someone you don't like falls into sin you don't glow you you grieve because God Grieves if they repent Rejoice there's a fine balance to love though I like how he says this there's a fine balance to love although love is kind and overlooks the faults of others it does not compromise the truth or take a soft view of sin that's what our church world has done they've interpreted love is softening up on preaching against sin preaching against hell how many sermons you hear about hell and the Bible says there's a hell if your preacher never preaches on hell you better get another church if your preacher never preaches about modesty in the Bible you better get another Pastor because all of that is in the Bible we must preach against sin can you say Amen because if we love the people we preach against sin as well but today it's interpreted it's a soft view of sin and it's a compromise to the truth to allow another person to go on and sin whether it is a known sin or blind spot is not to seek his best it is not love love will sensitively confront and correct precisely because it cares deeply and knows that sin destroys love rejoices with truth we must speak the truth in love love gets excited when it hears those spiritual victories can you say Amen love gets excited when it hears of spiritual victories love encourages by expressing Joy over little evidences of growth a lot of times in our parenting we know about how to say all the wrong things no no no no no no no no no but you got to give praise when they're doing something right most of us parents fail in that I'll put myself in that there's not enough praise forgiven for the little growth and the little maturity and the little steps towards the Lord it ought to be celebrated my son and daughter got baptized it should be celebrated can you say Amen you look at him at eight nine years old 10 years old they might even not have a full birth of Christ yet but they're taking a step towards God in every little step should be celebrated by the body of Christ it's not that they are successful in this world and they beat all the competition at school well you should praise them for that but the greatest praise you should get is when they make steps towards the Lord even if it's baby steps celebrate it and if your brother's sitting next to you you may feel a certain thing about it but if he's growing in the Lord even if it's a baby step you ought to celebrate and rejoice with him somebody say praise the Lord amen and so I love how he says that he says we are expressing Joy over little evidences of growth John the Apostle of Love wrote I have no Greater Joy than this to hear of my children walking in truth for a parrot what's your greatest joy in life your business making money your IRA oh it's growing my IRA is growing who cares we're going to leave all this to the Catholic Church anyway [Music] oh I shouldn't have said that the Bible prophesies that somebody's gonna take over and whoever owns all the gold of this world we're going to have to sell out to something someday I just dropped that in that was free but you see now I have no Greater Joy my parents what's your greatest joy I have no Greater Joy than to see my children walk in truth and I'm going to keep praying until that happens now keep praying until that happens job job in the Bible in job 37 help me out here put it up on the screen uh and you can get it in your Bibles there I'd still like you to bring your Bibles even though we're in modern times and the Bible is on everything else I'd like you to bring your Bible to church and job had something interesting here that he said is very humble with all that he went through and losing everything he could have become bitter but he actually became better instead of bitter he says something here I picked up on last night job 37 29. look what he says here job 37 29 . that can't be right I'm a senior moment here you have to edit all this out of the video 13 15. what a shame I wanted to read that and I cannot find it I'm going to summarize and then I'm going to bring you that scripture next Sunday is that fair I don't know where it's at I can I can I can promise you though it's in the Bible I read it last night he was saying things about acting a certain way towards his servants when they came up and they'd ask him a question and he'd give them a bad attitude back because they were his servants and he was the he was in charge and then he he talked about when my enemy does something wrong and he pays for it he said then I glowed over it and then I'm happy about that exactly what First Corinthians 13 is saying and he goes into it and he's saying I'm under the judgments of God too and in in one of the verses he says it this way he said they were made in the womb just like me so now we enter into life and we have status and we have positions and we have and so we start to think and we're better and someone fails and we rejoice in it and I don't have any time for the servants and we do us and he says I Was Made In the Womb just like them I have no right to act better or put them down I can fall just like them I'm not an elite just because I say I am I'm not Elite preaching about Pride here today I'm not Elite because I'm in the group of the message of the hour I'm only Royal by his blood that's in Me by spirit but that gives me no Bragging Rights to treat others lesser than me no matter what revelation we have even in the ranks of the message no matter what Revelation that we have we're and we're the bride and we're we're the super race we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride if you're the bride why don't you act like your husband throat if you're the bride of Christ then why is it their characteristics because to me the bride of Christ by Spirit Bears the characteristics of her husband Christ can you say man how many conventions were the bride we're the bride we're the bride and so many attributes are not acting like the bride at all I say start acting like our husband if we claim to be his bride can I get an amen I think the bride has the same Spirit of her husband where does this arrogance and pride come from I'm anointed many mighty things are happening under the anointing under me well your husband was the most anointed person on the face of the Earth and with the full anointing on him he sat down and precious words came from his mouth another Minister brought it up and said that day and the prophet says he said the most anointed person in the world Jesus Christ what did he do Under the full anointing he sat down he opened the book and precious words preceded us it didn't say he shouted and danced all over the room he didn't say he screamed he was the most I'm quoting the prophet now the most anointed sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth see brother Paul you again shouting absolutely not uh you can shout all you want to you can rejoice and get excited but just make sure it's because of the stimulation of what God's showing you it's not orchestrated it's not legislated and it's not pushed and that's not the evidence that we have something real that's not the evidence that there's a true anointing there if for the bride then let's act like our husband Jesus Christ can I get an amen I'm annoyed you well we should see what the anointing really is now I'm going to go to these quotes real quickly and then we're going to wrap it up because I believe that I've covered the subject I believe you're catching it so the next one says love does not rejoice with injustices or iniquities love to rejoices with when truth prevails so if you've caught that thought today this is that that channel of divine love that finds the the the the reason why it rejoices First Corinthians 13 6 this is our text and then I read to you in first Corinthians 12 there that there be so no be no division in the body of Christ but that the members should have the same care of one another and when the whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it in other words we are so tied together that's why we can rejoice when someone is honored and we can rejoice when someone comes to truth in a victory and a Deliverance in their life and that's why we can grieve when someone else is grieving give them a positive word give them a text of encouragement Interlink with the body of Christ New Year's resolution for some of you it's not going to hurt you to get closer to the body that you're a part of it's not going to hurt you to bring your young people and get them integrated and plugged in with the body of Christ not going to hurt you to invite somebody over why are you why are you so afraid of that why are some of you so afraid of it might say something that makes me nervous no that's your uncle that says things like that that's a family member I love you and I'm going to encourage you some of you are too detached from this body and you're missing out you're missing out on what God's providing with friendships developed here get back to what you're saying all right next next quote I do not know why I said that subject to speak on the return of the Prodigal Son brother Bobby speaking in Cleveland here speaking in Cleveland Ohio I do not know why I said the subject he was praying he says he didn't have a subject and he says I'm going to preach on the prodigal son and then he's after his prayer he says I don't know why I said that subject to speak on the return of the prodigal son I haven't read this scripture for the past eight years that I know of haven't read this piece of scripture and to go speak on it I guess it's been eight or ten years ago since I spoke on it and I think when I did I approached it from the way of the Pharisees the song that was left at home that felt bad towards his brother and I believe that's the way the story goes and he was very provoked because the father had received the Lost straying son back and his attitude of approach to it and I spoke to the church about how they should not feel that way that when a sinner comes to the altar the whole church ought to gather right around them don't you believe that he took a sermon not on the prodigal son because everybody preaches on the prodigal son he took a sermon on the brother of The Prodigal Son which is a type of a religious person and he gets mad because of all this party and celebration that his dad welcomes this kid back and he stayed faithful he's been going to church he's been paying his tithes he stayed faithful to his father he didn't take his inheritance and go spend it he said you're you're he comes to his dad all Angry he's angry his dad's saying my son come before he even gets back he's embracing him kill the fatted calf get the singers in let's have a celebration my son has come back home to me that was before he even had a repentance from his son he's just on his way back and he's already celebrating come on everybody everybody awake and and the Brothers From a Distance looking and he hears music the Bible says he hears the music and he says what's what's the deal with all the music what's the deal with all what's the party about Well your dad's son has come home and he's set a celebration and killed the fatigue he goes over to his dad's dad what's going on here I've been here the whole time he took his you know remember what he's done he took the entire heritance he's went out and spent it on prostitutes and every other thing it's gone he's on his way back and you're giving him the fatty calf and all the finest robes and I don't even have he said this in the Bible you haven't even give me a kid goat a baby goat that's how sarcastic is I don't even get a kid I haven't I've worked my fingers to the Bone and I don't even get a a baby goat and you're killing the fatted calf for him what's going on he says I don't know what to tell you son but I'm just happy my son has come back to me again [Applause] don't try to overthink it don't try to be critical when somebody comes back don't say well I never went that far out and they didn't no no no no no no listen we're all capable of running the farthest from God with the flesh that's in us but if somebody does they can't if they're a son and daughter of God they can't ever go far enough that God cannot reach them and bring them back and when they come back they don't need a code of ethics to live by they don't need to go through a process of whether we forgive them or not the Bible says we're still to rejoice when someone repents so are you the brother or are you the Prodigal Son religious Pharisees in the message that have all these things and feelings praise the Lord I'm ending this by saying and I'm ending at 12 25 I'm a good boy I'm ending this by saying there's a couple of other places that I want to remind you of of what we as Christians are Rejoice over and I'm going to end this by our vision because remember a vision my vision for the year if you want to join in is to get our minds off of every other thing that's going on in the ranks of our belief and get our minds on a soul a soul is worth ten thousand worlds a New Soul a repentance so a coming back Soul our hearts and prayers and our efforts should be on it take some cards with you I know that sounds mechanical take some invitation cards with you today take them and hand them out say well I live clear three hours away hand them out anyway and if that person calls you and says I think I want to go get them in the car and bring them in the presence of the Lord bring them but for us we're around here we get the word out the ads I'm on the broadcast today praise the Lord let's be praying would you all just raise your hand I'll pray that God calls the elected seed he can use anything to do it Lord use the music that's on there use the little 20-minute sermon on there God get a hold of your people let's get our Focus off of one another let's get our Focus off of all your past trouble let's get our Focus off The Grudges that we hold it's good trying to switch our focus and sometimes it's hard to switch people's Focus because they're so Bound by the past I'm trying to switch your focus come along with me come along with me you'll be happier I'll be happier there's something Joy raises up when a sinner repents Joy raises up with the little changes in a person's life Joy raise it up when somebody's here we haven't seen they may look like the world and act like the world and got all the habits of the world but we're all gonna already gonna talk to the deacons and policing insecurity don't worry about that we'll take care of it but we want them to come in the presence of the Lord and be transformed and changed praise the Lord so there's two places that we're to Rejoice over number one when he gave power to the disciples before Pentecost before the Holy Ghost to go out and heal the sick and cast out Devils they sent out sent them out two by two Jesus didn't go with them he gave them power to cast out devils and when they came back after that whole journey they were rejoicing and shouting and having a good time and they said this is the reason for the rejoicing even the devils are subject to us how many believe the devils are subject to a son and daughter of God I mean at least when you lay your hands on that child it's not you but it's through the name of Jesus that child can be healed my daughter Ryan sent me a quote this week I loved it so much because it it articulates what I've been feeling lately the power of the local church or what God can do in the local church not globally but what he can do in local church there's some influences that are undermining the local church and what God can do in them even within our ranks oh I can sit home and if this preacher is not on I can watch this one and I can watch that one and then and meanwhile the local church doesn't have any value to you I believe the local church God can do something and that quote she sent me says he said you're waiting around for a big evangelist to pray for you or a big healing line and he says your pastor has the same Authority as that of visiting evangelist to lay hands on you and you can be healed he said in not only the pastor a member of the body of Christ in your church has just as much Authority as the visiting evangelists [Applause] let's not undermine what God can do among us we're going to have meetings we're going to have special meetings in March third weekend in March we have brother Craig Brewer here for three nights and so we're looking forward to it we're praying God to do something but we don't have to wait for special meetings we don't have to wait for a special evangelist right now God can use his authority in the church I love that so much he says you you don't have to wait for him your pastor can lay hands on you the body of Christ can lay hands on you but here's here's what he said when they come back and we Rejoice the devils are subject to us Glory and Jesus corrected him he said don't Rejoice because devils are subject to you but the reason you should Rejoice is because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] and just saying friends he's correct and he's bringing correction to the whole Pentecostal world that the source of your rejoicing shouldn't be that devils are running and you have authority it should be that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life because if it's written there that's why you have authority and don't just see how rejoicing over shouting and Devil's subject and my such don't you see how that can get off track we're we're rejoicing and worshiping for the wrong reason but if you come into this service and God hasn't done any Miracles yet God hasn't changed anything in your life yet you're what you're looking for to change you can start worshiping already without nothing happening yet because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life you can shout around this room on the first Psalm Gideon sings and then he's going to look at you and say wow this is great you don't have to wait for God to do something you can shout my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life he's called me and loved me before the foundation of the world that's the reason I Rejoice that's the reason I can Shout I'm one of his [Applause] so that's the first season I'm giving you reasons to Rejoice now the second one is that when he said Jesus said it he says the angels and all of Heaven rejoice when one sinner repenteth source of joy what makes Heaven Rejoice what makes shouting in heaven what makes Heaven Come unglued not when someone Falls but it's one sinner it's not just one sinner comes back but he repents when we see true repentance and fruits of it coming that's the reason for our shouting and rejoice can you say man one all of Heaven that's when the Angels rejoice heaven doesn't Strike Up the Band for any old occasion at hand it's got to be a special thing just to hear those Angels Sing there's only one thing that we're sure about that can make those angels jump and Shout it's when a sinner makes the Lord his choice that's when the Angels rejoice did you like that amen all right I'll sing it again what's the course again I forgot the chords already there's only one thing that we're sure about that can make those angels jump and Shout it's when a sinner makes the Lord his choice that's when the Angels Rejoice that's the purpose that's the reason that's when they get excited in the other dimension they're here this morning somebody repented in this service some people have blocked me off some people have locked up he's preaching at me my brother's sister that's not true I love you but the other dimension this morning is rejoicing because so many in their heart has come closer to the Lord maybe even repented you don't always have to go to an altar to repent say Lord I'm wrong and I see this through this service this morning I'm wrong you're right forgive me and if it's true repentance you know what in the other dimension they're shouting they're rejoicing they're happy when a sinner comes back when a sinner comes we are to be saying praise be to God because two things we Rejoice because they're getting saved second of all we're closer to a rapture glory be to God has given us the victory oh God has given us the victory by his word and by the Light by the power of His might you know God has given us the victory all Victory yes victory oh God has given us the victory yes Victory is yes a victory God has given us the victory oh God has given us his peace of mind oh God has given us his Peace of Mind by his word and by the Light by the power of his mind oh God has given us the Peace of Mind peace of mind oh peace of mind the heart has given us peace of mind yeah [Music] oh God has given us overwhelming Joy God has given up overwhelming Joy by the word I Saw the Light by the power of his mind oh God has given us overwhelming trouble oh you're overwhelming Joy God has given us overwhelming Joy overwhelming Joy well enjoy God has given overwhelming Joy amen let's give a hand clap to the Lord God bless you Saints praise the Lord amen if you don't have the joys of the Lord you're being cheated out of what Calvary purchased for you freedom to forgive the freedom to let things go the freedom to rejoice in the truth and not rejoice in iniquity the freedom and divine love it's available to the body of Jesus Christ and actually if you have the Holy Ghost that's already within you just need to let it project God's calling your heart you ought to say thank you Lord for your calling you're not calling everybody thank you for your calling me to a deeper walk with you it's time to make to take the next step towards the Lord in your life right now it's time for all of you to take the next step go home pray about it talk to your wife talk to your husband talk to your children it's time for our family to take the next step towards the Lord what can we do let's get into the word I encourage all of you get into the word get your Bible read the word of God sometimes you only read the word here just maybe little for the day but it doesn't it's about the amount of time get into the word get in the message the presence of the Lord is there can you say Amen stay in the word as often as you can we're going to need it more and more as the day is approaching and we're getting more pressures in this world we're going to need to know what's in the word of God because he gave us our instructions he gave us how to live and his presence is in his word I believe that with all my heart amen praise the Lord you love him today you love one another love never gives up love
