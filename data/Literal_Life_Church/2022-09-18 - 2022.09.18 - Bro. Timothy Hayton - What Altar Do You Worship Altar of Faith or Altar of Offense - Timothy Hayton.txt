TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sometimes i've found that i have a need and i don't know i have a need and so if he comes by your door and knocks on it and touches you and don't get mad at him this morning because that's his love to you can you say amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus we stand here this morning lord just in this atmosphere and kind of trembling inside hardly knowing lord where we should start because we're standing before your wife this morning lord but more importantly we're standing in your presence we understand father that a man could stand here and read the scripture and he could maybe read some quotes or read a story but it's going to take you this morning lord as you walked with the two and you came down to the evening time lord and and you were going to pass them on by and they compelled you to come in and you came in and when you broke the bread they knew who you were may you break the bread to us this morning father may we know who you are may we know you and the power of your resurrection lord whatever need will be here this morning i asked heavenly father that you would just come and meet it now we ask it in the precious name of our lord savior jesus christ and the body would say amen if you have your bibles this morning i'm not much for small talk i'll greet you here in a minute we'll just go ahead and read the scriptures in ephesians chapter 6 and verse 12 and the reason i'm not much for small talk it's not about me it's about him and i want to make sure i don't care if you remember me or you remember my name but i do care that you remember the jesus that i bring you this morning that's the most important thing ephesians chapter 6 and verse 2 12 is a very familiar portion of scripture says for we wrestle not against what flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places over in first kings chapter 18 and verse 21 it reads it like this this is when elijah was dealing with the people and the prophets of bell says an elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions so he's asking them a question he said if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word sometimes god asks you a question ask me a question and he won't say nothing because he's wanting to see what our response to the word will be one more scripture and we'll let you be seated over in the book of james chapter one and verse eight we said it's a familiar scripture but the bible should be a familiar book to us can you say amen james chapter 1 and verse 8 says it like this that a double minded man is unstable in what some of his ways part of his ways in all of his ways let's pray one more time heavenly father lord we come to you now we have done our part we have reached the point where we can go no farther that it's going to take you to come and take control and we're asking that you would minister lord you would forgive each of us of any sin and trespass iniquity thought and failure and we ask the lord that we're not looking in to ourselves this morning lord but each of us are looking unto you who is the author and the finisher of our faith now come lord and minister in jesus name we ask you amen god bless you may be seated i will say before we get started it's certainly good to be with you many of you don't know i know brother kenny and sister tina i met them a while back and i know sister rebecca we go our families go way back when we were children and and i've heard the lafontaine family sing through the years but just recently became acquainted i heard something that your pastor had preached somebody told me something he's preached so i went online and listened to it and uh when i did i'm like wow we're in the same channel so i reached out to him and we talked for about an hour and a half and we found that we had a lot in common and that was the lord jesus and and we're interested i told the church a while back i said i'm interested in preaching myself out of a job i'm not interested in building a kingdom i'm not interested in another woman god gave me a woman that i'm very happy with very pleased with four children by i'm not interested in money and i certainly will never be the most popular preacher because i believe that it's gun barrel straight i believe it's a bare fisted gospel i i believe in a practical gospel that's the kind of preach around that it must affect your life if it's theology and it's out here somewhere and it never comes down to your door it's probably not the right gospel so i'm kind of just that kind of preacher i don't know how to do anything other than just take the word and just let the holy spirit take a hold of it but it certainly is a privilege and an honor to be with another part of the bride we've been ministering since about 2003 been pastoring since 2017 took a little church where a pastor had been there for about 30 plus years and and so we're still wet behind the ears as the old saying goes we're still green we're still learning so i glean from your pastor anything that i can i believe each church is sovereign but i believe the same god that's there in north carolina is here in ohio this morning we live and reside in hickory north carolina pastor of the church close there and so we're we're just trying to do our best for the kingdom of god to uh like i said i want to preach myself out of job i want to preach the word in a way that it changes the people and we can take a body change and we can leave this earth can you say amen to that that's what i'm after if not what are we doing i'm tired of walking around the mountain you know what i'm saying we walked around the mountain long enough we walked around the mountain of doctoring over and over and over and over but something's got to come there's got to be a generation that raises up that takes a body change and i want to be that part of it i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still young in spirit and i'm still young enough to take it are you with me and i won't i want to see our loved ones so god bless you this morning we'll move straight into this little thought it's um kind of a practical thought but um it's been those things that has changed my life and this is a thought that's very near and dear to my heart that the lord has given me and i preached it to the church but before i preached it of the church it had to be preached to me at home and it changed my life so i pray that there would be something that you could glean from this morning that would be of a benefit to you can you say amen to that because if you didn't come brother brown said we come to the church and we'll leave the doors better or we'll leave worse and i've left worse so many times i'm not interested in doing that anymore i want to leave a much better christian than what i came can you say amen to that but i want to take a thought this morning and just in my way i be you and you be me and we'll let god be god is that okay i want to ask you a question sort of this thought would be a question to you at what altar do you worship at what altar are you worshiping this morning and i want to give it a subtitle of either an altar of faith or an altar of offense an altar of faith we're either worshiping at one of two altars this morning at an altar of faith or an altar of offense and many times when we're offended we don't even know that we're worshiping at the altar of offense but what we're doing we're trying to have faith and seems like nothing's happening where's god god's not moving so i want you to keep that in mind as we move through this as i ask you the question this morning what altar do you worship i want to just lay a background for just a minute here if we think about this an altar is a place of sacrifice it's where you come and you give an offering to god it's a place of worship we in other words it's something given the first place we really find in genesis would be genesis chapter 4 where there was an altar that was brought and there were two sacrifices one was by revelation by the heart and the other one was from intellect and god accepted one but he would not accept the other one are you with me this morning one is acceptable and one is not matthew 6 and 21 just a few scriptures here this morning it says for where your treasure is there will your heart also be so really the altar this morning is not we call this an altar we give an altar call but the altar lays within the heart of every human being this morning that's where it is jeremiah 17 9-10 says it like this that the heart is a deceitful thing the heart is a deceitful thing above all things not just some things it says desperately wicked and who can know it now watch this this is what the lord did with me when i looked at this little thought he said i the lord not your pastor this morning not a preacher not an evangelist not a teacher not a prophet but i the lord search the heart or search the altar brother branham made a statement one time he said the sickest body i know is the bride of jesus christ it's a paraphrase quote okay but when i looked at this i began to understand sometimes sickness is in the body and you don't know that you're sick until a symptom arises and when the symptom arises then you go for the checkup watch something is off and so it's the same way with the spiritual side of things he said i the lord searched the heart or the altar he says i try the reigns to even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doing so the our actions are connected to what our heart it's connected to our altar luke chapter 6 and verse 45 says that a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil treasure out of the evil evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for the abundant for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so when you and i speak this morning where are we speaking from we're not speaking from our lips we're actually issuing it forth from our heart you know sometimes we come to church and we don't feel like praising god we've had a bad day we've had a bad week are you with me we expect the song leader and we expect the preacher to pump us up but i told the church a while back i said there's only two times that you should feel like praising the lord that's when you feel like it and when you don't feel like it because his feelings has got nothing to do when he went to the cross for you and me he didn't feel like killing me he didn't feel like delivering me because he knew every time i would turn my back on him but he did it anyway he did it anyhow in other words it had nothing to do with feeling so when we comes to praising god we praise him because he is worthy can you say amen to them matthew 15 and verse 8 says these people draw nigh draw nigh unto me with their mouth and on earth me with their lips but watch this their heart is far from me so in other words there's something up on the altar of the heart that is unacceptable but he said in vain they do worship me and this is what the lord showed me said you can have an offense in your heart towards somebody or something and you're trying to come and worship me and you are worshipping me in vain because there is no faith because the bible says that he that believeth that he must have what must have faith in other words to know without a shadow of a doubt that he is produces a true worship can you say amen to them now at this thought we're looking at what altar do you worship i want to lay a background this is where the holy spirit really pulled this from was out of first kings chapter 18 but i want to background something here just a minute before we before we look forward first kings chapter 16. i'm just going to pull some nuggets out of this this evening and or this morning rather and we'll see how the holy spirit will lead us we find where ahab had married jezebel and the bible says he went into worshipping baals so in other words the type of the antichrist he had he had raised up an altar and he had built a house for another god in samaria the bible says and another thing is that he allowed jericho to be rebuilt and the bible says that he did more to provoke god than all the kings before him he set up an altar and i want you to understand when an altar is set there's going to be worship when he sets up this altar there was the prophets of baal that came with this altar in other words there was another spirit that was ministering to israel now other than the spirit of god another god was being worshipped and i thought how the anything that connects disconnects god from his wife anything i said anything it could be your job it could be your career it could be your husband you realize some people worship their husbands some people worship their wives i've seen some people worship their children and grandchildren anything that's set up in our hearts this morning disconnects us and puts us at an altar of offense and not an altar of faith this morning anything that we put before god is an altar offense first kings 17 i thought about this and this is what the holy spirit really showed me and it really just kind of jumped out to me when an altar of offense is set up there are two conditions that come with this drought and it dries up the rain when they set up the altar of of bell in their israel that they they had no food the cattle didn't have any food the people didn't have any food because there was no rain in other words when i want to set something up on the altar of my heart that's not connected back to the holy spirit he dries himself up from me he just pulls himself back away from him and he don't like that because the bible said that he's a jealous god in other words he wants your praise he wants your affection he wants your thoughts he wants everything that you are because he gave everything for you in other words for you and i to receive everything we must give everything in other words we can withhold nothing from him everything has got to be surrendered but here in first kings we find when this altar of offense was set up there was two conditions there was a drought and the rain had dried up now as we go through this altar of offense i want to lay this out in two ways the altar of offense that i want to look at this morning is a doctrinal altar of offense and a personal altar of offense a doctrinal offer of offer a altar of offense and a personal altar of offense so hold that as we go through this now first king 17 we find that it opens with a widow woman or if i could say it this with a church with no head ship what had caused the headship there was an altar of offense that broke the headship between israel and god are you with me now and so what happened it was affected but with no rain or very little food and we find this woman was down to the last little bit of meal what because there was an offense set up you know i found in my own life when i have a fences that lays in there that i want to know where god is that he's just like he's so far from me i can't find him you know and i can lis you can listen to all the messages you want you can read all the scriptures you want but if your heart's not right with god if there's another if there's something else upon the altar it'll never work it'll never work why because you wasn't created to have an altar of offense you were created for an altar of faith to believe all things now i want you to think about this after three years of dry time of no no rain or we could say no spirit or very little food or or spiritual word the conditions had gotten so bad that that this woman she said you know what i don't even know if there is a god are you with me we can sit in message churches for 50 years and don't know that there's a god why because we've got something else laying upon the altar of our heart because jesus can't stay there he takes a step back he says when you get rid of it when you're ready to surrender then i'll come back and take over but until then see he cannot fight your battles as long as you're fighting them when you want vengeance god says then you have your own vengeance but it's not going to work out the way you wanted it to why because vengeance is mine saith the lord if we operate anywhere outside of the word of god it will not work it never has work and won't work today but i thought about this that this altar of offense to another deity it has no power and it's amazing how far things can decline in such a short period of time you know the devil when he walks in oh i can handle this i'm okay and it just goes farther and farther and farther and we start getting sticky with her husband we start getting sticky with her wife we start getting sticky with the children and eventually we dry up right why because we're worshiping at the altar of offense not the altar of faith this morning is this okay this morning i'm just god told me to come here and deliver this i don't know why but we're going to do it this morning but i want to give you my own testimony of this here in just a minute but i thought about this when when the altar of offense comes we become stubborn we'll still come to church we'll still raise our head we'll still sing we'll still look right we'll still dress right but because we're worshiping at the wrong altar we get nothing from god i found something interesting here how that when things go wrong we blame everybody but ourselves ahab called elijah he said are you the man that's causing that struggle with israel ahab was the one that did it ahab was the one that married the wrong woman it brought the prophets of baal set up the altar of offense brought in another ministry and he said elijah you know that's how it is now come on when the pastor comes and has to bring a correction to you we get upset and says well you're the one that's got a problem i'm happy where i'm at that's not your pastor that's doing that now that's the gift that's in his life that god says i love that one enough i didn't shed my blood and die so that they could go their own way but i love them enough to put a gift in a man's life that'll come down and says you're wrong and you need to get away from that thing why because that's the love of god to you see you were designed to express him upon this earth are you with me you were designed to express jesus christ upon this earth you in other words a reflection of your husband and anything that's not a reflection of him is an altar of offense this morning but he says are you the one that troubleth israel are you the one that's causing me this problem are you the one that's causing all the israel are thou the man that troubleth israel in other words we have no rain we have no food but i like this god says hey i love you enough to let's have a showdown this morning let's call for a showdown so he calls israel to assembly with this altar of offense and he said how long will you halt between two opinions you know sometimes we can be halted between doing the right thing and the wrong thing because we're wanting our own way with it don't we haven't surrendered to the holy spirit the way we ought so therefore well lord i'm going to pray this way because this is how i want it to come out not father if it be thy will are you with me watch he's looking for a complete surrender this morning so he can give you all the power well this is my life this is what i know to be the truth this only way i know to put it is from my own experience how long will you haunt between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word in other words how long will you worship between two altars this morning now i want you to think about this when he brings them together he lays two elements upon this altar one is wood and what is sacrifice humanity and the cross and this is what i have found that when we look at things from the aspect of a of a doctrinal offense that we can have all the right quotes we can have all the right scripture verses but one is from revelation and the other one is from intellectualism and they're really close together i said they're really close together but one can produce and one cannot see the devil does not care this morning that you believe that god sent you a prophet he don't care about that he don't care that we said in message churches are you with me but what he does care about is when you come in contact with the one who sent the prophet when you come in contact with the one who sent the message then he knows at that point he now is in trouble are you with me he doesn't care what we believe i i've seen it through the years and i'm going to be i'm just going to give you a little bit of of me i grew up in the messages it's okay this morning i grew up in the message and and and i believed certain things and i thought that's what the message was but come to find out that was a altar of offense it was a doctrinal offense because you know why it produced no power in my life it gave me nothing to overcome with it actually wanted me to argue with people about that i was right or that i was wrong and the holy spirit was standing back and says when you quit when you release what you believe are you with me i want to say this there's nothing wrong with the message nor the messenger but it's what people has made out of it for the last 50 years are you with me we're coming back to the essence of what it really was in other words all the offenses that's upon the altar of people's heart god's cleaning it off oh hallelujah i found out when when when you're stuck in a doctrinal offense you do all the talking because you got to convince somebody just how right you are because you don't even really believe what you say you don't believe it so every time you regurgitate it you're convincing yourself that you're the one that's right you ever heard the saying that a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still you win your argument over a doctrine but then you walk away and they're like i still don't believe what you got you know what was printed it was theology was the presentation not the person behind the theology oh my god is this okay this morning i want you to think about it now you can have all the right fundamentals you can have the right hair length you can have the right dress you can wear and it still be an offense it can still be an altar that you're worshiping at that you ought not be worshiping that and what you're doing is maybe you're not guilty this morning maybe i'm just preaching to the four walls but those prophets of baal were so convinced that they were right that they stood and afflicted themselves see all elijah was trying to say if god is god then where is he at today well we believe what we believe we believe x doctrine you got to see it the way i see it i'm going to cut myself and maybe i'll catch your attention with it are you with me yeah i don't know nobody like that do you listen i told you when i started i believe in a practical gospel i believe if the gospel does not come down to my life every day and address it then it ain't doing me no good are you with me the bible says that he was the firstborn among many brethren in other words the life that was in jesus christ must be back in the bride in the believer he said you by your traditions make the word of god a nun effect where did the pharisees get their traditions from right out of moses's message there wasn't nothing wrong with moses and there wasn't nothing wrong with this message but because they did not know the giver of the message they had traditions produced from it there was another altar there was a disconnect i i watch people well we're in the british no we're in the laodicean church age we're in the bright age and and i'm thinking somebody help me somebody give me m ibuprofen and i thought lord what's really the problem and see here's what i believe i don't know about you but i believe that you can actually hear the voice of god himself [Music] are you with me and i said lord there's two quotes on both sides of the fence but there's got to be a middle of the road you know what he said to me he said son when has there not ever been a bright age see we get hung up on theology and terminology and we create one man denominations brother braham said this message would never denominate but he never said that the spirit wouldn't creep into our churches wouldn't creep to her thinking you know how easy it is for you to create a denomination within yourself because i've done it it's when you put a period at the end of it instead of a comma and whatever else god you choose to reveal not whatever quote i find to support what i believe see when a person's got a doctoral offense they ain't listening for the voice of god they're coming to church to see if the preacher is going to support or be against what they already believe are you with me and when we search the message it's not to find the voice of god to let eternal life be imparted to us even more it's to find what we believe even more i had to come to a point to say god i know nothing i need you to minister to my spirit to change my life when i did oh you're talking about a spiritual detox i had to have a doctrinal detox i had to be detoxified from everything i thought i knew was right listen the only way only place you ever get anywhere with god is you got to be brutally honest with him you might fool your husband you might for your wife you might for your pastor you might even fool yourself but you ain't gonna fool god he knows right where you're at he knows how to come down to your doorstep but when i said lord what's the difference between the bright age and the laodicean church and she said when have i not ever had a bright age i said well there's got to be scripture for that you see where things come is when we take the message and we separate it from the bible are you with me this morning when we take it and separated it now i said lord where is the scripture for that then he said well paul said when i had him to write it they were seated in christ jesus in heavenly places he said i was the first angel heavenly and i was the seventh angel and down through seven church ages i had seven messengers upon the earth at that time i spoke they picked the revelation up and they sounded it and the revelation through them caught the bride and set them up in christ jesus i said there's been the bright age we get hung up on terminology well you don't believe it the way i do and what we've done we've caught a shism and an ism and a division from one church to the next from one church member to the next and we have divided the body of jesus christ paul said there should be no schisms in the body are you with me my body still feels the effects of laodicea gross darkness you say well i don't know about that well let me cut you off on the highway and you'll find out real quick that your mind and your body is still trapped in the spirit of gross darkness because you want to do what you want to give them a piece of your mind i'm going to roll up my more roll up as i'm going to roll my window down i'm going to tell them don't you know you cut me off see your body still see there has to be a way to reconcile these things if we'll let god do it and let men stop [Music] are you with me it's both one or the other but when we stand over here on this side and we stand over here on this side and don't let the holy spirit recognize it we're standing at an altar of offense and we're looking it out at one another and so you don't believe it like i do you know what i said i'm glad i don't believe it like you do sometimes because i found out what i thought people should believe like me i was wrong to start with [Music] is this okay this morning let me give you a little secret this morning brother brahm says the reason he's talking about paul that he had this christ in her life is because he personally now laying aside his teaching he personally met christ he had to lay aside said everything i thought i knew i'm paraphrasing this morning i had to count it as dung to know what the person we can sit in messes churches and say i believe x i believe this doctrine i believe this way but never come to know him you realize that jesus christ the holy spirit is a person today he has a personality he has emotions he has feelings he's not tied up in the quote he should be tied up in your heart he says and that's the only way you're ever going to know him is to meet him do you do we still believe that we can meet with jesus christ it's it's to meet him see he said to know him as life notice he never said to know a scripture verse to know a quote is life that's all that the element that comes in here but it must to know him is life because it's the letter that killeth but it's the spirit that giveth life this morning oh my he says to know him as life now watch this and paul had not yet had this experience and he said here one place the life that i now live showed he lived a different life at one time his life had been changed and when your life it's changed it makes you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do so if we're still holding something against somebody because they don't believe it like we do and we won't shake their hand or we'll avoid them when we see them y'all don't go to walmart around here do you for the ones that don't go to walmart when you go to target and that one that believes just a little bit different than you and you won't shake their hand you won't go out of your way to greet them are you i i'm going down this aisle yeah i do i got this on my list i need to go over here to the laundry section they will stand god put them right where you're at you needed somebody off that aisle but you wanted to go over here to avoid them why because god says i must remove you from the altar of offense think about it now you ordinarily would not do and it makes you say things you ordinary ordinarily wouldn't say he said a man's got a christ in her life he said paul stood in the right in the midst of those peoples and jews and so forth there wasn't one speck of fear about him he knew whom he believed do you know that jesus christ is with you or do you just know that you believe a message that god sent by a prophet there is no the devil believes that also the devil believes that also and can keep you backed into a corner it didn't matter that jesus had walked peter had walked with jesus that didn't wasn't what buffaloed the devil that wasn't what put the devil in his place but when je when peter began to act like jesus that's what backed the devil into the corner are you with me because now he knew this is not just somebody that has it from an intellect this is not just somebody that has it from their mouth but this is somebody that has it on the inside and now i am in trouble see i don't know about you but i'm tired of the devil backing me in the corner i'm tired when i get up in the morning i know we're going to have a mind battle but i'm tired of him telling me that you can't make him i'm tired of him telling me that your past is too great are you with me don't tell me you don't hear it every one of us hears it and what we do is we give into that and we let our spiritual immune system become weakened over time and we don't have any no victory we don't have no victory in our lives but we still believe the right things see i told my church a while back i said look just because you believe x means absolutely nothing if the god that you believe isn't there to back it up i'm going to say a strong statement he can correct me later if he needs to but we may as well be a baptist we may as well be a lutheran we may as well be presbyterians we're called by another name message believers but if that message don't produce the very life your church's name literal life if it doesn't produce the literal life it is an altar of offense you say it's kind of challenging this morning yes i know it is but you know i found the only way i would ever grow is i had to get outside of myself i had to be challenged i i'm not much of a musician but i try to play the guitar a little bit and and brother kenny when we was at a church a few years back he came and and you you challenged everybody that day you didn't realize it some of them got mad i didn't i knew i was there i watched your attitudes but he told us what we needed to do to become better i was the only one that listened to it because they said you're doing something different what are you doing i said what he told me to do you see god sometimes tells us exactly what it is that we need to do and it's too simple to follow because we want the deep mysterious things of god but we can't even get the abcs right we must have the foundation laid and if we don't have it we got to be let be willing to let the holy spirit come in and wipe our foundation down so you must be born again to make sure we got that foundation right oh my i wish i could be an no i don't want to be an intellectual but i wish i could deliver it a different way but you see when i got rid of theology and i met the giver of the message literally met a being i said but where is the god of the prophet because i know i had no overcoming power in my life just because i heard it just because my family believed it just because my father had been in the meetings uh-uh no i needed a personal contact is this okay this morning he said he knew noting who he believed in after that he says and he had a little life and he had a life that he would would by no means have he did it if he hadn't found something that had genuinely anchored him this is what i found maybe not for you but i believe ex-doctrine was not an anchor in my life it was actual stumbling block to me right because i was like i can't explain it i can't figure it out i can't make it work i can't i can't win somebody to the message because i was trying to win them to the wrong thing why did they want anything different than what i had they had theology just like i did but when you say hey let me introduce you to somebody oh a person yeah his name is jesus i believe that god is detoxing us from all doctrinal offenses things that ought not to be there many times they're correct but we hold them in the wrong place are you with me we hold them in the wrong place what about a personal altar of offense i want to deal with this for just a few minutes i won't keep you much longer but this right here was a real real kicker in the gut for me because i'm offended how dare somebody tell me that i'm offended see god's interested in what you believe and he's interested in your personal life as well he's interested in making you 100 whole sort of a body change he didn't say i give you tribulations abundantly said i give you life i've given you joy i've give you peace i've given you happiness and sometimes we think well we ain't even a christian unless we're in a trial unless we're fighting sometimes you've got to have a respite sometimes you've got to have a place of rest here's what god showed me i was listening to a book i'm going to say this i think it's okay i think you and i are on the same page but i was listening to a book that wasn't a message book is that okay i like to listen to audio books now i ain't listening to a bunch of junk but this book was called unoffendable it's about a four-hour book it's called an unfiddle unoffendable and it's a nominal christian and this viewpoint how christians shouldn't get offended i'm like man this is some good stuff i'm going to preach out of this god said you will after i fix you first i thought man this is an awesome book until the second trip through it and i thought i don't like this book no more because i realized i had offenses in my life don't ever think your pastor walks on water he's a man just like you don't ever think that the fifo ministry walks on some great level we have as much battles if not more than you we're greater targets many times because if he can get us discouraged and get us to fall and get us to not repent but i thought i'm not offended what's this going on but you know what when i look listen to this and and i found it in the scriptures okay so i'm not off the wall you know something i found you can say the same thing that the quote saying without saying it verbatim but the essence is being produced because i know a lot of people that repeats the quotes verbatim but don't have a revelation behind it paul said you say well where's that at paul's brother bram said i preached what paul preached can you find verbatim the things that paul preached brother brahm saying absolutely verbatim you don't but it's the same god coming through the same two different vessels but it's producing the same manifestation but the lord showed me this that when you are offended you have received a lesser value you've you've become less than now when you accept that offense and many times we'll find ourselves standing at an altar thinking that we're standing in an altar of faith trying to worship and have faith for god to move and and to to believe and nothing's happening it's because it's an altar of offense that i was worshiping at and not an altar of faith and i thought well lord i got to find this in the message where's it at i i believe the message okay and i believe the messenger don't don't get me wrong i'm not going i'm not a man that's leaving it i'm a man that's actually coming to what it's about as every son and daughter of god must be coming to what it's about it's got to be something that's affecting you see i believe this this is what i told the preachers at the church i said look when you read a quote of brother branham you're either putting brother branham before the people you're either using it to build your ministry or that quote should be revealing jesus christ back to the people again because the one that preached the message the 1200 sermons that's what his message that's what his life did was put jesus christ back before the people we're talking about a literal life your church this morning are you with me that's what the original literal life it is the original life of god himself zoe god's own life back in the life of a believer and i i went back and i began to search what the prophet of god brother bam said about your conscience your your reasoning your memory your affection your imagination and i came across this scripture verse proverbs 18 14 says the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear it where does the offenses take place it's in your spirit realm now watch tying that scripture verse in with the things that brother branham said listen when somebody offends you you always have a memory of it you cannot let them you can choose to forget it but it's like it's stored in your hard drive and every once in a while the devil will pull it up and the memory of you remember what happened and then your best friend kicks in reasoning says no why did they do that i i i thought they was a believer reasoning what we're talking about an offense and an affirmative now it's being sustained by the spirit man according to the scriptures why did they do that and then all of a sudden because you don't know you don't realize either the lord may have allowed it to happen or the devil got up on that person and caused that now your imagination kicks in well i bet it was because of this i bet you anything this is the reason they did it you remember what happened reasoning says why and then your imagination begins to supply the answers now we find ourselves moving into this altar of offense now watch because we're affectionate human beings so i'm not an affection yeah there's something in your life that you're affectionate about it might be golfing it might be hunting it might be fishing it might be hobbies it might be your husband a wife your children you are affectionate about something or you're dead you are affectionate about something or you are dead and because we're affectionate what we do is we hold on to this value that's been given because it identifies us and it gives me a validity well i am offended don't we realize jesus said that offenses are going to come and then the conscience kicks in this inner feeling that says you know you really ought not be like that you know what the word says you have to forgive to be forgiven and then guess what kicks back in the memory cycles itself again well i still ain't never i know i'm supposed to give i still ain't never figured out why they did that but you know what i bet it's also this why they did it you realize that the human mind if the events are written down within 24 to 48 to 72 hours you do not remember the details of it science has proven this but guess who else knows it the devil and then what happens it's memory reasoning imagination affection conscience and it's the cycle that locks well we're message believers can i give you a scripture verse there is no temptation but what's common to non-message believers and message believers and so this cycle runs over and over and over and over and we come to church year after year after year setting in an offended place with the holy ghost he's the magic pill the bible says he will lead you so that means we have to surrender for him to leap for the inside brother ram said jesus had to pray much to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was with in him with the holy ghost we set and will hold these altars offenses and he's service after service year after year month after month he's saying i will take it if you'll release it but lord i believe that you're jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and then the back of your mind says but you haven't seen him move are you with me an altar of a personal offense trying to have and and i said lord how can this be true and he said you want scriptures for it i'm like well i always want scriptures for it i want to know where it's at in your word it took me the most unusual place first peter 2 68 says wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sign a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which are disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling a rock of a fence and i went now he's talking about cyan or the bride it was like he said just because you think you're the bride don't mean that you won't get offended and hold something in your heart for years and i went see even the preacher gets corrected watch this in romans 9 33 as it is written behold i lay in cyan or the bride a stumbling stone in a rock or a revelation that she can be offended also you know when elijah the bible says that he rebuilt the altar he didn't build an altar he picked up what was already laying there the altar of the lord the altar of faith was laying in shambles because an altar of offense had taken its place now there was wood there was a sacrifice humanity brother brahm said is a representation of wood wood is a representation of humanity the cross is the sacrifice on both altars the altar of offense and the altar of faith have the same beliefs but still be worshiping at the wrong altar but there was a couple other elements on elijah's altar there was water washed by the water of the word and there was stones which is a revelation but you know sometimes something happens in your life and you think you got over it and you think you've moved beyond it and you think you're okay you know why because human nature is so adaptive we have the ability to survive trauma we have the ability to survive things that come into our lives because we can cut it off and push it aside but this is what the holy spirit showed me he said son there was one thing that was left on elijah's altar he said it was dust and i said what's dust represent he said it's when you think you're beyond it but the remnant of it is the dust of the offense is still laying in my wife's life at times you know why because the original offense is gone but the behavior that the offense caused still lives on today but what was the cure for it fire let the god who is god answer by fire see god don't want you halfway he don't want you three-fourths he wants you all he wants you whole he just don't want you to believe the message he wants you to be come the message she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of his bone we need fire i thought about it how that our own self-will keeps us many times at the altar of offense our thoughts keep us at an altar of offense bitterness grudges the past our own abilities our knowledge our wisdom our length of time and the message like there's some tenure i said the 11th hour worker debunks that one our hurt feelings our doctrines our own understanding let me give you a testimony and i'm closing with this right here i read this book listen to it called unoffendable and oh it was so awesome until it came to tim's doorstep until it began to walk down my avenue there's something that's been off between me and my wife for a very long time was a very long time so we almost couldn't talk to one another about anything without getting upset you think the preacher's immune to that no we're all humanity we all have the same faults and failures as a sinner as a denominational believer we're all we're all in this thing together the only reason you see the message is because god chose you to see the message that's it when others walk away why have you stayed because you've been predestinated to stay it's not because you believe a certain doctrine it's because you've been predestinated to stay right where you're at where else can you go you have the words to eternal life lord but i was sick i got sick a while back and my wife wasn't feeling well and so i had a brother to church he's a minister in the deacon there and he took the service and after his wonderful service and after service he called he said hey we want to come by and pray for your wife aside i said we might have omnicron whichever variant it was i said we may have it i said so he said well i don't care he said i've never been around all that stuff and i said well come on if you want to come i'll take your prayer come and pray and so when he got there he began to talk and both of the deacons they came and they put their hands on me and my wife and i reached out and took her hand and when i began to pray i began to realize how offended i was at her and when i prayed for her the way i've never prayed for her as though i would pray for another sister in the lord are you with me now when they left we looked at each other and we both immediately recognized that thing was gone between us that don't mean the devil ain't tried to come back but i'm gonna show you the power when something is released i just know when god does something for me i'm just going to tell somebody about it we go to church on a wednesday night brother dwayne jackson had ministered for us i got up after and this was burning on my heart where god had released us from this offense what most people didn't know what the church didn't know for two or three years my wife had had a garter that was growing on the inside of her throat getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger we weren't sure what we were going to do about it it's real easy when you're at an altar of faith and not an altar of offense to have faith when you're not mad at somebody it's easy to have faith and so she said honey on the way to church she said babe she said i still feel this thing she said i don't have to swallow now it's it's getting bigger i just put my hand over on her and i didn't even pray i said well lord i said you're still the same god that when women would come up through your prophet's prayer line that garters would disappear that's all i said it didn't go away right then but we got the church that night and after service i gave my heart for five minutes after the brother preached to the church and i told him i said the bible said these signs shall follow them that believe i asked my wife i said would you come off the organ and let us lay hands on you i said let's ministers and i said no if you're a believer i said i want you to lay hands on my wife are you with me see this ain't just a one-man ministry this ain't your favorite preacher i'm real sorry if you got favorites uh and you can't do that you can't do that it's moved from the ministry into the body or it must be that don't mean you'll get up here and preach because if you don't have a gift you won't do that but the word has moved from here down to there it cannot stay here only it's got to go out with you and reproduce itself every seed must bring forth of its own kind if it's a bride if it's the word it's going to reproduce another bride within three seconds of the whole church laying hands on my wife's body one on the other those who could reach or put their hands on her i heard her scream she's quiet woman she ain't a screamer she ain't a shouter i i like emotion because you got to have some emotion you're dead i watched the spirit god hit her and she dropped i'm like well praise i was getting ready to have the church to pray the spirit of the lord swept into the building we worshiped for 15 minutes after it was over she said can i testify i said sure she said when the hands were laid on me within three seconds it disappeared but you know what do you know where it got started from is when i stop being offended when i let the fire of god come into tim hayden's heart and take me from the altar of offense and put me back at the altar of faith then i could say all things are possible you know what i'm going to say this as you get ready to come whoever's going to come musicians come when we stay at the altar of offense and we will not allow the holy spirit to move us to the altar of faith we're defrauding our spiritual husband from working the bible says defraud you not one another we look at husbands and wife what she's defrauding he's defrauding but what about the frauding going on like this are you with me as you play the song let your word be born let's just bow our heads with me if you will father lord i know what you put upon my heart but not knowing how to bring it out god you're the god who can be touched by the feeling of every infirmity in her heart and life where my heart's been delivered this morning you know the needs lord maybe there was not none here this morning that needed maybe we just needed a reminder i don't know lord but father if there's one that needs what may you walk up and down the aisle this morning walk down into the heart say son daughter i will move you from the altar of offense to the altar of faith if you'll just let me do it right now if you just surrender everything that you are i gave everything for you now give it all to me and i'll take care of it at this point if he's speaking to your heart this morning don't don't push him away don't resist him allow him to take a hold of it give you a testimonial preach this in another place another state another church there happened to be a baptist woman that was sitting there 74 years of age she said preacher i i never heard nothing like that in my life she said i i thought i was over a lot of stuff she said if i had so memories come flood him back into my mind that i don't even know what to do with them now i told her i said sister you heard what he said let him take control of that offense maybe you've held this morning to a particular doctrinal belief from the message and you fought over it you squabbled over i'm urging you to release that this morning to let the holy spirit walk down into your life and say lord if i have to start all over from the basis i will do that because i want to be right before you and write with you in my [Music] walk just released it to him this morning in jesus name we ask him sing this with me i may sing a little different than you but this i know this where this song came from but it's a very special song to me because i believe this is what it's about is that we let his word be born in the mangers no it no no when they wrote it never said it in our minds
