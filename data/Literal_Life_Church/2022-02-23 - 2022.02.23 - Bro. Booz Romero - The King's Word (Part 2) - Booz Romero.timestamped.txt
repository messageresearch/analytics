[0:00] never will kind of the lord kind of will
[0:01] never be caught caught as a surprise
[0:04] amen um but we're we're again it is good
[0:07] to be in the house of the lord and um
[0:10] we're just trying to open my file here
[0:12] but it seems that it doesn't want to
[0:13] open or something happen but let me see
[0:16] if i can try it up there you go it's
[0:18] here
[0:20] you know you have your notes and
[0:21] everything is written in there and then
[0:23] all of a sudden something happens and
[0:25] nothing is coming up but you know praise
[0:28] the lord amen
[0:30] so um
[0:32] you know um
[0:34] what we can say tonight is you know the
[0:36] word of god is so perfect
[0:38] that a human cannot understand how the
[0:41] lord inspire
[0:42] all those books without having a
[0:45] contradiction against each other
[0:48] you know uh as we mentioned last last
[0:51] wednesday you know we were talking about
[0:53] 12 gates and then
[0:56] the prophet of god taught us that 12 is
[0:58] a number of foundations it's a number of
[1:01] kind of establishing something it's a
[1:03] number of uh you know when you're going
[1:05] to build a house you need good
[1:07] foundations say man and then through the
[1:09] bible we see that there there were the
[1:11] 12 children of israel you know there was
[1:14] the the establishment for for the jewish
[1:18] nation and then there were two apostles
[1:21] so that was establishment for for the
[1:23] gospel that needed to come every and
[1:25] everything was coming you know in number
[1:28] 12.
[1:29] then if you also go in reading the book
[1:32] of uh in uh at the beginning of the
[1:34] bible when they were um
[1:37] crossing the jordan river like there was
[1:40] uh uh
[1:43] joshua was telling them that they needed
[1:45] to set uh um
[1:47] uh like like a memorial and in that
[1:51] memorial there were 12 stones as well
[1:55] so what is all this talking about that
[1:56] the lord kind of he doesn't make
[1:58] mistakes and what whatever the lord does
[2:01] in our lives or whatever the lord has
[2:03] written in the scriptures is perfect
[2:06] so now when we look at this city when we
[2:08] look that there is a new jerusalem that
[2:10] is coming that has descended john is
[2:13] seeing a perfect city as we were saying
[2:15] last west last last wednesday uh john
[2:18] was seeing a perfect city
[2:20] with per with beautiful colors stones
[2:23] and everything and then he saw that it
[2:25] was 12 12 gates and then in on each a
[2:28] gate there were 12 a
[2:30] angel see man
[2:32] so
[2:33] that's why
[2:34] if somebody tells me that the bible is
[2:37] is not it's not the word of god or or if
[2:40] that it is not perfect i will tell them
[2:42] i i beg your pardon you're wrong because
[2:45] go back and read the scriptures and
[2:47] you'll see that christ is in the in his
[2:49] word amen
[2:51] so before we go there um you know the
[2:53] prophet of god uh he went up to one one
[2:56] time he was uh went up to the mountain
[2:59] and and
[3:00] you know he knew
[3:02] he knew everything he knew when how to
[3:04] go and go hunting and everything but
[3:07] there was this one specific uh
[3:10] instance that he went up to the mountain
[3:12] and and then when he was there like all
[3:14] of a sudden there was this a heavy fog
[3:16] that kind of fell on that mountain so
[3:20] all of a sudden he was like well i know
[3:22] my way back home
[3:24] he was so sure that he knew his way back
[3:26] home so there was maybe a little bit of
[3:28] something that he needed to check in his
[3:30] heart and that was the gate of humility
[3:32] amen so he he was like you know i know
[3:34] my way back home and i know how to uh i
[3:38] i know how to hunt and i know that
[3:40] i just take the way back and i'm gonna
[3:42] be i'm gonna make it back
[3:45] but then all of a sudden like uh he has
[3:47] started you know going in circles and
[3:49] going in circles and the indians will
[3:53] indians will call that the indian march
[3:55] in other words you start here and then
[3:57] you go go around and you go you're gonna
[3:59] get to the same place
[4:01] so it was the prophet of god you know he
[4:03] he was someone that was very close to
[4:05] the lord and then all of a sudden he was
[4:07] like
[4:08] i know the way you know i was reading he
[4:10] was like yeah i know the way i know the
[4:11] way i know the way but the more we bring
[4:14] ourselves first the more we're going to
[4:16] get lost
[4:18] that's why the the the the importance of
[4:21] recognizing when we are making mistakes
[4:24] lord i'm wrong and you're right please
[4:26] come in correct amen so
[4:31] there was like going in circles circle
[4:33] circles and circles and then all of a
[4:35] sudden he remembered you know a few uh
[4:38] or he was thinking before you know
[4:41] as i'm here i can i can survive like
[4:43] i know everything but i he he was
[4:45] thinking about his wife thinking about
[4:47] his son and then he was like but i know
[4:49] that they may die because they don't
[4:51] know they don't know how to hunt or they
[4:53] don't know how how to uh
[4:55] things like that like the survival
[4:58] things
[4:59] but then uh
[5:00] he was worried about it he was like so
[5:02] now what what is going to happen what am
[5:04] i gonna do if
[5:05] if i don't go down they're gonna die
[5:08] but then all of a sudden you know there
[5:10] there was a a
[5:12] a point or an instance where he realized
[5:14] you know lord
[5:15] then he he was having that specific
[5:18] thought
[5:19] god is my present
[5:22] help
[5:22] in the time of trouble
[5:25] god is my present help in the time of
[5:28] trouble and it was that was just coming
[5:30] to his mind coming to his mind coming to
[5:32] his mind and then all of a sudden he's
[5:33] like you lord you are my present help in
[5:36] the time of trouble so when he realized
[5:39] that he was wrong is when the lord can
[5:41] come and help him
[5:43] so that's the same thing for us you know
[5:46] talking about all these gates and things
[5:48] is like when we realize that it should
[5:49] be less of us and more of him then is
[5:52] when we are going to be helped
[5:55] so all of a sudden then he realized you
[5:57] know or he remember that film like in
[6:00] the summer of that specific year he had
[6:02] helped a yeah you know
[6:04] kind of to install some telephone wire
[6:07] so he knew
[6:09] that if he will find that telephone wire
[6:12] that means that he could go back home
[6:16] and then all of a sudden he just lift up
[6:18] his hands and said you know what lord i
[6:21] surrender lord this gate i can put it
[6:24] there this gate of humility now i'm
[6:27] checking it and i'm thinking i'm lacking
[6:29] there some lore so all of a sudden then
[6:32] he lifts up his hands and then he
[6:34] realized you know lord if i find that
[6:37] telephone wire i know that this is gonna
[6:39] be my way back home
[6:41] so once he found it then he's like i'm
[6:44] not gonna let this go because i know
[6:47] sorry all of a sudden he found that line
[6:49] that or that telephone wire that was
[6:51] gonna bring him back home so then he
[6:53] said you know what this is my time i can
[6:56] go now back home
[6:58] so how much more for us tonight that
[7:00] when we
[7:02] surrender to christ and when we lift up
[7:05] our hands and say lord my humility my
[7:08] testimony my salvation your word that
[7:11] needs to dwell in me lord i need your
[7:14] help i surrender tonight because i know
[7:17] that the the more that i surrender the
[7:20] more as the song says the more you're
[7:22] gonna take control of my life and the
[7:24] more i'm gonna see results in my life
[7:27] the more i'm gonna see changes in my
[7:29] life
[7:30] i was thinking you know
[7:32] if we go here you know we have
[7:36] this sorry
[7:37] we have this ship gate the fish gate the
[7:40] old gate the valley gate the dung gate
[7:42] and then we stop in the fountain gate so
[7:45] these are kind of a lot of people they
[7:47] stay there a lot of people stay in
[7:49] salvation a lot of people say and i just
[7:51] have to testify a lot of people they
[7:53] just say in in in their own experience
[7:57] a lot of people stay in humility a lot
[8:00] of people are staying the dong gate
[8:02] and a lot of people stay in the fountain
[8:04] gate but there's more there's there are
[8:06] more things that the lord wants to come
[8:08] and restore there are more things that
[8:10] the lord had already paid a ransom for
[8:13] you
[8:14] amen so that's why you know when when we
[8:17] surrender it's not going to be just six
[8:20] it's not gonna be your seven or ten or
[8:22] or eleven it's gonna be twelve the lord
[8:25] is going to build a foundation in your
[8:27] life
[8:29] but you need to go back and repair
[8:30] everything as we were saying last
[8:32] wednesday nehemiah had a heart had a
[8:35] desire in his heart that he wanted to
[8:38] see that city he wanted to see that wall
[8:40] repair he wanted to see the gates he
[8:43] wanted to see the locks he wanted to see
[8:45] everything repair
[8:46] and when there is a desire when somebody
[8:48] has a desire to repair something if it
[8:51] is a desire that is coming from the
[8:53] presence of the presence of god he is
[8:56] going to provide all the materials
[8:59] and and learn this tonight he's going to
[9:02] provide everything he's going to give
[9:04] you all the provisions that you need to
[9:06] all be an overcomer everything you're
[9:09] not going to be a survivor every day now
[9:11] you're going to be a victor
[9:14] it is time for us to change
[9:16] our attitude that we come to church or
[9:19] that we live our day by day as survivors
[9:24] the lord has provided us tools that we
[9:27] can be overcomers every day
[9:30] that when somebody tells us how are you
[9:32] doing you say i'm doing great by by
[9:34] god's grace
[9:36] when they asked that that woman how is
[9:38] everything going and she was like
[9:40] everything is fine and she had a son
[9:42] that was laying dead in her house
[9:45] but her faith was looking beyond death
[9:48] her face was looking beyond what human
[9:51] side can see her face was looking at the
[9:54] promise
[9:55] that
[9:56] her face was looking at the word that
[9:58] that prophet had a prophet elijah had
[10:01] and he had a word of restoration he had
[10:04] a word of resurrection
[10:08] we have received the same thing
[10:10] and we can live victorious lives tonight
[10:13] how many believe that
[10:15] amen
[10:17] so we just don't want to stay here and
[10:19] and what's the reason that we put these
[10:20] like like kind of arrows going around
[10:22] because this is a cycle these are things
[10:24] that you have to be checking in your
[10:26] life every day lord where am i in my
[10:28] humility where am i am i taking off all
[10:31] the trash out of my mind every day
[10:34] because remember the don gate he was
[10:36] like the dog would have to go through
[10:38] there but he didn't have to stay there
[10:41] he had to go through by that gate but
[10:44] then they it had to keep going
[10:46] onward to where it was supposed to be
[10:48] placed
[10:50] amen
[10:53] now the next gate that we have here
[10:55] is the water gate
[10:57] what is the water
[10:58] gate it's moreover the methane dwalt in
[11:02] office onto the place over against the
[11:04] water gate toward the east and the tower
[11:07] that laid
[11:08] out
[11:10] what is this
[11:11] these gates represent the revelation of
[11:13] his word
[11:15] and how it is how important it is the
[11:17] revelation that can never be over
[11:20] emphasized
[11:22] you know the fountain gate will always
[11:24] lead you to the watergate
[11:26] the holy spirit will always bring bring
[11:29] you to the revelation of the word
[11:31] because when you receive the holy spirit
[11:33] it cannot say something against on of
[11:36] what was already written in this book
[11:39] that's the revelation of his word
[11:41] the bible says that without faith it is
[11:43] impossible to please god and we can say
[11:46] without revelation it is impossible to
[11:49] please god
[11:50] and i can tell you ask the lord to show
[11:53] himself more and more through the
[11:55] revelation of his word
[11:57] that's why somebody asked the prophet of
[11:59] god you tell me how can i be closer to
[12:01] christ and the answer was not you you
[12:04] don't have to push play or he didn't say
[12:06] you have to push play and obey no you
[12:08] say read your bible and pray
[12:11] why because the more you read the more
[12:13] god is going to open his word
[12:18] we believe we say that we're bible
[12:19] believers if i ask you today did you
[12:21] take your bible and read something from
[12:23] there
[12:26] look what the prophet of god says the
[12:28] bible has the answer
[12:31] because the bible is the revelation of
[12:33] jesus christ being revealed since the
[12:35] foundation of the world he has been
[12:38] rebuilt he has been revealed in the form
[12:40] of prophets he has been revealed in the
[12:42] form of kings he has been revealed in
[12:44] the form of law givers because that's
[12:46] what he is he's a king he's a prophet
[12:49] and he's a law and he is god
[12:52] he is the same yesterday today and
[12:54] forever christ is the mystery of god
[12:57] that has been revealed to us in our day
[13:00] this is not a god of history that we
[13:02] kind of just look back at the
[13:04] god of story you know this is a god of a
[13:07] present time
[13:09] amen what is this why because the bible
[13:13] plainly declares his full coming and he
[13:16] comes in full revelation of the word
[13:19] and each generation reveals him
[13:22] in the full revelation that is loaded
[13:24] for that time
[13:25] but this then generation must reveal
[13:28] jesus christ
[13:30] if you're here because you are here you
[13:33] have to reveal jesus christ what does he
[13:36] mean to you tonight
[13:39] if he means something what does he mean
[13:41] to you
[13:43] this generation that's the revelation of
[13:45] him that has promised in the world it
[13:48] must be revealed to this generation
[13:50] there won't be any other generation
[13:53] this is a generation that is that you'll
[13:55] be seeing a changing in their bodies
[13:58] and i can tell you i'm a witness of that
[14:00] the lord have come and changed my mind
[14:02] the lord had come and changed the way i
[14:04] think
[14:05] the lord have come and changed the way i
[14:08] approach things isn't that something
[14:10] related to the changing of my mind in my
[14:12] body
[14:15] sometimes we go like so in the future
[14:17] that we say you know what then my my
[14:20] athletes are gonna be changed that's
[14:21] true that is coming but what change is
[14:25] lord doing in your life tonight
[14:27] if
[14:28] nothing is happening in your life i
[14:30] invite you to say lord something needs
[14:32] to happen in my life tonight i cannot
[14:35] stay like this anymore i cannot be
[14:37] living in sin anymore like this
[14:42] it has to be a cry in your heart
[14:45] lord i want to rebuild
[14:48] i want to be
[14:49] someone that you can use
[14:53] a revelation of who you are
[15:01] amen
[15:03] john said because god is able to these
[15:06] stones
[15:07] of these stones to raise to raise
[15:09] children unto abraham don't think that
[15:12] to say that within yourself
[15:14] we have abraham to our father but god is
[15:17] able of these stones to to raise
[15:20] children to abraham how many how many
[15:23] had a sonny heart and the lord has
[15:25] raised them tonight
[15:27] that's that's a fulfillment of that
[15:29] scripture of that when jesus was telling
[15:31] those people
[15:34] colossians 1 26 and 27 it says even the
[15:37] mystery and that's the beauty of the of
[15:39] the gospel is very simple yet is very
[15:42] deep
[15:44] even the mystery which have been hit
[15:47] from ages and from generations but now
[15:49] is made manifest to his saints what is
[15:52] this to whom god will make known what is
[15:55] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[15:58] among the gentiles which is christ in
[16:01] you
[16:02] the hope of glory
[16:05] churches that you say with god the
[16:06] father the dispensation as a father
[16:09] that's great or people stay with god
[16:11] emmanuel
[16:13] jesus with us or christ with us but i
[16:16] thought i like that but i want more lord
[16:19] what is your desire lord i want you you
[16:22] are the hope of my my life
[16:25] you are the hope of glory lord that's
[16:27] what i want tonight
[16:29] christ in you the hope of glory
[16:31] everything as we we always quote that
[16:34] quote from brother branham that says
[16:35] everything that was in the father was
[16:37] poured to jesus and everything that was
[16:39] in christ now where is it
[16:42] then we have to bring fruits of that
[16:46] amen
[16:53] how many has that desire in their hearts
[16:55] you can say lord that's what i want for
[16:57] my life
[17:06] prophet of god says let the bible read
[17:07] us here tonight see the truth let them
[17:09] see the malachi 4. what is malachi 4
[17:12] that this is and this is that this
[17:14] anointing is supposed to come and he's
[17:16] supposed to restore back again that
[17:18] faith
[17:20] that the fathers once sinned the
[17:22] revelation of god in christ
[17:24] that's what he wants for my life may
[17:27] they see the revelation of god in human
[17:29] beings
[17:30] not just letter not how much you can
[17:32] read not how much you can't you can talk
[17:35] but may they see christ through your
[17:37] life
[17:37] christ manifested in the flesh of his
[17:40] church walking among us
[17:43] that's a prayer he's a granted lord how
[17:45] many say yes lord that's what i want for
[17:47] my life
[17:48] i want to manifest who you are
[17:52] now just the asberry paul was preaching
[17:54] not just the the legal lesson or
[17:57] idolatry no no we can take those two and
[17:59] they can they can come to a balance and
[18:02] then that's christ
[18:06] what kind of a revelation would that be
[18:09] it would be the revelation of his living
[18:11] after being crucified for 1900 years and
[18:14] he's raised from the dead and is alive
[18:16] with us he will be revealed
[18:20] i think he says the word don't need any
[18:22] interpretation when it is doing it
[18:24] itself revealing christ in the promise
[18:26] of the age that's exactly what will come
[18:29] on the sin
[18:32] is he is it here or not
[18:35] is christ being revealed himself through
[18:37] us or not
[18:39] is christ in me the hope of glory or not
[18:43] this gate is revelation of who christ is
[18:46] but more than that is who am i in christ
[18:51] you know in nehemiah chapter 8 verse 8
[18:54] it says so they read in the book in the
[18:56] law of god distinctly and gave the sense
[19:00] and caused them to understand the
[19:02] reading
[19:03] what happened why were they able to
[19:05] understand the reading because
[19:07] everything was ready everything was
[19:09] repaired so they were able to understand
[19:11] what was written in the book of the uh
[19:13] of the law of moses
[19:16] because before that kind of it would
[19:17] have brought condemnation instead of
[19:20] conviction to this to their hearts
[19:23] and all the people went their way to eat
[19:26] and drink and to send portions and to
[19:29] make a great mirth and that's make great
[19:32] joy make up a fist why because the world
[19:36] was open to them
[19:38] how much more now that the world has
[19:41] been open to you tonight that you
[19:44] that's why why am i gonna be oppressed
[19:46] because of the attacks of the enemy when
[19:48] the world has been open to me
[19:50] and whatever come comes my way i know
[19:53] that the lord is going to take care of
[19:54] it
[19:57] and even more listen to this because
[19:59] they had understood the words that were
[20:03] declared unto them because will it be
[20:07] fair that you would be reading something
[20:08] and wouldn't be understanding a word it
[20:11] wouldn't be fair
[20:12] but once they received the word once
[20:15] they knew that everything was in its
[20:17] place then when they started reading the
[20:19] book when they were reading from an open
[20:22] book
[20:22] what happened
[20:24] they were rejoicing because now they
[20:25] were able their eyes were open they were
[20:28] able to understand everything
[20:30] and it is not just to have an
[20:32] intellectual understanding because a lot
[20:34] of people stay there
[20:36] oh this is that i can bring it down now
[20:38] to my heart lord how am i gonna express
[20:40] yourself today
[20:48] the opening of the word
[20:50] will place a desire in the people to say
[20:53] amen to the word
[20:55] and to worship god
[20:57] the opening of the word will place you
[21:00] in your position as what as a believer
[21:04] one more thing the opening of the word
[21:06] will show you where you come from
[21:09] the opening of the word will show you
[21:11] who you are
[21:13] the opening of the word will show you
[21:15] what is your purpose on earth and even
[21:18] something greater than that not just
[21:20] that but the opening of the word also
[21:22] will show you where you are going
[21:26] that's why you need to read your bible
[21:28] you need to listen to the tapes you need
[21:30] to come to church if you want to
[21:32] understand where you're going if you
[21:34] want to understand what's my purpose
[21:36] here what am i doing here am i just here
[21:38] just a church goer no lord i want i want
[21:41] to understand where i come from i and
[21:43] then the prophet of god says
[21:45] that we come from the mind of god
[21:49] it says you know does it the thoughts of
[21:52] god are eternal and they are real
[21:54] in other words this is not something
[21:56] that just happened out of the blue as we
[21:58] say
[21:59] this is then the prophet of god says
[22:01] they are not simply like a man without a
[22:03] blueprint that he has grown up in which
[22:05] one day will be translated into into
[22:07] substance and form no they are very
[22:10] already real and they are eternal and
[22:12] they are part of god
[22:14] and who are those that are already
[22:16] eternal and they are part of god
[22:22] where do i come from who am i what is my
[22:25] purpose here
[22:26] then it will show me show you where
[22:28] you're going so where are you going
[22:30] tonight
[22:32] i can say reveal yourself more and more
[22:34] every day lord may people can see that
[22:37] you are living in an earthly vessel
[22:41] isn't that your desire that when people
[22:42] see they can see like christ is walking
[22:45] there like that person has a different
[22:46] anointing that that person has something
[22:48] different
[22:50] wouldn't that be your desire tonight to
[22:51] say lord i want that i want that people
[22:53] when they they can come and approach me
[22:56] without being afraid that i'm going to
[22:58] give them a bad response or i'm going to
[22:59] be all grumpy
[23:03] amen
[23:04] but the lord doesn't just leave us there
[23:07] then after the watergate there is
[23:09] something more there is more in the word
[23:10] of god
[23:12] then now he brings us to the horse gate
[23:14] what is this
[23:15] nehemiah 3 28 from above the horse gate
[23:18] repair the priest every everyone over
[23:20] against his house and
[23:23] in the book of job chapter 39 verse 19
[23:26] ins it says has thou given the horse
[23:29] strength has outlawed his neck with
[23:31] thunder
[23:33] what is a horse in the scriptures it
[23:35] represents a power it is a beast it
[23:38] represents a power
[23:39] in this gate it represents the
[23:42] quickening power
[23:44] that word that you receive that
[23:46] revelation that you receive is not it is
[23:49] you know you can receive a seed but if
[23:51] that seed is not quickened it wouldn't
[23:53] do anything
[23:54] but that seed needs to be quickened that
[23:57] seed needs to be revived that seed needs
[24:00] to receive the light
[24:01] amen
[24:03] is the mechanics and the dynamics in you
[24:07] enoch's mechanics became his dynamics
[24:11] what is your mechanics and your dynamics
[24:13] today
[24:14] you know the prophet of god says he was
[24:16] not only the mechanics but god's word he
[24:18] was the dynamics to prove that
[24:21] he was the mechanics then the the the he
[24:24] will do those the natural things but he
[24:26] also was the human part and he also was
[24:28] the divine part
[24:31] so that has to be the same thing has to
[24:33] be in us that that is the horse gate
[24:35] that's the quickening power in our lives
[24:38] and he you know the bride has to comfort
[24:41] because it is part of him in other words
[24:43] it can only be the manifestation of the
[24:46] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[24:48] others has spoken of the bride
[24:51] the bride cannot produce something
[24:53] different than what he is because if
[24:55] that is then the bride is not part of
[24:57] him
[25:00] and i like this party look what it says
[25:02] here
[25:04] she is flesh of his flesh
[25:06] bone of his phones
[25:08] life of his life
[25:10] power of his power
[25:12] and even more than that
[25:14] she is him
[25:17] so if you are god if you are part of god
[25:19] tonight
[25:20] how are you supposed to live
[25:22] how are you supposed to conduct yourself
[25:26] are you going to be just like you know
[25:27] tired and just kicking the
[25:30] the can and uh
[25:32] just another day
[25:35] or will you be like you know lord
[25:37] whatever comes my way like
[25:38] i'm in your hands
[25:40] i know i know where you have brought me
[25:42] from i know what what purpose i'm
[25:44] fulfilling here lord if it is a purpose
[25:46] that you want do you wanna heal me then
[25:49] i'm gonna i'm fulfilling the purpose
[25:51] that you are the healer
[25:54] if i'm in need lord i'm fulfilling the
[25:56] purpose that you are the provider
[25:59] when we just complain
[26:02] you will say well brother boaz is
[26:03] because you are not going through things
[26:05] so
[26:06] if you will ask me are you going through
[26:07] things yes i am
[26:09] but we are not going to be oppressed by
[26:11] the enemy's attacks we cannot be like
[26:13] that all our lives we i posted something
[26:16] and i was very interesting you know
[26:18] brother paul was reading a quote from
[26:20] corey
[26:21] tem tim boom or whatever so she was
[26:24] saying like the worry
[26:26] will uh kind of draws or will kind of
[26:29] take the strength from your from the day
[26:33] isn't that right
[26:35] it can sorry the word god will take away
[26:38] the strength of the day but like why why
[26:40] wouldn't you enjoy your day today
[26:43] amen
[26:46] what is the quickening power what is
[26:47] that quickening power doing in my life
[26:50] when the word is being preached it is a
[26:52] word preaching to the word
[26:55] because there if there is a seed in your
[26:56] heart then that word has to say amen to
[26:58] that word
[27:00] amen the very dynamics of his word that
[27:03] is still a small voice that was inside
[27:05] of elijah or that came to elijah you
[27:08] know the seed must wait for the
[27:10] appointed time
[27:13] what was and i was talking to the youth
[27:15] on friday what was i still a small voice
[27:18] and when it came to elijah it was not a
[27:21] it came like an earthquake an earthquake
[27:23] came and god wasn't there and then the
[27:26] whirlwind came and god wasn't there
[27:31] and then
[27:32] why when that still small voice came to
[27:36] elijah why he was able to recognize that
[27:39] and i was telling the youth you know
[27:41] because when somebody is whispering to
[27:43] you that doesn't mean that that person
[27:45] is meters or a feet away from you that
[27:48] means that person is right next to you
[27:50] so that is what was happening with
[27:53] elijah he was able to recognize the
[27:55] lord's voice because the lord was right
[27:57] besides him beside him
[28:00] so when you're able to hear the voice of
[28:02] god
[28:03] be take heart and be confident that he's
[28:06] just right right beside you
[28:10] he is right he's right beside you seek
[28:12] him with all your heart and mind daily
[28:15] the prophet of god says if you want to
[28:18] hear from god what do you have to do you
[28:20] have to read your bible you have he says
[28:23] if you want to hear the voice of god you
[28:25] have to be in the word
[28:28] people is like it's because god is has
[28:30] forsaken me no the lord has not forsaken
[28:32] you is because you have drifted away
[28:35] from him
[28:38] romans 8 11 it says and if the spirit of
[28:41] him that raised up jesus from the deal
[28:43] from the dead dwell in you
[28:45] he that raised up christ from the dead
[28:47] he shall also quicken
[28:50] your moral bodies by his spirit that
[28:52] dwelleth in you in other words for you
[28:55] in order for you to be quick and there
[28:56] has to be something in you that need
[28:58] that is supposed to be quick and
[29:02] that's the gate of the quickening power
[29:03] so that's why everyday lord
[29:06] is that quickening power in my life is
[29:08] your holy spirit in my life so that when
[29:10] you come and talk to me i'm a receptor
[29:12] of what you're saying
[29:14] amen
[29:18] after that weekend in power is in you
[29:21] now he brings us to another gate
[29:25] gate fish gate all gate valley gate long
[29:28] gate fountain gate watergate horse game
[29:31] we're gonna end soon here okay
[29:34] now he brings us to the easter gate
[29:37] what is the easter gate
[29:39] after after them prepare sadok the sum
[29:42] of emir over against his house after him
[29:44] repair also shemaya the son of shen
[29:49] shanaya the keeper of the east gate so
[29:52] they went and repaired the escape
[29:56] what is east gate
[29:59] or the easter gate
[30:02] this gate is the revelation of his
[30:05] coming
[30:06] why
[30:08] because matthew 24 27 it says for as
[30:11] lightning cometh out of the east
[30:14] and shine it even on to the west so
[30:17] shall also be so social out so the
[30:20] coming of the son of man be
[30:23] there it is
[30:24] that's why
[30:25] and if you go to like the ones that were
[30:27] in israel they are waiting for their
[30:30] messiah to come through a gate
[30:34] and i was reading specifically that gate
[30:37] that when uh they they kind of occupy
[30:40] the city kind of the other nations they
[30:42] block the gate
[30:44] because they were like if their messiah
[30:46] is coming there is a prophecy that has
[30:48] to be fulfilled so we don't want the
[30:50] prophecy to be fulfilled
[30:51] but guess what that prophet is prophecy
[30:54] is going to be fulfilled because he's
[30:55] coming through the eastern easter gate
[30:58] and for us what is this this is the
[31:00] revelation of his
[31:02] coming many times we speak about the
[31:05] seals and what is this at the end you
[31:08] know the seventh seal is bringing christ
[31:10] down to earth
[31:12] that is what the seventh seal is because
[31:14] when there was when the opening of the
[31:16] seven seal happened there was silence in
[31:17] heaven all the worship they stopped in
[31:20] heaven and why did either stop in heaven
[31:23] if it is stopping in heaven then where
[31:25] is christ
[31:27] where is christ now
[31:30] he was descending
[31:32] and i can tell you we're not longer
[31:34] waiting for for he he's coming for sure
[31:37] he's coming in a physical way but we
[31:39] have seen his appearing 1963 he
[31:42] descended that's what we have this
[31:43] picture that's what happened there
[31:47] but we're waiting to leave these
[31:49] dimensions because god is already here
[31:53] that's what we're saying that he is not
[31:56] like he's good that he's above us he's
[31:59] good that he's with us but i want him to
[32:01] beat me and if he is in me what does
[32:03] that mean that he is already here
[32:07] isn't that simple
[32:10] then the prophet in the message the
[32:12] rapture he says but to the church
[32:14] the bride
[32:15] the rapture
[32:17] is a revelation to her
[32:20] it has to be revealed to her
[32:22] in other words a personal revelation of
[32:25] his coming is found at this gate
[32:28] remember the rapture is a revelation to
[32:30] the heart of the believer
[32:33] you must repair and open this gate so
[32:36] you can see his coming
[32:40] amen
[32:41] now we go to another gate
[32:43] number 10.
[32:46] so he come through the east gate that's
[32:48] the revelation of his coming
[32:50] and then now we go to the mythcat
[32:53] gate
[32:57] after him prepare malka malkaya the
[32:59] goldsmith song
[33:01] onto the place of the nephilims and of
[33:03] the merchants over against the gate
[33:05] mythcat and to the going up of the
[33:07] corner
[33:08] in other versions and i think it's verse
[33:11] 2 32 it's talking about that he is going
[33:14] not not going up to the corner but he's
[33:16] talking about an upper room
[33:18] i don't know why he's there but he was
[33:20] there amen
[33:21] so
[33:25] this is the inspection gate
[33:27] this is the verification gate
[33:30] this is the gate of the appointed time
[33:34] this is the gate of adoption time
[33:37] amen
[33:38] and i was reading about this gate and
[33:40] this is the gate that led to the mount
[33:43] of olives
[33:45] what happened in the mount of olives is
[33:46] where gethsemane was and is also jesus
[33:50] he had to come to the mount of through
[33:52] this gate
[33:54] and then when he goes to the mount of
[33:55] olives you know he was very in
[33:58] gethsemane before before he went
[34:00] uh to the cross and also
[34:03] what in the book of acts it talks that
[34:06] he went back to these uh to to get to
[34:09] the mount of olives so he had to go
[34:11] through this gate in other words he had
[34:12] to be verified he had to be tested to
[34:15] make sure that he was the christ
[34:17] that his will was broken when he said
[34:20] father let not my will be but that will
[34:22] be done
[34:23] in other words when he was verified he
[34:25] was found
[34:26] perfect
[34:29] that's why every time you can go back to
[34:31] this gate lord a verification time
[34:34] it's a testing time his adoption time is
[34:36] a it's a it's an appointed time
[34:39] now notice here when jesus was baptized
[34:43] matthew 3 17 it says in law a voice from
[34:46] heaven saying this is my beloved son in
[34:48] whom i am well pleased that's it
[34:52] but now
[34:54] after
[34:55] this was brother i was preaching on
[34:56] sunday when adoption time came and jesus
[34:59] transfigured himself before peter james
[35:03] and john three words were added
[35:06] i'm not only dwelling in him but now he
[35:09] says well yeah well he had spake behold
[35:12] a bright cloud overshadowed them and
[35:14] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[35:16] said this is my beloved son in whom i am
[35:19] well pleased he repeats the same words
[35:21] but he doesn't stay there he's like hear
[35:23] ye him
[35:27] there was a change in dispensation now
[35:30] you can hear him because he's an adopted
[35:32] son
[35:34] amen the son and we can say this the son
[35:37] in nothing differs from his master until
[35:40] they appoint it appointed time what was
[35:43] in this instance it was the appointed
[35:45] time to christ to show himself to them
[35:48] that it was not only the prophets
[35:51] or not only the law moses it was not
[35:53] only elijah the prophet no it was our
[35:56] everything about him everything about
[35:58] jesus
[36:00] and now he's telling us hear he him in
[36:03] other words now he is an adopted son
[36:06] galatians 4 1. now i say that the heir
[36:09] as long as he is a child deferred
[36:11] nothing from a servant
[36:14] though he be lord of all but he's under
[36:17] tutors and governors until the time
[36:19] appointed of the father
[36:22] that's what we were saying like there
[36:23] has to be a gate where somebody has to
[36:25] be appointed where somebody has to be
[36:27] adopted
[36:30] even so when we were children we were in
[36:32] bondage under the elements of he of the
[36:34] world but when the fullness of the time
[36:37] was come god sent forth his son made of
[36:40] a woman made under the law
[36:44] to redeem them that where under the law
[36:47] that we might receive the adoption of
[36:49] sons
[36:51] and because we are sons god has sent for
[36:53] the spirit of his son on into your
[36:55] hearts crying father father abba father
[37:00] that's us now he's sent he's telling us
[37:03] that when we go through this gate we are
[37:05] going to be adopted
[37:07] and are we in an adoption process yes we
[37:10] are
[37:11] so every day we can go and say lord how
[37:13] is my my adoption gate going
[37:17] verification time
[37:19] when when the tutor will come and check
[37:21] the sun and they're like you know what
[37:23] [Music]
[37:24] his thoughts today were not the best
[37:28] you know he just say a white lie today
[37:33] brother paul said one time he's like he
[37:35] just cheated on his taxes
[37:37] this year
[37:40] give to caesar what is to caesar
[37:47] it's an adoption time it's an
[37:50] appointment appointed time what is
[37:52] unappointed time is like
[37:54] a specific date
[37:56] a specific hour
[37:59] that is that option when they somebody's
[38:01] going to be adopted they said the court
[38:03] day and and that child is looking
[38:06] forward
[38:08] for that adoption because he's like you
[38:09] know that this day this hour
[38:12] this is in this specific location i'm
[38:15] gonna be receiving a name
[38:19] that's in the natural
[38:20] how much more us
[38:23] he's given us his word
[38:25] that now we have received we are in that
[38:28] appointed time in the days of the voice
[38:30] of the seven angel but he didn't stay
[38:32] there now he's like
[38:34] prophesying and speak again john
[38:37] who is he talking there about and he's
[38:39] now he's talking about us
[38:41] that's the appointed time for us i will
[38:43] say now you have to go and take the book
[38:46] and read the book
[38:48] it will be
[38:49] sweet in your mouth but then it's going
[38:51] to be bitter in your belly but if it is
[38:53] bitter it's going to bring good things
[38:56] amen
[38:58] an appointed time
[38:59] now you can say father father now you're
[39:02] not that far from me because
[39:04] your your third or your holy spirit now
[39:06] is checking my heart and now he can give
[39:09] a testimony today he obey your word
[39:12] today he went to church today he had a
[39:15] good heart do your work today he was
[39:18] able to produce the fruits that you want
[39:20] him to produce
[39:23] amen
[39:28] and i like this quote from from the
[39:29] prophet possessing the enemy's gates it
[39:32] says was only a few years later when the
[39:34] trials come and the church got all shook
[39:36] up and it's so easy for a congregation
[39:38] of people to do when something
[39:40] something doesn't seem to happen the way
[39:42] that it is supposed to be
[39:44] but god
[39:45] makes it that way
[39:49] god brings tensions into the church
[39:53] every son that cometh to god must be
[39:55] tried and proven and tested
[39:59] he let sickness strikes you
[40:02] he lets
[40:03] diseases come in you
[40:05] to test you and to prove you to show the
[40:08] world that you are truly the seed of
[40:12] abraham
[40:14] i lord
[40:15] i that sounds i
[40:17] ouch but a mentally work
[40:22] but he permitted by his own will
[40:26] he permits disasters how many have
[40:28] experienced at disasters and thanks lord
[40:30] at work at home in the kids school
[40:34] he permits the friends to turn against
[40:37] you
[40:40] he permits all these things and turns
[40:43] the devil loose
[40:44] to tempt you and he will do all but take
[40:48] your life
[40:49] he can do everything but he cannot take
[40:51] your life
[40:52] that's what he told satan when satan was
[40:55] before before him he's like you give him
[40:56] everything he has everything but he said
[40:58] well just
[40:59] you can take everything but you cannot
[41:01] touch the his life
[41:03] you cannot touch the wine you cannot
[41:05] touch the oil
[41:12] he could turn your he will throw you on
[41:14] a bit of affliction
[41:18] he will turn your neighbors against you
[41:22] he could turn your church the church
[41:25] against you
[41:27] he can do most most anything and it is
[41:30] god's will for him to do it
[41:32] but we are thought that it is more
[41:34] precious than gold to us
[41:37] in if we can say it this way what's
[41:39] going on what's happening here he's
[41:41] letting these trials is this these uh uh
[41:45] beating if we can say that way why
[41:47] because he wants to see where we are
[41:49] standing
[41:50] he wants to see how we are going to
[41:52] react
[41:54] and when you react the right way gets
[41:56] the i can say i can say that there is
[41:58] victory and i have experienced that not
[41:59] long ago i was talking to brother
[42:01] brandon about it
[42:02] there was victory there
[42:04] and i can say that i was going through
[42:06] that inspection gate and i pass
[42:14] he will allow us to go through
[42:15] situations to show that we are gold
[42:17] but i can say oh lord as many times i
[42:19] have to as i have to be inspected pass
[42:22] me by the filter of your word
[42:25] that's what we need every day pass
[42:27] yourself through the filter of the word
[42:29] if you're if you are lacking something
[42:31] you say lord help me help me help me go
[42:33] back lord help me go back in and restore
[42:36] the things that needs to be that needs
[42:37] to be restored
[42:40] then the baptism of the holy spirit will
[42:42] always open a way you know when you
[42:44] receive the holy spirit it does we
[42:46] wouldn't say just like that you have to
[42:47] encounter you have to meet the very
[42:50] person of jesus christ
[42:53] what is next
[42:55] after we go we're going through that
[42:57] verification gate now we're going
[42:59] through something else
[43:01] now we've got we're going through the
[43:02] efrain gate
[43:06] what is this so the people went forth
[43:08] and brought them and made themselves
[43:10] boots and every one upon the roof of his
[43:13] house and in the courts and in the
[43:14] courts of the house of god and in the
[43:16] street of the watergate and in the
[43:18] street of the gate of ephraim
[43:21] what is this
[43:22] this is the gate of double portion this
[43:25] is the gate of double fruitfulness
[43:28] after you have been adopted you are
[43:30] given the birth right
[43:34] amen as we're talking that child when he
[43:36] goes to the courthouse after he he
[43:39] he he came out without a name but when
[43:42] he goes out and you know he belongs to
[43:44] the state but after he's adopted now the
[43:46] child has a name
[43:48] now the child has a family and the
[43:50] scripture says that we have received his
[43:53] name and is as the the the name that is
[43:56] above all names and that all the
[43:58] families of this earth
[44:00] can receive that name and that is the
[44:02] name that is above all names the name of
[44:04] our lord jesus christ
[44:06] so this is where you are receiving a
[44:09] double portion
[44:10] look at what caleb said he says caleb
[44:13] was a faithful dog and he was a gentile
[44:15] he had a different spirit he wasn't
[44:17] looking at the problems he was looking
[44:19] at the promise and he was like you know
[44:22] what give me my mountain
[44:25] i i i my strength you know i was 40 days
[44:28] 40 years old and that was my strength
[44:29] but now i'm 80 and i have the same
[44:32] strength i have the same willingness to
[44:34] keep serving the lord
[44:38] now look at elijah he got a local
[44:40] portion why why elijah got out of the
[44:42] whole portion he told elijah
[44:44] you i want a double portion of your
[44:46] spirit
[44:47] and elijah told him if you see me when
[44:49] i'm taking from you then you're gonna
[44:50] get a double portion and what was that
[44:52] double portion he he he saw uh
[44:56] elijah leaving so that was a portion of
[44:58] rapture
[45:00] and also he crossed the jordan so that
[45:02] was a portion of what of resurrection
[45:05] that was his double portion he saw
[45:07] rapture he saw the rapture and he saw
[45:10] the resurrection
[45:11] when you go through this skate you have
[45:13] to receive double portions how many won
[45:15] a double portion tonight
[45:19] and the and the birthright belongs to us
[45:21] by the election of god
[45:23] you know ephraim became the firstborn by
[45:25] election
[45:27] and what happened in israel stretched
[45:29] out his right hand and laid upon
[45:31] ephraim's head who was the younger in
[45:33] his left hand upon
[45:35] manessa's head and guiding his hands
[45:37] willingly but for manis it was
[45:40] manasseh was the firstborn
[45:42] and then verse 20 he says and he blessed
[45:44] them that day saying in this show israel
[45:47] blessed saying god make thee us a frame
[45:50] in us
[45:51] and he said ephraim before menace
[45:55] why
[45:57] the prophet of god says from the jews
[45:59] the oldest the first chosen of god
[46:01] through the cross
[46:02] come to the blessing but come the
[46:04] blessing back to who to the gentiles
[46:08] he cross it
[46:12] and here we are
[46:15] back to the gentiles to to get the bride
[46:18] blessing come through the cross that's
[46:20] why we have to go to the cross
[46:22] from the jew to the gentiles rejected
[46:24] they rejected the cross therefore he got
[46:26] the gentile bride
[46:30] when god went to the gentiles he blended
[46:32] keep lining the eyes of the jews you
[46:35] know i was i was thinking if you have
[46:38] like like a visual here when when uh
[46:41] naomi was there and ruth was there and
[46:43] then
[46:44] when boaz went to ruth the gentile he he
[46:47] was kind of blind in their the eyes of
[46:49] all all of them and he kind of was blind
[46:52] in them and then he was telling rude
[46:53] okay go ahead go ahead pass it go go for
[46:55] it go for it
[46:57] and that's what he did for us he blinded
[46:59] the the eyes of of the gentle people or
[47:02] i mean the jewish people why so because
[47:04] we needed to come
[47:06] he crossed the blessing
[47:10] he said god crossed my hands
[47:12] taking it from the older son
[47:15] the law and put it over on christ
[47:18] and and and through that come through
[47:20] the cross come the change of the
[47:22] birthright amen to the younger son
[47:24] was that third well it was his election
[47:29] in christ is the mystery of god reveal
[47:31] and he was put on a tree of disgrace
[47:34] of course is that is he that hang on a
[47:36] tree because of become a curse for the
[47:38] human race
[47:40] and now he brings forth
[47:42] he didn't just stay there he just went
[47:44] to the to the cross in vain he went to
[47:46] the cross because there had to be
[47:48] somebody else that needed to come
[47:50] and that was when he was crossing that
[47:52] blessing that blessing was for us
[47:54] and it came through this gate
[47:57] and he brings forth what a bright tree
[48:01] which will be the tree of life restored
[48:03] back to him
[48:06] as a husband and wife in the garden of
[48:08] eden her glory to god
[48:10] by the same word and the same god made
[48:13] manifest in husband and wife the same
[48:15] bride the tree the same bright tree back

[48:20] and he doesn't stay just there we're
[48:23] gonna go to the last one
[48:27] miff cut gate a friend gate double
[48:30] portion
[48:31] now we we're going to the prison gate
[48:36] and from above the gate of ephraim and
[48:38] above the old gate and above the fish
[48:39] gate in the tower the tower of hanonel
[48:42] and the tower of maya even onto the ship
[48:44] gate and they stood still in the prison
[48:47] gate
[48:49] what is this gate
[48:50] you have become a prisoner of christ
[48:53] once you become his you are no longer
[48:56] your own
[48:57] you are his love slave
[49:01] lord pass me through this gate as many
[49:03] times as you want
[49:05] because i'm no longer on my own
[49:07] now i'm yours hundred percent more
[49:10] thousand percent
[49:13] and
[49:15] paul
[49:17] talking to philemon he says paul a
[49:18] prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our
[49:21] brother
[49:22] unto philemon our dearly beloved and
[49:25] fellow laborer but now paul is like you
[49:28] know what i've gone through this gate
[49:29] and now i'm a prisoner of christ
[49:33] amen
[49:35] then in the book of psalms 102 18-21 it
[49:38] says this shall be written for the right
[49:40] generations to come and the people who
[49:42] shall be created shall praise the lord
[49:44] this is a psalmist is prophesying
[49:46] something of a people that shall come a
[49:49] generation that is to come which where
[49:51] is that generation
[49:52] that generation shall praise the lord
[49:54] for he had looked down from the height
[49:57] of his sanctuary from heaven did the
[49:59] lord behold the earth to hear
[50:02] the groaning of the prisoner
[50:05] so if you're a prisoner of christ he's
[50:07] hearing your groaning
[50:12] not just there to lose those that are
[50:14] appointed to death
[50:18] the the the one that was the hated one
[50:21] now became the beloved one
[50:23] to declare the name of the lord in zion
[50:27] and his praise in jerusalem
[50:30] amen
[50:32] now zechariah chapter 9 verse 12 turn
[50:35] you to the stronghold ye prisoners of
[50:38] hope
[50:39] even today do i declare that i will
[50:42] render double unto thee
[50:44] or that i will restore everything you
[50:48] know and what as we were talking last
[50:50] wednesday this is the work of the lord
[50:52] that's why he says i will this
[50:54] i will restore i will go and i will go
[50:58] and to prepare a place he's talking
[51:00] about the i am
[51:01] i will go i will do it i have started a
[51:04] good work in your life and i will finish
[51:06] the work in the day of the lord
[51:09] what is all of this
[51:11] the ship gate
[51:13] praise the lord everything is in there
[51:14] for us to put in practice may we check
[51:17] every gate every lock every bar
[51:20] we must make sure everything is restored
[51:24] this is not a 12-step
[51:26] process this is a cycle that at any time
[51:29] we can go back and check the condition
[51:31] of our hearts gates
[51:34] if you can go back and you know david
[51:36] when he in the psalm he's talking
[51:38] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[51:44] in other words you know his game
[51:46] was there but he needed some repair
[51:49] he needed some restoration
[51:52] so which gate for you tonight will be
[51:54] like lord it needs some painting it
[51:57] needs some refurbish
[52:00] he's gonna hurt but he's praise the lord
[52:02] for that
[52:05] we can put it this way the process of
[52:07] redemption has started in you before the
[52:10] foundation of the world
[52:12] and as we started with the ship gate
[52:14] where we spoke about the salvation and
[52:16] the sacrifice he made for us
[52:18] and then he brought us to the fish gate
[52:20] what is that where the lord wants us to
[52:22] give testimony that he is alive
[52:25] but he didn't leave us there then we
[52:26] went to the old gate and where he wants
[52:29] us to have that old pentecostal
[52:31] experience the real one
[52:33] that can come and change our lives
[52:36] then he sent us back to the valley gate
[52:39] and what is the valley gate that demand
[52:41] from us humility to be exalted as he was
[52:44] exalted
[52:46] then he brought us to the don gate from
[52:48] where all worldliness must go by but not
[52:51] stay there
[52:53] then he brought us to the fountain gate
[52:56] which is the holy spirit coming and
[52:58] sealing our lives until the day of our
[52:59] redemption
[53:01] and then we went to the watergate
[53:03] that is a that is the importance of
[53:05] revelation in our lives
[53:07] without faith it is impossible to please
[53:10] god
[53:11] and then after giving us revelation he
[53:13] brings us to the horse gate and what is
[53:15] the horse gate is the quickening power
[53:18] quickening that seed that he has already
[53:20] placed in our hearts
[53:22] and he didn't leave us there now he
[53:24] wants us to understand and now he wants
[53:27] us to brings us to the easter gate where
[53:30] we can see him face to face
[53:33] and then he brings us to the
[53:35] verification gate
[53:37] where is the time for us to do
[53:39] inspection in in our lives
[53:42] then the gate of ephraim where he has
[53:45] chosen the gentiles and giving them a
[53:47] double portion
[53:49] them that
[53:50] what
[53:51] the jews rejected
[53:53] he gave it to us and finally he makes us
[53:57] prisoners of his love
[54:00] in the prison gate

[54:05] that he didn't leave anything out
