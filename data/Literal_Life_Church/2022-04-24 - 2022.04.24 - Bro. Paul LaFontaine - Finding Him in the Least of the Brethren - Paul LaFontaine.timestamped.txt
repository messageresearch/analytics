[0:00] angels with him
[0:01] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[0:03] glory and before him shall be gathered
[0:06] all nations and he shall separate them
[0:09] one from another
[0:10] as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
[0:13] the goats and he shall set the sheep on
[0:15] his right hand but the goats on the left
[0:18] then shall the king say unto them
[0:21] on his right hand come
[0:23] ye blessed of my father inherit the
[0:26] kingdom prepared for you from the
[0:28] foundation of the world
[0:30] for i have a hundred hungered and you
[0:33] gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave
[0:36] me drink
[0:37] i was a stranger and you took me in now
[0:41] notice jesus is using this he's using
[0:44] the word i
[0:45] and as if he was the one that's hungered
[0:48] he's the ones that's thirsty in these
[0:50] conditions he's saying i was hungry you
[0:53] gave me me i was thirsty and you gave me
[0:55] a drink
[0:56] i was a stranger and you took me in
[0:58] naked and ye clothed me i was sick and
[1:01] you visited me i was in prison and you
[1:04] came unto me
[1:06] then shall the righteous answer him
[1:08] saying lord
[1:09] when saw we thee a hundred hungered and
[1:12] fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
[1:15] when saw we thee a stranger and took
[1:17] thee in or naked and clothed thee or
[1:20] when saw we thee sick or in prison and
[1:23] came unto thee and the king shall answer
[1:26] and say unto them
[1:28] verily i say unto you in so much as ye
[1:31] have done it unto
[1:32] one of the least of these
[1:34] my brethren
[1:37] ye have done it unto me amen heavenly
[1:41] father
[1:42] we're grateful to be in your house today
[1:44] and there's something lord so
[1:47] powerful in all these themes that we
[1:50] sing about and we worship with lord
[1:53] they're not just songs but they're
[1:54] themes that come from an experience that
[1:58] we've had with you
[2:00] lord it's one thing to sing about
[2:02] something it's one thing to read the
[2:04] word and
[2:05] to read the stories in the bible it's
[2:08] another thing lord where we're living
[2:10] out what the bible says
[2:12] we're experiencing lord some things even
[2:14] that you went through
[2:16] and lord even this week i see that i can
[2:18] look to your example and know how to
[2:20] respond to certain things that i go
[2:22] through because lord we're living out
[2:24] those pages in our own lives i thank you
[2:27] lord that we can come and have this
[2:29] place to learn of you
[2:31] to sit quietly lord and just have you
[2:34] speak
[2:35] to let you do your eternal work or
[2:37] through the gospel preaching
[2:39] lord i'm thankful that we're still
[2:42] knowing that your holy spirit is calling
[2:45] souls this morning we're thankful for
[2:46] that and lord if you're calling may we
[2:49] all respond to the call
[2:52] lord jesus we pray you'll bless the word
[2:54] anoint it father and may we learn of you
[2:56] this morning as we commit the service
[2:58] and the souls here in your hands
[3:01] in jesus name amen
[3:04] amen god bless you may be seated
[3:14] last sunday easter sunday we
[3:17] were very blessed to be able to
[3:20] see
[3:21] mary magdalene and to see the
[3:24] the special place
[3:26] that god gave mary magdalene
[3:29] and that special calling or that special
[3:31] place that he gave her
[3:33] kind of surprised us all i never looked
[3:35] at it that way maybe you had before
[3:37] but we were very blessed and very
[3:40] surprised to see who it was
[3:43] the least likely person
[3:46] at the end at the very closing hours of
[3:49] jesus earthly journey and just before
[3:52] the the resurrection
[3:54] the least likely person at the end
[3:56] got to got the first view of his glory
[3:59] in the resurrection the least likely
[4:02] person
[4:03] and
[4:04] it's not because that mary magdalene was
[4:06] better
[4:07] or it's not because she had a good past
[4:10] because she did not have a good past
[4:13] it's not because that she had done
[4:15] anything better than the disciples
[4:18] it's not because of any of her merit
[4:20] it's not because of any of her
[4:21] background
[4:22] uh
[4:23] it wasn't because any of that it was
[4:25] just god's grace and god's mercy but it
[4:28] teaches us something that god is not a
[4:30] god of position and rank
[4:33] and how much you do or how little you do
[4:36] or we how many know that this gospel is
[4:39] not based upon how many works you do to
[4:42] gain entrance into the kingdom and god
[4:44] doesn't judge you according to your
[4:46] works can you say man
[4:49] god does not look at things that way and
[4:51] this is an example that surprised us to
[4:53] see her to be able to view the glory of
[4:55] god as the first one in the resurrection
[4:58] not because she was better or she had a
[5:00] great past but i believe was because she
[5:02] was just simply focused on the right
[5:05] thing
[5:07] mary magdalene in the closing hours of
[5:09] jesus life was focused on the right
[5:12] thing and incidentally the other
[5:14] disciples were not focused on the right
[5:16] thing
[5:17] they were focused on their carnality
[5:19] they were focused focused on losing
[5:21] jesus they weren't focused on the
[5:23] promise and i don't know how much
[5:24] revelation that mary had but she had
[5:26] enough of her that she wanted to stay
[5:28] close to the lord stay close to his body
[5:30] even though he had already
[5:32] passed on as what we know it it was a
[5:35] lifeless body but she she was focused on
[5:37] the right thing and she was faithful to
[5:40] the right thing and she was staying
[5:42] close to the right thing i wonder if god
[5:45] looks at it that way it's not so much
[5:47] that we have a lot of works to bring to
[5:49] him but that we in this closing hours
[5:52] and how many believe we're in the
[5:53] closing hours of time
[5:55] that we would be focused on the correct
[5:57] thing that we would be faithful to the
[6:00] right thing that we would stay close to
[6:03] the right thing
[6:05] and to not judge ourselves someone was
[6:07] asking for prayer last week is that they
[6:09] continually be beat up by the enemy and
[6:12] beat themselves up that i'm not doing
[6:14] enough and i don't seem to be enough
[6:15] doing enough to please the lord and the
[6:17] devil's always doing that but when it
[6:20] comes to god's grace friends god is not
[6:22] judging by our works but i wonder if
[6:24] it's just as simple as mary magdalene
[6:27] she just basically focused on the right
[6:29] thing at the right hour she was focused
[6:31] on the right thing how many would raise
[6:33] your hand this morning say god in these
[6:35] closing seconds of time don't let me be
[6:38] diverted by anything of this world don't
[6:41] let me try to work my way into heaven
[6:43] but lord let me just be focused on the
[6:45] right thing and let me be faithful and
[6:48] consistent
[6:50] to you lord
[6:52] even when it looks like the lord's gone
[6:54] and it looks hopeless let me be faithful
[6:56] anyway can i get an amen even it looks
[6:59] like that's why the other disciples
[7:00] they're disappointed i'm going back to
[7:02] my career i'm going back to this but
[7:04] there was something about harrison even
[7:06] though his body was dead i'm going to
[7:08] stay faithful to him i'm going to stay
[7:11] close to him
[7:13] even though this tragedy has happened in
[7:15] my life i'm going to stay consistent
[7:17] with the lord
[7:18] i'm going to can you say i'm going to
[7:20] stay coming to church i'm going to stay
[7:22] close to him
[7:24] even though i might not feel him right
[7:26] now i'm going to stay close to him
[7:28] because when jesus body was dead he
[7:30] couldn't touch her like he used to he
[7:32] couldn't lay his hands on her like like
[7:34] he used to it was a lifeless body but
[7:37] nevertheless something in her said
[7:39] listen he raised me up one day there was
[7:41] something in him that raised me out of
[7:43] my dirty life it raised me something
[7:46] raised me up
[7:47] there's something about this man
[7:49] and even though he's dead i know there's
[7:51] resurrection power in that
[7:57] i want to stay close to the right thing
[7:59] like she did can you say man
[8:01] because if he could raise and raise her
[8:03] life out of sin that he could do more
[8:05] so the least of the followers of jesus
[8:08] got written
[8:10] in the story of the resurrection the
[8:13] least of the followers of jesus
[8:16] got written in the story
[8:19] of the resurrection i'll tell you don't
[8:21] let my name be in anything else
[8:24] except for let it be in the closing
[8:26] hours at resurrection time let my name
[8:28] be attached to that and let me be in
[8:30] that resurrection
[8:34] my name don't have to be in lights
[8:35] they're not anyway but my name don't
[8:37] have to go i don't care i don't have to
[8:39] be invited to another convention i'm
[8:41] perfectly happy just to preach the
[8:43] gospel here to my own people this
[8:44] morning and serve the lord i am so happy
[8:47] to be
[8:48] here and just feeling his presence with
[8:50] you
[8:52] i don't need my name out i don't even
[8:54] know i just want my name attached to the
[8:56] lord
[8:58] i want to be close to him
[9:00] so it's it's it's she was chosen the
[9:03] least of the followers how many of you
[9:05] kids or how many of you adults
[9:07] experience uh when the team got chosen
[9:10] brother tom was just talking about this
[9:11] the other day when the team is lined up
[9:14] there and all the people are lined up
[9:16] and you're going to choose them it's
[9:17] kind of the worst way to do it
[9:19] to choose them out because somebody
[9:21] always ends up the last one
[9:24] and you can't help but judge there's a
[9:26] reason that they were chosen last
[9:29] they just don't have what it takes they
[9:31] don't have the talent so how many would
[9:33] say i'm one of those because i'm raising
[9:35] my hand right away i was the young
[9:38] redhead that was chosen last most the
[9:41] time
[9:42] so there's three or four of us come on
[9:43] be honest now
[9:45] and there's nothing worse than that
[9:46] feeling is that that that coach or that
[9:48] person goes through i'll take you and
[9:50] then the other team says i'll take you
[9:52] and i'll choose you i'll choose you and
[9:54] it keeps going down and you're looking
[9:55] around and going and it's becoming more
[9:57] lonely all the time
[10:01] and all of a sudden you're the last one
[10:03] there and you're chosen
[10:05] you are chosen but you're the last one
[10:07] chosen
[10:09] it's not fun
[10:12] but it's terrible but
[10:14] but the surprise
[10:16] in god's choosing
[10:19] is he
[10:20] picks the least
[10:22] first
[10:27] in god's kingdom he and i can show you
[10:29] other examples in scripture he he seems
[10:31] to choose the least uh the least that
[10:35] would have the credibility for it or
[10:37] that would have the background for it or
[10:39] that would have what the what they need
[10:41] for it and that's when you're playing
[10:42] baseball or volleyball these different
[10:44] things you're being judged about your
[10:46] talent and so you're the last one to get
[10:48] chosen because you don't have what it
[10:49] takes like the other ones have and the
[10:51] coaches are choosing based upon i got to
[10:53] get this done so i'm choosing the very
[10:55] best of the best based on that but when
[10:56] we come into the kingdom of god then god
[10:59] looks at character god looks at what he
[11:01] needs god looks at somebody teachable
[11:03] and you could take somebody you don't
[11:04] have a clue about volleyball and you can
[11:06] start teaching them all of a sudden
[11:08] within a few months probably under the
[11:10] care of brother tom or somebody like
[11:11] that they can excel everybody else in
[11:14] volleyball and surprise everybody
[11:17] did anybody do that when you were in
[11:19] school did you do that not really
[11:24] but in the kingdom he chooses even
[11:27] even though you would think think like
[11:29] you're the worst player
[11:31] even though you would think like you're
[11:32] the worst christian
[11:34] the thing about it is is that this coach
[11:37] he sees
[11:39] your potential
[11:42] he sees what you will become
[11:46] and so
[11:47] we find this in other places in the
[11:49] bible um
[11:51] related to the end time and i'm going to
[11:53] reference a couple of them today related
[11:55] to the end times related to the last
[11:57] closing hours we see other examples
[12:00] where
[12:01] of god's choosing and also we see the
[12:03] least of the brother and that's kind of
[12:05] my theme this morning finding him and
[12:07] the least of the brother and we find
[12:09] that at the end there's a choosing
[12:11] there's a there's a choosing the least
[12:12] of the brother and god emphasizing that
[12:15] and we find other places related to the
[12:17] end and so one of the one of them i'll
[12:19] reference right now and that's the
[12:20] parable of the wedding invitation given
[12:22] by the king jesus talks about there was
[12:24] a king he sent out invitations to a
[12:27] wedding feast and so we we find that the
[12:30] who was chosen first is the normal
[12:32] people to be chosen the normal ones that
[12:35] get would get an invitation to this
[12:36] wedding and this wedding feast and so he
[12:39] sends out the invitation and and uh and
[12:42] so uh then and brother branham deals
[12:44] with this and is your life worthy he
[12:46] talks about it and he references how
[12:48] jesus said there was invitations that
[12:50] went out to the normal people and all of
[12:53] a sudden the normal people begin to make
[12:55] excuses
[12:57] it says i i'm too busy i can't come i've
[13:00] got this to do and i've got that to do
[13:02] and an invitation has come to this great
[13:04] weapon and it's a great privilege and
[13:06] honor to be invited to this king's feast
[13:08] but and it used to be an honor to some
[13:10] of these people it used to be an honor
[13:12] to be invited to this king this is
[13:14] pretty important and so it used to be
[13:16] top priority but something happened in
[13:19] their lives that it's not a priority
[13:21] more i can take it or leave it it's at
[13:23] the bottom of the list now because their
[13:25] lives have become busy
[13:30] i'm prepared for no amens their life had
[13:32] become so busy where the invitation to
[13:35] the king's feasts was not quite as at
[13:38] the top of the priority as it used to be
[13:41] so the bible says they all with one
[13:43] accord begin to make excuses i have
[13:46] bought a piece of land i need to go view
[13:49] that i need to look at the closing
[13:50] papers i need to view that i just i
[13:53] can't make it i can't come i've got this
[13:55] and the other one says i've purchased a
[13:57] cow a big cow and that's going to bring
[14:00] beef for my family and it's going to be
[14:02] great for me and i've got to go and i've
[14:04] got that appointment set at that date so
[14:05] i'm not going to be able to make that
[14:07] invitation and they made an excuse of
[14:09] that and this is the subject now is is
[14:11] your life worthy is your life deserving
[14:14] of the invitation is your life
[14:16] responding that's worthy of the
[14:18] imitation you're getting
[14:21] the third one made an excuse i have
[14:23] married a wife
[14:26] and he's really the only one that
[14:28] had an inch of a
[14:31] value to his excuse
[14:34] just kidding
[14:39] so you can see
[14:41] those three things kind of cover all the
[14:43] stuff that we can be distracted by
[14:46] a wife
[14:48] the busyness of
[14:50] getting the cow the business the
[14:52] purchase of a piece of land
[14:55] but and all that is perfectly fine okay
[14:59] but when it makes you turn down the
[15:01] invitation
[15:06] amen
[15:07] that's another story
[15:09] these parables are for the end time
[15:12] because why we're headed to a marriage
[15:14] feast
[15:15] he invites you to a feast a wedding
[15:17] feast and so now we've come to the word
[15:19] the full opening of the word he's
[15:21] invited you to a feast he's invited you
[15:23] to the full word and then there's a
[15:24] marriage supper of the lamb this every
[15:26] time i preach i'm giving an invitation
[15:29] to you to come to this wedding feast
[15:32] every time i preach it's a calling to
[15:34] you can you say amen every time we meet
[15:36] together every time god you get in the
[15:38] word of god god is calling you he's
[15:40] inviting you can you say amen
[15:42] and so then what we have happened i've
[15:44] got to move along the story i've got a
[15:45] lot of hay on my fort today but you see
[15:47] now what happened is that the king said
[15:49] if they won't come he says i want you to
[15:52] go out i want you to get the lame the
[15:54] halt the sick all the ones out there
[15:56] that you can find and i want you to
[15:58] invite them those people to the wedding
[16:01] feast because the rest of them wouldn't
[16:02] come so i want you to go out and get
[16:04] others that surprise surprise they
[16:06] wouldn't normally be invited to the
[16:08] feast but the king says i'm going to
[16:11] invite them because of the excuses of
[16:13] other people
[16:15] don't be surprised if you keep turning
[16:17] down the lord that god fills your seat
[16:20] at this church
[16:22] with somebody very unlikely
[16:26] because remember brother ron spencer
[16:28] said something i believe it was the word
[16:30] of the lord and god is going to fill
[16:32] every one of these seats all the way to
[16:33] the front with a lot of people and
[16:36] prostitutes and people delivered of
[16:38] drugs and people delivered of alcohol
[16:41] god's gonna fill these seats with maybe
[16:43] not the normal people that we would
[16:45] think
[16:46] i wonder how you're gonna feel about
[16:48] that if you come and you can't find a
[16:49] seat yourself when you come once a month
[16:51] or whenever you come listen i wonder how
[16:53] you're going to feel i say it's under
[16:56] the scripture it's going to happen that
[16:57] way
[17:00] and then when they all came the halt
[17:02] it's kind of like a second bowl healing
[17:04] revival and brother brown uses the term
[17:06] there was three poles first to the
[17:08] normal the ones then the lame and the
[17:10] halt and then the third one he says i
[17:11] still have room for my feast he said now
[17:14] i want you to go out into the highways
[17:17] into the byways i just want you to go
[17:19] out and make the invitation to them
[17:22] so as servants they go out and the least
[17:25] the least expected to be invited now god
[17:29] at the end time starts to call them
[17:33] because a bunch of others turned it down
[17:36] it's in time scriptures
[17:38] and the people that will come
[17:40] in the third poll
[17:42] would be the least likely
[17:44] that would have been invited to this
[17:46] invitation
[17:48] can you say amen
[17:51] many
[17:53] every service you're being invited to
[17:55] the marriage supper of the lamb
[17:57] some feel they don't need it
[17:59] that they're different they're under a
[18:01] different category
[18:03] all this is fine brother paul but i'm
[18:04] under different rules
[18:06] i don't need to rsvp
[18:09] to this
[18:11] oh yes you
[18:12] do so they made excuses
[18:16] and god begins to fill it it still was
[18:18] not enough so god says i want you to
[18:20] call
[18:21] and i want you to call and and all the
[18:24] other people that rejected him
[18:26] all of a sudden these others from the
[18:28] highways and byways begin to come
[18:32] i'll reference another scripture of
[18:34] first samuel 22 and verse 2
[18:36] and these are the people in david's
[18:38] rejection who's a type of christ in
[18:40] david's rejection as a king when all the
[18:43] normal people the normal israel rejected
[18:45] him as king
[18:46] then this is what it says about the
[18:48] people that gathered around him and
[18:50] everyone that was in distress and
[18:53] everyone that was in debt and everyone
[18:56] that was discontented
[18:58] gathered themselves together unto david
[19:01] and he became a captain over them and
[19:04] there were with him about 400 men
[19:13] first corinthians 1 26 says for you see
[19:16] your calling brethren how that many wise
[19:19] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[19:21] many noble are called but god hath
[19:25] chosen the foolish things of the world
[19:28] to confound the wise and god had chosen
[19:31] the weak things of the world to confound
[19:34] the things which are mighty and base
[19:36] things of the world and things which are
[19:38] despised hath god
[19:41] chosen
[19:43] yea and things which are not to bring to
[19:46] not things that are that no flesh i'm
[19:49] going back to verse 27 but god has
[19:51] chosen the foolish things in verse 26
[19:53] for your see your calling brother and
[19:55] how that not many wise men after the
[19:57] flesh and so in other words in our view
[19:59] of who should be called it's different
[20:01] than what god would choose not you said
[20:03] not many wise men after the flesh not
[20:05] many mighty not many noble are called
[20:08] and then you jump to the end verse 28
[20:10] base things of the world things which
[20:12] are despised have god chosen yea and
[20:14] things which are not to bring not things
[20:16] that are that no flesh should glory in
[20:20] his presence
[20:22] there there is a a word of the lord i
[20:24] believe for you today to realize that at
[20:27] the end at the end no flesh no talents
[20:31] no gifts no position will glory or take
[20:35] any glory away from him he will choose
[20:39] based upon who he chooses and it will
[20:41] bring glory only to him
[20:47] but who he chooses
[20:49] is a surprise to us sometimes
[20:52] some of you were a surprise to all of us
[20:57] you don't have
[20:58] seniority because you grew up in the
[21:01] message
[21:02] you don't have position in the rapture
[21:05] because you grew up in the message
[21:07] or that you had a christian home can you
[21:09] say amen everybody needs a new birth
[21:12] everybody needs a relationship with
[21:13] jesus christ
[21:15] can you say amen and so god chooses not
[21:18] sometimes on the noble or the ones we
[21:21] but no no flesh and glory in his
[21:22] presence we glory in certain people we
[21:24] glory in certain things we choose based
[21:27] on certain things but at the end when
[21:29] all this is over he starts to choose
[21:31] ones that we would be surprised by
[21:33] because you see at the least of the
[21:35] brethren at the least of the brethren in
[21:38] the worst cases
[21:40] they come and they're delivered and god
[21:43] gets the glory
[21:48] become naked destitute
[21:50] look at the people
[21:52] that i read in the text
[21:54] there's the least of the brethren jesus
[21:56] called him his brother and but look at
[21:57] their condition
[21:59] it seems like it would be the elite
[22:01] because remember that's the bride he's
[22:02] speaking about and that it's the bride
[22:04] because the the the sheep that he had
[22:07] was actually the the
[22:09] not the bride but the ones who
[22:10] ministered and did good things to the
[22:12] bride
[22:13] but look look at who they are here's you
[22:15] think this is the elite people this is
[22:17] the people of god this is christ himself
[22:19] and the people but look at their look at
[22:21] their conditions
[22:23] naked
[22:25] destitute hungry thirsty
[22:28] that's the last ones who came
[22:34] i refer back now to matthew 24 and 25 if
[22:37] you have your bible open
[22:39] and i just have to give something we
[22:41] read uh wednesday night matthew 24. it's
[22:43] all of the
[22:45] end time events
[22:46] and i'll just go quickly for those who
[22:48] are know
[22:49] that the seven seals which the the the
[22:53] six the seven seals which revealed the
[22:55] history of the church and spiritually
[22:57] what was happening and runs all the way
[22:59] through the coming of the lord in the
[23:00] end of millennium all those things were
[23:02] revealed in the seals and and as we see
[23:04] then you can take and layer these seals
[23:06] right on top of matthew 24 as jesus
[23:09] asked questions about what will be the
[23:10] sign of the end time he begins to give
[23:13] all the characteristics of the signs of
[23:15] the end time you can read it when you
[23:16] get home and you could take all six
[23:19] seals and layer them on top of matthew
[23:22] 24 and the prophet does this for us he
[23:25] shows us those different attributes that
[23:26] are there that are being described is
[23:28] exactly the first horse rider the second
[23:30] horse rider the conditions that the
[23:32] church went through it's it's all laying
[23:34] there in matthew 24 and uh and then we
[23:37] get to matthew 25 so we're taught that
[23:40] the six seals are being expressed by
[23:42] jesus in matthew 24
[23:44] uh and then we know that the seventh
[23:46] seal is the coming of the lord the last
[23:49] seal is the coming of the lord and when
[23:52] they when when it comes to the day or
[23:54] the hour of his coming jesus said nobody
[23:58] knows that it's a secret it's a mystery
[24:00] jesus himself said he didn't even know
[24:03] the day or the hour
[24:05] so you pick it up in matthew 24 and
[24:07] verse
[24:08] 36 but of the day and hour knoweth no
[24:11] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[24:14] father only so that one statement shows
[24:17] us when we get to revelations eight and
[24:19] verse one and there's only one verse
[24:21] about the seventh seal uh
[24:23] and it just simply says behold there was
[24:25] silence in heaven for a space of a half
[24:27] hour so the seventh seal is a space of
[24:30] time but it's a complete secret secret
[24:32] there's not one symbol of it there's not
[24:34] one thing to show what it is because god
[24:36] completely hit it the day of the hour
[24:38] god completely healed the seventh seal
[24:42] and so
[24:43] i'm going somewhere with this i know
[24:44] you're wondering but i'm going somewhere
[24:46] so i want you just hold tight and so
[24:48] verse 36 the day of the hour knoweth no
[24:50] man not the angels of heaven but my
[24:52] father only so now but when when it's so
[24:55] specific in matthew 24 to give the
[24:58] conditions of each time during the seal
[25:00] and the tribulation period and all that
[25:02] but then when it breaks into the seventh
[25:04] it goes silent and it goes into parables
[25:07] because he's got to hide it again all
[25:09] right so that's what happens in matthew
[25:11] 25
[25:13] once you get to explaining the seventh
[25:15] seal you can't it breaks into mysterious
[25:18] parables
[25:19] it's not specific like the other seals
[25:21] and now we have the specifics of what
[25:23] the first six seals were in the
[25:26] revealing john
[25:27] now jesus said these things
[25:30] i got to take my time and qualify this
[25:32] jesus spoke of these things for the end
[25:34] time
[25:36] then john picks it up and he sees it all
[25:38] happening and he begins to write and he
[25:40] writes the first it was still in symbol
[25:42] but he writes it first seal and it's the
[25:45] first it was a white horse rider second
[25:47] seal red horse rider and he writes it
[25:49] all down and so now he's given the
[25:51] symbols of what the seals are but yet
[25:53] even when it was all done in revelations
[25:56] 10 he says seal up those things john
[25:59] seal them up in other words what the
[26:01] meaning of was each of those seals would
[26:03] still be sealed up until 2000 years
[26:06] later till our day he says that's when
[26:08] i'll release the meaning of each seal
[26:10] how many knows that
[26:12] so even though he wrote the symbols out
[26:14] and he says he's about to write he was
[26:16] about to write and he said no no no no
[26:18] we'll save it to the end time and i'll
[26:20] seal up all those things and we'll break
[26:22] it all forth in the end time and so then
[26:25] in revelations 10 it gives the the time
[26:27] frame of when he's going to do it in the
[26:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[26:33] when he shall begin to sound so that
[26:35] gives us the time frame so you'd have to
[26:38] find out if you're listening if you want
[26:40] to find out how he's going to use what
[26:42] vocal cords he's going to use for the
[26:44] lamb to break the seals in the end time
[26:46] you'd have to find out who the seventh
[26:48] angel is because the bible says that's
[26:50] who he's going to bring those seven
[26:52] thunders through
[26:54] and when it comes to seven thunders it's
[26:55] not going to be a symbol anymore it's
[26:57] going to be blasting out the voices of
[26:59] what the seals mean
[27:01] seven thunders right in a row bang bang
[27:03] bang bang bang voices thunders or voices
[27:06] thundering out blasting out what what
[27:09] the meaning of the seals
[27:12] he did it friends
[27:14] but when you get to the seventh seal
[27:16] brother branham starts to talk a little
[27:17] bit and he says now
[27:19] it says there's three parts to the sixth
[27:21] seal there's three purposes of the fifth
[27:22] seal there's three person purposes these
[27:25] are and there's three parts to the
[27:26] seventh and he says i seen the first one
[27:28] but i couldn't make out the weather
[27:29] because there's still a mystery behind
[27:32] this seventh seal that god didn't even
[27:34] show the prophet
[27:36] he said i looked across it there by
[27:37] vision and i just i just i couldn't make
[27:39] it out and he says i got in my notes
[27:42] stop right here
[27:43] because why
[27:44] if he lets it out
[27:46] satan can get a hold of it
[27:48] misinterpret it
[27:50] misdirect the people
[27:52] i'm leaving this alone and it's going to
[27:54] be here's how it's going to happen
[27:56] it's not going to be something that's
[27:57] written it's going to be something
[27:59] that's caught by revelation in the soul
[28:02] of the bride
[28:04] that's it
[28:06] she'll catch the revelation of the
[28:08] coming of the lord and she'll so catch
[28:11] it she knows what she needs to do to get
[28:13] ready for the coming of the lord she
[28:15] knows what she needed to have rapturing
[28:16] faith to be a part of the coming of the
[28:18] lord
[28:19] she's going to catch it
[28:21] i've held this secret i've not shown any
[28:23] man i didn't even sow jesus christ
[28:26] himself in his earth did not even know
[28:27] it
[28:29] because i'm holding it to the end time
[28:31] until right now
[28:33] when i burst those seven thunders forth
[28:35] and they keep echoing out and they keep
[28:37] the bride keeps feeding on it and keeps
[28:39] feeding on it it's gonna grow into a
[28:41] revelation of the resurrection it's
[28:44] going to break forth now the seventh
[28:45] seal is a span of time
[28:47] so
[28:48] i believe it be there's a beginning to
[28:50] it and there's a span of time he said
[28:51] that and so now just like the first
[28:53] coming of the lord was not just the one
[28:56] event of his birth but it was a it was
[28:58] many events together that was part of
[29:00] the first coming of the lord
[29:02] so the second coming is just not just
[29:03] the rapture but it's many events
[29:05] happening real close together
[29:08] so i can safely say to you because the
[29:11] thunders have were uttered because the
[29:13] mysteries have been revealed we're
[29:15] already in the first we're in the cycle
[29:19] of the coming of the lord
[29:21] we're living in the time of the seventh
[29:25] seal
[29:27] see why
[29:28] i don't feel my new body yet no
[29:31] but we're in the cycle of getting a new
[29:33] body
[29:38] so you say why in the world are you
[29:41] talking about this very important
[29:43] the seventh is the coming of the lord
[29:46] and so the seventh holds the mystery
[29:49] so matthew 24 deals with the six and
[29:52] then it goes into these parables there's
[29:54] a parable of the fig tree so now
[29:56] now when he comes to the seventh seal
[29:58] because i got to hide it now in a
[29:59] parable
[30:01] it'll be by revelation that they catch
[30:03] the parable the disciples ask him one
[30:05] day he says why do you speak in parables
[30:07] and he gave the reason he says because i
[30:09] speak in parables on some things because
[30:11] it is given to you to know the mysteries
[30:14] so it's given to a certain group to
[30:16] catch it by revelation so he doesn't
[30:18] throw it out there real plain he throws
[30:20] it in a parable because it can't come by
[30:22] just intellectual learning
[30:25] especially this mystery it cannot it
[30:28] will not come by intellectual learning
[30:30] so those are beating yourself up over i
[30:32] don't have enough knowledge of the
[30:34] message i don't have another knowledge
[30:35] of the scripture i'm not getting enough
[30:36] keep feeding on it keep reading on it
[30:38] can you say amen but don't you ever
[30:40] judge yourself by how much you have
[30:42] knowledge of this because especially
[30:44] this mystery will not be based upon some
[30:47] intellectual capacity that you have it
[30:50] will be a soul revelation
[30:53] once god thinks rapture and the bride
[30:56] connects with that sod it's a done deal
[31:02] oh my glory be to god
[31:05] it's not based upon theological learning
[31:08] how much you know of the message
[31:09] don't stop studying the message don't
[31:11] stop studying your bible
[31:13] because it's good to get those things in
[31:14] your mind that it can drop to your heart
[31:18] but he hides it because this will not be
[31:20] something that will be how much
[31:21] intellect you get through it this would
[31:23] be something different so he he puts it
[31:25] in parables it's given unto you to know
[31:28] the mysteries of the kingdom it's given
[31:30] but it's not given to some so that may
[31:32] be unfair to you but that's just the way
[31:34] it is because if god left it up to
[31:37] intellectual knowledge then anybody that
[31:39] was smarter than you could catch these
[31:41] things
[31:42] and god said i'm not setting it up based
[31:45] upon the smart catch it quicker than the
[31:47] dumb which i'll raise my hand i'm one of
[31:49] the dumb i my mind doesn't work like
[31:51] some of the high iq my iq is probably
[31:54] very low so thank god you know god
[31:56] didn't choose us based upon our iq
[31:59] that's not what this message is about
[32:00] can you say that thank god that i i
[32:03] can't preach things like a lot of other
[32:04] ministers in the message but i thank god
[32:06] for them i garner so much for it but i
[32:08] can't be them i got to be me and and i
[32:10] sometimes i get it simple but it's not
[32:12] based upon intellect it's based upon
[32:14] revelation and he's because if he didn't
[32:17] do that then a smarter person than you
[32:20] would make it in the rapture before you
[32:22] you might not even make it it was based
[32:24] upon intellect
[32:26] as i've said if it was based upon who
[32:28] was smart probably not a lot of you
[32:30] would make it in the rapture if it was
[32:31] based upon those who are good looking i
[32:35] wouldn't even make it
[32:38] and you that are laughing wouldn't have
[32:40] made it either
[32:42] thank god this isn't based upon what
[32:45] clothes i wear or how beautiful i look
[32:48] or how much intellect i have or how
[32:50] disciplined into my life thank god this
[32:53] is not based upon how disciplined i am
[32:55] in my christian walk thank god it's not
[32:58] based upon that thank god it's what
[33:00] brother joe is saying when we get to
[33:02] this i'll stand there by the grace of
[33:04] the lord
[33:08] i submit myself i read i pray i want to
[33:11] be better i told her brother a few weeks
[33:12] ago i said at breakfast i said i just
[33:14] still feel like i fail in the
[33:16] consistency in doing my devotions i want
[33:18] to get better and i am getting better
[33:20] but never judge yourself about that how
[33:22] much time you spend it's a relationship
[33:25] with the lord
[33:26] and you could be out camping and not
[33:28] even have your bible oh i forgot my
[33:30] bible and guess what you can talk to the
[33:33] lord and he can drop a revelation in
[33:35] your heart
[33:39] i'm glad this wasn't based upon
[33:41] choosing who the smartest was
[33:44] so because it's in parables we'll catch
[33:46] it by revelation so that
[33:48] no flesh glory is in his presence that
[33:50] somebody else doesn't make it and get
[33:51] chosen before you based upon their
[33:53] intellect so he's got the
[33:55] here we go you read your bible first one
[33:57] the parable of the fig tree which speaks
[33:59] about israel so now even though he says
[34:01] no man knows the day of the hour i'm
[34:03] going to lay some parables in i'm gonna
[34:05] lay some hints in
[34:09] it talks about the fig tree
[34:12] this generation don't pass till all
[34:13] these things will fulfill so you watch
[34:15] the fig tree israel coming into your
[34:16] homeland all that that's the thing then
[34:18] he goes on get your bible read with me
[34:19] matthew 24
[34:22] verse 37 look at this hint that he drops
[34:24] as in the days of noah so shall also the
[34:27] coming of the son of man be for as in
[34:28] the days that it were the flood they
[34:29] were eating and drinking marrying and
[34:31] giving in marriage until the day that o
[34:33] noah entered in the ark and knew not
[34:35] until the flood came and took them all
[34:37] away so shall also the coming of the son
[34:39] of man be so even he says we don't know
[34:41] the day or the hour but we'll know the
[34:43] season by the signs it'll be like the
[34:44] days of noah and guess what wake up wake
[34:47] up because as he is they're living a
[34:50] party life not thinking he's coming
[34:52] the seventh seal is written right in the
[34:55] ark how many has visited the the ark
[34:57] encounter down there
[34:59] all right somebody please take me i
[35:00] haven't been able to go yet i hear it's
[35:02] a great thing to see how big it was
[35:04] that ark when you look at it is a type
[35:07] of the seventh seal
[35:10] because judgments come into the world
[35:12] god gives grace for an ark for his
[35:13] people
[35:15] and they actually get in that and
[35:16] they're in a span of time in the ark
[35:18] with the door closed
[35:20] for seven days
[35:23] sealed up
[35:25] i tell you we need to be sealed by the
[35:26] holy ghost
[35:27] everyone else need to be sealed by the
[35:29] holy ghost and know where we stand
[35:32] god seal me up
[35:33] seal christ with me seal the devil out
[35:35] can you say amen
[35:38] look at these signs though look at these
[35:39] little things these hints
[35:42] so the or the the ark closes the verse
[35:45] 40. then shall two be in a field the one
[35:47] shall be taken the other one left i want
[35:48] you to notice now here's the hour
[35:51] something's going to happen there's a
[35:52] separation
[35:54] one shall be in a field the one should
[35:56] be taken another left we can think of
[35:57] that as rapture because that's going to
[35:59] happen some are going to go some are
[36:00] going to stay and not necessarily
[36:02] unbelievers and believers but christians
[36:06] without the holy ghost will stay through
[36:08] tribulation and those that have the holy
[36:10] ghost will go in the rapture
[36:12] so one shall be taken the other one left
[36:15] it's all given hints of the seventh seal
[36:16] coming of the lord how it's gonna be two
[36:18] women shall be grounding at the meal the
[36:19] one shall be taken and the other left
[36:21] watch therefore for ye know not what
[36:23] hour the lord cometh but know this that
[36:25] if the goodman of the house had known
[36:26] and which watched the thief would come
[36:28] he would have watched and not have
[36:30] suffered his house to be broken up
[36:31] therefore be also ready for in such an
[36:34] hour as you think not the son of man
[36:36] cometh so you may not all intellectually
[36:38] know the details of when the day he's
[36:40] coming to the moment is coming but i can
[36:41] tell you you can keep watching and you
[36:44] can be ready
[36:45] because jesus said i could
[36:48] watch and be ready
[36:51] when who then is a faithful and wise
[36:53] servant whom his lord hath made ruler
[36:55] over his household to give them meat and
[36:57] due season i want to be a faithful and a
[37:00] wise servant hopefully i'm feeding you
[37:03] his meat in due season i see myself in
[37:05] that scripture blessed is that servant
[37:07] who is lord when he cometh shall find so
[37:09] doing verily i say to you that he shall
[37:11] make him rule over all his goods but and
[37:13] if that evil servant shall say in his
[37:15] heart my lord delayeth his coming and
[37:18] shall begin to now look at this now look
[37:19] at this attitude
[37:21] i've been around this many years and
[37:23] they keep preaching the coming of the
[37:25] lord you know what
[37:26] i think the lord delaith is coming so
[37:28] i'm just going to go party for a while
[37:31] i'm going to go wear what i want to wear
[37:33] i'm going to do what i want to do i'm
[37:34] going to feed on the movies i want to
[37:35] feed on that's not watching and be ready
[37:40] that's the attitude
[37:42] he delayeth is coming
[37:45] and i'm okay
[37:47] to live a worldly life for a while
[37:49] because he delayeth his coming
[37:52] bear listen to your pastor
[37:55] god help you
[37:57] you better not have that attitude he's
[37:58] delaying his coming so i'm gonna just
[38:01] dabble in some things of the world
[38:04] that's what you're doing some of you
[38:07] that's what you're doing you need an
[38:08] altar
[38:12] look what they do though it's not just
[38:13] that they say the lord delay is coming
[38:15] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[38:17] servants and to eat and drink with the
[38:19] drunken
[38:20] so these people that
[38:22] are saying he delayeth is coming maybe
[38:25] even this message isn't true
[38:27] i grew up in it but it's not true
[38:28] anymore
[38:29] it's not good enough for them just to
[38:30] leave but they're smiting they're
[38:32] persecuting
[38:34] the fellow servants of the lord
[38:36] they're taking shots
[38:38] at the true believers
[38:42] the lord that servant shall come in a
[38:43] day when he look enough for him in an
[38:44] hour that he is not aware of and shall
[38:46] cut him asunder and appoint him his
[38:48] portion with the hypocrites there shall
[38:50] be weeping and gnashing of teeth so that
[38:53] we see that picture now matthew 25 two
[38:56] more parables and the ones familiar to
[38:58] you all about the seventh seal he
[39:00] doesn't say it outright but here we have
[39:03] the parable of the five
[39:05] wise virgins and the five foolish
[39:08] virgins can you say man
[39:09] both of them are virgins can you say
[39:12] amen
[39:13] and so now this parable is revealing the
[39:15] time of the seventh seal the next
[39:17] parables reveal the time of the seven
[39:19] sail he just said one shall be taken the
[39:21] other one left so now that seems to be
[39:23] under this this time of the seventh seal
[39:26] this time before the coming of the lord
[39:29] it seems to be in these parables there's
[39:32] two groups in them
[39:35] in the why in the in the ten virgins
[39:38] there's two of them but they're all
[39:40] virgins
[39:41] they're all christians
[39:44] and the only distinction is one has oil
[39:47] and one doesn't have oil it's these two
[39:50] groups that i'm talking about during the
[39:52] time of the seventh seal it's not
[39:54] unbelievers and believers no no it's
[39:56] it's all in the christian group
[40:00] but one will go through tribulation
[40:02] because they were lacking the oil
[40:05] so we got to look at that as this time
[40:07] of the seventh seal the coming of the
[40:08] lord we've got to look at it as as being
[40:10] an important thing it reveals that
[40:12] there's two groups here so you could
[40:14] speak more about this uh let me just
[40:17] come back to my notes here we live in
[40:19] that the span of time of the opening of
[40:21] this seventh seal so now we have this
[40:24] this uh parable uh just moving down
[40:27] quickly here uh
[40:29] this parable of the wise and foolish
[40:31] virgins i don't have to speak much about
[40:33] it you've read it over and over again
[40:34] you see it but i just want to make sure
[40:36] when you read it that you know this is
[40:38] what's revealing that time of the coming
[40:41] of the lord this isn't a parable back
[40:43] for another time it's for the time
[40:45] you're living in right now
[40:48] that's why preachers will preach you
[40:50] need the holy spirit
[40:52] that's why we'll emphasize the oil
[40:54] because that's that's a
[40:56] it's gonna in these parables it's gonna
[40:58] bring the essentials what do we need
[41:00] what do we need to be prepared what do
[41:03] we need during this time of the coming
[41:05] of the lord well number one you need to
[41:07] say lord if i don't have the oil please
[41:11] give me the oil
[41:12] and they said when some recognized they
[41:14] didn't have it they tried to piggyback
[41:17] off of the other ones you can't
[41:19] piggyback off of mom and dad you can't
[41:22] piggyback off of the pastor you can't
[41:24] say i'm good because i go to literal
[41:26] life you've got to say to the lord god i
[41:29] want to know that i have this oil myself
[41:35] please if you haven't said that urgent
[41:37] cried prayer to god
[41:39] say it to him
[41:40] say lord there is nothing more important
[41:43] to me than the oil
[41:46] and i can't piggyback i can't they said
[41:48] go we give us off some of your oil you
[41:50] can't do it
[41:52] they said we have not enough for
[41:54] ourselves
[41:56] go to them that sell when they went to
[41:57] themselves too late
[41:59] the most important thing in our lives
[42:01] right now during the time
[42:03] the last hours one of the most important
[42:06] things
[42:07] is that we know
[42:09] that we have the oil i might go into a
[42:10] series on the holy ghost that we
[42:12] understand what that is
[42:14] i find one of the most confusing things
[42:15] that satan's still confusing people over
[42:17] is the new birth
[42:19] and the holy ghost
[42:22] i i want people to be able to understand
[42:25] because satan does his job
[42:27] to confuse people about it
[42:29] god is not the author of confusion
[42:34] but there's such even until today
[42:37] such
[42:38] different slants
[42:40] on the new birth
[42:42] and what the holy ghost is and the
[42:44] evidence sometimes people preachers will
[42:45] preach and if you do this then you'll
[42:48] then you have the holy ghost and it
[42:49] becomes a sanctification thing but you
[42:51] see the prophet told us what the
[42:53] evidence of the holy ghost was
[42:55] and we need to preach
[42:56] the balanced word of god
[42:59] for the people's sake for the young
[43:01] people's sake
[43:02] how many want to know what the holy
[43:03] ghost is
[43:05] how many want the holy ghost in your
[43:06] life without a shadow of a doubt god
[43:08] bless you god bless you i mean you pray
[43:11] you say lord and you've got evidences of
[43:14] you in your life praise the lord say god
[43:15] and then you that have it say i want
[43:18] more of it see the thing is friends god
[43:20] doesn't just make it confusing to us
[43:22] that we're always in this i'm lacking
[43:23] i'm lacking i'm lacking no it's just
[43:25] whatever we do lack just keep going
[43:27] before god and say lord whatever i lack
[43:30] fill me with it
[43:32] if it is the holy spirit fill me with it
[43:35] let me be obedient to you
[43:37] make me ready lord the next parable is
[43:41] in matthew 25 and verse 14 and
[43:43] unfortunately today i have to summarize
[43:45] i'll get to another sermon on it but now
[43:47] this parable under the seventh seal says
[43:50] that this
[43:52] master or king came
[43:54] he gives talents different talents to
[43:57] people
[43:58] and then he leaves
[44:00] and he comes back later to find out what
[44:03] they did
[44:04] with those talents
[44:06] it's a strange mysterious thing but it
[44:08] is in the seventh seal and it is have
[44:10] related to the coming of the lord so the
[44:12] first essential thing you got is oil
[44:15] the next thing is god's gonna hand you
[44:17] something
[44:19] and
[44:21] you know under the
[44:22] five wise and five fuller virgins
[44:25] having the oil we know brother branham
[44:27] preached the
[44:28] the essential thing of having the holy
[44:30] ghost he preached those things
[44:32] but then under this parable
[44:34] brother brandon preached investments
[44:38] right so now here you take the talents
[44:41] and something's given to you and it's
[44:43] not talents it's not we think gifts and
[44:46] talents no
[44:47] it's something spiritual that he gives
[44:49] you
[44:50] but then he comes back later says what
[44:52] did you do with what i gave you
[44:56] did you invest it
[44:57] did it multiply did it become more or
[45:01] did it come back like some of the
[45:02] servants says we hid it we we hit it we
[45:05] put it away and
[45:06] we had certain reasons and we just and
[45:08] they never got anything more than what
[45:10] god gave them 30 years later in the
[45:12] message they're in the same spot never
[45:14] grown an inch
[45:16] never went anywhere with it never sought
[45:18] god for more
[45:20] still still right at that same spot
[45:23] borderline believers just kind of there
[45:26] you know i've been in the message for
[45:27] years still you know have struggling
[45:29] over the fashions of this world never
[45:31] growing and he's coming to say i gave
[45:34] you something
[45:35] how have you grown with it
[45:39] what have you done with what i've given
[45:40] you
[45:41] and because i'm i'm really in the same
[45:43] state that i was it's time to pray just
[45:46] like you prayed for the oil now you need
[45:48] to pray say god i've been blessed to see
[45:50] the message of the hour i've been
[45:52] blessed to be handed something here
[45:54] but lord i don't want to hide it
[45:57] i don't want to hold it
[45:59] i want to invest it and let it become
[46:01] more
[46:02] one of those guys got two talents i
[46:04] think and it
[46:06] it was multiplied 100 fold when the king
[46:08] came back he said lord your your talents
[46:11] he didn't call him his he says your
[46:12] talents look how much they've gained
[46:15] your talents your growth your grace in
[46:18] my life look where it's gone and he was
[46:20] so pleased he says enter into the joys
[46:22] of the lord you inherit all kinds of on
[46:24] the other side because why you took what
[46:27] you had and say lord i don't want to
[46:29] stay this speaks of adoption do you
[46:31] realize that the end time is adoption
[46:33] time that we're not just to have the
[46:36] holy spirit but we're to see the holy
[46:38] spirit bring an overcoming life we're to
[46:41] see the holy spirit bring more in our
[46:43] lives more fruit in our lives
[46:46] the time of the seventh seal
[46:48] the time of the coming of the lord
[46:51] where we're given something
[46:53] we're given something
[46:55] and the talents become
[46:58] multiplied
[47:02] i wish i had more time on that but i
[47:03] have to move on
[47:05] is anybody getting something out of this
[47:07] today
[47:09] this is seven seal parables
[47:12] this is where we're living right now
[47:15] isn't it great that it's not complicated
[47:18] i need to go by find my lord before my
[47:20] lord say lord
[47:22] let me know that i know that i know that
[47:23] i have
[47:25] that amen are on the inside that says
[47:27] amen to the word of god there's no
[47:29] resistance on a soul level the flesh
[47:32] bucks up against it but in here it says
[47:34] amen
[47:35] to every word of god i got to know that
[47:38] i have that
[47:39] as the evidence of holy ghost believing
[47:41] every word of god for your age not just
[47:43] believing it up here but really from my
[47:45] heart i believe this lord i woke up the
[47:48] last oh wasn't it nice this morning to
[47:50] just have some warm weather and i was on
[47:52] my porch for the first time it's almost
[47:54] may and the first time i'd be able to be
[47:55] on my porch
[47:57] it was so nice to hear the birds singing
[47:59] and just fellowship but i've been waking
[48:00] up say lord thank you for this message
[48:02] thank you for this word
[48:05] grow it in me lord
[48:09] the things that you've given me are so
[48:11] incredibly blessed and i feel blessed
[48:15] the saints that you've given me to
[48:16] fellowship with is such wonderful saints
[48:19] i'm a blessed man
[48:23] so then we come to
[48:25] i wish i had more time on the talents
[48:26] because
[48:27] it's so important that we
[48:30] see
[48:31] that god
[48:34] preached that to us in investments
[48:38] that
[48:40] they're given something he leads and
[48:42] returns
[48:44] this speaks of an increased faith that's
[48:46] why brother brown preached perfect faith
[48:48] it speaks of investments he preached in
[48:49] investments investments mature over time
[48:52] this speaks of boldness to take his word
[48:55] and see it do more that's why he
[48:57] preached why christ speak
[49:00] amen it's not waiting around for god to
[49:02] do it for you can you say amen you've
[49:05] given me faith you've given me something
[49:06] let my faith create increase why cry
[49:09] speak and go forward
[49:11] so it's the boldness it's adoption
[49:13] that's what we need more of can you say
[49:15] man we we need to realize what this new
[49:17] birth is doing to us growing more than
[49:20] just salvation when you come back to god
[49:22] are you gonna hand him back say i gave
[49:24] my heart to the lord and that was it i
[49:26] gave my heart to the lord at a camp when
[49:27] i was 10 years old and you hand back and
[49:29] it's all you have is salvation that's
[49:31] what i hand back to you no no no we want
[49:34] to say when he comes back that that
[49:36] thing that he gave me that that power
[49:38] that he gave me it's grown into a full
[49:40] mature son and daughter of god it's
[49:43] grown into something lord look what you
[49:46] gave me but look what it's grown into
[49:49] that's what i want to be able to say and
[49:50] it won't be me that's grown it's that
[49:52] you've done it all by your grace lord
[49:54] but look i never dreamed that i could
[49:57] overcome things like this i never
[49:59] dreamed that i could go this far in the
[50:01] lord
[50:05] and then
[50:06] it speeds ahead to the last thing in
[50:09] matthew 25 to judgment day which is our
[50:11] text
[50:13] and i know
[50:14] for those doctrinally would check me out
[50:16] i know this is not the bride here this
[50:19] is speaking of the sheep and goats and
[50:21] speaking of those who be separated those
[50:23] that were good to the bride those who
[50:24] were respectful to the bride and
[50:26] incidentally
[50:27] i just want to bring it out and divide
[50:30] that properly because you see it's still
[50:32] when this goes on where they're being
[50:34] good to the bride and naked i clothed
[50:37] you
[50:37] and and i fed you when you're thirsty
[50:40] they're doing good works and guess what
[50:42] because they do good works to the bride
[50:45] they are granted eternal life on
[50:47] judgment day they don't have eternal
[50:49] life but they are granted eternal life
[50:52] the sheep are because of their works
[50:56] now they didn't do that by the holy
[50:58] ghost they did it just by works and they
[51:00] were given eternal life later
[51:03] and i want you to notice the connection
[51:05] they were making and that is with the
[51:07] least of the brethren so they're even by
[51:10] mechanics even by doing works they were
[51:12] able to recognize unconsciously not that
[51:15] it was the lord they were doing it to
[51:16] but they were able to give and they were
[51:18] able to respect and they were able to
[51:20] give towards the least of the brethren
[51:22] now most of us would ignore the least of
[51:24] the brethren most of us would ignore the
[51:27] naked the thirsty the hungry the ones in
[51:29] prison the the the ones that are
[51:32] distressed the ones are in these
[51:34] terrible conditions under most cases we
[51:37] kind of
[51:38] have an arm's length with people like
[51:40] that
[51:42] they might smell too much
[51:47] they've got a lot of hang-ups that
[51:50] they've come from
[51:53] under normal circumstances that's not
[51:55] the people we're going and visiting
[51:57] that's not the people we're reaching out
[51:58] to that's not the people we're coming to
[52:00] in gorge towards them but but they're
[52:02] doing it i want to just say if i can
[52:04] divide this properly
[52:06] that if that eternal life is granted to
[52:09] them for for reaching out to those least
[52:11] of the brethren jesus said that was me
[52:13] when you reached out to them you were
[52:14] reaching out to me
[52:17] if they're doing that and get eternal
[52:19] life
[52:20] shouldn't we be reaching out
[52:22] when we already have eternal life
[52:28] so this is the time of the seventh seal
[52:30] all this is going on not at judgement
[52:32] day when the separation sheep goes this
[52:33] is during this time this is happening
[52:36] and actually the bride members is who
[52:37] they're ministering to but some of those
[52:39] bride members came in conditions that
[52:41] were completely sometimes intolerable to
[52:44] deal with
[52:46] broken distressed
[52:49] in prison
[52:51] addictions
[53:00] and if we have eternal life
[53:03] i'm going to read it to you in a minute
[53:05] you must understand eternal life
[53:08] is not something that we get someday
[53:11] it's something that we have now
[53:16] so it will be bringing eternal life
[53:19] to broken lives
[53:22] it will be imparting eternal life
[53:25] to the ones of the least of the brethren
[53:28] not the best of the brethren but all the
[53:30] brethren that are his brethren that are
[53:33] actually when you did this you did it to
[53:36] me
[53:39] can you say praise the lord
[53:45] this group ministers to the least
[53:48] we can attach this to those who are
[53:49] granted eternal life but yet we hear in
[53:51] this hour we have
[53:52] but this
[53:54] isn't it surprising the people in their
[53:57] conditions at the very end
[54:00] naked and this could be spiritually
[54:01] naked spiritually in a few weeks i want
[54:03] to have a subject of naked and modesty i
[54:06] want to talk about modesty i want to
[54:07] title it who decides what's modest
[54:11] who decides what's modest how many knows
[54:14] modesties in the bible
[54:16] see that's not the question who decides
[54:18] what's modest
[54:19] i was going to do it today but the lord
[54:21] wouldn't let me i still got to finish
[54:22] this up who decides what's modest
[54:27] you want me to let you know what sunday
[54:29] so you can
[54:32] be a little sick
[54:37] this is sunday we're taking a trip
[54:38] somewhere
[54:42] you gotta ignore modesty you can't
[54:44] ignore it and you can't interpret what
[54:45] it is for yourself
[54:48] but i was looking into a little bit and
[54:49] it's just spiritually the reason the
[54:51] world has gone naked is because they're
[54:53] naked spiritually
[54:56] and you've got to have the right kind of
[54:57] covering on your soul and you have the
[54:59] right kind of covering on your soul
[55:01] then you have the right righteousness of
[55:02] god you have protection with it
[55:07] but
[55:07] if it's this is if these people are
[55:09] spiritual conditions of being naked
[55:12] hungry thirsty in prison in chains of
[55:15] something bound by something spiritually
[55:17] and they're sick whether physically or
[55:20] emotionally i'm telling you friends
[55:22] we're living in an hour i spoke of it
[55:24] wednesday night we're living in a time
[55:26] that people are coming and there's
[55:28] there's situations people share with me
[55:31] that i'm overwhelmed sometimes to the
[55:33] the damage that satan has done to the
[55:37] emotions and the people's lives there
[55:39] isn't anybody even sitting here that's
[55:42] had a perfect background had a perfect
[55:45] family
[55:47] spoke on betrayal there isn't anybody
[55:50] that hasn't been betrayed by somebody
[55:52] you will be betrayed but it's not about
[55:54] that it's about what you're going to do
[55:55] with it
[55:58] but we're having broken people come to
[56:00] us and guess what i'm one of them you're
[56:02] one of them and the quicker we can quit
[56:04] judging people on the other side and say
[56:06] i'm coming broken they're coming broken
[56:10] the quicker we can see what our calling
[56:12] is
[56:14] these people are coming naked and
[56:16] destitute and bound by addictions and
[56:19] bound by things and
[56:21] under depression
[56:23] we can't beat somebody up from that but
[56:25] i can tell you this i can tell you this
[56:27] if that's who's coming if that's the
[56:30] last group
[56:31] there's a there's a there's a
[56:33] bride
[56:35] who has eternal life
[56:39] she has the answer amen
[56:43] and there isn't any addiction there
[56:44] isn't anything that you went through in
[56:46] your past or present there is anything
[56:49] plaguing your mind that is too big for
[56:52] the message that i'm preaching and the
[56:54] power of god that's available there's
[56:55] anything too big for
[56:58] i have confidence in that
[57:01] here they come
[57:02] this is the way they come
[57:04] and if they come in spiritual conditions
[57:07] like this
[57:08] and they give a ten we give attention to
[57:11] those needs so needy
[57:13] so needy and this is the bride in these
[57:16] conditions but in a natural way she's
[57:19] needy not i shouldn't say in a natural
[57:20] way but even spiritually she comes needy
[57:23] and this group ministers them respects
[57:25] them and meets some of the needs but the
[57:27] people with eternal life listen this is
[57:29] the one we don't run from people like
[57:31] that we don't run away we don't distance
[57:33] ourselves we don't no no no we're saying
[57:35] this is the body of christ and eternal
[57:38] life is working among us working in us
[57:40] in the closing seconds of time can you
[57:42] say amen
[57:43] question is if he said you did it to me
[57:46] and they were granted eternal life
[57:48] shouldn't we who already have eternal
[57:51] life be sensitive to these conditions to
[57:54] minister to them now
[57:57] hopefully i've divided that scripture
[57:58] properly
[58:00] i'm going to read a quote here to finish
[58:02] this up
[58:06] could it be that if we miss the least of
[58:08] the brother and the least likely
[58:11] we miss him
[58:13] could it be
[58:15] that if we miss the least of the
[58:17] brethren
[58:18] we miss him
[58:22] on that day of calvary
[58:26] brother brown says look what that day on
[58:28] calvary did to you
[58:30] it paid your price it settled the
[58:31] question there's several elements of
[58:33] calvary that he brings out in this
[58:34] message and one of them it settled the
[58:36] question settled the sin question your
[58:38] sin be a scarlet they're as white as
[58:40] snow red like prince of white as wool
[58:42] then you have no sin you are perfectly
[58:44] sinless no matter what you've done or
[58:46] what you do you're still sinless as long
[58:48] as you've accepted jesus christ as your
[58:50] savior your sins are forgiven anything
[58:53] is forgiven is remitted and forgot about
[58:55] then what does it do it gives you after
[58:58] that condition it gives you his spirit
[59:01] to follow him and to do as he did for
[59:05] others who are following on he was a ju
[59:08] just one man the perfect man he gave his
[59:10] life and he made an example for you now
[59:12] what must we do now the first thing i
[59:14] want to say is jesus never lived for
[59:17] himself so stop right there see so
[59:19] calvary the power of calvary when we
[59:21] come in face to face with and it's come
[59:23] in our life by experience we know the
[59:25] first thing is it settles the sin
[59:26] question it settles the sin question
[59:29] forever he paid for my sins
[59:34] that's the results of calvary i know
[59:36] you've heard that a million times girl
[59:38] but don't lose the meaning of it because
[59:40] the devil's going to attack you with it
[59:41] i need to hold on calvary paid for my
[59:44] sins he settled the sin question that's
[59:47] not to be brought up anymore can you say
[59:49] amen he's washed away my sin but he said
[59:51] that's not the only thing the power of
[59:53] calvary brings
[59:56] that day of calvary brought us more than
[59:58] just the settlement of sin and that's
[59:59] where you have a lot of denominational
[1:00:01] churches stop right there our sin has
[1:00:04] been settled we preached calvary today
[1:00:06] because he went to the cross the sin
[1:00:07] says sin question has been settled
[1:00:10] that's all the further they go but see
[1:00:11] there's a life that comes from calvary
[1:00:14] and that is we receive his spirit to
[1:00:16] follow in the ways that he would be can
[1:00:19] you say amen now he goes into this
[1:00:21] subject of the way it will be jesus
[1:00:23] never lived for himself his life was
[1:00:26] spent for others that's perfectly
[1:00:28] eternal life
[1:00:30] so what's he saying eternal life is not
[1:00:32] something we get someday but eternal
[1:00:33] life came from the power of calvary and
[1:00:35] we will receive that life in us and it's
[1:00:38] not it what kind of life was it it was
[1:00:40] not a selfish life
[1:00:43] you never get a self-focused
[1:00:45] selfish life
[1:00:47] out of the power of calvary
[1:00:51] if you've experienced calvary you don't
[1:00:55] get
[1:00:56] a selfish life you get eternal life and
[1:00:59] eternal life is an unselfish life when
[1:01:01] you say you go to church and you do good
[1:01:04] things
[1:01:05] that's fine
[1:01:06] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:01:08] you have an eternal life eternal life is
[1:01:12] living for others it proved it when it
[1:01:15] come in the lamb of god
[1:01:17] opens up our understanding of what
[1:01:19] eternal life is
[1:01:21] eternal life is an unselfish life
[1:01:24] eternal life comes through the word of
[1:01:26] god comes to christ comes from calvary
[1:01:28] it's not just something we get someday
[1:01:29] to live eternally in the millennium or
[1:01:31] any other time it's it's something that
[1:01:33] we receive by the holy ghost now and we
[1:01:35] have that life but what is it it's an
[1:01:37] eternal life and i i just bring you back
[1:01:39] to what jesus on wednesday night jesus
[1:01:42] did to handle the betrayal all of his
[1:01:44] disciples paid to hate him judas
[1:01:45] betrayed him he was left alone nobody
[1:01:47] was there i'm saying how did he handle
[1:01:49] that how did he respond to it he loved
[1:01:51] them until the end his love didn't stop
[1:01:54] it didn't go up and down can you say a
[1:01:55] man they were up and down all the time
[1:01:58] they were committed to him denied him
[1:02:00] their emotions were everywhere and
[1:02:02] that's that's all understandable i i see
[1:02:04] but i want to be like our lord that was
[1:02:06] consistent and faithful in his love to
[1:02:08] them it didn't go up and down
[1:02:12] i told somebody yesterday on the phone i
[1:02:14] said if i were to go on people's
[1:02:15] comments from week to week and the
[1:02:17] bipolar situation sometimes people are i
[1:02:20] would have left church a long time ago
[1:02:22] i'm not depending on the up and downs of
[1:02:23] people's emotions or their comments
[1:02:25] against me or the ups and downs of my
[1:02:27] emotions i want to be consistent and
[1:02:30] faithful and love god's people until the
[1:02:32] end
[1:02:33] my love should never stop because it's
[1:02:35] eternal
[1:02:37] and it's unselfish love
[1:02:40] he lived
[1:02:41] and had eternal life because he did not
[1:02:43] live for himself
[1:02:45] and he lived for others you receive
[1:02:46] eternal life by receiving that that day
[1:02:49] and you don't live for yourself no more
[1:02:50] you live for others someone said how can
[1:02:52] you stand and let anybody call you such
[1:02:54] bad names
[1:02:56] you don't live for yourself
[1:02:58] there's a really simple answer to that
[1:03:00] and he just gave it how can you stand
[1:03:02] and let somebody call you bad names and
[1:03:04] not respond
[1:03:06] none of that's ever happened to you guys
[1:03:09] when it started to happen to me a lot in
[1:03:11] my life didn't happen a lot in my life
[1:03:13] but it happened a lot when i became a
[1:03:15] landlord
[1:03:18] brother
[1:03:19] brother quinlan
[1:03:21] daryl
[1:03:22] boy i tell you i found out i heard words
[1:03:25] i never heard in my life
[1:03:26] and they were calling me those words
[1:03:30] praise the lord you live in this world
[1:03:33] and sometimes people say things stupid
[1:03:36] within the church
[1:03:40] i can never guarantee people aren't
[1:03:42] going to say stupid things against you
[1:03:45] but i can guarantee you there's an
[1:03:46] eternal life
[1:03:48] that knows how to respond
[1:03:51] that's what i want how do i respond
[1:03:55] he loved them till the end
[1:03:57] you live for others that you might
[1:03:58] redeem that man you become sons
[1:04:01] and the trouble of it is the church has
[1:04:03] forgotten they were sons you're a son
[1:04:05] you're taking christ's place you're a
[1:04:06] son so don't live to yourself live for
[1:04:08] others or brother brahma i can't live
[1:04:10] for this man he said i can live for this
[1:04:12] man because he sure is a nice man
[1:04:17] that's not it live for that man who
[1:04:19] hates you
[1:04:21] live for that person who would kill you
[1:04:23] if they could
[1:04:26] what they done to him they killed him
[1:04:27] and he died that he might save them
[1:04:29] that's eternal life when you
[1:04:32] that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:04:34] heaven then stop right there don't go
[1:04:36] any further listen this is eternal life
[1:04:40] it's not just that we believe he paid
[1:04:41] for our sins but that's life is coming
[1:04:43] through us and working through us that
[1:04:45] it makes us cause us to live
[1:04:48] live for a man that hates us to live a
[1:04:51] person who would kill us if they could
[1:04:53] that's what it done to him they killed
[1:04:54] him and he died that he might save them
[1:04:56] that's eternal life when you that's in
[1:04:58] your bosom you're facing heaven them how
[1:05:00] many want that in your bosom
[1:05:03] but you sacrifice your own things give
[1:05:05] them up like the sheep gives its wool
[1:05:07] you look on towards calvary i hope this
[1:05:09] helps you to get in a place that's what
[1:05:11] the tabernacle that's what all people
[1:05:13] has got to do is find out what you are
[1:05:15] and what's the purpose
[1:05:17] church isn't going to church the church
[1:05:20] isn't going to church just to play music
[1:05:22] sing songs
[1:05:24] church is a place where correction
[1:05:26] judgment begins in the house of god if
[1:05:28] the church can ever come to those
[1:05:29] fundamental facts that it's not
[1:05:32] something you try to do you work
[1:05:34] yourself up to do it's something that's
[1:05:37] born in you
[1:05:40] forgive me my pentecostal friend
[1:05:43] i am pentecostal but my pentecostal
[1:05:46] friends has got to a spot to where it
[1:05:48] has to be a lot of fast music
[1:05:51] beating some bands or clapping hands or
[1:05:54] tambourines to bring up a shout
[1:05:58] out
[1:06:00] that's only emotion
[1:06:03] they play in the bands before they go to
[1:06:05] battle they get people in the emotion of
[1:06:07] battle
[1:06:09] i believe in music i believe in clapping
[1:06:11] hands but i believe in these things
[1:06:14] stop right there go back
[1:06:16] he's correcting pentecostals not because
[1:06:18] he's against emotion
[1:06:22] but when that begins to be worked up by
[1:06:24] the music
[1:06:25] we're off track
[1:06:29] when we're working up emotion and say if
[1:06:31] we can do this then we've had a good
[1:06:33] service
[1:06:35] we're getting off track
[1:06:37] and there's hundreds of quotes that
[1:06:38] brother brown is correcting the
[1:06:40] pentecostals
[1:06:41] and i think sometimes we should read
[1:06:43] those because it could correct us
[1:06:44] sometimes who get off track when we're
[1:06:47] pushing for such emotion
[1:06:49] it misdirects people to think that
[1:06:52] because i'm emotional that i'm getting
[1:06:53] the holy ghost that's not true
[1:06:57] usually the motion comes after we've
[1:06:59] been delivered
[1:07:01] usually the motion comes after we've
[1:07:02] heard the word we're stimulated by the
[1:07:04] word of god and let the emotion flow
[1:07:08] but when emotion is worked up by the
[1:07:10] music or by the preacher
[1:07:14] we cross the line a little bit if we're
[1:07:16] not careful because the emotion becomes
[1:07:18] the definition
[1:07:20] of whether god's doing something or not
[1:07:26] so to try to keep a balance to say what
[1:07:28] he's saying
[1:07:30] a lot of fast music beating some bands
[1:07:32] clapping cancer to bring up a shout
[1:07:34] that's only motion may god help us never
[1:07:36] to go down that path we don't want to do
[1:07:38] that you never have to bring up a shout
[1:07:40] of people who are being delivered
[1:07:42] you never have to work up a shout or
[1:07:44] work up emotion or work the people into
[1:07:46] a frenzy
[1:07:48] and then say we've had a good service
[1:07:49] i'll tell you we have we there's
[1:07:52] services i've been in not here other
[1:07:54] places even
[1:07:55] in services and it you just here's what
[1:07:58] we need to do we need to let god do what
[1:08:00] he wants to do
[1:08:02] and not
[1:08:03] pull it our way just let god do what he
[1:08:06] wants to do let him do his work and that
[1:08:08] might be a very exuberant emotional
[1:08:10] service but it might be just a quiet
[1:08:12] service but god dropped some real solid
[1:08:16] bombs on the enemy can you say amen
[1:08:19] and some revelations into the heart of
[1:08:20] the people that overcoming power is
[1:08:23] going to make them stand the sons and
[1:08:24] daughters of god
[1:08:26] don't ever stop entering into worship
[1:08:28] remember the bible says the sacrifice of
[1:08:29] praise
[1:08:31] so you need to come and bring the
[1:08:32] sacrament it's the sacrifice work out
[1:08:34] all that tiredness work out all that
[1:08:36] thing all the week has been a rough week
[1:08:38] you're coming the song leader's got to
[1:08:40] cut you know he's singing and pulling
[1:08:42] sometimes he shouldn't have to do that
[1:08:44] you should say this is my time to
[1:08:46] worship the lord and you should enter in
[1:08:48] sometimes you shout sometimes a person
[1:08:50] just sits and cries sometimes they just
[1:08:52] ponder don't look to the next person and
[1:08:54] try to copy the next person just yield
[1:08:57] to the lord and worship him
[1:09:00] is that okay with everybody
[1:09:01] i got hundreds of quotes from brother
[1:09:03] bran corrected the pentecostals but we
[1:09:05] need to read it ourselves sometimes
[1:09:06] because we get off track of the
[1:09:08] imbalance of where things are going
[1:09:10] we don't have to work anything up
[1:09:12] because eternal life is working through
[1:09:14] the word of god and the new birth of the
[1:09:16] people and he can come and deliver
[1:09:18] somebody in a moment's time without any
[1:09:20] emotion involved
[1:09:25] how many believe that
[1:09:28] you don't put a
[1:09:30] a certain thing on god say he has to do
[1:09:32] it this way or nobody got deliverance
[1:09:40] sometimes i know people that are in the
[1:09:41] most
[1:09:42] emotional services
[1:09:44] in this message and because i know their
[1:09:46] lives they didn't get nothing out of
[1:09:49] that some are getting delivered praise
[1:09:52] god but i know some
[1:09:54] and they can't even talk to somebody
[1:09:56] else that's another brother said i will
[1:09:57] never talk to them again
[1:09:59] but boy they shouted all over that
[1:10:01] building
[1:10:02] won't talk to another christian i'll
[1:10:04] never talk to them again
[1:10:06] they're not getting anything
[1:10:08] they're just being worked up
[1:10:10] brother brahman says don't dance or
[1:10:12] shout any higher than what you're living
[1:10:14] every day
[1:10:16] go ahead and dance he never said don't
[1:10:17] stop dancing shout but don't dance or
[1:10:20] shout any higher than what you're living
[1:10:22] can't even talk to another brother
[1:10:24] holding grudges for years and you're the
[1:10:26] greatest shouter something's wrong with
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:30] something's desperately wrong
[1:10:33] i'll say this too that we must be
[1:10:35] careful how we misdirect our young
[1:10:36] people sometimes because someone who's
[1:10:38] crying for god
[1:10:40] might think that if i get it i have to
[1:10:42] get it like that person over there
[1:10:44] that's just screaming and shouting they
[1:10:47] may be getting the genuine thing but you
[1:10:49] should never feel like i have to do that
[1:10:51] in order to get something real
[1:10:54] can i hear something from somebody
[1:10:57] we have to be so careful of that because
[1:11:00] he got sincere hearts looking for god
[1:11:03] and crying for god
[1:11:05] but young people you you enjoy all the
[1:11:07] camps and enjoy the presence of the lord
[1:11:09] here and enjoy and listen don't ever
[1:11:11] disrespect don't speak against the
[1:11:13] emotion somebody speaks in times tongues
[1:11:16] don't speak against it respect it just
[1:11:18] say praise the lord somebody's being
[1:11:19] blessed somebody's screaming somebody's
[1:11:21] getting delivered praise the lord but
[1:11:23] don't ever be intimidated by that that
[1:11:25] somehow you didn't get nothing the same
[1:11:27] god that's making them shout is the same
[1:11:30] god that can give you something real in
[1:11:32] your heart as well
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:35] we can't interpret the holy ghost as
[1:11:38] being an emotion emotion comes with the
[1:11:41] holy ghost but you could have all the
[1:11:43] emotion and not have the holy ghost
[1:11:46] is that okay with everybody
[1:11:49] so he's correcting the pentecostal
[1:11:50] exactly exactly true we're going to end
[1:11:52] here in a minute we ought to have that
[1:11:54] but you have left the great things
[1:11:56] undone is that self-sacrifice life that
[1:11:59] god lives in you automatically doing
[1:12:01] that which is right because it's right
[1:12:03] just going on don't even think about it
[1:12:05] just living it now what jesus said watch
[1:12:07] how he stated it the works that i do
[1:12:10] he's doing them right now the works that
[1:12:11] i'm doing now healing the sick raising
[1:12:13] the dead opening of the eye is blind
[1:12:16] these works shall you do also he'll do
[1:12:18] if you believe in me you do these works
[1:12:20] and then greater than this shall you do
[1:12:23] for i go to my father so now he's
[1:12:25] pointing to the miracles the signs the
[1:12:27] raising the dead he says the works i do
[1:12:30] shall you do also i can say in the last
[1:12:32] 50 60 years while i have been around i
[1:12:34] have watched the dead raised i've
[1:12:36] watched the blind eyes open i've seen
[1:12:38] the same works that jesus did not only
[1:12:41] in brother branham but in our church
[1:12:43] cancer delivered can you say man he has
[1:12:45] fulfilled this in the bride the works
[1:12:48] that he did we're doing also
[1:12:52] and it's still going on but jesus said
[1:12:54] greater works will you do
[1:12:58] greater than a healing line
[1:13:00] greater than physical deliverance what
[1:13:02] could be greater than that
[1:13:05] the greater works was to have the power
[1:13:07] in the church not only to heal the sick
[1:13:09] by prayer cast out devils by prayer but
[1:13:12] to impart
[1:13:13] eternal life
[1:13:18] what is the greater works that you have
[1:13:20] the power to impart eternal life to
[1:13:23] someone else

[1:13:28] the holy ghost was coming and given into
[1:13:31] the hands of the church
[1:13:32] to impart life that's why god come and
[1:13:34] fill them with the holy ghost not just
[1:13:36] to do signs not to cast out devils not
[1:13:39] just but to impart eternal life to
[1:13:41] someone else
[1:13:42] because they had eternal life they can
[1:13:44] impart it to the least of their brother
[1:13:46] to the least to the worst drug addict to
[1:13:48] the prostitute can you say that to the

[1:14:00] life you can't hold it back
[1:14:02] for certain ones that
[1:14:04] smell bad to you
[1:14:07] the greater works was to have the power
[1:14:09] in the church the holy ghost was coming
[1:14:10] and giving it to the hands of the church
[1:14:12] to impart our life oh that's what

[1:15:58] so lord we obey you today but i just
[1:16:00] don't want to ask for the sick to come
[1:16:01] but anyone
[1:16:03] who has a need
[1:16:04] they don't have that eternal life they
[1:16:05] don't have that holy spirit within them
[1:16:08] lord i can lay hands in the sick
[1:16:10] but i also can lay hands on someone
[1:16:13] and the life that's in the word that i
[1:16:15] preach can come in them
[1:16:17] granted father

[1:16:20] lord we don't recognize the power that's
[1:16:22] in the church
[1:16:24] and lord
[1:16:25] may we learn that it's
[1:16:27] it's sometimes the broken that come
[1:16:30] it's sometimes the least of the brethren
[1:16:32] the ones that were are least likely to
[1:16:34] succeed or the least talented or the the
[1:16:37] least the ones with all the complexes
[1:16:40] the ones with all the fears the ones
[1:16:42] that are depressed and distressed
[1:16:44] it's the ones lord that are naked and
[1:16:46] afraid and fearful sometimes
[1:16:49] it's the ones that are in prison
[1:16:52] and bound by certain things
[1:16:54] that's the ones that you said when you
[1:16:56] did it unto them you did it unto me
[1:16:58] lord i pray that you will call us
[1:17:03] to reach out
[1:17:05] and to extend this life
[1:17:08] to others that we think would be the
[1:17:10] least to receive it
[1:17:12] may we be a witness to them as well and
[1:17:15] impart eternal life to them
[1:17:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:17:19] ask it amen
