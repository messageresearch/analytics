[0:17] so i thought you know i'm gonna go
[0:19] support him and
[0:20] he starts talking right exactly about
[0:22] the subject that i'm gonna talk about
[0:23] this morning so brother kyle let that be
[0:25] a confirmation to you i'm taking it as a
[0:28] confirmation to me and then uh
[0:31] to take it even further he says you know
[0:33] he's talking and he he uh he says you
[0:36] know i really you know i really want to
[0:38] take it this way but i'm going to go
[0:39] this way
[0:40] and i'm thinking well i'm taking it the
[0:42] way you wanted it to go so
[0:44] so god's at work this morning and in the
[0:46] songs and the comments that have been
[0:48] made brother dan taking the the
[0:51] request so
[0:53] now i just got to get out of the way
[0:56] amen mark uh 4 35
[1:02] and the same day when
[1:04] the even was come
[1:06] he saith unto them let us pass over unto
[1:08] the other side
[1:10] and when they had sent away the
[1:11] multitude they took him even as he was
[1:14] in the ship and there
[1:15] were also with him other little ships
[1:19] am i reading in the right spot here okay
[1:23] and there arose a great storm of wind
[1:25] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[1:27] it was now full
[1:29] and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:30] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[1:32] him and say unto him master carest thou
[1:35] not that we perish
[1:37] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[1:39] said unto the sea peace be still
[1:41] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:43] great calm and he said unto them
[1:45] why are ye so fearful how is it that ye
[1:48] have no faith
[1:50] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[1:52] to another what manner of man is this
[1:54] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[1:57] just keep going
[1:59] and they came over
[2:02] under the other side of the sea into the
[2:04] country of the gadarenes and when he was
[2:06] come out of the ship immediately there
[2:08] met him out of the tombs a man with an
[2:10] unclean spirit
[2:11] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[2:13] no man could bind him no not with chains
[2:16] because that he had been often bound
[2:18] with fetters and chains and the chains
[2:20] had been plucked asunder by him and the
[2:23] fetters broken pieces
[2:25] neither could any man take him and
[2:27] always night and day he was in the
[2:29] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[2:30] cutting himself with stones
[2:32] but when he saw jesus afar off he ran
[2:35] and worshipped him
[2:36] and he cried with a loud voice and said
[2:39] what have i to do with thee jesus thou
[2:41] son of the most high god i adjure thee
[2:43] by god that thou torment me not
[2:47] for he said unto him come out of the man
[2:49] thou unclean spirit and he said unto him
[2:51] what is thy name
[2:52] and he answered saying my name is legion
[2:54] for we are many
[2:56] and he besought him much that he would
[2:58] not send him away out of the country
[3:01] now there was
[3:02] there nigh unto the mountains a great
[3:04] herd of swine feeding and all the devils
[3:06] besought him saying send us into the
[3:08] swine that we may enter into them
[3:11] and forthwith jesus gave them leave and
[3:14] the unclean spirits went out and entered
[3:16] into the swine and the herd ran
[3:18] violently down a steep place into the
[3:19] sea
[3:20] they were about two thousand and were
[3:22] choked in the sea
[3:23] and they that fed the swine fled and
[3:26] told it in the city and in the country
[3:28] and they went out to see what it was
[3:30] that was done and they come to jesus and
[3:33] see him
[3:34] with the possessed
[3:36] hymn that was possessed with the devil
[3:38] and had the legion sitting and clothed
[3:40] and in his right mind and they were
[3:42] afraid
[3:43] and they that saw it told them how it
[3:46] befell to him
[3:47] that was possessed of the devil and also
[3:50] concerning the swine and they began to
[3:52] pray him to depart out of their coasts
[3:54] and when he was come into the ship
[3:57] he that had been possessed with the
[3:59] devil prayed him that he might be with
[4:01] him
[4:02] how be it jesus suffered him not
[4:04] but saith unto him go home to thy
[4:06] friends and tell them how great things
[4:08] the lord hath done for thee and hath had
[4:10] compassion on thee and he departed and
[4:12] began to publish and the
[4:15] decapolis how great things jesus had
[4:18] done for him and all men marveled
[4:20] let's just bow our heads one more time
[4:22] lord
[4:23] lord jesus we come before you and
[4:26] father we're so grateful god we're so
[4:28] thankful for the confirmations you've
[4:30] given this morning lord
[4:32] now i just ask you god to help me to get
[4:34] out of the way help your people to get
[4:36] out of the way father and be fully open
[4:38] to receive from you god and and fully
[4:40] open father for you to step forth god
[4:43] just let me step out of the way now that

[4:47] people god
[4:48] i pray lord give them what they have
[4:50] need of
[4:51] lord set
[4:52] lord the captive free father give
[4:56] healing lord to the sick
[4:58] and the afflicted lord
[5:00] give comfort to the needy in jesus
[5:03] christ's name
[5:04] amen
[5:05] amen you can have your seats
[5:11] i'm going to step out on a limb here
[5:13] this morning and i'm going to dramatize
[5:14] it just a little bit and uh maybe say
[5:17] some things that um
[5:19] you're going to say boy i don't know
[5:20] about that but i'm going to say him
[5:22] anyway
[5:26] and
[5:27] just humor me
[5:30] so we know that before there was a
[5:33] beginning
[5:34] there was and before god was god
[5:37] we know that
[5:39] it was the the great i am
[5:41] in a vast
[5:43] before there was even really a space
[5:46] and he was by himself
[5:48] and he was alone with his thoughts
[5:51] but then
[5:53] jesus came the word
[5:56] jesus came forth and then and then
[5:59] creation started
[6:01] and
[6:02] we can fast forward from from that time
[6:06] god visits a virgin mary who who births
[6:09] jesus in flesh
[6:12] and and i can see him coming
[6:15] as he stepped out from from the father
[6:19] and he was creating there with just him
[6:21] and the father
[6:23] and then he was birthed into his
[6:24] creation
[6:26] i can see him maybe one years old
[6:28] and
[6:29] and i know mary they they were
[6:32] considered you know kind of outcast
[6:34] because of of what was thought about him
[6:37] but i just say maybe there was a close
[6:39] group maybe it was family there
[6:41] and maybe it was with elizabeth they
[6:43] were visiting and jesus and john are
[6:45] just one years old
[6:47] and they're in their title and you know
[6:48] they're they're playing you know there's
[6:50] before they can walk and things and
[6:52] and um
[6:54] and
[6:55] the the moms are pitting the olives and
[6:57] they're they're making the food and
[6:59] things you know that the women did back
[7:01] in the day you know it seems like any
[7:03] time there's a depiction of what was
[7:05] going on
[7:06] they're always doing something because
[7:08] they they had to survive
[7:10] and so the kids are there playing and
[7:12] and
[7:13] maybe it's john he gets hurt and he's
[7:15] crying and
[7:16] and jesus looks over at him and in tears
[7:19] fill his little eyes because he's
[7:21] looking on compassion for this little
[7:23] boy that just got hurt
[7:25] and you say that's ridiculous but i've
[7:27] seen little kids that small that when
[7:29] another child started crying they would
[7:31] start crying because it was just too
[7:34] much for them to handle they had so much
[7:35] compassion in their heart that they just
[7:37] started crying themselves
[7:40] say two years later three years old
[7:42] again playing with the other children
[7:43] while the mothers knit together
[7:45] and another child falls and gets hurt
[7:47] and it's crying and jesus is is over
[7:50] there and he's playing with his his wood
[7:51] blocks as daddy made him and he sees
[7:54] this child get hurt and crying and the
[7:56] knees are scraped and bleeding and and
[7:58] the mom walks over and picks them up and
[8:00] you know all the other kids are going
[8:01] about their business and and the mom's
[8:03] trying to comfort the baby and the
[8:04] baby's just hysterically crying and
[8:07] jesus gets up from his blocks and he
[8:09] walks over and with that compassion in
[8:10] his eyes he just touches the little baby
[8:13] and the bleeding stops and the baby
[8:15] quits crying and wiggles out of its
[8:16] mom's hands to go and start playing
[8:18] again with the other kids
[8:22] fast forward in time and jesus is 12
[8:24] years old on the way home from the
[8:27] passover
[8:29] maybe it's the time when joseph and mary
[8:32] were frantically searching for him and
[8:33] it was that time that they found him in
[8:35] the temple and he was teaching and they
[8:37] were they were astounded
[8:39] yeah i'm going out a little limb now so
[8:40] bear with me
[8:42] as they walk back towards the city gates
[8:44] there was a prostitute standing on the
[8:46] street corner
[8:47] and jesus just a 12 year old boy walking
[8:50] past and he notices this prostitute and
[8:53] he's just never seen anything like that
[8:55] before and so he's just kind of staring
[8:57] looking at her and she she waves at him
[8:59] and smiles and mary's just got her arm
[9:02] around him and she's she's walking him
[9:03] and she's chiding him you know why'd you
[9:05] do this and you shouldn't have done that
[9:07] you gave us a scare and things and she
[9:09] looks up and she notices where jesus is
[9:11] looking and she sees the prostitute she
[9:13] jerks his head and rushes out of the
[9:15] city gates
[9:17] jesus on the way home he's got a lot of
[9:19] questions about what he just saw you're
[9:22] saying brother this is absolutely
[9:24] ridiculous you're off the word
[9:27] but remember
[9:28] jesus was god
[9:31] but he was man
[9:34] and so he saw this and maybe in his
[9:36] young 12 year old body you know the the
[9:38] the hormones and things and and just the
[9:40] curiosity and so he's asking questions
[9:42] why why was she dressed that way mama
[9:45] why was she this way why why why was she
[9:48] a prostitute what is that and he's
[9:49] asking all these questions
[9:52] and maybe maybe the feelings all of a
[9:54] sudden they turn in his heart because
[9:56] the god part kicks in
[9:58] and he starts his mind goes back to what
[10:01] the father said about whoredom and he
[10:03] feels compassion go out of his heart for
[10:05] this woman
[10:06] in this state in this condition
[10:10] 16 years old entering into the city with
[10:12] joseph to sell their carpentry work
[10:15] there's someone singing over in the
[10:16] corner it's a homeless man playing a
[10:18] stringed instrument like jesus has never
[10:20] heard before
[10:22] he's got a couple more licks than what
[10:23] jesus is used to hearing and
[10:25] and uh you know the the
[10:27] the homeless man is is trying to collect
[10:30] money and he's singing about how he lost
[10:32] his dog and his wagon and his wife and
[10:37] and then the song changes and he starts
[10:39] talking about being with a woman who's
[10:40] not his wife and you know it was a
[10:42] catchy tune so jesus is standing there
[10:44] he's never heard this before and he's
[10:46] he's wanting to hear the lyrics and he's
[10:48] you know it's kind of appealing to the
[10:50] flesh and
[10:51] joseph
[10:52] just
[10:53] snaps his fingers and jesus looks over
[10:56] and joseph just shakes his head and
[10:58] does like that
[11:00] jesus comes on
[11:03] maybe 18 years old
[11:06] he gets his license to drive the wagon
[11:11] brand new wagon that joseph just built
[11:14] taken a long time to collect the wood
[11:16] and
[11:17] to get the wheels and things but joseph
[11:19] just got it just right
[11:22] just right beautiful finish on it i mean
[11:24] this thing was slick
[11:27] brand new never had a brand new wagon
[11:29] for the family
[11:30] jesus 18 years old and he's driving
[11:32] through to take the
[11:34] take the products the goods to go sell
[11:36] them and on the way he gets too close to
[11:38] the rock and it scratches down the side
[11:40] of the wagon
[11:43] jesus is frightened because he's
[11:44] thinking
[11:46] this is a brand new wagon what am i
[11:47] going to do i just put a scratch on my
[11:50] dad's new wagon
[11:53] and the thoughts start going through
[11:54] jesus's head well just don't just don't
[11:56] tell him
[11:58] and then reasoning kicks in and he looks
[12:00] at it and he goes he's not going to miss
[12:02] that
[12:04] so then jesus is thinking and he's
[12:06] driving and he's thinking okay if i get
[12:08] home and i get to my tools before dad
[12:10] sees it before joseph sees it
[12:13] maybe i can buff it out
[12:16] and then he says it's too deep he's
[12:17] going to notice
[12:19] and then as he's thinking these things
[12:22] and as you're thinking this preacher is
[12:24] just crazy
[12:26] proverbs 12 22 comes to jesus's mind
[12:29] lying lips or abomination to the lord
[12:31] but they that deal truly are are his
[12:33] delight
[12:35] psalms 101 verse 7 he that worketh
[12:38] deceit shall not dwell within my house
[12:40] he that telleth lies shall not tarry in
[12:43] my sight
[12:45] jesus tells the truth he tells joseph
[12:47] what happened
[12:50] around age 21
[12:53] i told you i'm out on a limb here so
[12:57] jesus is praying hard for him for joseph
[13:00] because he's fallen sick
[13:02] you know you have a lie after a certain
[13:04] time in the bible you have where they
[13:06] don't talk about joseph anymore it's
[13:07] just mary
[13:11] joseph becomes sick jesus is praying
[13:13] hard for him but he passes away
[13:16] it's a hard thing for jesus to
[13:18] understand it's another hard thing for
[13:19] him to watch mary grieve
[13:23] jesus is moved with compassion and he
[13:25] hugs mary and after a good cry together
[13:28] jesus just starts whispering scripture
[13:32] that comes to mind that says joseph is
[13:34] just sleeping mama
[13:36] you'll see him again someday
[13:39] we'll see him again
[13:42] there's a hope
[13:45] and then maybe he tells his mama
[13:48] i'm saying mama but we know
[13:51] but he says mama
[13:53] we know what i'm here for
[13:57] i promise you you'll see him again
[14:01] you see jesus was tempted in every like
[14:03] manner as we are
[14:05] yet he overcame every temptation and he
[14:07] was without sin
[14:09] that you and i could live a victorious
[14:11] life
[14:14] i was realizing this week that you know
[14:17] i've i've i've had a lot more victories
[14:19] in my life than even what i realized
[14:22] and i just became so thankful to the
[14:24] lord because i didn't i didn't see him
[14:26] but yet it was just some things i was
[14:28] reading and god was just showing me that
[14:30] you know what you you have you have
[14:33] victory over here and this and this spot
[14:36] here that the devil's always beating you
[14:37] over the head over you have had a
[14:39] victory there
[14:41] and it was just it was it was just
[14:43] wonderful for me to see
[14:45] and you have victory and though you make
[14:47] mistakes and though you fail and and we
[14:50] falter and and things you have victory
[14:52] through jesus christ because jesus came
[14:56] and he died that you could have victory
[15:00] jesus came that you would have life and
[15:02] have it more abundantly
[15:05] god became flesh that he could feel what
[15:08] we feel
[15:09] the grief of loss the pain of a scraped
[15:12] knee the sickness at different times in
[15:14] his life
[15:16] he became us so that we he could be our
[15:19] our high priest that can be touched by
[15:21] the feeling of our infirmities
[15:23] hebrews 2 17 wherefore in all things it
[15:26] behooved us it before him to be made
[15:28] like unto us brethren
[15:30] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[15:32] high priest in things pertaining to god
[15:35] to make
[15:35] reconciliation for the sins of the
[15:37] people
[15:40] so god so loved the world that he came
[15:42] down from the glory and splendor of
[15:44] heaven
[15:46] from the pure worship of the angels
[15:49] to save sinners such as you and i
[15:53] this was always something that's that's
[15:55] been astounding to me and that when i
[15:57] think about it i just
[16:00] i just feel that overwhelming feeling
[16:04] that god
[16:06] in his perfection
[16:09] knowing no sin
[16:11] knowing no sickness
[16:13] just
[16:14] in that perfect state that our bodies
[16:17] cry out to be in
[16:20] pure worship from angels
[16:22] angels think of that
[16:24] angels worshiping him
[16:26] day and night designated angels
[16:29] designated
[16:30] just to be in his presence
[16:33] beholding not even be able to behold his
[16:36] glory they have to keep their their
[16:38] their eyes and and their feet covered
[16:41] and they and then they have the wings to
[16:43] stay there and they're just
[16:45] they're in that that presence of jehovah
[16:49] of god
[16:50] and yet
[16:52] god could soak that in
[16:55] but he would rather come down and soak
[16:57] in your praise
[16:59] he left all of that perfection
[17:02] that he had created so that he could be
[17:05] god
[17:06] he left all of that
[17:09] to come down to earth to be with you and
[17:12] i
[17:13] so that he could understand what you go
[17:15] through and what you and i go through so
[17:18] that so that he could answer your prayer
[17:20] and that just like maybe he looked over
[17:23] and saw that little child with the
[17:24] scrape knee and compassion overwhelmed
[17:27] him and and leaked out of his eyes
[17:32] so that he could understand every
[17:34] situation
[17:35] that you would go through
[17:38] and that he could come down and touch
[17:40] you in your situation
[17:43] so i want you to get out of your mind
[17:45] this morning that your situation is too
[17:47] big for god
[17:49] or or that god doesn't hear your prayer
[17:51] god hears every prayer
[17:54] when daniel prayed the angel of the lord
[17:57] came to him
[17:59] and depending on seems like i studied
[18:01] that a long time ago and and i don't
[18:03] know but you could probably say that was
[18:05] jesus christ
[18:10] i'm growing a whole tree here this
[18:12] morning
[18:13] all the limbs but
[18:18] but he said daniel i heard you the first
[18:21] day that you prayed
[18:23] and i tried my hardest to get to you
[18:27] but there was a there was a dimension in
[18:29] the other round that i had to deal with
[18:32] the great
[18:34] prince of persia the devil himself
[18:36] fought me
[18:38] but but i had another angel come i think
[18:41] it might maybe that was what it was
[18:42] maybe it took christ to come and and
[18:45] fight the devil hold the devil off so
[18:47] gabriel could get through
[18:50] but he said i'm gonna i fought for you
[18:53] from day one to get down to you to
[18:55] answer your prayer
[18:57] i heard you the first time you uttered
[18:59] your voice
[19:02] there's a time and a season
[19:04] for prayers to be answered
[19:06] and we we don't understand that because
[19:09] we want it right now but but god knows
[19:11] all things
[19:13] and he knows just where you need to be
[19:15] and he knows maybe where just somebody
[19:17] else needs to be
[19:19] in order for him to come answer that
[19:22] in his full plan be made fulfilled
[19:28] so my title this morning is what god
[19:30] will do for one needy soul
[19:33] it's been a couple years since i
[19:34] preached this and it's been burning on
[19:36] my heart so
[19:37] here we are this morning and if there
[19:39] was only one soul that needed a redeemer
[19:41] to die
[19:43] i believe god still would have done it
[19:45] for that one needy soul
[19:50] if in all the earth
[19:52] if in all of seven thousand years
[19:55] six thousand that we've been here
[19:58] you were the only soul that needed
[19:59] saving
[20:01] jesus christ would have come and saved
[20:03] you the exact same way that he did
[20:06] because he set up his plan a certain way
[20:08] because he had certain attributes about
[20:10] himself and it had to be done a certain
[20:12] process had to be had to be taken care
[20:15] of in order for us to be saved and if
[20:17] you were that one person he would have
[20:19] done it for you
[20:24] brother branham says our scripture
[20:25] reading tonight is concerning a
[20:26] desperate man
[20:30] kyle i think read right from this
[20:32] a man by the name of juria
[20:35] jarius
[20:36] it was in the right in the middle of the
[20:37] ministry of our blessed redeemer savior
[20:40] when he was here on earth
[20:42] he spent much time in prayer he went up
[20:44] into the mountains and he prayed and a
[20:46] day before this he had just crossed over
[20:48] a sea all the way over a stormy sea to
[20:51] help one single person
[20:53] he went over to gadara to help a maniac
[20:55] over there that was bound in the tombs
[20:58] crossed over a stormy sea to help one
[21:00] man in trouble
[21:02] because one soul was calling to him
[21:07] and he's the same yesterday today and
[21:10] forever
[21:12] he come out of glory tonight come out of
[21:14] his his power to make one single person
[21:17] of this earth well tonight to help one
[21:19] person
[21:20] and i believe that he'd be there for
[21:22] each day thousands around the world
[21:26] excuse me
[21:28] where great campaigns are being held now
[21:30] in the closing up of the gentile
[21:31] dispensation
[21:33] may he come tonight
[21:36] now through study and i just i grabbed
[21:39] different things that um
[21:42] excuse me that
[21:43] brother branham said about this man
[21:51] i'mma preach through this if you don't
[21:52] mind
[21:55] the man was probably an upstanding
[21:57] citizen
[21:59] this is
[22:00] what kyle talked about this morning
[22:02] understanding where he came from
[22:05] the man was probably an upstanding
[22:06] citizen a young dedicated christian man
[22:12] let that sink in
[22:15] who had been just recently been married
[22:18] maybe with two or three children and a
[22:20] lovely wife
[22:21] he loved and everything
[22:24] wow that's brother branham going on a
[22:27] limb by the way his raw things he said
[22:32] no that's a prophet seeing it
[22:34] but he got with the wrong crowd
[22:37] and maybe that crowd encouraged him to
[22:39] drink or great or gamble or something
[22:42] brother branham said and listen careful
[22:46] he he took maybe they they talked him
[22:48] into taking his first drink
[22:50] brother branham said first drink first
[22:52] devil
[22:56] went home that evening and lied to his
[22:58] wife about where he had been and what he
[23:00] had done
[23:01] second devil
[23:04] on down he spiraled until he had fully
[23:06] surrendered himself to the devil
[23:12] i was doing some reading and this is
[23:13] some of the things that the lord was was
[23:15] speaking to me personally out of but i
[23:17] just thought that this was some amazing
[23:19] statements
[23:21] the author said sin will always take you
[23:24] further than you want to go
[23:26] sin will always do that
[23:29] it's progressive
[23:31] and it's subtly aggressive
[23:34] so it's progressive in that it takes you
[23:37] further than you want to go so it builds
[23:39] upon itself
[23:41] it's progressive it's always going to
[23:42] take you deeper take you lower
[23:47] but it's a subtle
[23:48] progression
[23:51] it's not it's not just
[23:53] you know
[23:54] the devil puts a
[23:56] a naked woman in front of you and you
[23:58] commit adultery
[24:00] usually there's something that leads up
[24:02] to it right
[24:04] maybe maybe uh uh you know i used jesus
[24:07] seeing a glimpse of a prostitute maybe
[24:09] it's a glimpse of of
[24:11] uh you know
[24:12] scantily dressed woman and then then it
[24:15] gets you into pornography and then it's
[24:17] on down on down until you find yourself
[24:19] committing adultery
[24:22] it's subtle but i say it's aggressive
[24:26] it's aggressive because you never
[24:28] thought you would become that way you
[24:30] never thought that you would go to that
[24:32] low but you did
[24:34] it's aggressive
[24:37] you think you're in control
[24:39] and then you find you lost control when
[24:42] you first yielded to it
[24:44] first string first devil
[24:48] first lie
[24:49] second devil
[24:51] you think you're in control of the
[24:52] situation maybe that man said you know
[24:55] what i'm i'm never going to do that
[24:56] again
[24:57] but he got back around his buddies their
[25:00] own crowd
[25:01] somebody he thought who is was his
[25:03] friend
[25:05] let me tell you if if you've got friends
[25:07] and they're they're trying to coax you
[25:09] into doing things that you know is wrong
[25:12] that's not your friend that person's
[25:14] being used to the devil
[25:17] let's just call it what it is that's not
[25:18] your friend
[25:20] and if you're doing that to somebody
[25:22] else you're not their friend
[25:24] and shame on you if you're doing it
[25:26] you need you need god
[25:28] you need to get to an altar
[25:30] but if somebody's doing that to you you
[25:32] need to recognize that and you need to
[25:34] leave that friendship
[25:36] let it go don't don't stay around and
[25:38] say well i'm going to save them one day
[25:40] no you're probably not they're going to
[25:42] get you filthier and filthier and take
[25:44] you down further and further
[25:46] i've seen it firsthand where someone
[25:48] goes and they say you know well i'm just
[25:50] going to witness to them i'm just going
[25:52] to do my best and god's really moving
[25:54] and god's doing things in their heart
[25:55] and that person is no longer serving the
[25:57] lord today
[26:00] what happened
[26:01] the influence reversed
[26:04] i i'll never forget that you've heard me
[26:07] say it and there's just certain things
[26:08] that have stuck out to me through life
[26:10] but you know this guy was saying if you
[26:12] put a white glove on and you stick it
[26:14] down into the mud
[26:15] the mud doesn't get glovy
[26:18] the glove gets muddy
[26:21] and you think well what about the power
[26:24] of god well the power of god says don't
[26:26] go there
[26:27] don't stick
[26:31] don't stick the white glove in the mud
[26:34] stupid
[26:40] right
[26:42] i only say stupid because i've done
[26:44] stupid things
[26:50] there's another problem that goes on
[26:52] within our soul within our heart
[26:55] the problem is we desire to stop
[26:59] a little less
[27:01] than we desire to keep going
[27:06] the problem is we desire to stop
[27:09] a little less than we desire to keep
[27:11] going
[27:14] and then he asks a question and he said
[27:16] are you more committed to your sin or to
[27:18] obeying god
[27:21] listen this isn't to belittle you
[27:24] this is to say be real
[27:26] be real with yourself and be real with
[27:28] god these are honest questions that you
[27:30] have to ask yourself
[27:35] but one thing that i learned about
[27:37] victory in my life that i didn't
[27:39] recognize before
[27:41] is stumbles and struggles do not equal
[27:44] failure
[27:46] stumbles and struggles do not equal
[27:48] failure
[27:50] you say boy i was doing so good and then
[27:52] i messed up but but but what's in your
[27:54] heart
[27:56] what's in your heart crying out to god
[27:59] and if you have that cry in your heart
[28:01] that's something that you need to latch
[28:03] onto
[28:05] that's a good thing that's a good sign
[28:07] that's that's that's building up to a
[28:10] victory i encourage you this morning
[28:12] keep going keep trying don't give up
[28:16] don't get discouraged keep bringing it
[28:18] to god keep repenting keep coming and
[28:21] and keep getting the strength of the
[28:23] holy ghost keep feeding on the word
[28:25] because eventually like brother paul
[28:28] preached you're going to turn around and
[28:30] you're going to realize that your
[28:31] taskmaster is now drowned
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:35] you'll see it but there's no power to it
[28:37] he said
[28:48] brother branham said if the devil can
[28:49] drive you into a bar room or out into
[28:51] the street immorally
[28:53] and doing let me see here
[29:00] so if the devil can drive you into a bar
[29:02] room or out in the street immorally or
[29:04] doing the things of the world which is
[29:06] contrary to your own nature
[29:10] because you were born to be a son and
[29:11] daughter of god
[29:14] and let these things sink in
[29:17] because these are deep things that can
[29:19] talk to the voice of the enemy in your
[29:20] life
[29:22] and the devil can make you do things and
[29:24] cheat on your husband cheat on your wife
[29:26] steal lie how much more can god do when
[29:30] he gets full possession of you
[29:32] don't don't discount the power of god
[29:36] don't give the devil more more
[29:38] power than he actually has because
[29:41] greater is he that is in you than he
[29:43] that's in the world so if you have jesus
[29:46] christ you have all the power you need
[29:48] to overcome the power that keeps binding
[29:50] you that keeps you running you into the
[29:52] gutter you have it in you
[29:55] not by your strength
[29:57] not by my not by power but by my spirit
[30:01] saith the lord can you overcome every
[30:04] temptation
[30:05] through every temptation god has made a
[30:08] way of escape
[30:09] and you have access to it you have the
[30:12] power within you to yield to the holy
[30:14] ghost to overcome these temptations if
[30:18] you'll just yield to it
[30:20] it's all in and what you want more
[30:23] and sometimes it's only just a little
[30:25] margin
[30:29] if the devil can bring some sickness on
[30:31] you that steals your energy and your
[30:33] strength
[30:34] if he can be so strong and hold somebody
[30:37] down
[30:38] through some sickness or affliction
[30:41] often times when brother branham was
[30:42] talking about this he'd say in a
[30:44] wheelchair
[30:46] or with the withered arm or on a crutch
[30:50] if satan has that power
[30:55] then how much stronger is the power of
[31:02] god how much stronger
[31:05] how many testimonies are out there
[31:08] of somebody bound in a wheelchair
[31:10] or somebody dying with cancer
[31:14] and i'm not i'm not trying to point
[31:16] backwards because we got plenty
[31:17] testimonies today
[31:20] but i'm just trying to show you that
[31:22] regardless no matter how strong the
[31:24] devil's hold is to bind you into a chair
[31:28] or to bind your mind up into something
[31:31] that that just is destroying your life
[31:34] how much greater is the power of god how
[31:37] many times have we seen god come down
[31:40] and rise up somebody from the chair
[31:43] throw away the crutches the mind battle
[31:47] ceases the heart is purified the the the
[31:50] the spirit is set free
[31:53] how many testimonies
[31:55] let's not give more power to the devil
[31:58] than what he deserves
[32:00] give the power to god that he deserves
[32:02] let your faith let your faith cut loose
[32:05] this morning
[32:07] let your faith grab a hold of god listen
[32:11] my whole point in going through that at
[32:14] the beginning
[32:15] you have god then then the word comes
[32:17] out and then he comes down and he's
[32:19] going through these things it's because
[32:20] god came down from heaven for one needy
[32:23] soul
[32:26] god came down from heaven for what you
[32:28] have need of this morning
[32:31] whatever it is you you put your you you
[32:34] name it
[32:39] you name it this morning
[32:40] and god came down for you
[32:45] but i'm not wanting to leave that back
[32:47] at some past event of jesus dying on the
[32:50] cross
[32:51] that's where it happened friends that's
[32:53] where it was that's
[32:55] that's exactly right
[32:58] but today this morning in this service
[33:01] god will come down from heaven
[33:04] for one needy soul
[33:07] if there's only one person here that
[33:09] gets something out of this
[33:12] god will have have arranged events
[33:17] not not saying me by all means i'm not
[33:19] saying me but so that a particular
[33:21] service goes a certain way a particular
[33:25] thing is said
[33:26] for you
[33:28] because you had need
[33:32] and and and god will bend heaven down
[33:37] and stoop down i got a scripture at the
[33:39] end that i just i was trying to find it
[33:40] when i found it i was rejoicing in the
[33:42] office
[33:44] because god will bend heaven down
[33:49] to come to you this morning
[34:03] the maniac of
[34:04] gadir completely out of his mind
[34:09] completely
[34:10] and they said that
[34:12] listen now we're talking about power and
[34:14] who's more powerful
[34:17] he was he had
[34:20] not him the devil had so much power in
[34:23] that man's life
[34:25] and he was so yielded
[34:27] to the devil
[34:29] the scripture says that
[34:31] remember when they cried out the demons
[34:34] and they said what do you have to do
[34:35] with us
[34:37] jesus said what's your name and they
[34:38] said legion
[34:40] for we are many
[34:43] when those demons were cast out
[34:46] two thousand pigs ran and drowned into
[34:48] the sea
[34:50] one man
[34:52] had two thousand devils on them
[34:55] and and what i love is just depending on
[34:57] the accounts you read brother kyle read
[34:59] it this morning jesus walked up and this
[35:02] has always been astounding to me and
[35:04] this is just the way that i believe it
[35:05] when the power of god comes down
[35:08] jesus spoke one word
[35:11] in matthew i think it was
[35:13] and all he said was
[35:14] go that's all he said was go
[35:18] jesus is out starting in his ministry
[35:20] and at the beginning of mark you'll find
[35:22] the man as he's preaching and teaching
[35:24] the the the people listening are saying
[35:28] this is nothing like we've heard before
[35:32] maybe it was the same things that
[35:33] they've always heard
[35:35] but they said this man is speaking with
[35:37] authority
[35:39] he's speaking with authority we've never
[35:41] heard it like this before and then jesus
[35:44] astounds them a little bit more
[35:46] and it's and it's devils people bringing
[35:49] actually it was a man in the synagogue
[35:51] with an unclean spirit
[35:53] and it cries out and it says we know who
[35:56] you are you son of god
[35:59] and you know what it said jesus said you
[36:01] know what don't shut up
[36:04] that's right he just shuts the devil's
[36:06] up
[36:06] because he wasn't quite ready for for it
[36:09] to be known who he was
[36:11] and so he says
[36:12] hold your peace go out of the man
[36:16] and that was it
[36:18] the devil might have screamed i think it
[36:20] screeched and
[36:21] thrashed itself but it had to go because
[36:24] jesus spoke
[36:25] because the power of god had come down
[36:27] and there was a needy soul there
[36:29] and and and you know we get we get
[36:31] caught up on on the the physical things
[36:34] that we can see but these are spiritual
[36:36] matters that god is taking control of
[36:39] and that god's speaking to because
[36:41] because there's one soul there
[36:44] that is bound up and and liberty
[36:47] is is so important to god
[36:50] he wants you to be able to worship in
[36:52] freedom and when you're worshiping and
[36:54] you're trying to worship with sin in
[36:55] your life and
[36:57] you can't give yourself freely that's a
[36:59] needy soul
[37:01] god wants to come down and get to you so
[37:03] that you can worship him freely and it's
[37:06] not and it's and yeah it's pouring out
[37:08] your love upon god but it's so that he
[37:10] can pour his love out upon you
[37:14] he wants you to get the full benefit of
[37:16] worshiping him of relationship it's
[37:19] relationship
[37:21] but god
[37:26] jesus
[37:27] saw this man
[37:29] no doubt in a vision
[37:31] and he was there and the multitudes were
[37:34] great with him
[37:36] and jesus no doubt knowing
[37:39] when we hit the water
[37:41] shortly after
[37:43] there's going to be a storm
[37:46] and that was why it was so important
[37:48] jesus could have just said let's get in
[37:50] the boat
[37:53] and
[37:54] sail
[37:56] north
[37:59] he could have left it at that
[38:00] but he turned around knowing what was
[38:02] coming
[38:03] and he tells his disciples
[38:06] let's go over to the other side
[38:09] that should have been enough i don't
[38:11] want to spend too much time on this
[38:12] because brother paul was on it wednesday
[38:14] but he said that should have been enough
[38:17] but the disciples like
[38:19] just
[38:20] the waves came brother branham said
[38:22] there was a thousand devils on every
[38:24] wave sitting there
[38:25] and they're thinking we're gonna sink
[38:27] the ship
[38:28] we got him now he is in our clutch
[38:32] sea is so much more unstable than land
[38:34] we're going to get him
[38:36] he has no idea what he just but then
[38:38] jesus comes later and he says you know
[38:40] what
[38:41] i'm going to answer that call too i'm
[38:43] just going to step out on the stormy
[38:44] weave waves and walk them
[38:48] show the devil he's he's god of the of
[38:50] the land and god of the sea
[38:54] and he's god of the heart this morning
[38:56] and he's god of the mind and he's god of
[38:58] the soul
[39:01] and so he encountered the storm and all
[39:03] these devils on the way over
[39:06] just because one man
[39:09] the the town the city turned them out
[39:12] they said we don't want you here
[39:14] you just you just tore up our livelihood
[39:16] we don't want you here
[39:19] why don't you leave
[39:21] jesus says
[39:22] no problem
[39:24] i got the man i came for
[39:26] amen i got the one i came for
[39:30] there was a multitude that should have
[39:32] been crying out to god because they they
[39:34] all needed this this christ
[39:37] but there was one man
[39:40] jesus said i don't know where it's at in
[39:43] my notes i don't see it and i thought it
[39:44] was here
[39:47] yeah whoops
[39:56] then i lost my train of thought
[40:03] oh there was there was a couple of
[40:05] things g that brother branham said about
[40:07] this man
[40:10] that man was so insane
[40:12] he couldn't cry out for himself
[40:16] so watch watch this now watch the depth
[40:19] of of the power of god of the love of
[40:22] god
[40:24] the man couldn't cry out for himself
[40:27] he was he was
[40:29] too submitted to the devil
[40:31] brother branham said he would come to
[40:32] himself maybe and
[40:34] and
[40:36] he would say what am i doing here and
[40:37] then brother branham said the devil
[40:39] would come right back on him
[40:41] because he don't want him to come to his
[40:42] mind because then he might start
[40:44] believing that there's that he might
[40:45] start crying out to god
[40:48] so before he could have the opportunity
[40:50] the devil would come on him and send him
[40:52] right back
[40:53] but there was a soul down in there
[40:56] and though the devil could stop the lips
[40:58] he couldn't stop the heart
[41:00] that heart was crying out
[41:02] and then brother branham said that there
[41:04] was some gray-headed mama
[41:06] that was praying for this young man
[41:08] somewhere
[41:10] and then he said maybe his wife was
[41:12] praying for him
[41:14] so i want to encourage you this morning
[41:17] gray-headed mama
[41:19] don't stop praying
[41:21] you wife don't stop praying
[41:24] because you send the power of the holy
[41:27] ghost out
[41:28] when that soul isn't crying out himself
[41:33] you have the power within you now
[41:37] to overtake
[41:39] however many devils that that young
[41:41] person has on them that's right that
[41:44] that husband has on him that that wife
[41:46] has on her
[41:47] you have the power to call heaven down
[41:53] and god will bend heaven
[41:56] for one needy soul
[41:59] so i tell you this morning don't stop
[42:02] crying out
[42:05] keep crying out
[42:07] you say but every time i cry they get
[42:10] worse of course
[42:12] of course
[42:14] because you're crying out
[42:16] and the devil knows his days are
[42:18] numbered
[42:20] when the voice of god came brother
[42:22] paul's been saying it when the voice of
[42:24] god came pharaoh's days were numbered
[42:27] when your voice cries out to god
[42:31] the devil's days are numbered
[42:35] but i want you to understand something i
[42:37] want you to really catch this
[42:39] it's not your power
[42:41] but it is power within you
[42:44] because
[42:46] if you jesus said
[42:48] if
[42:49] you abide in me and my word abides in
[42:51] you
[42:53] if the word abides in you that makes you
[42:55] the word
[42:56] right let's reason just a little bit
[43:00] and if you're the word
[43:02] and jesus was the word
[43:04] then you're the same it's the same as
[43:06] jesus christ calling out for that soul
[43:10] you are his lips amen
[43:13] you are you become the heart of god
[43:16] crying out
[43:18] for a need
[43:20] that's good
[43:22] now i don't want to i'm going to take
[43:23] this off of the maniac of gadira for a
[43:25] minute because i want you to just see
[43:28] how important this is to god
[43:32] jesus comes back from
[43:35] delivering the maniac
[43:38] and he steps onto the shore
[43:41] and he starts walking down a particular
[43:43] path
[43:45] jesus hits shore
[43:49] he can go this way
[43:50] and go that way
[43:52] he can go this way and go that way
[43:54] he could go that way this way
[43:56] that way
[43:58] back that way
[43:59] over this way
[44:01] but jesus starts walking
[44:05] and there's a multitude that's following
[44:06] him
[44:08] and along the way
[44:11] jarius comes
[44:13] and says can you come by my house my
[44:16] daughter's sick
[44:19] jesus took a particular path because
[44:21] there was one needy soul
[44:24] in jerius's house
[44:28] it was a dead girl
[44:29] she was gonna die
[44:31] she was really sick on the way there
[44:34] they come out and met her and said you
[44:36] know what it's too late forget it just
[44:38] don't bother him she's dead
[44:41] but there was a needy soul in there
[44:44] look at look it
[44:46] i just feel like we're hitting the devil
[44:48] this morning
[44:50] the devil said you know what
[44:52] i'm going to take her last breath
[44:54] i'm going to take her last breath and
[44:56] that's it
[44:58] then god can't do nothing for
[45:01] but jesus says
[45:03] i am the way
[45:04] the truth and the life
[45:09] no man can come to the father but by me
[45:13] so jesus says satan
[45:16] you took her last breath
[45:20] whatever the girl is
[45:21] daughter
[45:22] i give you your breath back
[45:25] took her by the hand
[45:28] and said get her something to eat
[45:34] just to show
[45:36] that you know what this girl isn't i
[45:39] didn't bring her back and she's gonna
[45:40] remain sick
[45:42] so sick that she can't eat
[45:44] he said you know what she's fully
[45:46] restored give her something to eat
[45:48] [Applause]
[45:50] but along that same path that jesus
[45:52] walked that day to get to jerius's house
[45:55] there was another woman
[45:57] and this woman had an issue of the blood
[46:01] you don't think jesus knew what he was
[46:03] doing
[46:04] when he took this particular path
[46:07] and that woman was so in need
[46:11] that's why god can come down in a
[46:13] service and he can talk
[46:15] and and hit so many different lives
[46:18] because
[46:19] i just picture jesus walking through the
[46:21] aisles
[46:23] and as he's walking you're touching him
[46:26] your need is touching jesus
[46:29] it reaches out and it grabs a hole it
[46:31] just reaches and and
[46:34] touches the hem of the garment
[46:37] touches touches
[46:38] his pant leg as it were just
[46:41] that it's your heart it's your need
[46:44] but god took that particular path that
[46:46] day
[46:47] and that woman just
[46:49] so
[46:51] ashamed probably an outcast
[46:54] i imagine that she was just so
[46:56] distraught because this was so many
[46:58] years that she's dealt with this thing
[47:00] and the devil kept telling her you're
[47:02] going to deal with this all your life
[47:05] and could you imagine that imagine how
[47:07] needy this woman was that she's walking
[47:11] she starts crawling through the
[47:12] multitude just to just to reach and
[47:14] catch his garment as he walked by
[47:17] could you imagine i mean this is throngs
[47:19] of people
[47:20] and and she just she just had to reach
[47:23] through so many legs just just a touch
[47:26] just to touch his garment
[47:28] but she said i know that if i can just
[47:30] touch
[47:33] the outer skirt of what he's wearing
[47:36] then i have enough faith in this man
[47:39] that he's going to love me enough i know
[47:41] that this is god
[47:44] and i know that my need can touch him
[47:46] this morning
[47:48] and she touched it
[47:50] and jesus out of all these people
[47:53] could you i just
[47:55] uh just imagine
[47:58] all these people
[48:02] jesus you're all the people
[48:04] and i'm jesus and jesus is walking and
[48:06] he stops
[48:09] and he turns around
[48:11] and he starts looking around and he said
[48:13] who touched me
[48:15] and the disciples were like
[48:18] he did just heal the maniac
[48:21] maybe he's losing it
[48:25] but jesus says no no you don't
[48:27] understand you don't understand what
[48:29] touched me
[48:32] there was a need that just touched me
[48:35] and he finds her way in the back
[48:38] and he says woman
[48:40] you're healed amen
[48:41] that's right
[48:43] you're healed
[48:45] thy faith has made thee whole
[48:49] jesus took that path
[48:51] for one needy soul
[48:53] amen
[48:59] there was three women
[49:00] had need of being set free from bondage
[49:03] of sin
[49:05] jesus was at each place at the
[49:08] appropriate time
[49:11] jesus sitting in the house of simon the
[49:14] pharisee he accepted that invitation no
[49:17] doubt knowing
[49:19] that he was going to be rejected that
[49:21] day
[49:23] but there was a needy soul crying out to
[49:25] him
[49:26] he had an appointment
[49:28] that he had to keep
[49:30] and it wasn't with simon the pharisee
[49:33] it was with a harlot amen
[49:37] remember when he was 12 years old maybe
[49:40] he saw and compassion went out
[49:42] and so this particular need was personal
[49:44] to him
[49:48] and as he's sitting there and the
[49:49] party's going on this woman comes and
[49:51] she brings she spends all she has to buy
[49:54] this oil to anoint his feet
[49:56] and jesus sitting there completely
[49:59] rejected
[50:00] that's right
[50:03] and that woman comes and she starts
[50:05] crying pouring out her need on jesus's
[50:07] feet just if i could just touch him
[50:11] and maybe you have that in your heart
[50:12] this morning if i could just touch him
[50:14] if i could just touch jesus
[50:17] touching jesus is all that really
[50:18] matters
[50:20] and then your life will never be the
[50:22] same
[50:24] but there's only one way to touch him
[50:27] just believe
[50:29] when you call on his name
[50:32] and that woman believed
[50:34] that she could get something from jesus
[50:36] that day
[50:38] and i imagine that it just tore up to be
[50:40] sitting there watching jesus completely
[50:43] rejected
[50:45] and so she rushes in and she she starts
[50:47] crying over his feet and she's pouring
[50:50] out her
[50:51] her guilt and her shame that she felt
[50:54] she's just
[50:55] just hoping
[50:56] hoping believing that this man is
[50:58] different from the others that maybe
[51:00] he'll give her what she stands in need
[51:01] of
[51:03] she feels bound by the shame and the
[51:05] guilt and the lifestyle that she's had
[51:10] jesus discerns the thoughts of the
[51:11] hearts going around him and he says let
[51:13] me ask you something
[51:15] simon
[51:17] who's more grateful
[51:20] if you owed 500 talents and and if she
[51:23] owes 500 talents and you only owe 50
[51:25] who's gonna be more thankful
[51:27] if i write off that debt that's right
[51:30] and he says well 50 i guess
[51:35] well done and then he turns to her and
[51:37] he says thy sins are forgiven me amen
[51:40] and can you imagine that needy soul how
[51:42] she felt that day hearing those words
[51:45] knowing that this man is different
[51:47] seeing the miracles and the signs and
[51:49] wonders that he's done hearing his his
[51:52] voice hearing the way he speaks is with
[51:54] authority knowing that this man could
[51:56] make a difference in my life
[52:00] and god gives her what she needed
[52:03] another time there's a harlot another
[52:05] woman another prostitute
[52:08] caught this is
[52:10] if i read the scripture right she's
[52:11] caught in the act of adultery
[52:14] probably set up because the pharisees
[52:16] bring her to jesus
[52:19] throws her at the feet and they say now
[52:21] we got him
[52:23] that devil that was anointing those men
[52:25] says now we got him
[52:28] this is what the law says
[52:31] what do you say
[52:33] i noticed something in each of these
[52:35] things is
[52:36] the religious of that day
[52:39] went back to the law
[52:41] held on to the law
[52:44] but jesus said but there's a needy soul
[52:46] here
[52:49] he said i'm the fulfillment of the law
[52:52] so she's thrown at his feet
[52:55] and the accusers pick up stones and
[52:57] they're going to stone her but jesus
[53:00] doesn't even respond to their question
[53:03] listen this is this is what i'm trying
[53:05] to get to you this morning is that god
[53:07] is answering needs in a much deeper way
[53:10] because
[53:11] it wasn't a sincere question first of
[53:13] all but even if it was jesus starts
[53:16] dealing with them with their heart
[53:18] not what they were trying to do to this
[53:20] woman
[53:21] but jesus listen she had need of
[53:24] somebody to stand up for
[53:28] she had a need she was in a lifestyle
[53:29] that she felt trapped in
[53:32] she's trapped by the devil but jesus
[53:34] comes along and he starts dealing with
[53:36] the accuser
[53:38] and then it's just him and her there
[53:41] jesus bent down probably writing their
[53:44] sins in the sand
[53:46] and he told him he said if you're if
[53:48] you're if you don't have any sin in your
[53:50] life go ahead and cast the first stone
[53:52] and then he drop back down and he starts
[53:54] writing again
[53:56] and they they slowly it says from the
[53:58] oldest down to the youngest they start
[53:59] dropping their stones because they
[54:01] realize i can't justly throw this with
[54:03] what he just said
[54:05] i'm just as guilty look at he's putting
[54:07] i don't want him hey don't put my name
[54:09] next to that let's get out of here
[54:10] before he does
[54:13] and jesus just not even
[54:16] in that world to himself
[54:19] i'll tell you who was in that world with
[54:20] him that day
[54:22] was that woman standing behind him
[54:23] crying
[54:24] fearing for a life
[54:27] they were in a world together
[54:30] because she had need
[54:31] and jesus went by that way
[54:33] that day
[54:35] and so he stands up and he turns around
[54:39] and he just looks around and she's
[54:41] crying and maybe too afraid to look up
[54:43] at him
[54:45] he says
[54:46] hey woman
[54:48] and she looks up
[54:50] he says where's your accusers
[54:54] they're not around
[54:56] and then jesus spoke to that woman's
[54:58] need
[54:59] that went deeper than even a physical
[55:01] healing
[55:02] went down into her soul
[55:04] and he said woman i don't accuse you
[55:06] either
[55:07] go and sin no more
[55:09] and that you know what if you think
[55:11] about it go and sin no more
[55:13] that woman didn't want to live that
[55:15] lifestyle
[55:16] and jesus not only took care of her
[55:18] guilt and her shame for what she had
[55:20] done
[55:21] he gives her an opportunity
[55:24] go this way
[55:25] don't sin no more you can live a new
[55:27] life from this day forward
[55:30] jesus gave that woman new life
[55:39] the woman at the well are you still with
[55:40] me
[55:43] the woman at the well
[55:46] the bible says jesus had need
[55:49] to go by samaria
[55:52] we all know the story the need jesus had
[55:55] was to meet the need of this woman
[55:57] he had an appointment that he had to
[55:59] make
[56:00] there was a need from samaria crying out
[56:04] to god
[56:05] stuck in her sin and her shame stuck in
[56:08] the lifestyle she was living in but but
[56:10] but she had touched god with the cry of
[56:13] her heart
[56:14] not knowing how to get out of it and so
[56:16] jesus says his disciples i have need to
[56:18] go by samaria and they're thinking
[56:21] samaria we hate the samaritans
[56:24] why do you got to go by samaria we can
[56:26] go around samaria
[56:28] but jesus said no no i have need
[56:31] there's a need in samaria
[56:37] jesus went
[56:38] broke all the culture of that day
[56:41] broke all that satan had put in the
[56:43] culture for that day
[56:45] all
[56:46] he went against all odds
[56:49] the cultural separation not
[56:52] despite what she was
[56:55] but he had need but that woman had a
[56:57] question on her heart too
[57:00] and that question was where is true
[57:02] worship supposed to take place
[57:05] you you jews you say this and and we say
[57:08] this but and now you're saying it's in
[57:10] jerusalem but i'm not allowed in
[57:12] jerusalem so where do i go to worship
[57:15] and jesus answered it and said woman let
[57:18] me tell you something
[57:20] it's not a physical place
[57:22] it's in your heart and that's what
[57:24] touched me
[57:25] your heart is what touched me this
[57:27] morning
[57:29] in spirit and in truth
[57:40] so just as i bring this down to a close
[57:44] what's your situation this morning
[57:48] what do you need god to step into
[57:53] jesus said he cast demons out by the
[57:55] finger of god
[57:57] jesus just cast out two thousand devils
[58:01] by the little finger of god
[58:03] brother kyle said this morning he said
[58:05] then what do we have to be afraid of
[58:08] if that's what god if that's what jesus
[58:11] was walking around casting devils out
[58:13] when he had the full he was the fullness
[58:15] of god
[58:16] and he says listen it's just my little
[58:19] finger
[58:20] just hit him in the right spot and they
[58:22] got to go
[58:26] by the little finger of god
[58:30] and i
[58:31] you know it's not it's not downing when
[58:33] people jump and shout and and scream
[58:36] under the anointing of god but
[58:38] you don't have to jump for it this
[58:40] morning
[58:41] you don't have to jump for god to get a
[58:43] hold of your need
[58:45] to see you it's it's your heart's cry
[58:48] your heart crying out to god is what
[58:50] touches god
[58:53] let me just find i want to read this and
[58:55] of david psalms 18.
[59:03] psalms 18 and verse 1.
[59:10] god's in you through the life of the
[59:11] holy ghost
[59:13] just let your faith go this morning
[59:17] what if i don't have enough faith
[59:22] i wish you'd stop thinking that right
[59:26] i wish i would stop thinking that
[59:30] stop thinking that and trust the pool
[59:33] you feel in your heart
[59:35] and just let your faith go
[59:38] just just yield to the call that's in
[59:40] here
[59:42] not what satan's telling you up here
[59:44] yield to the call that's in here amen
[59:48] and just say lord i believe that's right
[59:52] jesus was tired and weary when he was
[59:54] crossing
[59:56] but there was one soul calling out for
[59:57] god
[1:00:02] and then this is where i found
[1:00:06] we said this earlier about the mom
[1:00:07] praying the wife
[1:00:14] brother branham said
[1:00:16] love is how you cast devils out
[1:00:20] it's not getting the person and beating
[1:00:22] them in the back
[1:00:24] it's not dragging them to the altar
[1:00:28] it's it's love
[1:00:30] remember that quote he said the man was
[1:00:32] coming home from the meetings and he was
[1:00:34] so
[1:00:35] so on fire for god that he'd come home
[1:00:38] and he'd grab his wife and he'd start
[1:00:39] shaking her and he'd start come out of
[1:00:41] her devil come out of her
[1:00:44] and that
[1:00:45] totally turned her off from anything of
[1:00:47] god
[1:00:49] and brother branham
[1:00:52] says you know well that's okay
[1:00:55] but that's not how you cast the devil
[1:00:57] out
[1:00:58] you cast the devil out by loving that
[1:01:00] person amen
[1:01:05] psalms 18 and verse 1
[1:01:08] i will love thee o lord my strength the
[1:01:10] lord is my rock and my fortress and my
[1:01:13] deliverer
[1:01:14] my god my strength and whom i will trust
[1:01:17] my buckler and the horn of my salvation
[1:01:19] in my high tower
[1:01:21] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[1:01:23] to be praised
[1:01:25] so shall i be saved from mine enemies
[1:01:28] the sorrows of death compassed me and
[1:01:30] the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
[1:01:35] the sorrows of hell compassed me about
[1:01:38] the snares of death prevented me
[1:01:43] i can i can just hear the devil saying
[1:01:45] you're going to hell
[1:01:48] in my distress i called upon the lord
[1:01:51] and cried unto my god he heard my voice
[1:01:54] out of his temple and my cry came before
[1:01:57] him even into his ears
[1:01:59] then the earth shook and trembled and
[1:02:01] the foundations also of the hills moved
[1:02:04] and were shaken because he was wrath
[1:02:07] there went up a smoke out of his
[1:02:09] nostrils and a fire out of his mouth
[1:02:11] devoured coals were kindled by it he
[1:02:14] bowed the heavens also and came down and

[1:03:27] hailstones and coals of fire yeah he
[1:03:29] sent out his arrows and scattered them
[1:03:31] and he shot out lightnings and
[1:03:33] discomforted them

[1:03:40] and the foundations of the world were
[1:03:42] discovered at thy rebukel lord at the
[1:03:45] blast of the breath of thy nostrils he
[1:03:47] sent from above he took me he drew me

[1:03:58] calamity but the lord was my stay
[1:04:01] he brought me forth also into a large
[1:04:04] place
