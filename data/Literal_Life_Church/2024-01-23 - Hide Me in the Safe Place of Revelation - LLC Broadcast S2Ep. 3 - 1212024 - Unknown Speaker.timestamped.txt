[1:31] so yes he
[1:34] can sometimes those voices try to tell
[1:38] me I'm forgotten and I'm falling too far
[1:43] from his hand but I know what kind of
[1:48] God he is and I'm trusting in his
[1:51] promises I'm believing and I'm
[1:54] singing yes he came oh did he move Every
[2:00] Mountain did he part every sea yes he
[2:05] did so yes
[2:08] he oh did he defeat the darkness did he
[2:14] deliver me yes he did so yes he came oh
[2:22] yes he did so yes he can cuz I've seen
[2:28] too much now I can't
[2:32] deny I know he's come through every
[2:36] single
[2:38] time from the beginning until the end he
[2:44] did he will he
[2:50] can did he move Every Mountain did he

[3:25] he did he defeat the darkness did he
[3:30] deler me yes he did oh yes he can oh yes
[3:38] he did so yes he
[3:42] did yes he
[3:45] did yes
[3:49] he though a host should encamp against
[3:52] me my heart shall not fear though War
[3:55] should rise against me in this will I be
[3:57] confident one thing have I I desired of
[4:00] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[4:03] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[4:04] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[4:07] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[4:10] every day he wanted to dwell in the
[4:12] dwelling place of the Lord and that was
[4:14] his one desire above money above riches
[4:18] above business above anything we need
[4:20] one main desire and that's to stay in
[4:23] the presence of the Lord for in the time
[4:25] of trouble now to me this is a prophetic
[4:28] t uh scripture for our time and we know
[4:33] that in the history of Israel God's
[4:35] people Israel the Jews we know they they
[4:38] come to times of extreme trouble time of
[4:40] trouble Daniel speaks of a time of
[4:42] trouble for the children of Israel and
[4:45] uh so we we realize that'll uh begin to
[4:48] climax towards we get to getting to end
[4:51] time events the trouble will be that the
[4:54] whole world will surround Israel and
[4:56] come against Israel and the whole and
[4:58] armies will surround so now when when
[5:01] David says he's feeling that there's
[5:03] armies encamped about me Israel will go
[5:06] through the same thing and prophecy that
[5:08] they'll be encamped the enemy will be
[5:10] encamped around we spiritually go
[5:12] through what Israel will go through
[5:14] literally and so then he says one thing
[5:16] I have a desire of the Lord and then he
[5:17] says in the time of trouble verse 5 for
[5:19] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[5:22] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[5:25] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[5:27] me up upon a rock that that has a lot of
[5:30] Revelation in it to tell us where this
[5:32] is at number one it's the secret of his
[5:35] Tabernacle it's not out there publicly
[5:37] openly it'll be a secret as to where
[5:39] God's dwelling place is but for the
[5:41] people of God he will show them where he
[5:44] is so that they can live in his
[5:46] presence this last part I want to give
[5:49] he shall set me up upon a rock how many
[5:51] know in the Bible that rock means
[5:54] Revelation so what do we what what is
[5:57] our secret place it's really the re
[5:59] reation that God has given us and you
[6:01] know you can't give yourself a
[6:02] revelation it comes directly he told
[6:05] Peter he says flesh and blood has not
[6:07] revealed this you didn't learn it in
[6:08] seminary my father has given you this
[6:11] Revelation Satan can't get it can't get
[6:13] his grubby mitts on it but when he gives
[6:15] you a revelation it becomes the hiding
[6:18] place and it becomes the
[6:21] stability can you say amen and now shall
[6:24] mine head be lifted up above mine
[6:27] enemies round about me therefore will I
[6:29] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[6:32] Joy I will sing you know what a Believer
[6:34] does when he's surrounded by demon power
[6:38] he raises his hands his head's lifted
[6:40] above all of it and he just starts to
[6:42] praise the Lord and then the devil gets
[6:45] more mad can you say Amen I'm so glad in
[6:48] my trials and troubles I can lift my
[6:50] hands and give a song to the Lord I want
[6:53] to title this today hide me in the safe
[6:56] place of Revelation hide me in the safe
[6:59] place of
[7:01] Revelation while the bride is called
[7:03] into a revelation for the Rapture and
[7:06] that's what we were saying last Sunday
[7:08] that it's actually a revelation the
[7:11] Rapture is a revelation just before our
[7:14] deliverance just before our ultimate
[7:16] deliverance we realize that the
[7:19] increased pressure the armies gathered
[7:21] around us the the pressure will not
[7:23] decrease but it will increase so much so
[7:26] that sometimes mentally we don't know if
[7:28] we can handle it the only cry that we
[7:31] can cry is what David said hide me in
[7:34] your secret place during this time and I
[7:37] believe that's the the the place that
[7:38] you're living in that develops this
[7:40] rapturing Faith builds this rapturing
[7:42] Faith but we know there's great pressure
[7:44] on the outside how many can say Amen
[7:46] there's great pressure on the outside
[7:48] the heat has been turned up on the bride
[7:50] can you say Amen it it it is is it's
[7:54] it's it's in such an an increased state
[7:56] that it's hard to Fathom how much more
[7:59] press pressure can come and and I just
[8:01] want to say this that if that pressure
[8:03] is too much for you and you want that
[8:06] pressure off of you then just stop
[8:08] standing up for the right
[8:12] things if you don't if you can't handle
[8:14] the pressure of this hour then just stop
[8:17] standing for things because a lot of
[8:18] your pressure is because you're standing
[8:21] up for something you're standing for the
[8:23] message of the hour um I'm going to
[8:26] elaborate on that a little bit later but
[8:28] but if you if you don't like the
[8:29] pressure stop stop living a holy
[8:34] life I want to say that it's the one
[8:37] standing on Revelation that are being
[8:39] surrounded and encamped by
[8:42] demons the ones that are experiencing
[8:45] criticism heavy criticism is probably
[8:47] the ones that are making a stand and if
[8:50] you want an easy life without a lot of
[8:52] demons against you then just be a
[8:54] borderline believer today because
[8:56] there's a lot less pressure on a
[8:58] borderline believer but when a Believer
[9:00] makes a stand for the truth and wants to
[9:02] live in Holiness and live in
[9:04] sanctification and stand I believe this
[9:07] message with all my heart get ready for
[9:09] more
[9:10] pressure it's the ones that are making a
[9:12] stand that get more criticism and if you
[9:15] can't take the heat stay out of the
[9:18] kitchen yeah you can release a lot of
[9:21] pressure can you say am man you can get
[9:22] out of a lot of this if you don't make a
[9:24] stand for anything and uh you can you
[9:27] know you can be out of a lot of matter
[9:29] of fact you can there's choices you can
[9:31] make to just release a lot of pressure
[9:33] in your life and just kind of take the
[9:35] normal uh status of this world or maybe
[9:37] a borderline believer it'd be a lot less
[9:39] pressure than this but once you begin to
[9:42] stand once you begin to articulate and
[9:44] speak this message and speak what you
[9:46] believe whatever environment it is if
[9:49] you do that get ready for more pressure
[9:51] and it's not people as much as it is
[9:53] demons don't like somebody to make a
[9:55] stand right amen amen so so you know and
[10:00] and and you got to take a stand for
[10:01] things you think that the trouble in
[10:03] this world is the economy or you think
[10:05] the trouble is the scare of War uh you
[10:08] think your trouble is you don't have
[10:09] enough money to meet your bills this
[10:10] week you think that's my trouble I don't
[10:12] have enough money that's not really your
[10:14] trouble when the Bible says it's a time
[10:16] of trouble it's not it's not that you
[10:18] can't meet your bills this week it's a
[10:21] much deeper trouble than that and I'm
[10:24] not beling that trouble in your life we
[10:26] all have trouble but the trouble the
[10:28] Bible is speaking of is not not just
[10:29] that some friend forsake you or or or
[10:31] you don't have enough money or you lost
[10:33] your job your trouble as standing for a
[10:36] Believer your trouble is a lot deeper
[10:38] than that David was talking about a much
[10:40] deeper trouble a armies encamped around
[10:44] him everything against him can you say
[10:46] amen and so the the the scare of war and
[10:49] money trouble your your trouble is not
[10:51] really that it's much deeper than that
[10:53] and my son so told me something a few
[10:55] weeks ago he said you know I'm learning
[10:57] that there are people that are that
[11:00] drama is so normal in their life they
[11:03] can't live without
[11:05] it I said son that is so true and Lord
[11:09] help me not to be that way drama and
[11:12] something going on in the church and
[11:14] this and that and the other they they
[11:16] live in a soap opera and how many know
[11:19] soap operas aren't
[11:20] real it's a soap opera and they present
[11:24] that as real life but it's not really
[11:25] real life it's a soap opera people like
[11:28] soap opera is going on the church wonder
[11:30] what the pastor why is he doing that why
[11:32] is she why is she doing that why she
[11:33] doing and so they they live in that
[11:35] because it's so normal to them if they
[11:37] come out of that they wouldn't know how
[11:38] to
[11:44] live they like drama they like a good
[11:47] scrap they like a good fight they like
[11:49] competition between families they they
[11:52] create it cuz you are a
[11:54] Creator amen the pressure to choose
[11:58] sides to pull you down but then I go
[12:01] back to that scripture that David said
[12:03] God Is Lifting Me Above All these things
[12:07] can you say amen and I can raise my hand
[12:09] he's going to set me upon the rock of
[12:11] Revelation above my enemies now when you
[12:14] say above it doesn't mean I'm better
[12:15] than my enemies but I'm above it in
[12:18] other words I can live above it I can
[12:20] live in that secret place I can live
[12:23] upon a rock and I got up on the chair
[12:25] last week he said I'm living up here and
[12:26] all down here they're saying come on
[12:28] down fight with us come on down into my
[12:30] fear I'm nervous about stuff can you be
[12:32] nervous with me no I'm not I'm just
[12:34] praising the Lord I will pray for you
[12:36] but I'm not coming down to that level
[12:38] I'm I that you know that's not where I
[12:41] want to live and when God is Raising you
[12:45] to a to higher levels get ready for more
[12:50] [Music]
[12:52] Devils that was borrowed from borrowed
[12:54] from TD
[12:56] Jakes when you want to go to the nextev
[12:58] level get ready for more
[13:01] Devils cuz you can't go to the next
[13:04] level spiritually unless there's a fight
[13:07] to keep you
[13:08] away it's just the way it works because
[13:10] you're making a stand you're making a
[13:12] better stand you're making a higher
[13:14] stand and you don't want to be brought
[13:16] down how many would rais their hand say
[13:17] I don't want to be brought down by
[13:19] people living in fear I don't want to be
[13:21] living with a Jonah can you say amen I
[13:23] want to be praised in the Lord all the
[13:25] time no matter what I'm going through
[13:27] can you say Amen you get up here said no
[13:29] I'm not coming down there why don't you
[13:30] come up here with me and praise the Lord
[13:32] a while why don't you come out of that
[13:34] fear I just want to go into this
[13:36] prophecy of Israel just a little bit the
[13:37] theme of Prophecy for Israel is to in
[13:40] Prophecy to become surrounded by the
[13:42] enemy literally the world against them
[13:45] and many Jews see and believe prophecy
[13:48] of
[13:49] Deliverance they believe it today that
[13:51] their Messiah will deliver them they
[13:53] believe the the the Deliverance part but
[13:55] they don't see what comes before their
[13:57] Deliverance
[13:59] they don't understand that and there
[14:01] will be great armies gather around that
[14:04] uh that uh piece of land there and it's
[14:07] not because of the piece of land
[14:09] necessarily but it's who's there and
[14:11] God's people and so we see then that the
[14:15] the armies I'm going to skip some of
[14:16] this because some of some of this is
[14:18] revisiting what I've already preached on
[14:20] before but I just wanted to bring in
[14:22] this element of Israel literally now and
[14:24] so if you turn with me to Daniel 12
[14:26] we'll see something happen here when all
[14:28] the armies gather around just after all
[14:31] the armies uh in Prophecy all surround
[14:35] Israel in Daniel CH 12 and at that time
[14:40] and this is a time where the pressure
[14:42] will come shall Michael stand up the
[14:44] great Prince which standeth for the
[14:47] children of thy people and there shall
[14:49] be a time of trouble such has never was
[14:53] since there was a nation even to that
[14:55] same time now Israel had a lot of
[14:57] trouble through the years they had 6,000
[14:59] years of trouble they had times of
[15:01] trouble they had times when they went
[15:02] Rebellion against God and they went into
[15:04] Babylon into captivity they had a lot of
[15:07] troubling times but this scripture says
[15:09] at the end they've never had any trouble
[15:12] compared to this trouble and I just look
[15:15] at that spiritually and say that for the
[15:17] bride spiritually there's no trouble
[15:20] like we're having now in the spiritual
[15:23] realm there's no other pressure like
[15:25] we're having now now you say brother
[15:27] Paul I don't know what you're talking
[15:28] about my life is good I'm doing pretty
[15:30] good I got a good salary and
[15:31] everything's pretty comfortable um so
[15:34] I'd only say to that what are you doing
[15:36] right I'd say that first but then I
[15:38] would say check your life because
[15:41] anybody who's making a stand and that's
[15:42] the elect of God the guns are pointed on
[15:47] you it says says now the the the the and
[15:52] it talks in the Bible here let me just
[15:55] finish this in the time of trouble such
[15:57] as never was since there was a nation
[15:59] even at the same time and at that time
[16:01] thy people shall be delivered everyone
[16:03] that should be found written in the book
[16:05] notice now there's the elect written in
[16:08] the book of life so we got several
[16:11] reasons now why the armies are encamped
[16:15] around this particular people right
[16:18] they're in the Book of
[16:20] Life can't you remember that when you're
[16:23] being
[16:24] surrounded can't you remember that
[16:27] there's a reason that I'm being fought
[16:29] with
[16:32] demons probably because my name is in
[16:34] the book of
[16:36] life and I'm the elected can you say
[16:39] amen and I'm part of him now we'll go to
[16:43] book of the revelations Revelations
[16:45] 12:17 just another small element I want
[16:47] to bring in that you would
[16:51] understand why there's an increased
[16:53] demonic
[16:55] power and Satan maybe is in in the time
[16:59] where he's very nervous and he's you
[17:02] know he doesn't understand the word he
[17:04] doesn't understand
[17:06] Revelation and he can't have what the
[17:10] bride has he can't have it this is why
[17:14] he's jealous that's why he fights
[17:16] against it to stop it you know you've
[17:18] always had what the devil wanted yeah
[17:21] that's right amen with Adam and Eve he
[17:24] had the creative power and was the ruler
[17:26] of this Earth and that's what devil
[17:27] wanted from so from the very start you
[17:31] the Believers have always possessed by
[17:33] Revelation and had it in them what the
[17:35] devil wanted and you wonder why he's
[17:38] against you and he can never have
[17:40] it he can't ever have has never had it
[17:45] and can't ever have what you
[17:50] have that's enough to have a really
[17:52] shouting time on Monday put it on your
[17:55] refrigerator if you have to devil you
[17:57] will never have what I
[18:00] [Applause]
[18:02] have and and from the beginning I like
[18:05] to point this out it's like he comes on
[18:07] the scene because he's jealous of what
[18:09] Adam and Eve have and eventually he had
[18:11] to be kicked out you know what actually
[18:14] it happened before he was kicked out of
[18:16] heaven he he got this stir with all the
[18:20] the brothers the angels and a third part
[18:22] of the angels with influence with him to
[18:24] come against he wanted to raise his
[18:25] kingdom so he was jealous he couldn't
[18:27] have the position he wanted
[18:28] and so now he creates a certain finally
[18:31] they he was kicked out of heaven with
[18:32] his angels He was kicked out on Earth
[18:34] he's kicked out of the garden even the
[18:36] Sun and daughter were kicked out of the
[18:37] garden because they fell with him he was
[18:39] kicked out then there's tension between
[18:43] uh Isaac and uh ishmail there's tension
[18:45] between Cain and Abel and then then that
[18:48] ended and then there's tension between
[18:50] ishmail and Isaac and he had to be
[18:54] kicked out of the camp we got to get rid
[18:55] of cast out the Bond woman and her son
[19:00] and then I could go scripture after
[19:01] scripture where the tension Rises he
[19:03] gets kicked out the tension Rises he
[19:06] gets kicked out did why do you let this
[19:09] guy bother
[19:12] you when he's been kicked out of every
[19:15] believer's situation from the
[19:18] beginning if he's been kicked out all
[19:21] the way through then why don't you give
[19:24] him the boot every now and
[19:27] then
[19:28] he's used to it he's used to being
[19:30] kicked out amen all the way to the end
[19:33] when we get the Book of Revelation and
[19:35] Satan and his angels will be cast out
[19:38] the accuser of who the accuser of the
[19:41] Brethren stood there with tension with
[19:43] accusations keeping things tense all the
[19:45] time accusing accusing in your ear every
[19:48] day brother Joe in your ear every day
[19:50] brother Bob and but but one day one day
[19:53] it's the same history he's going to be
[19:54] kicked out and you'll never hear that
[19:56] voice again
[20:00] it's his history I don't know how he
[20:02] can't look in the Book of Revelations
[20:03] and see his end is he's going to be
[20:05] kicked out at the very end of it kick
[20:07] out of the atmospheres kicked out of
[20:09] heaven kicked off the Earth so the bride
[20:12] can come back and enjoy this without the
[20:14] devil
[20:15] here praise God
[20:19] hallelujah give him the boot every day
[20:21] because he's used to
[20:24] [Music]
[20:25] it when he's trying to come in and make
[20:27] you a god goip or give them the boot and
[20:30] stop your family and say we don't do
[20:32] that because that's the realm the devil
[20:35] Works
[20:36] in give them a
[20:38] boot that's not you you're teaching your
[20:40] children to be gossipers teaching your
[20:43] children to be accusers of the Brethren
[20:45] to be accusations against Elders that's
[20:48] a serious thing no no that's not the
[20:50] kingdom of God that's Satan's kingdom
[20:53] we're not in a picnic here what I'm
[20:56] preaching here and what you're you're
[20:58] trying to live is not a picnic it's what
[21:01] the devil hates he hates Revelation he
[21:04] hates people growing in the Lord he
[21:07] hates Unity amongst the people of God he
[21:11] hates it that's right in the time of
[21:13] trouble the time of trouble is the time
[21:15] of Deliverance and this is what he says
[21:18] in Psalms 27 in in the time of trouble
[21:22] he will hide me so in this time of
[21:24] trouble is the time for our deliverance
[21:26] and a Rapture if we're surrounded by the
[21:29] enemy ganged up on by the enemy guess
[21:32] what and it's if it's showing no relief
[21:35] it it it and it shows nothing in the
[21:37] prophecy for it to stop uh you know and
[21:40] the thing is is that until God steps in
[21:43] he lets the pressure continue he lets
[21:45] the pressure go the only hope we have is
[21:47] a hiding place until he delivers us in a
[21:49] Rapture but we have that hiding place
[21:52] the only thing it's doing is setting us
[21:54] up for the total deliverance and that's
[21:56] a Rapture my friends if you hear the
[21:58] Simplicity of what I'm expressing for my
[22:00] spiritual life and your spiritual life
[22:02] the only place we need the one desire we
[22:05] need to be in every day is to live in
[22:07] that secure safe place in the word
[22:11] Daniel 3 so if you're talking about
[22:14] being surrounded All Through the Bible
[22:15] you have it but here's some guys
[22:20] that Daniel chapter 3 verse 8 for at
[22:23] that time certain Chaldeans came near
[22:25] and accused the Jews they spake and said
[22:27] to the king Nebuchadnezzar oh King live
[22:29] forever forever thou oh King H has made
[22:31] a degree that every man that shall hear
[22:33] the sound of their
[22:34] cornet uh flute harp sack butt Sultry
[22:39] damer and all kinds of music shall fall
[22:41] down and worship the golden image um I
[22:46] like to preach a little sermon in here
[22:48] that did you notice bowing to the image
[22:50] was associated with all kinds of
[22:54] music music was used to open their
[22:56] emotions to bow to the
[22:59] image because music is used to open up
[23:02] your emotions we use it here in the
[23:04] service but what is it opening up your
[23:07] heart to
[23:09] receive right and who shall fth not down
[23:12] and woreth that he should be cast in the
[23:14] midst of the burning fiery furnace there
[23:16] are certain Jews whom the whom thou Hast
[23:19] set over the Affairs of the province of
[23:21] Babylon Shadrach Meshach and abedo these
[23:24] men oh King have not regarded thee they
[23:26] serve not thy gods or worship the golden
[23:28] image which thou has set up then
[23:30] Nebuchadnezzar in his
[23:33] rage
[23:35] point this man was mad but now he's in a
[23:38] rage and what is he in a rage about what
[23:43] is his in his anger increased about
[23:47] believers who made a stand against
[23:56] him that's what it was
[23:59] about his anger increased his rage
[24:02] increased I'm going to do something more
[24:03] now because I'm angry why am I angry
[24:06] because they won't join in with the rest
[24:08] and bow to the same thing they're not
[24:11] going to Bow his rage was increased then
[24:16] Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury
[24:18] commanded to bring sh can you imagine we
[24:20] get mad at a lot of things but can you
[24:22] imagine what this guy is on rage and
[24:23] fury about he's against three believers
[24:26] who make a stand
[24:30] when you make a
[24:31] stand see some of you today I'm I'm I'm
[24:35] encouraging you I pray you feel the pull
[24:36] of the Lord for your family your wife
[24:38] girlfriend whatever it is I I pray that
[24:40] you feel the pull through the preaching
[24:42] that Christ is pulling you because you

[24:52] stand you're a daddy you need to make a
[24:55] stand for the rest of the
[24:56] family yeah so he's in a rage he's in a
[24:59] fury verse 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[25:02] said unto them is it true oh Shadrach

[25:07] worship the golden image which I set up
