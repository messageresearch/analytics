life [Music] your name is [Applause] [Music] another name every time [Music] Jesus in the streets Jesus said in the darkness this is a small my family I speak the whole name Jesus [Music] Jesus [Music] Jesus Jesus [Music] for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her Leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so these scriptures are not just little um Sunday school scriptures but they're actually foretelling and speaking of the Believers particularly of the last day who are thriving and are planted in the right place and that are that are chosen and predestinated to walk in the word and become adopted Sons and Daughters of God and when they're planted in the right place then they have all these characteristics and I wanted to read it again because I was amazed how much it just elaborated a little bit more than Psalms 1 and I want you to read again it says for he verse 8 shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreadth out her Roots by the river and that's what we talked about Sunday and shall not see when he cometh but her Leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so it's just it just elaborates just a little bit more on what the scripture says in Psalms 1 and so his roots are have gone down close to the river The Roots receive constant moisture from the river and the water and it seems it just it gives more details and I read it today in the Amplified I was going to read that to you as well this way this is the way verse 8 is read in the Amplified for he will be nourished like a tree planted By the Waters that spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear the heat when it comes but its leaves will be green and moist and it will not be anxious and concerned in the year of drought nor stop bearing fruit if you're planted close to the water and receiving that Life Source then you're not living a life of worry that you're not worried about a drought this tree is not worried about a drought coming because he doesn't have to worry about a drought he's not dependent upon those Reigns and we'll just get into that in just a minute but his leaves are green and moist and he will not fear the heat when it comes so this is a just amazing how this just is manifested in such a way or brought to us in such a word picture in such a revelation to show us and it should tell us this is where I want to live this is where I want to be this is God speaking of the Holy ghost-filled Christian this is where and when he's planted in the right place this is the fruit that comes from his life and it certainly is taking away our fears it certainly is taking away our worries can you say Amen and so um you know when we speak of they're just that part about no fear or no worry it's just not there in this tree even when no rain is on the outside and the rain in the Bible say it's rain types blessings rain types blessings so this Christian is not dependent on the blessings of the Lord we enjoy the blessings of the Lord but we don't live on the blessings of the Lord are are moisture and are are thriving and our growth comes from something deeper because we know the rains can be there but then the rains can stop and sometimes in our life the rain can stop for a long time and that's called a drought and so if this tree was dependent upon that reign of blessings then it would give out in the drought it would be nervous it would become anxious it would begin to die but because it's not dependent on the blessings of the Lord and because blessings we can in life we can have we can have things that we think as the blessings of God but sometimes our trials can be blessings in disguise and sometimes when we have a drought if we're rooted in the Lord the drought can be a good time to grow as well only in this type of tree now can you say man a tree that's got its roots way down is that we find in a drought sometimes you're through trials and wins and the things that happen on the outside back to you those things can actually be when your roots are dead actually it can make your roots go deeper so what a wonderful thing to see that but people actually depend people live dependent on the blessings of God uh is everything and when everything is right in their life and when the rain is falling and when everything is good then they're happy when everything's working out all right then they can be happy it when everything is just coming together just so well and lining up so well and that's the times we thank God it's just all lining up good and we're happy about it and we thank God for it and we shouldn't do that but see growth in the Lord maturity in the Lord is that when that's not lining up just right and we don't understand why it's not lining up we still are rooted by the tree the tree is rooted by the rivers of water it's not like we're going to die from that it's not like we're losing our joy from that because we know during those times we're a predestinated Son of God anyway God's going to direct us anyway God is going to keep us anyway and so uh people live dependent on the blessings of the Lord and I'm not against the blessing I love the blessings of God but a lot of times it's what we view as blessings it's what we view as God's blessings and a lot of times blessings we view it is if things are just going well and coming in line and perfect can you say man so we have to really become a deeper Christian to realize what is God's blessings because we look at it that we got a lot of money and we got all the money to pay bills and we look at it as far as Financial price prosperity and it is sometimes sometimes we can be just as blessed spiritually and not have a dime to our name we can't view all of our spirituality where we stand with the Lord on just finances we can't view it just as that we can't see I'm blessed if that's happening and I'm not blessed we can't view it carnally like that because we realize God he can prosper us but the most important Prosperity we receive as a Believer is where we're at spiritually and if we lose sight of that we'll view his Blessings by natural carnal things are we listening tonight so then I can be if everything's going right then I'll serve the Lord that's how some people feel about it if I feel good then I'll go to church you think that you think that's not true people go to church if they feel if everything's happened good for the week and they feel good and they're feeling healthy then we're going to be at church it's it's about feelings it's about emotions if everything's going good with my job then I'll come and sing and open my heart and Worship the Lord you really should come and worship with more strength towards the Lord when you lose your job see this is Counter Culture isn't it I won't be there tonight brother Paul I lost my job and if I lost my job I'll probably lose everything and I don't know where this is going to go so I won't be there I didn't I just don't even feel like worshiping now you might cut chuckle at that that's the type of conversations in 30 years of pastoring I've had that sometime and sometimes I have to bite my tongue to not say it and correct it and say no if you've gone through this or if you lost a loved one or you're going through a depressing time the very Place best place you could be is in the presence of the Lord you're letting Satan rob you of what you really should be doing that's the times we call out on God that's the time job says you know what I don't have a clue what's going on and my wife's telling me to curse God and die but I'm going to go to church and I'm going to worship and I can you say man I'm a little bit angry here but I'm not gonna stop my worship before God because the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord that's the time to Worship the Lord but we can't view His blessings as then the things that come from the outside and this tree is basically saying this believer is saying that I am not afraid of a drought in my life because I am not dependent on the moisture of those rains I'm dependent on the moisture coming from the river the drought hits and there's no blessings and if there's rain in our life it's all good but you see if the drought hits that's when a drought can be a real test it can bring worry if you're dependent on those blessings and this tree is not worried about a drought if it rains or if it doesn't I'm good why because he's planted by the source of moisture it's not that it comes from the top but the roots are way down deep connected to the moisture of the river if there if there's money if there's no money we pray we worship God amen if people treat me right or people treat me wrong we serve God we worship God if I'm in pain or I'm not in pain it doesn't change my worship before the Lord if the job ends or if they like me a lot at work it doesn't matter it doesn't waver can you say Amen because I'm not looking to the outside things going good or going bad can you say man I'm not dependent on that and that's not dictating my joy I say that because for all of us we might as well admit that things of Life affect and take away our joy and we should never let outside rain or not rain or whatever take away our joy don't let nobody steal your joy don't let anything steal your joy you say well I lost a no you still got it but you're just letting it being clouded over by thinking something was going to go this certain way I thought the job was gonna I thought it was going to go this way and so I'm just not happy and and you know you you can say with trying to be careful not to offend tonight you can can say it's very much like a little baby who's only happy when it gets what it what it wants and when it doesn't get when a two-year-old does not get what she wants she can turn on you pretty quick he can turn on you pretty quick I mean I just I I get in trouble so I gave Ellie a sucker where's she at she gone I gave her a sucker in the office because when we left from the house I had to take her to church tonight and we had to get in the truck so the sucker had to be taken away so this smiley girl had it taken away and she changed to a different countenance and so then I thought well let's give it back we got in the office I gave her another one and then that had to be taken away from her but it's kind of funny to watch because this is Christian sometimes this is Christian sometimes these are baby Christians and they can change in a moment they're so happy and so smiling and something changes in their life somebody doesn't treat them well somebody posted something that they didn't like and in a moment's time they're counting has changed and they become this different person that's baby Hood that's a baby Christian we let things affect our emotions so much family problems and family issues and and marriage issues and God is looking for that consistent being planted staying filled with the word of God staying with our mind on the word of God so that just doesn't bump us around as much and we're not dependent on the blessings or if the drought comes we're still receiving the from the source we have a source and if we're connected to it it never ends never gives up so now you know that even a good plan as we talked about Sunday we're talking about the tree plant you know that even a good plant taken away from water or not getting water can start withering can start getting sticky can start getting brown leaves instead of as it speaks in scripture here of a flourishing a leaf being green we know that a plant can get dried up we know a plant can become ugly when it was beautiful before we know a plant can get hard instead of soft instead of gentle the petals can become they're gentle but they can become hard and it's all because of a lack of water if that's true in the natural it's true in the spiritual can be shriveled up it could be it can be closed and look dead and be eventually become dead and so I I think sometimes we can see pretty good when a person is not near the Water of Life I think it becomes pretty quickly evident when someone is not planted close to the rivers of Living Water there's a clear evidence of someone being distant from the spirit and from the word and feeding out other things I'm going to say it again it becomes pretty quickly evident in our if it does for a plant like some of our plants within just a few days you can see them shrivel up and they've got brown edges on some of the petals and that's for lack of water sometimes if that happens in the natural that's what happens to your life in the spiritual and it becomes real clear in your life in my life is that when we get a little bit too far away from the Waters of life then we start to have these characteristics sometimes to show that we're distant from the word we're distant from uh from the spirit of God and we're feeding on other things usually you can tell what a person is feeding on it shows up in the attitude it shows up in the reactions hey how you doing I'm fine doing fine leave me alone these these characteristics of getting edgy and bitter and angry and feeling your feelings are sensitive and you're easily offended for a Believer and say well no Believers act like that all right for a Believer it's a direct giveaway that you have become disconnected because you will never get a a a a a pattern of those results you might have an instant moment where you get angry because that's anger's a part of us it's an emotion can you say man remember the Bible says be angry and sin not our emotions can rise up over things even over sin can you say Amen but you see now he says be angry and sin not it's where that anger goes we can have a moment but when we see patterns popping up in a life we know that someone and in our own lives we know that you can never be completely connected and feeding on the word of life and the spirit of life and staying in there every day and have all of these patterns of sensitivity and easily offended and outraged anger and bitterness and being edgy all the time and becoming bitter even towards God there is no way you get that fruit from a person that's connected to the source of life there's no way you get it uh uh doesn't James say that a tree cannot put forth this fruit and that it can't happen it can't bring forth these different things it's not to be so if you're connected to the water of life and you stay connected there are fruits that come from that God told Israel when he received the word when he gave the word to Moses on Mount Sinai that's a very Horeb is where they were in Mount Sinai and the word came to the prophet it was such a pivotal point for Israel and God actually after it happened they received the word to live by he kept pointing them back to that and that was a pivotal point for them but when he talked to them in Deuteronomy 6 which we won't have time to read tonight when he said it said to them when he spoke to them after they'd received the word it wasn't just they received the word and it wasn't just that they would uh that they would have the word but he said now I'm going to warn you when you come into the land the first thing you you should give all of your heart to the word of God and you should meditate upon it day and night you should teach it your to your children you should put it upon the doorpost of your house you should put it upon here you should put it and so so you should become saturated with the word of God they could say well we've got the word from a prophet that's enough but to God it wasn't enough because he says when you get into the promised land a couple things will happen you're going to prosper you're going to have goodly lands and guess what if you keep your eyes on that you're going to forget my precepts you're going to forget me so in order not to forget me this word can't just be on tablets this word has to be in your heart every day do you get it and God's saying that you know teach your children from the time they're young teach your grandchildren get it in front of them post it on the doorpost have the word up everywhere talk about he says talk about it in your home constantly why is God saying this we've got the word from a prophet that's all we need no wasn't all you need you've got to get that word integrated into your life you've got to get that word into your mind you've got to get that word into your soul you've got to get it in your spirit and you've got to keep it in your spirit for two reasons when you prosper you tend to forget God listen God knows Human Nature I said God knows human nature and when people Prosper with blessings they tend to forget the precepts of God so the first reason he says you have to keep it you have to integrate it into your life every day speak about it teach it to your children let it be the Forefront of your thoughts the second reason is he says so that you won't be overtaken with Idols because when your heart gets distant and when your heart is away from the word you're more susceptible to idol worship and then God says I am one Lord and I want you to be single in your worship towards me that heart believes belongs to me and he says I want you to serve me with all your heart soul mind and strength there's only one way to serve God and that's all of you and God said that because he knows your heart and the Heart can be easily swayed by other gods and other things to worship brother Paul I don't worship any other gods tonight you don't you don't you have to be careful that because our heart can be swayed to worshiping and given our attention and given our all and given our heart to something else and eventually our worship to something else and God said I'm a I've got an exclusive I want an exclusive relationship and I want all my worship from your heart to come to me you don't let someone else who said something to you steal your joy make you depressed bring you down you can't let people control you like that you can't let the devil control you like that you can't let the devil steal your joy so quickly don't let them steal it at all you let people's comments on the internet and even face to face which they don't do much of it face to face today but there are little comments wonder what he's trying to say by that I wonder what she's saying by that I think she met me with that and so you let it steal your joy and your happiness and being able to enjoy the day because you've let somebody else's comments control you and I say don't let anybody steal your joy this thing is the Simplicity of Jesus Christ Paul said I fear lest any would beguile you as the serpent did Eve from the simplicity of Jesus Christ this message is the Simplicity of Jesus Christ but men have complicated it men have complicated it I just want to be a pure fruit bearing tree of God that can say don't complicate this thing if you're thirsty come and drink thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if
