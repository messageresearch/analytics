[1:22] you

[1:25] for your gift and for your talent for
[1:26] your work may you open the word in
[1:28] matthew chapter 21
[1:31] beginning from verse one lay a
[1:34] background
[1:35] to a thought for this morning are you
[1:37] preaching
[1:39] matthew 21 1 and when they drew nigh
[1:42] unto jerusalem and were come to beth
[1:45] page
[1:46] unto the mount of olives then sent jesus
[1:49] to disciples
[1:50] saying unto them go into the village
[1:53] over against you
[1:55] and straight away you shall find an ass
[1:57] tight i hope i pronounce it right
[2:00] look i'm a german a dunky tight and i
[2:02] called with her
[2:04] lose them and bring them unto me and if
[2:07] any man say unto you you shall say
[2:10] the lord hath need of them and straight
[2:14] away he will send them
[2:15] all this was done
[2:18] that it might be fulfilled which was
[2:20] spoken by the prophet saying tell you
[2:24] the daughter of zion behold thy king
[2:27] cometh unto thee
[2:29] meek and sitting upon a donkey and the
[2:32] cold the foal
[2:34] of a donkey may the lord add his
[2:36] blessing to the reading of his word we
[2:38] may be seating
[2:42] now i wish you all god's blessings in
[2:44] the house of the lord and it's a great
[2:46] honor for me to be here and brother paul
[2:48] rightly uh rightly said that we are more
[2:51] just we are just friends we don't see us
[2:53] all the time
[2:55] but but friendship is not a question of
[2:59] a certain amount of calls that we do per
[3:03] month uh friends and brothers is a
[3:05] question of fellowship of vision of a
[3:08] certain chemistry okay
[3:11] and uh thank you very much for the part
[3:12] it's an honor for me to be here i i came
[3:15] i could connect this trip as he has
[3:17] invited me a long time with the youth
[3:19] camp over there in toronto and so i'm
[3:21] bringing greetings from the brothers and
[3:23] sisters from germany our pastor about
[3:26] the rhode world
[3:27] from the places that i have been brother
[3:29] dun guava the ericsson brother chad and
[3:31] everybody is greeting you by the way
[3:32] paul brother paul
[3:34] and um yeah we are very very thankful
[3:37] for this morning for the afternoon and
[3:40] as brother paul said when i'm traveling
[3:42] i always say this i say don't take me as
[3:44] a german huh i have the holy ghost that
[3:47] makes me different huh and but take me
[3:49] as a friend take my other brother
[3:51] and um the subject for today is is
[3:54] leading into into into that father's day
[3:57] and most of you that don't know me maybe
[3:59] they have seen or some of you were there
[4:01] on the wednesday but uh let me let me
[4:04] introduce it that way so that you are
[4:06] not fearful or have too much reservation
[4:10] during the whole service
[4:12] we believe one thing and i don't want to
[4:14] hurt the feeling write it in my first
[4:16] sentences but but but the message that
[4:18] we believe does not come from america
[4:21] in all respect it comes from the
[4:23] presence of god
[4:24] i mean brother brandon was just a voice
[4:26] explaining what our father had to say
[4:29] he was the voice there is a voice behind
[4:31] that voice amen
[4:33] this message
[4:35] is not a denomination
[4:37] why should we become denominational
[4:40] sometimes there's people who say well we
[4:42] make a circle and we are putting
[4:43] somebody into the circle and somebody
[4:46] out of the circle i said look i come
[4:47] from a heavenly family
[4:49] nobody will preach you me into something
[4:51] and nobody will preach me out of
[4:53] something it's a family affair between
[4:56] god and his children the rest is just
[4:58] denominational approach that we brought
[5:00] into
[5:01] into the message of the hour as many
[5:03] times said we have many people they have
[5:05] the doctrine of the message but they
[5:06] have still the old set up
[5:09] of the pentecostal movement and whatever
[5:12] baptist or whatever we come from the
[5:13] holiness movement
[5:14] this message that we believe is not a
[5:17] cult
[5:18] why should we become cultish
[5:20] this message is not a sect and we know
[5:23] it's not but why should we become
[5:24] sectarian
[5:26] amen this message what is this message
[5:28] it's our father speaking to his right
[5:31] now in the catholic of the uh in in in
[5:34] the in the um let me say in the
[5:37] in the picture of a catholic uh religion
[5:40] the mother the the son can be the
[5:43] husband that's
[5:44] uh that's the subject or that's that's
[5:46] that motive that they got from babylon
[5:48] now the sun sitting on the lap of its
[5:50] mother and it's the lover at the same
[5:51] time
[5:53] and it's completely a false picture the
[5:55] right picture is my father is my
[5:57] bridegroom
[5:59] my father is my brother
[6:02] my father is my friend my redeemer is my
[6:03] servant
[6:05] my king is my helper only christianity
[6:07] can produce this
[6:09] and the book of i think in the book of
[6:10] hebrews says those who sent the one who
[6:13] sanctifies
[6:15] and those who are sanctified
[6:17] both come out of one therefore brother
[6:20] abraham said he's my father he's my
[6:22] mother he's my sister and my brother
[6:24] he's everything to me
[6:26] can you say amen
[6:28] so so so only to understand the
[6:31] preaching today comes really from the
[6:32] message of the hour and we understand we
[6:35] are not branhamites
[6:38] we're christians
[6:39] but we understood the ministry of the
[6:41] seventh angel
[6:43] as as as as the star
[6:46] who let the three young men uh from
[6:48] babylon to to or from from mesopotamia
[6:51] from from irk from chaldea down to
[6:53] bethlehem that star was not leading them
[6:56] to himself
[6:57] the star was leading them to christ
[6:59] which is the words which was the king we
[7:02] have seen his star
[7:04] it was the seventh type was the seventh
[7:06] angel and the seventh angel never sent
[7:09] us or led us to branham tabernacle
[7:11] it lends us to the it was leading us to
[7:14] the king
[7:15] to christ to the word
[7:17] can you say amen
[7:19] so so so that's what it is so brother
[7:22] brother brother paul thank you very much
[7:23] for the invitation to my friendship to
[7:25] brother stephen and his family to
[7:27] brother rap and his family i said i will
[7:29] pay attention i'm too old right now i
[7:31] don't i know i'm here among friends
[7:34] uh but i we learned a lot i mean you
[7:36] have to understand one thing if a
[7:38] minister is young he has to learn
[7:41] no matter how big the gift is he has to
[7:44] learn
[7:45] he makes his mistakes and a young
[7:47] minister always needs older ministers to
[7:49] help him to correct him too because he's
[7:51] young i mean
[7:53] and
[7:54] those young people they need somebody
[7:56] who is standing in the gap for them
[7:58] because when we were younger i always
[8:00] said this i said i thank god that all of
[8:03] my first sermons are not recorded
[8:05] [Laughter]
[8:08] because we were so much in in balance
[8:10] we come out of a legalistic background
[8:12] and we meant well
[8:14] but to mean well and to do well is
[8:16] different
[8:17] to mean what and to do and it takes
[8:19] someone who has a little bit of a life
[8:21] experience to bring us back into some
[8:23] kind of a line
[8:25] so every minister needs friends it needs
[8:27] somebody who cares who let him don't let
[8:29] him fall and unless of his appearance
[8:33] because no matter how a menace a person
[8:36] can be brave and hard
[8:38] remember he has still feelings
[8:40] he's still human beings he needs
[8:42] somebody who sticks with him
[8:45] corrects him at the right time
[8:47] and
[8:48] you remember there was i know i'm among
[8:50] musicians
[8:51] and
[8:52] the great musician arthur rubinstein he
[8:54] was asked a question mr rubinstein is it
[8:57] difficult to play piano and rubenstein
[8:59] said it's very simple to play piano is
[9:01] very simple you just have to press the
[9:03] right buttons at the right time i mean
[9:05] that's all you see and to correct a
[9:08] person is very very simple you just have
[9:10] to be the right person
[9:12] at the right time
[9:13] in the right place
[9:15] in the right spirit saying the right
[9:16] thing and the other one must be in the
[9:18] right spirit to receive the right thing
[9:19] what you meant for him to say so it's so
[9:21] easy to be corrected
[9:24] so so you understand we need a lot of
[9:26] grace for one another and so i'm happy
[9:28] for the ministering friend there i'm a
[9:30] little bit of a joker uh i i i it seems
[9:32] i got your haha spirit somehow
[9:36] you know and even if i'm a little bit i
[9:38] like to imitate and even um our precious
[9:41] brother tremendous but don't take it
[9:43] personally okay don't take it first
[9:45] we're not in politics we're just feel
[9:47] home feel feel i feel really to be among
[9:50] friends and
[9:52] blessed be the name of the lord and so i
[9:54] was making yesterday that the joke i
[9:55] said the snipers are already here so i'm
[9:58] very much waging my words
[10:00] there is a um there is some of the
[10:03] things that i have to say that is my
[10:05] opinion
[10:06] and i will tell you this is my view i
[10:08] learn on it it's a comma okay i'm sure
[10:11] my opinion is right
[10:14] but but
[10:16] look there is a quote that brother brahm
[10:18] said you we have to protect this message
[10:22] in our lives by our behavior but we have
[10:24] even to protect their doctrine because
[10:26] their truck dream is the way of life to
[10:28] find christ
[10:29] so we cannot just bring shadows where is
[10:32] no shadow we have to stay with what the
[10:34] prophet said okay but we can we don't
[10:37] have to be just to be parrots we can be
[10:39] eagles we can rise up we can we can see
[10:42] a picture that brother brandon doesn't
[10:44] doesn't say that way but then we have to
[10:45] say look this is no marcus
[10:47] okay we have a right to do because we're
[10:49] not just parrots we are eagles ourselves
[10:52] and we the the bride is a prophetic
[10:55] class of people
[10:57] there it's more than just repeating
[10:59] brother brandon everybody can repeat
[11:00] brother ben but the bride has brother
[11:03] said prophetic insight
[11:06] the holy spirit gives her insight into
[11:08] certain things the bride can read
[11:10] between the line because this bible is a
[11:12] love letter
[11:14] only the bride can read that that love
[11:16] letter the right way the rest they have
[11:19] just dates and facts and commands and so
[11:21] forth but everything that we preach
[11:23] between the lines must be somewhere in
[11:25] the lines too
[11:27] if not we end up in all kind of
[11:29] fanaticism and and so forth if there
[11:32] would be a thought that i said look we
[11:33] can look it that way it's not the only
[11:35] way then i would say it's just marcus
[11:38] and uh
[11:39] um blessed be the name of the lord so
[11:41] let us let us start with a picture i
[11:43] would like to call
[11:46] that sermon for today
[11:48] uh for our father's day your king cometh
[11:50] or the tent vision
[11:52] and try to bring it right in our and in
[11:55] our day in our time it is not a
[11:57] doctrinal message i would dare to come
[12:00] behind another man's pulpit and try to
[12:02] bring any kind of a doctrine unless i'm
[12:04] invited for it brother marcus sometimes
[12:06] people say brother mark is an evangelist
[12:08] somehow he's more like a teacher
[12:10] i mean in comparison to brother stephen
[12:12] i'm nothing and that's for sure but i
[12:15] would not come to bring some kind of a
[12:17] teaching but it's just to give a certain
[12:19] insight when we speak about
[12:21] a father and his children
[12:23] if if if we can start with their scent
[12:26] then i will make that kind of a drama
[12:28] okay
[12:28] but we'll start with the first picture
[12:30] if you wouldn't mind
[12:32] can you say amen
[12:34] so when we were preaching last time in
[12:37] in brother chess there was another
[12:38] minister by brother sham
[12:40] and he has a very unique approach he
[12:42] said now we are now going up on a flight
[12:46] uh he said so flight attendant is
[12:47] everything everybody buckled up he said
[12:50] there will be some turbulences during
[12:52] the preaching okay but let's let the
[12:53] airplane go up okay so i took that
[12:56] little little subject in that way so if
[12:58] if you could just
[13:00] have the first
[13:01] uh picture
[13:03] you make
[13:06] there's some turbulences right right
[13:08] behind but we know uh everything is in
[13:10] god's hand and we're doing doing very
[13:11] fine yeah i see it over there already
[13:14] ah there it is okay you see
[13:17] now look at this now we're starting
[13:20] you have to understand i many times
[13:23] speak to young people
[13:25] let this message
[13:27] change from a religion to a relationship
[13:31] with your father
[13:33] you see
[13:34] no i'm a father of a of a young girl you
[13:37] see
[13:37] i'm not not 18 okay
[13:42] but i'm not interested that when i'm
[13:45] coming home that my little girl
[13:47] now kneels down
[13:49] okay and she says father comes home
[13:53] he brings the money
[13:56] i can go to
[13:59] whatever
[14:03] god is not interested in muslimic
[14:06] worship
[14:08] islam means
[14:10] pure obedience in form of legalism
[14:14] god wants your heart
[14:16] god wants your soul
[14:18] god wants to have a perfect unity
[14:22] that he had before the garden of eden
[14:24] we were separated for 2000 years but
[14:27] this message brings us back into the
[14:29] bosom of god
[14:31] i always said this when god in the
[14:33] coolness of the evening as eve was
[14:36] coming out of
[14:37] adam when god called adam
[14:40] where are you
[14:41] two people came
[14:44] two people came not only adam because
[14:46] eve didn't have a name for himself for
[14:48] herself she was just the woman
[14:50] so god called adam and two people came
[14:54] she was called and you say brother
[14:56] marcus where is the picture right now
[14:58] it's very simple you remember brother
[14:59] branham had that had that had that
[15:01] vision with the staircase and he was arm
[15:04] and neville and the angels were petting
[15:06] him on his back and so forth
[15:08] and and he was so happy now armor
[15:10] neville was called enter for the into
[15:12] the joy of the lord and then brother
[15:14] brain said and then he heard william
[15:16] branham
[15:17] you know the story and when he went up
[15:19] that staircase he saw meter coming on
[15:22] one side and hope on the other side but
[15:25] god never called
[15:27] william
[15:28] hope meter god called william branham
[15:31] and his wife was called with him
[15:35] so brother brahman said he said when
[15:36] christ was at the cross when he paid
[15:38] that price the family of god was was was
[15:42] redeemed
[15:43] there is even a quote that he says we
[15:45] paid for our own sins at the cross
[15:49] only the messenger could bring these
[15:50] things
[15:51] so what happens is now this man he is
[15:55] not grandfather
[15:57] but he is the father
[15:59] and he has cancer
[16:01] and he will die soon but but i was so
[16:04] touched because i thought here's a
[16:06] father who understands what his what is
[16:09] what his little one needs he doesn't
[16:11] have the holy ghost he is not a
[16:13] christian this is somewhere in europe
[16:15] and here's some
[16:16] journalists they're putting it together
[16:19] the father has very short time to live
[16:23] and the little girl is his own daughter
[16:26] and what they do is
[16:28] he was asking uh for donations to make
[16:32] that event happen
[16:34] they were playing a marriage
[16:38] though the young girl is still in her
[16:40] teens she doesn't have a husband yet
[16:42] but
[16:43] he knows one thing
[16:45] i'm the only father to her that will
[16:48] bring her one day to the altar
[16:51] nobody can replace you if you're a
[16:53] father nobody can replace your plate
[16:56] take your place if you're a mother
[16:58] nobody can take your place
[17:00] so what he does in the emotion of a
[17:02] child so what he does he's going with
[17:05] that little child to the altar
[17:08] giving her
[17:10] to the priest to the preacher
[17:12] and the ceremony here stops
[17:17] and when that little girl will marry in
[17:19] a couple of years they will continue
[17:22] exactly at that spot
[17:25] where they left
[17:27] that ceremony
[17:29] and i thought by myself if a father
[17:31] without the holy ghost can have that
[17:33] kind of an understanding of a father
[17:36] what about us
[17:38] how much is god caring for his children
[17:41] and brother if we understand god we
[17:44] become good fathers we cannot separate
[17:47] the doctrine from our everyday's life
[17:50] if you understand the message you become
[17:52] the message
[17:54] there is no there is not that kind of
[17:56] nonsense of i'm i'm uh i i i i i
[18:00] understand the deepness of the message
[18:02] and all my family is is run
[18:05] i i run the car against the wall it
[18:07] doesn't work
[18:08] there is something that we understood
[18:11] through the message to deal situation
[18:13] with god can you make the next one
[18:16] so we we so we see
[18:19] that we have jesus
[18:22] and
[18:23] it is the time where he should come down
[18:26] on mount olives
[18:29] now brother brandon preaches about that
[18:32] message in the message what is the
[18:35] attraction on the mountain and he takes
[18:38] this as a little drama
[18:40] and we see jesus that he is calling and
[18:43] now let me say in my words for a donkey
[18:46] because i know even the english is
[18:48] tricky
[18:49] you got it you got it you got it okay
[18:52] so there was a donkey and he was still
[18:55] tired
[18:57] let me call him tired in situation in
[18:59] life
[19:00] but jesus has need of that
[19:04] donkey
[19:06] and be sure
[19:07] for the world you you are nothing else
[19:10] than a donkey
[19:12] with your long hair and your long deers
[19:15] and and your tie and on sunday morning
[19:17] sitting into a church and let the world
[19:20] think about us what they want but the
[19:23] lord is in need of us
[19:25] the lord needs you because brother blame
[19:27] said he only has your hands
[19:30] and he has your feet and yes your
[19:31] tongues
[19:33] so god untied us to use us for his
[19:37] ministry
[19:38] and
[19:40] he was sitting on that little donkey
[19:43] and coming down from mount of olives and
[19:46] this is the direction from the temple to
[19:48] the mount of olives
[19:51] here on that special day
[19:54] there was now sitting
[19:57] the messiah on a donkey
[20:00] and he appears and brother blame said it
[20:02] was a nervous day
[20:06] and the people were waiting
[20:10] down in the valley
[20:12] and brother brain said
[20:14] somewhere for him
[20:16] most of them were against him
[20:18] but somewhere in between they really
[20:20] didn't know
[20:23] he said but here appeared
[20:27] he the lord on a white donkey
[20:30] now the bible doesn't say it was a white
[20:32] donkey but you have to understand
[20:35] brother brandon was a prophet
[20:37] he was not a reformer he could see
[20:38] things
[20:40] i remember when brother biscuit told us
[20:42] that little story
[20:43] of brother but but suffolk but was a
[20:46] smoker in the church
[20:49] and nobody knew
[20:50] so when they were going out to hunt
[20:54] bud was taking care of the horses
[20:57] and everybody said buddy is a nice
[20:59] brother but what was smoking while he
[21:02] was taking care of the horses because
[21:04] they were a little bit away in the
[21:06] distance yeah and brother brother but
[21:09] himself he gave later that testimony he
[21:11] said he came back and he was taking care
[21:13] of the kitchen and so forth and brother
[21:15] graham laid in his hands with his hand
[21:17] behind his back he said hey bud how long
[21:19] are you a christian for how long and he
[21:22] said oh brother abraham since many many
[21:24] many years
[21:25] and after some minutes brother branham
[21:27] just spoke to god hey but when you were
[21:31] a non-christian did you ever smoke in
[21:33] your life
[21:35] and bought it yes
[21:38] and after some minutes where the brain
[21:40] was just
[21:41] calling him
[21:43] he said hey bud when did you stop
[21:45] smoking
[21:46] and bud said right now
[21:50] you see
[21:51] but he said he knew that brother bram
[21:54] saw him
[21:56] but you see
[21:57] god
[21:58] loves to correct his children but he
[22:00] will never break them
[22:03] god will never expose us
[22:05] god will never embarrass us
[22:08] because he's a father
[22:10] god is not interested in disciples like
[22:13] in north korea
[22:15] god wants to have personalities
[22:19] but who are under a certain headship
[22:22] can you say amen
[22:24] now as every father is the head of his
[22:26] own home
[22:28] every pastor is the head of a local
[22:30] church
[22:31] every messenger is the head of a church
[22:33] age
[22:34] but christ is the head of all seven
[22:36] messengers
[22:38] i'm sometime asked the question brother
[22:40] marcus does somebody have a right to
[22:42] correct the prophet i said sure god has
[22:44] a right
[22:47] god has a right god did it all time
[22:48] through the bible when a prophet didn't
[22:50] say exactly what he said god corrected
[22:52] him
[22:53] god has her because he's the head of all
[22:54] the prophets
[22:56] can you say amen
[22:57] so it's a question of a headship and and
[23:00] brother abraham saw jesus coming on a
[23:03] white donkey and he said this and i have
[23:05] to
[23:06] memorize it he's what happened on that
[23:09] mount of olives he said history was made
[23:12] prophecy was fulfilled
[23:15] that's what he says
[23:16] and here he comes down on that mount on
[23:19] that on the on that little donkey and
[23:22] here is a group
[23:24] uh fanatically screaming
[23:28] because they saw
[23:31] who was sitting on that donkey it was
[23:34] elohim
[23:36] it was the i am
[23:39] those
[23:40] whose eyes were opened spiritually could
[23:43] see who was sitting on the donkey
[23:45] that it was god
[23:47] and they were not standing just there
[23:49] and said oh
[23:51] that's deep man
[23:55] sometimes sometimes we have young people
[23:57] they come back from some kind of a camp
[23:59] and i said brother marcus it was
[24:02] tremendous
[24:04] i said tremendous we heard things that
[24:07] we never heard before i said yes you
[24:09] heard it never because
[24:10] before because the prophet never said it
[24:12] therefore you haven't never heard it
[24:14] before
[24:16] and then they say it was so deep and i
[24:17] said okay what did you understand
[24:20] uh nothing but it was tremendous
[24:23] so so we have to understand we are not
[24:26] here to impress people
[24:28] we have
[24:29] we are here to help people
[24:32] to align our vision in the vision for
[24:34] this day
[24:36] amen
[24:37] so
[24:38] they knew one thing and i'm just quoting
[24:41] it right from the bible
[24:43] it says in exodus 13 30 he said every
[24:46] first thing of an ass or donkey thou
[24:48] shalt redeem with the lamb and thou will
[24:51] not redeem it then thou shalt break his
[24:54] neck and all the firstborn of a man
[24:56] among the children shalt thou be
[24:58] redeemed so every
[25:00] every donkey is redeemed by a lamb and
[25:04] here was that group that could see a
[25:06] lamp
[25:07] sitting on a donkey and they knew one
[25:10] thing that's the messiah
[25:13] now my my thought is always this
[25:16] who was sitting on that donkey the lamb
[25:19] or the lion
[25:21] was both
[25:23] at the same time
[25:24] amen because because behold the lamb of
[25:28] god which taketh away the sins of the
[25:30] world that was him
[25:31] but the prophecy says tell the daughter
[25:34] of sign behold thy king
[25:37] cometh unto thee
[25:39] therefore i will say i will say don't be
[25:41] true dogmatic
[25:43] many times don't be doctrine because
[25:45] many times the same medal has a second
[25:47] side
[25:48] and if we are if we are just preach
[25:51] to enforce our camp it will not help
[25:55] for none of us
[25:57] to help that whole situation because
[25:59] maybe the picture is bigger than we
[26:01] thought
[26:04] so therefore we always should say make a
[26:06] comma
[26:06] but when these people saw who was
[26:09] sitting on that little donkey they
[26:12] they put off their garments and throw
[26:15] this
[26:17] on the floor it said behold who cometh
[26:20] in the name of the lord it was not a
[26:22] doctrine it was their redemption coming
[26:26] and brother brother we we
[26:30] there is a lot of people they say we are
[26:33] you know that expression slain in the
[26:34] spirit
[26:36] and we loved it i mean i i i love to be
[26:39] slain in the spirits
[26:44] but it must be so important to be slain
[26:46] in the world
[26:50] i always tell the young people a youth
[26:52] camp is not that superman comes you know
[26:55] and
[26:56] and he has a big ass and then he goes
[26:58] and he has in his suitcase some kind
[27:00] like a revival the revival is in the
[27:02] world
[27:05] we can encourage them we can bring on
[27:07] the right wrong way but if you don't go
[27:09] home and you eat the right thing
[27:11] that revival will die out
[27:14] and then you have to invite back the man
[27:16] of the hour and to just
[27:25] so because we want to help people
[27:28] look i always say this and that maybe
[27:30] i'm repeating myself because i have no
[27:32] notes just these pictures we were we
[27:34] were not believers at that time we were
[27:37] young people my family didn't believe
[27:39] god called me with an audible voice out
[27:42] of a discotheque an audible voice
[27:44] we didn't understand the message we just
[27:47] came to christ
[27:48] and after the years now we understood
[27:50] the message behind it
[27:53] you see sometimes you are just in the
[27:55] world or
[27:56] are you you're a new christian and you
[27:58] want to evangelize and you have always
[28:00] somebody who tries to steal away
[28:04] your experience with god
[28:06] i'm always there it's nothing behind
[28:09] christ it's nothing behind that kind of
[28:12] christianity and then you have to say he
[28:14] said honestly you're come too late
[28:18] you're too late
[28:19] because i see what god did in my life
[28:21] you're too late honest
[28:23] and we have to understand one thing
[28:24] there is people they are now discussing
[28:26] about with the young people
[28:28] uh about were there 13 people who fell
[28:31] from that bridge or 14 people who fell
[28:34] from a bridge i always said i wasn't
[28:36] there
[28:37] it was right before i was born i'm not
[28:39] interested in it
[28:41] but i know one thing it went from the
[28:43] prophet to the prophecy
[28:46] it went from the messenger to the
[28:49] message
[28:50] so i'm not interested so much in branham
[28:52] details
[28:54] about his life as a man but i see if
[28:57] somebody says and this message is
[28:59] nothing behind i can say today honestly
[29:01] you come too late
[29:03] we come before because we have seen how
[29:05] this message changed our life
[29:08] this message is more than just learning
[29:10] and seminary it has transforming power
[29:13] for our life
[29:15] and the holy spirit feeds on the word
[29:18] for our day
[29:19] [Applause]
[29:21] so so don't discuss if they were third
[29:23] because you were not there and the
[29:25] critics was not there neither
[29:29] then let us discuss uh was really paul
[29:32] on the way to damascus when the pillar
[29:34] fires who was there where was the webcam
[29:38] where was it if you start if you go on
[29:41] that level the whole bible just becomes
[29:43] a historic book
[29:45] i mean somebody says to me is that
[29:46] brother michael but the bible is god's
[29:48] word yes and the message the same way
[29:50] it does not come from america it comes
[29:52] from the presence of almighty
[29:54] so you can tell a person look you're
[29:56] come too late honestly
[29:58] we can discuss about dates but we will
[30:00] not discuss the message because i became
[30:02] the message
[30:04] still in process
[30:06] so look at this now you're looking now
[30:08] from to the mount of olives and we are
[30:11] going back and you go you see uh the
[30:14] temple of jerusalem make the next one
[30:16] please
[30:17] by the way i'm thinking so much you see
[30:18] i'm a little bit of a of a nervous type
[30:20] of a person so i'm so happy that i have
[30:22] nothing in my hand because
[30:24] there will be electrical shut down in in
[30:27] in in toledo if i have something in my
[30:28] mind to a remote control you know so
[30:31] so this is the view from mount of olives
[30:34] to the temple
[30:36] the only problem is we have the wrong
[30:38] building over there but i mean you you
[30:39] this you put you put it to my ignorance
[30:42] okay but this is not the temple this is
[30:44] just the mosque of omar
[30:46] when you watch from the mount of olives
[30:50] in this direction you struck straight
[30:52] west
[30:54] straight west
[30:55] not south east you look straight west
[30:58] and when the doors were open in the
[31:00] temple you could see from mount of
[31:02] olives up to the curtain
[31:06] you could see right
[31:08] amen
[31:09] so
[31:10] jesus went when he entered into
[31:13] jerusalem
[31:15] and these people were screaming
[31:17] fanatically
[31:19] he went from the east to the west
[31:25] i when i'm preaching about that subject
[31:27] about what happened in this week you
[31:29] know
[31:30] i said it started with just a
[31:33] demonstration
[31:34] of
[31:35] message believers who received their
[31:37] messiah
[31:39] but this week ended with the coming of
[31:41] the theophany bodies or let me say in
[31:44] other words with the resurrection of the
[31:47] saints
[31:48] because it was the sunday and the next
[31:50] sunday was the day of the resurrection
[31:53] in between of a week
[31:54] it changed from a doctrinal way of
[31:57] seeing up to a supernatural event
[32:01] that dimensions now mixing together
[32:05] this message is not reformation
[32:09] i know brother bram said when we go into
[32:11] the rapture uh we we were passed by the
[32:13] moon about the stars and at the same in
[32:15] the same message brother graham said
[32:17] when we're going to the rapture we're
[32:18] not changing the places change of
[32:19] dimension
[32:21] and our sister said yeah but i believe
[32:23] the first version i said okay let's both
[32:24] go into the rapture and we will see how
[32:26] it was
[32:29] okay
[32:30] i mean definitely so but we are going we
[32:32] are going now right to the west please
[32:35] make the next one
[32:37] and we understand one thing
[32:40] that the bible is right the bible is
[32:42] correct
[32:43] because when cain left the garden of
[32:45] eden which is located
[32:48] in the area of of israel northern africa
[32:52] um that place of of
[32:55] the river river euphrates that that area
[32:59] cain went east at what the bible says
[33:02] and the first civilization that we have
[33:05] is china
[33:06] so the bible is correct
[33:08] and from there civilization went to the
[33:11] west
[33:12] and
[33:13] the messengers went to the west and the
[33:15] gospel went to the west and it went over
[33:17] three seas
[33:19] mediterranean sea then over to england
[33:22] and over to the atlantic ocean and
[33:23] brother blame said that's justification
[33:26] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[33:29] but this was not the end of the story
[33:32] because when it came to the changing of
[33:35] dispensation the voice said to brother
[33:37] branham had you have to go west
[33:42] there was some kind like a force let me
[33:43] say a forced state
[33:45] far is the number of human deliverance
[33:47] that what the prophet said
[33:49] now look
[33:51] when the picture was made of blood with
[33:53] brother brandon was the pillar of fire
[33:54] and i always say this that's what the
[33:56] prophet said we say that brother branham
[33:59] was the pillar of fire but brother
[34:01] graham said god wanted to make a picture
[34:03] of himself
[34:05] and he allowed that i was on the picture
[34:07] too
[34:09] so it was not brother brandon was the
[34:10] pillar of fight it was the pillar of
[34:12] fire with brother branham on it
[34:14] god wanted to make a picture of himself
[34:17] it was made by a kodak eastman film
[34:22] and brother branham oh it is exactly
[34:24] kodak eastman and that is exactly where
[34:26] brother bryan lived all the days of his
[34:28] life but when there was the time for the
[34:30] revealing of the word the voice says to
[34:33] him cersei's is the time now go west
[34:37] and remember that brother brandon that
[34:39] here is a a medium
[34:42] and
[34:43] you have to understand one thing
[34:46] things that are in the denominational
[34:48] world great is small for god
[34:52] amen
[34:53] because brother brennaman in the early
[34:55] years of his ministers i mean 400 000
[34:58] people in bombay india 100 000 people in
[35:01] durban south africa we would say this is
[35:04] a tremendous ministry but that was not
[35:06] the message at that time that was the
[35:09] preparation for the message to come
[35:12] all the healings was just the
[35:14] preparation god wanted to say something
[35:19] so when you go into a denominational
[35:21] world the everybody acknowledged that
[35:23] brother brandon was a prophet
[35:25] benny hinn
[35:26] reiner bonker jimmy swaggart everybody
[35:29] would say william branham was a true
[35:31] prophet but at the end of his ministry
[35:33] he failed because he wanted to teach
[35:37] now for us the first part of the
[35:39] ministry was not as important as the
[35:41] last part of it
[35:43] where where denominations say brother
[35:45] brandon's ministry failed we said now it
[35:48] started really
[35:50] because now the word is open
[35:53] amen because the word comes to a prophet
[35:56] but brother brennan was a young man and
[35:58] here comes that
[35:59] medium
[36:01] and she says this i can tell you your
[36:02] date of your birth
[36:04] because there's a light following you
[36:06] i'm i can tell and brother ben didn't
[36:08] want to know but he could exactly so say
[36:11] as a young man there's a there's a star
[36:13] there's a light for i tell you the date
[36:15] of your birth and it was correct and
[36:16] what did that woman say she said your
[36:18] success
[36:20] will be in the west
[36:23] and brother baby said these mediums know
[36:25] more about the gospels than many
[36:27] preachers
[36:29] we cannot approach when we came into the
[36:32] message of the hour we were not white
[36:33] sheets
[36:34] we had already our background
[36:36] and many of us see the message through
[36:39] their glasses
[36:41] and they have their quotes to defend
[36:42] their little little doctrine that little
[36:44] petty doctrine but but this message we
[36:47] have to die everything many of our
[36:49] people they still live with the old
[36:51] husband
[36:53] denominational husband they have the
[36:54] doctrine of which i can see god send a
[36:56] messenger but this old husband has to
[36:58] die
[36:59] so that we can really marry christ which
[37:02] is the word
[37:03] can you say amen
[37:04] so it went to the west make the next one
[37:07] please so here brother branham in there
[37:09] preaching please make the next one in
[37:11] that preaching the prophet of god he now
[37:14] makes the link to sunset mountain
[37:17] in the message uh what is the attraction
[37:20] on the mountain he said oh
[37:22] there will be a truman true former and
[37:25] later reign in the last days upon that
[37:28] little group that come with him on this
[37:31] little donkey low
[37:33] humble
[37:34] no denomination
[37:36] and i always say no denomination outside
[37:38] of the message and inside of the message
[37:42] somebody said brother marcus here's the
[37:44] new wave and the man of the hour comes
[37:46] and here he said hey the bride found the
[37:48] man of the hour the bride is in the new
[37:51] wave already since many many years she's
[37:53] already in okay i mean lo and harmer
[37:56] crying hosanna to the king that comes in
[37:58] the name of the lord what's the matter
[38:00] today what is the attraction on the
[38:02] mount and brother brian bring brings
[38:05] that story of mount of olives to sunset
[38:08] mountain
[38:10] so what we have is
[38:12] we have a
[38:14] hey let me call it a generation but
[38:16] maybe i'm not i'm just missing some
[38:18] words
[38:19] who are afraid to go into the deeper
[38:21] part of the message because it's not as
[38:24] uncomplicated
[38:27] but don't fear those things
[38:29] because the same god who revealed you
[38:32] who the messenger is is the same god who
[38:34] reveals you the seven thunders
[38:37] it's not a question of working above
[38:38] seminary of being intelligent amen i'll
[38:41] give you just an example amen
[38:44] here is here here is that airplane over
[38:47] there in memphis
[38:49] and the plane stops and cannot go away
[38:52] because of the tornado or whatever and
[38:55] brother brandon hears the voice he said
[38:56] go
[38:58] go and he continues and here was that
[39:00] woman and
[39:02] i don't know if it is politically
[39:03] correct but let me quote the prophet he
[39:05] calls him a negro mama
[39:06] okay or an auntie he says sometimes okay
[39:09] and you have to understand the picture
[39:11] she is now laying over the fence
[39:14] and she says hello parson
[39:16] and brother brahm said how do you know
[39:18] that i'm a minister
[39:20] you see you have to understand normally
[39:22] it was brother branham discerning the
[39:24] people
[39:25] your name is eva i see you in a car
[39:27] accident but here that woman discerns
[39:30] the prophet
[39:32] and the prophet doesn't know who she is
[39:35] you get it
[39:36] he said he said this he said you are the
[39:38] prophet elijah and then she says some
[39:40] which is even greater she says and i'm
[39:42] the shunammite woman
[39:46] it was not brother brandon revealing her
[39:47] it was her revealing brother you say
[39:49] brother marcus that is a tremendous
[39:52] testimony i say that's the same holy
[39:53] spirit who showed you who the seven
[39:55] messengers
[39:57] the same one who revealed you this is
[39:59] the same one who brings you up higher
[40:02] don't only believe don't fear god
[40:05] can you say amen the same holy spirit
[40:08] that showed you come in
[40:10] amen
[40:12] as i was preaching on wednesday when
[40:14] when when joseph in the time when the
[40:16] lamb takes the book
[40:18] when joseph revealed himself to his
[40:20] brothers
[40:21] he didn't say you're a reuben you're a
[40:23] cebullon you're this he just this
[40:26] i am joseph
[40:28] and while he was revealed the brothers
[40:30] were revealed automatically
[40:32] you see now joseph could have gone
[40:34] before pharaoh
[40:37] i am joseph
[40:40] and pharaoh would say so what
[40:43] so what
[40:44] but
[40:45] when he said i am joseph the whole
[40:48] family knew who joseph was and at the
[40:51] same time the family knew who they are
[40:54] so when god revealed himself there was
[40:57] not one service that brother bram said
[40:59] the bride the bright age or the the the
[41:02] presentation of the bride not one
[41:03] preaching one sermon
[41:05] but when god
[41:07] unveiled himself
[41:09] the mighty god unveiled uh who is this
[41:13] who is this melchizedek automatically
[41:15] bride found herself
[41:18] while he reveals herself she is revealed
[41:20] with him
[41:22] nobody can tell you this
[41:24] it's your father revealing from where
[41:26] you come
[41:27] and where you go back to
[41:29] i mean this is just a little a little
[41:31] illustration but before the foundation
[41:34] of the world god made a picture of us
[41:36] and here we were
[41:40] there is no need to be arrogant brother
[41:42] brahm said if you want to continue with
[41:43] god never have an arrogant spirit among
[41:46] you
[41:46] amen but we are proud of our father so
[41:51] god made a picture
[41:52] here we were in what form ever amen just
[41:55] in the mind of god not to bring any kind
[41:57] of questions upon him and god took our
[42:00] souls and was throwing them in seven
[42:02] church ages
[42:04] amen and seven continents and god knows
[42:06] one thing he placed part of himself in
[42:09] our hearts
[42:10] because the bible says david said in the
[42:12] psalm he even placed eternity in our
[42:16] hearts there's only one who is eternal
[42:18] that's god himself
[42:19] you don't become an eternal being by the
[42:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:24] amen you must receive the holy ghost
[42:26] because you come from the mind of god
[42:28] it belongs to you
[42:30] amen you were already in the mind of god
[42:32] you had you had you are like him
[42:34] definitely so come from the same force
[42:36] source
[42:37] so god was just throwing his every pose
[42:40] he knows one thing my sheep he will hear
[42:42] my voice and when seven church ages are
[42:45] over the whole family of god
[42:48] will be together again
[42:50] nobody is missing
[42:52] and this messenger could say us god is
[42:54] not any more complete without you
[42:58] you are not just a number in the church
[43:00] you are part
[43:02] the manifestation of one of his thoughts
[43:05] can you say amen
[43:06] so here is that group and brother
[43:08] brandon brings it if you just make the
[43:10] next one
[43:11] we know
[43:12] that the prophet says now when he speaks
[43:15] about that event
[43:18] he said three years ago it was a
[43:20] prophecy now it's it's history he said
[43:23] what happened on sunset mountain
[43:25] revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled
[43:28] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[43:31] so what happened they had the headstone
[43:34] came christ i mean we're still waiting
[43:37] for him to meet him in the air that's
[43:38] not another question at all okay but
[43:40] christ the worst king now here's what
[43:42] the brother brandon says now friends i
[43:44] believe
[43:46] that he is the same yesterday today and
[43:48] forever i believe he is just as able
[43:51] this afternoon to cause in this building
[43:53] a paradox
[43:55] because that he promised it would happen
[43:58] and how much more has he promised
[44:01] how much more is he leaving in the bible
[44:03] to this very age that we are living the
[44:06] ephesians again of the church
[44:09] keep in mind not ephesus again
[44:13] ephesians
[44:14] again
[44:16] we got seven church ages and we are
[44:18] promised that at the loud you see a
[44:20] church age there would be another
[44:22] ephesians that's right and we are here i
[44:25] believe with all my heart that jesus
[44:27] christ who made the promise
[44:29] so it's not an 8 8 8 8 h or back to a
[44:34] ephesus but it's in ephesians
[44:38] so somebody says brother marcus we are
[44:40] still in loud he's here amen definitely
[44:42] so
[44:43] because because the president of the
[44:45] millennium will not
[44:48] we're still here but brother marcus we
[44:50] live in a new day definitely though
[44:53] amen but it's part of a church age
[44:56] it's in ephesians in between of laodicea
[44:59] amen therefore brother branham starts
[45:01] here 1964
[45:02] shalom good morning
[45:05] i mean a star shines in the night
[45:08] that was brother praise me but there was
[45:10] a changing a trans transforming in his
[45:13] ministry and he starts that year shalom
[45:18] good morning in finnish it's yuma
[45:22] so therefore i said this
[45:24] if we really live in this time our
[45:27] preaching must be different
[45:30] i mean
[45:31] our songs must be different
[45:34] every revival has four has its own own
[45:37] songs
[45:38] so this no imagine this
[45:41] here is now the people of israel they
[45:43] are just in bondage you know whipped out
[45:46] okay
[45:47] evening they have service miriam sing a
[45:50] song for us
[45:51] when
[45:52] israel
[45:54] was in a gib and everybody said that's
[45:56] the truth egyptian land let my people go
[46:03] so god came remembered
[46:06] brought them out
[46:07] brought them over the red seas
[46:10] everything was rejoicing and here comes
[46:12] mo he said miriam just sing a song for
[46:15] us yes i got something chorus number 365
[46:19] when israel
[46:21] was in and mostly hey miriam
[46:24] that song doesn't fit right now to the
[46:26] to the present time
[46:28] i'm a singer song of today
[46:32] amen
[46:33] every revival has their songs
[46:36] can you say amen
[46:37] so so it's nothing wrong to play old
[46:39] song but
[46:40] everything has a balance
[46:44] the lord will come soon and
[46:46] when we sing the song he
[46:49] is here
[46:51] we sing it different than denominations
[46:54] we must think it's completely different
[46:57] they don't know what they think they're
[46:58] just thinking of a little blessing a
[47:00] little a little but we think about the
[47:01] person who came down i'm in christ in
[47:04] christ the full words
[47:06] now the entire holy spirit
[47:08] is visiting the church
[47:10] can you say amen
[47:11] i mean so we see these things different
[47:14] so what happened so oh
[47:16] ephesians church age okay
[47:19] therefore as the church is subject unto
[47:21] christ so let the wives be they're
[47:24] subject to their own husband and
[47:25] everything husbands love your wife and
[47:27] then it says this
[47:29] this is a great mystery but i speak
[47:31] concerning christ and the church
[47:34] so
[47:36] this is the ephesians though what we
[47:39] read for every marriage
[47:42] so i don't know if somebody wants to
[47:43] marry this morning if there is any kind
[47:45] of quick decisions
[47:46] you can do we had already a scripture
[47:48] for it
[47:49] we are reading it for every marriage and
[47:53] what time are we living in ephesians 8
[47:55] it says it's it's a spiritual union
[47:58] between the heavenly bridegroom and the
[48:00] earthly bride
[48:02] that's going on right now
[48:04] can you say amen
[48:08] blessed be the name of it it's a
[48:09] tremendous time
[48:11] people say nothing is going on right now
[48:13] because we want to have some kind like a
[48:15] denominational thing
[48:17] but this is a revival like never before
[48:20] can you say amen
[48:22] i mean therefore the messenger will do
[48:24] two things
[48:25] bring the hearts back to the children
[48:27] and will reveal i think brother man said
[48:29] the seven thunders which will literally
[48:31] bring us to the face of our father i
[48:33] mean two things
[48:35] so this is now going on that means
[48:38] the capstone is landing the the the um
[48:42] the full world what wants to take his
[48:44] place
[48:46] and now my question is this now
[48:48] we want to meet him somewhere we want to
[48:51] get to him somewhere please make the
[48:52] next one
[48:54] you have to understand one thing
[48:56] when brother branham came on the scene
[49:00] he was like david
[49:03] brother branham did not
[49:05] bring a pentecostal revival
[49:09] in fact
[49:10] brother branham was a young man when he
[49:12] received the holy spirit
[49:14] himself the question is why we need the
[49:17] message
[49:20] why do we need the message when brother
[49:21] ben receives the the holy spirit without
[49:23] the baptism the baptism without the
[49:24] message why do we need to make is it
[49:25] just theory is it just nice thoughts
[49:27] nice to have or no
[49:29] amen let's be the name of the lord
[49:32] so when he came with his healing gift
[49:35] there were now many other evangelists
[49:38] they came up in the front
[49:41] it was like when when when when israel
[49:43] was facing goliath here comes david and
[49:46] his smiling relies and the bible says
[49:48] and all israel now
[49:50] restraint in their faith
[49:52] in faith and courage and just go went on
[49:55] when the ministry of william branham
[49:57] started and here you see the ticklish
[49:59] thing
[50:00] many people thought they can do the same
[50:03] in fact
[50:04] i think it was t.l osborne who heard the
[50:06] voice and he said you can do the same do
[50:08] the thing i mean i wonder from where
[50:10] that voice comes because brother ram
[50:11] said not to do it
[50:13] amen
[50:14] think about it the prophet said no no
[50:16] you are an evangelist don't try to
[50:17] imitate this
[50:19] but here comes great men and everybody
[50:21] was a facility more even
[50:24] successful than william branham
[50:27] but they had no message
[50:29] that they had no message they could
[50:31] bring people from one gathering to the
[50:33] next gathering
[50:35] they could bring healing because healing
[50:36] is a gift but they cannot bring you from
[50:39] a certain point into the next point
[50:41] because the only the messenger can do
[50:43] this
[50:44] this third exodus is not just going back
[50:47] to somewhere yes in some sort definitely
[50:49] so but the third exodus it is from the
[50:52] spiritual baptism of the holy ghost
[50:55] to the millennium and the great things
[50:57] hereafter
[50:58] the third actress is not let's just
[51:00] going back no let's go back and get what
[51:02] they have
[51:04] plus
[51:06] what is revealed what brings us home
[51:09] let's have that what they had in the
[51:10] beginning yes sir
[51:12] definitely plus
[51:14] the opening of the word
[51:17] that's what they didn't have in the
[51:18] beginning
[51:19] amen can you say amen
[51:21] so we find out
[51:23] that brother blame said this here is now
[51:26] these people
[51:27] and we have the great evangelists
[51:31] and a person like aura roberts he had 50
[51:35] channels
[51:37] television channels okay
[51:39] and he need the money
[51:42] to keep that thing alive
[51:46] and brother blame said this
[51:48] when these evangelists are begging for
[51:50] money they are still under the same
[51:52] anointing of the of the catholic church
[51:54] he says in the fifth seal they still
[51:56] have and you watch for example jimmy
[51:58] swaggart and i mean
[52:01] we have to make a difference between
[52:02] true working of the holy spirit and just
[52:04] emotionalism
[52:06] both is able i will not say who is but
[52:08] jimmy you know
[52:10] he knows how to make people cry
[52:15] brother brandon tried at one time he was
[52:17] a young man
[52:18] and here comes his older person he said
[52:20] it was the worst preaching that i ever
[52:21] got that i ever heard
[52:25] and then brother said oh but all the
[52:27] sisters and other but they were crying
[52:29] and
[52:30] and and that doctor i forgot the name
[52:32] from the baptist churches your ministry
[52:34] is not to make people cry but to preach
[52:36] the gospel
[52:38] i mean uh whitney houston can make you
[52:40] cry
[52:42] if crying is the evidence for anything
[52:46] now we germans we don't cry
[52:49] but when it comes to football
[52:52] there's something in
[52:53] no not again see me finally
[53:00] if emotionalism is a sign for anything
[53:03] it will not work brother
[53:06] therefore brother ram said instead of
[53:07] searching he speaks of denomination
[53:09] instead of really searching the holy
[53:11] ghost something that changes them they
[53:13] are searching for speaking in tongues
[53:15] so that the young people can come to
[53:17] church i have the holy ghost too nothing
[53:18] changed in their life but they can say
[53:20] so i'm one of you
[53:22] but the baptism brings us into the
[53:25] fellowship of the saints
[53:26] but only the baptism of the holy spirit
[53:28] brings
[53:29] us into the body
[53:31] that's the difference can you say amen
[53:33] so here's jimmy swagger and all these
[53:34] people cry and what he does the camera
[53:37] comes
[53:38] because i mean a lot of tears is a lot
[53:41] of money at the end right because people
[53:44] love to give to something i mean support
[53:47] this work you see how and then people
[53:49] are crying at you all in the camp
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] i think two or three are really hired
[54:01] that is marcus okay
[54:03] but i was one time in a charismatic
[54:05] movement it was a big uh uh it was it it
[54:08] was a big uh fella it was a big car was
[54:11] a big convention
[54:12] and and and uh it came from that
[54:15] pensacola thing you know pure
[54:16] denomination i just wanted to see it you
[54:18] see and then was the altar card and you
[54:20] could see how the own staff you know
[54:21] when it came to the altar they were
[54:23] already
[54:25] so because they knew one thing if the
[54:26] first 20 are running the rest things oh
[54:29] i don't want to miss something so they
[54:30] just go with the flow
[54:32] but it was not really god calling them
[54:34] into nothing
[54:35] definitely so
[54:37] so what happens is that
[54:41] they're filming those people and it
[54:42] comes up and and it is on the screen and
[54:46] by the way
[54:47] by the way by accident the bank account
[54:50] of jimmy swaggart appears
[54:53] i mean
[54:55] pure catholic approach of getting
[54:58] people's money
[54:59] always the same so
[55:01] so here what happens is this he said
[55:04] brother sister i've been back in the
[55:05] cave long enough and you have to that to
[55:08] know that there has been a lot of
[55:10] earthquakes and brother branham speaks
[55:12] about the
[55:13] revivals in the 50s
[55:15] shaking around a lot of noise and fusses
[55:18] nothing against don't misunderstand me
[55:20] it's dues and things like that big
[55:23] meetings but where has been got out of
[55:26] it
[55:27] that's the reason i said what i said
[55:29] this morning there has to come something
[55:31] deeper than a healing service brother
[55:34] baby didn't say it is wrong but
[55:37] something deeper has to follow that
[55:39] there has to come something deeper than
[55:41] a gift to speak with tongues there has
[55:43] to be something deeper than a rushing
[55:45] mighty wind
[55:47] so if brother branham
[55:49] brought the church into a higher level
[55:51] why should i bring the bring bring the
[55:53] people back to
[55:55] some kind of an emotional pentecostalism
[55:58] amen amen can you say amen
[56:01] so it's so important and then you have
[56:03] to see this
[56:04] that
[56:05] uh when aaron roberts had his had his
[56:08] television program
[56:10] um
[56:12] it was not only the preaching the
[56:13] preaching was not enough for the people
[56:15] so they hired the singers
[56:18] that was the time when red foley and
[56:20] these people came in
[56:21] and they were
[56:23] singing as in form of a concert before
[56:27] the people okay
[56:29] so
[56:30] say it in my words
[56:32] church has become entertainment for the
[56:35] people
[56:36] pure spiritual entertainment
[56:40] amen
[56:41] we love these things
[56:42] seeing in all this
[56:44] but it will not change you that you have
[56:45] to understand this the word will change
[56:48] you
[56:49] one of the mistakes that brother branham
[56:51] showed is never major on a minor
[56:54] and never minor on a major let minor
[56:56] things be minor you see
[56:59] amen
[57:00] and with the major thing would change
[57:01] our heart this would be the center of
[57:04] all things
[57:05] so it became a
[57:09] question of a pure
[57:11] entertainment it took the sincerity away
[57:14] from the people
[57:15] so here in that time brother branham got
[57:18] a vision what we called the tent vision
[57:20] okay we're still in the subject of our
[57:22] father coming down okay if we just show
[57:24] it okay next one please
[57:28] here he says this
[57:30] he says and he picked me up and he took
[57:32] me up and sent me way up high to where a
[57:34] meeting was going on looked like a tent
[57:37] or a cathedral of some sort and i looked
[57:40] and there was a little box a little
[57:42] place over on the side and i seen that
[57:44] light was talking to somebody above me
[57:47] that light that you see there on the
[57:48] picture it rolled away from me like that
[57:51] and went over to that tent and said i
[57:54] will meet you there and said this will
[57:56] be the third pull and you won't tell
[57:58] nobody and in sabino kenya he said this
[58:01] is the third pool
[58:04] so so so god sees
[58:07] that he sends william branham
[58:10] as a gift
[58:11] and as paul was not in the upper room
[58:14] william branham was not in azusa street
[58:17] both came later
[58:19] the problem of the first church in
[58:21] jerusalem was that they did not
[58:23] recognize their messenger and you can
[58:25] see very clear on the jerusalem council
[58:27] because peter was the spokesman
[58:30] john uh james was the pastor and they
[58:33] were just talking to one for them paul
[58:36] was just a nice missionary going to the
[58:38] hiddens
[58:40] but brother brahma said only the
[58:42] messenger of the age catches the mystery
[58:45] of the age
[58:46] brings it but as they couldn't see
[58:49] their messenger brother bram said when
[58:51] the first messenger came the church was
[58:53] already a fallen woman
[58:54] in the resume of the church age was
[58:56] already a form in short time
[58:59] so here's brother branham and he comes
[59:00] later and he sees and god sees that
[59:03] people are relying now on the gifts on
[59:05] the healing on the big meetings on the
[59:08] person
[59:11] and he has to do something deeper
[59:14] because god's vision was always to live
[59:18] with man as he did in the garden of eden
[59:22] we're thankful to god that he sent
[59:24] william brandon we are thankful to god
[59:25] that he sent him did he take him away
[59:28] because nobody would preach today we
[59:30] would all stream jeffersonville
[59:32] amen and billy paul gives that little
[59:34] example he said his father said to him
[59:36] billy god will take me home because i'm
[59:38] here and you are here
[59:40] kenny capps told us brother marcus at
[59:42] the end he became a catholic thing
[59:45] because we didn't even pray anymore if
[59:47] somebody was sick we were just phoning
[59:48] brother ben brother branham somebody
[59:50] said can you pray
[59:52] think about that he became a catholic
[59:54] that's what he said himself nobody
[59:55] prayed anymore because brother branham
[59:56] was around he would pray for us like a
[59:58] catholic priest amen
[1:00:00] but god wants his children to come into
[1:00:03] immaturity
[1:00:05] and and brother and brother bran said
[1:00:07] with billy paul i'm here and you are
[1:00:09] here but god wants to have you here
[1:00:11] but as long as i'm here you're looking
[1:00:13] too much to me
[1:00:14] so god would take me away he said you
[1:00:17] get a hold
[1:00:18] of this message this is what the young
[1:00:20] generation understand he is jehovah he
[1:00:22] is jehovah jairo you have to you have to
[1:00:25] nurse from him
[1:00:26] you have to drink it you have to eat it
[1:00:29] and you say man
[1:00:30] i'm in order to grow
[1:00:33] in christian things
[1:00:35] when i was a boy that's what that's what
[1:00:37] i lost my thought
[1:00:40] we were not believers at that time
[1:00:42] and i know i made it already when i was
[1:00:44] wednesday here but i was a fan of arnold
[1:00:46] schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone
[1:00:51] so one time arnold schwarzenegger he
[1:00:53] just made a little movement with his
[1:00:54] breasts breath
[1:00:57] and i was just a little skinny boy so i
[1:01:00] started bodybuilding
[1:01:02] so i tell you boys everything that you
[1:01:04] see here was here
[1:01:08] it's just a changing of dispensation
[1:01:12] but everything that you see here was
[1:01:13] here
[1:01:15] honestly
[1:01:16] it's not a problem you see but therefore
[1:01:18] i said this you can make bodybuilding
[1:01:21] you can't make sport but don't invest
[1:01:23] too much time
[1:01:25] don't forget your soul
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] you can do whatever you want you don't
[1:01:30] have to make any kind of sport this is
[1:01:32] just human life okay uh but but don't
[1:01:35] invest too much into it
[1:01:37] okay so what happens is i was making
[1:01:39] bodybuilding and i went before the
[1:01:41] mirror and nothing happened
[1:01:44] try to go back
[1:01:46] but i learned one thing
[1:01:47] if you want to have muscles you cannot
[1:01:49] eat mcdonald's
[1:01:52] salmon
[1:01:54] it's the quietest audience that i ever
[1:01:56] heard
[1:01:56] [Laughter]
[1:01:59] if you want to have mussels you need a
[1:02:01] real steak
[1:02:03] you need something to feed upon
[1:02:05] and brother ben shows us the natural
[1:02:07] types the spiritual if you want to have
[1:02:10] muscles on your chest i said improv on
[1:02:13] penises on your breast
[1:02:15] better say chest okay if you have one my
[1:02:17] if you only have muscles on your breast
[1:02:19] if you want to have muscles amen
[1:02:22] he said you can i said you cannot eat
[1:02:25] harry potter
[1:02:26] you cannot eat facebook
[1:02:29] you can use it for some social network
[1:02:32] but don't think that you are now feeding
[1:02:34] spiritually because you are in some kind
[1:02:36] of a whatsapp group
[1:02:38] you must eat off the body word of the
[1:02:42] son of man which is the message of the
[1:02:44] hour
[1:02:45] and say amen
[1:02:47] you can do diet
[1:02:49] you don't have to do diet
[1:02:52] amen this is this is pure human life but
[1:02:55] never make a diet on the word
[1:02:58] you must take your time to eat the book
[1:03:00] to become the book amen that's it be the
[1:03:03] name of the lord so god
[1:03:05] stops
[1:03:06] to reform us on the inside but he is
[1:03:09] doing something on the outside but god
[1:03:12] does something on the inside for us
[1:03:14] the true purpose
[1:03:16] of christianity is not having people
[1:03:19] with long hair and long dresses because
[1:03:21] all the muslims have longer dresses than
[1:03:23] us
[1:03:25] the muslims are even
[1:03:27] you see
[1:03:28] god wants to have fellowship with us
[1:03:31] god wants to be a father to us
[1:03:34] not oh we go to church and we are better
[1:03:37] than the baptist oh thank you god and
[1:03:40] these pentecostal chicken i cannot see
[1:03:42] them anymore
[1:03:44] heavenly father i'm the only eagle here
[1:03:47] i'm so sorry i'm so sorry for the retina
[1:03:49] now
[1:03:52] this message did not leave us a doctrine
[1:03:54] it left us an attitude
[1:03:58] that you can feel sympathy with with
[1:04:01] anybody
[1:04:02] say brother because we thought when we
[1:04:04] were legalizing this message we can
[1:04:06] over every unbeliever
[1:04:09] because he saw us anyhow and then we can
[1:04:11] over every denomination because
[1:04:13] they don't have a message and then we
[1:04:15] had only feelings for those in the
[1:04:16] message who believed like us
[1:04:19] and all the time the circle became
[1:04:20] bigger smaller and smaller it's only us
[1:04:23] the chosen frozen
[1:04:26] but this messenger showed us how you can
[1:04:29] love people you can respect people and
[1:04:31] brother if somebody is not bright we
[1:04:33] will not make them bright
[1:04:35] but if somebody is not bright it doesn't
[1:04:37] mean he's not nothing
[1:04:38] he is something in the economy of god
[1:04:41] brother blame said a lot was just a
[1:04:43] penny and abraham was the silver dollar
[1:04:45] he said but god uses pennies
[1:04:52] and then brother brady said yes he uses
[1:04:54] pen and then second quote and that helps
[1:04:56] us so much brother raymond said everyone
[1:04:58] who served god's purpose will have a
[1:05:00] resurrection
[1:05:03] god remembers
[1:05:05] these things blessed be the name of the
[1:05:06] lord can you say amen
[1:05:08] so what happens is this here comes that
[1:05:10] tent vision
[1:05:12] now
[1:05:13] if god says to brother brainer i want to
[1:05:16] meet him there it would be good to know
[1:05:18] where the meeting place is
[1:05:20] huh because my question brother brother
[1:05:23] marcus where is the rapture in
[1:05:25] jeffersonville or tucson
[1:05:27] and brother ramsay in christ
[1:05:29] amen okay so where is the meeting place
[1:05:32] make the next one please please see one
[1:05:34] thing i mean
[1:05:37] a vision of brother branham
[1:05:41] or a vision in the bible
[1:05:43] can be naturally
[1:05:45] and can be symbolically
[1:05:48] the vision of marijuana was naturally
[1:05:51] the vision of pharaoh with the seven
[1:05:53] cows was completely symbolically
[1:05:57] some visions are natural visions
[1:06:00] some visions are
[1:06:03] spiritual visions with a spiritual
[1:06:05] application
[1:06:06] so if you make a spiritual vision to be
[1:06:09] natural you are searching the tent
[1:06:12] and they are building up up right now in
[1:06:14] south america a big a big tent to
[1:06:16] fulfill brother branham's vision
[1:06:20] but
[1:06:21] and here comes the point how i see it
[1:06:23] and i know i'm right but i don't have to
[1:06:24] say okay i don't have authority to say
[1:06:26] okay
[1:06:28] bring everything that the prophet said
[1:06:30] bring it back to the word
[1:06:33] that is one if you see a false doctrine
[1:06:35] in this message it's always built upon
[1:06:37] quotes
[1:06:39] and he has now
[1:06:40] anchor in the word in the in the whole
[1:06:42] picture
[1:06:44] it's just quote upon quote and
[1:06:45] misquoting something and then you come
[1:06:46] into a direction which doesn't make
[1:06:48] who was the first one who had a 10th
[1:06:51] vision in the bible
[1:06:53] that was moses definitely so
[1:06:56] moses was the first one he was taken up
[1:06:58] into the presence of god he saw the out
[1:07:00] of god and when he came down he should
[1:07:02] build a tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:07:06] according to the vision that he saw in
[1:07:07] heaven
[1:07:09] solomon takes that same concept
[1:07:13] and builds the temple in jerusalem and
[1:07:15] brother
[1:07:18] it has three compartments body soul and
[1:07:20] spirit this messenger revealed to us the
[1:07:23] temple in jerusalem was just a shadow on
[1:07:25] a human being
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:31] this gives you respect for people
[1:07:34] for god to create a planet is nothing
[1:07:39] nothing god is god he just makes and
[1:07:41] another planet comes
[1:07:43] but the human being is the only species
[1:07:46] in in space who is made in the image of
[1:07:49] god
[1:07:51] it's nobody higher
[1:07:53] so if even if you see a dump on this a
[1:07:56] bump on the street
[1:07:57] for us he means nothing but brother
[1:07:59] brain said but for a mother it's his boy
[1:08:03] it's her boy and baby for a little girl
[1:08:06] it's her daddy
[1:08:08] every person on his earth deserves a
[1:08:10] certain form of a respect
[1:08:12] how do you how do you do yes i said this
[1:08:16] brother we are not a sect
[1:08:18] do you know how a sect is is is is
[1:08:21] identified
[1:08:22] in a sect you only have a value when
[1:08:25] you're a member of that
[1:08:27] of that lodge
[1:08:29] you see and sometimes
[1:08:31] let me see in christian churches here is
[1:08:33] a person
[1:08:34] goes to church everything is fine
[1:08:37] here she comes
[1:08:40] and we say oh
[1:08:41] brother marcus
[1:08:43] he from the foundation of the world i
[1:08:45] knew you already
[1:08:47] you are just an eagle you are just okay
[1:08:49] here something happens to brother marcus
[1:08:51] it doesn't have to be a doctrinal thing
[1:08:53] but maybe he's
[1:08:54] has heartache because of he fell in love
[1:08:57] to a girl
[1:08:58] so brother marcus doesn't come anymore
[1:09:00] he's away the same people will say
[1:09:03] yes
[1:09:04] he went from us because he never was
[1:09:06] part of us
[1:09:09] so brother marcus comes back to his
[1:09:10] right mind he said okay next week i'm
[1:09:13] coming back to church the same people
[1:09:14] would say
[1:09:15] he was always an eagle
[1:09:18] always it was an eagle
[1:09:21] that is a sect
[1:09:24] there is a sect
[1:09:25] if your value if you only have a value
[1:09:28] because you fit into their system you
[1:09:30] better
[1:09:31] flee away from that thing
[1:09:33] if you're a family of god god remembers
[1:09:35] you amen sometimes you forgot who you
[1:09:38] are but god did not forget you
[1:09:41] can you sometimes we we dress like
[1:09:44] heathens and we
[1:09:46] we we each like hidden
[1:09:48] and we we we we behave like edems and we
[1:09:51] live like heathens whatever but god
[1:09:53] knows there's still a soul there is
[1:09:55] still a part of me in it let my boy
[1:09:58] comes to himself
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:02] when i was a young boy i could dance
[1:10:03] like michael jackson
[1:10:05] i could take mike the moon works shall i
[1:10:06] make it
[1:10:07] [Laughter]
[1:10:11] but all the time my father was not
[1:10:13] nervous about me
[1:10:15] because i did not know who i was
[1:10:17] but when when that voice called me i r i
[1:10:20] did not understand but it was there was
[1:10:21] some call that somewhere hurt somewhere
[1:10:24] when i was in him
[1:10:26] i heard that voice already
[1:10:28] do you know one thing if a person dies
[1:10:30] the last sense that he's losing is his
[1:10:33] earring
[1:10:34] hearing
[1:10:36] therefore if somebody falls into a coma
[1:10:38] and he's for example a fan of michael
[1:10:40] jackson or whatever you put michael
[1:10:42] jackson on his ear many times they come
[1:10:44] back because they remember that voice
[1:10:46] that's so
[1:10:47] so i told the church if i fall into a
[1:10:50] coma you know what you put on my head
[1:10:51] okay
[1:10:53] and if i hear good evening in france i
[1:10:54] know i'm back here
[1:10:56] because it is the voice behind the voice
[1:11:00] that we recognize
[1:11:02] can you say amen
[1:11:04] so sometimes we don't know who we are
[1:11:06] and here is god
[1:11:07] he is not dealing with a group
[1:11:12] i said to brother chad on on on
[1:11:14] wednesday
[1:11:16] it's a bit bigger the building than this
[1:11:17] one
[1:11:18] i said the time will come where our
[1:11:20] churches will be closed
[1:11:23] that's what the prophet says
[1:11:25] but then we will be the church
[1:11:27] i'm the church
[1:11:29] therefore if you can come don't sleep in
[1:11:30] the church we will see it this afternoon
[1:11:32] if you come get benefit of it don't
[1:11:35] drive for two hours then to sleep in the
[1:11:37] church
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:39] sleep in bed and pray in church don't
[1:11:40] pray in bed and stephen church
[1:11:43] then something is misrepresented in our
[1:11:45] life
[1:11:45] if you come say lord speak to me okay
[1:11:48] but our churches will one day be closed
[1:11:51] i said to brother chad brother chad
[1:11:53] maybe he was shocked i couldn't say i
[1:11:54] said your church will be a nice
[1:11:57] rent of a cars you know it's big enough
[1:11:59] here will be the used vehicles and here
[1:12:01] are the new
[1:12:03] now this church will be a nice pizzeria
[1:12:05] one day
[1:12:10] but we will not cry
[1:12:12] we would say okay then it's time to go
[1:12:13] home
[1:12:15] they say amen we are not worshiping a
[1:12:17] building
[1:12:18] not a doctrine not a group
[1:12:20] it's a family of god that you will take
[1:12:22] home
[1:12:23] the rapture is not that god will be
[1:12:25] standing there and said okay
[1:12:28] literal life tabernacle
[1:12:31] okay
[1:12:32] maybe
[1:12:35] the maybe is god will take all his
[1:12:37] children home
[1:12:38] the rapture is him coming down and
[1:12:40] picking us up home
[1:12:43] i love that i made this illustration
[1:12:45] different time and it shows when we have
[1:12:47] father's day today
[1:12:49] think about our heavenly father who he
[1:12:52] is and who we are i mean there was one
[1:12:54] time a boy and he wanted to buy some
[1:12:56] dogs okay
[1:12:58] and when he was buying these dogs the
[1:13:01] owner of the dogs he came down this
[1:13:03] staircase and the boy said i want to
[1:13:05] have this dog
[1:13:07] and the owner said i mean what what do
[1:13:08] you want with this dog he cannot run
[1:13:10] he's handicapped and he doesn't have a
[1:13:12] value anyhow
[1:13:13] and the boys he picked up his throws and
[1:13:16] from his knee down he had an artificial
[1:13:19] leg
[1:13:20] and the boy said i want to have this dog
[1:13:21] because when we go out he understands me
[1:13:24] and i understand yeah
[1:13:26] and brother blame said this
[1:13:28] god became man to understand
[1:13:31] quote brother branham god became
[1:13:34] teenager to understand the teenagers
[1:13:36] that's the father that we serve
[1:13:38] and even brother brahem said god became
[1:13:40] man as man you understand what i want to
[1:13:42] say in a mixed audience to understand
[1:13:44] man
[1:13:45] whatever you pray
[1:13:47] god says i understand what you talk
[1:13:49] about
[1:13:50] that's our father
[1:13:52] whenever it's important brother ramsey
[1:13:54] god doesn't send an angel he comes it
[1:13:55] down himself
[1:13:57] think about that time
[1:13:59] can you say amen
[1:14:00] amen so here we have amen the first tent
[1:14:03] you continue and then
[1:14:05] we see this
[1:14:08] the tent where is the tent
[1:14:11] amen let me say in my own words let the
[1:14:14] bride be the tent
[1:14:16] amen let you be the tent
[1:14:18] amen because we live in a tent
[1:14:21] amen amen look i'm a very sympathetic
[1:14:24] type of a person you wouldn't believe
[1:14:26] but honestly
[1:14:28] my problem is i live in a german tent
[1:14:30] for 70 years
[1:14:32] i mean but if i will step from my german
[1:14:36] tent in my true body
[1:14:38] that god ordained for me amen you will
[1:14:40] find out marcus back as a fine boy he's
[1:14:42] a good body he's a good brother
[1:14:44] every funeral we say this for we know
[1:14:47] that our earthly house of this
[1:14:49] tabernacle you could call it tent
[1:14:52] we're dissolved we have a building of
[1:14:55] god a house not made with hands eternal
[1:14:58] in the heaven
[1:15:00] and paul continues in verse 5 we are now
[1:15:03] living temporarily in a tent
[1:15:06] but we will enter into
[1:15:09] it was brother brandon who said that
[1:15:12] heavenly body is our theophany
[1:15:16] brother brahm did not invent theophanies
[1:15:18] but he was the messenger the first
[1:15:20] messenger who could show us the
[1:15:22] unvisible world yes
[1:15:25] two questions to brother and brother
[1:15:26] brandon who are the angels beholding the
[1:15:29] faith of the father all the time but the
[1:15:31] brain said that's the body that you're
[1:15:32] going into it's your theophany
[1:15:35] brother brandon please explain the angel
[1:15:38] which abides with every accolade every
[1:15:40] believer brother brahman said only the
[1:15:42] redeemed half angels it's your own
[1:15:44] theophany that was his questions one
[1:15:46] before the seals one after the seals
[1:15:48] brother brahm did not
[1:15:50] invent theophanies
[1:15:53] but he was the one showing us our link
[1:15:56] to it because he said my glorified body
[1:15:58] is standing right here on the platform
[1:16:00] i'm charging me like a bet he calls a
[1:16:02] glorified body but by this
[1:16:05] therefore
[1:16:07] you say brother mark is it can that be
[1:16:08] look at what the bible says if
[1:16:11] if you have a certain kind of a
[1:16:12] hospitality you invite the good brother
[1:16:14] it's not only the brother coming
[1:16:17] it's his angel going with him amen and
[1:16:20] if you invite some kind of a critics is
[1:16:23] a wrong spirit going with that person
[1:16:24] the same way can you say amen
[1:16:27] i mean therefore it's a supernatural
[1:16:30] gathering when you come to the church
[1:16:32] it's not only become for a sermon
[1:16:34] amen it's you are here and i believe
[1:16:37] this wherever this message is preached
[1:16:39] the pillar of fire is there
[1:16:41] that's what i believe
[1:16:42] amen and the angels of the lord i encamp
[1:16:45] those who fear him
[1:16:47] so we live according to the bible we
[1:16:49] live in a tent
[1:16:51] amen but we are not that tense
[1:16:54] brother sister you are not a person with
[1:16:57] a soul
[1:16:58] you are the soul living in a body
[1:17:02] when you came to earth nobody asked you
[1:17:06] do you want to be black or white nobody
[1:17:08] asked you
[1:17:09] you want to be german or or or
[1:17:12] or american
[1:17:13] as i always said you america you
[1:17:15] americans are baxter europeans anyhow
[1:17:21] nobody asks you do you want to be male
[1:17:22] or do you want to be female
[1:17:24] nobody asks you
[1:17:26] nobody asks you which kind of name do
[1:17:27] you want to have you couldn't even
[1:17:28] choose your own name your parents choose
[1:17:30] that crooked name that you have all your
[1:17:31] life
[1:17:33] if you like it or not
[1:17:36] i'm in nobody nobody asked do you want
[1:17:39] to what kind of family you want to
[1:17:40] become i would have said um is is
[1:17:42] rockefeller is that okay that's
[1:17:47] brother i was born in a broken home
[1:17:48] nobody asked me right and i was so
[1:17:50] hating my own life you know having that
[1:17:52] kind of i saw how my father was beating
[1:17:54] up my mother
[1:17:55] even with the holy spirit you'll never
[1:17:57] forget these pictures you never forget
[1:17:58] it's deep in your soul but i have enough
[1:18:00] holy spirit to go over it right but we
[1:18:03] didn't choose our own background and and
[1:18:05] sometimes we hate ourselves we hate the
[1:18:07] background from where we are but one
[1:18:08] thing is true and we thought we came
[1:18:10] wrong on this earth but quote brother
[1:18:12] branham in the message thinks it ought
[1:18:14] to be god planned your birth for many
[1:18:18] many generations
[1:18:21] it is not that god knew that would you
[1:18:23] would be there but god planned your
[1:18:26] your birth for many generations
[1:18:28] it helps you to accept you the way how
[1:18:31] you are
[1:18:32] can you say amen
[1:18:34] your grandfather
[1:18:36] i was when i was last year here it was
[1:18:38] veterans day
[1:18:41] veterans day in the us i was over there
[1:18:43] in in north carolina so somebody we went
[1:18:45] into a restaurant and somebody wants to
[1:18:46] give me an arden or something like a
[1:18:48] like a like a special
[1:18:50] a special present it's veterans day
[1:18:53] and i received it i got it veteran's day
[1:18:55] thank you very much i wanted to say yes
[1:18:57] but i was on the wrong side
[1:19:03] but i didn't do it
[1:19:05] i was afraid they were spitting in my
[1:19:06] food or something like this
[1:19:08] i said better say nothing that do do do
[1:19:14] but we never choose
[1:19:17] and we think we came back wrong
[1:19:20] on this earth but one thing is sure
[1:19:22] god makes sure that you go the right way
[1:19:25] you will leave this earth in the right
[1:19:27] way
[1:19:28] but we're living with our life complexes
[1:19:31] that we didn't choose for ourselves
[1:19:33] can you say amen
[1:19:35] god god god wanted to bring us directly
[1:19:37] into our theophany
[1:19:40] and we landed in ohio
[1:19:44] we wanted to come by the spoken word and
[1:19:46] we had to go to the birth channel
[1:19:48] with all the blood and all the crying i
[1:19:50] was there when my daughter was when my
[1:19:52] daughter was born
[1:19:54] present
[1:19:55] in german you can do it
[1:19:57] so i always said this my my wife needed
[1:19:59] one midwife
[1:20:00] i needed two
[1:20:02] honestly
[1:20:05] that was too much a burst is too much
[1:20:07] honestly
[1:20:09] i promise my wife will never get another
[1:20:11] child
[1:20:12] no no that was not so but but
[1:20:15] i was thinking twice about certain
[1:20:17] things you know that was for me too much
[1:20:20] so we came on this earth
[1:20:22] you see the first thing that we got was
[1:20:24] a spanky
[1:20:26] and the big website you get more in life
[1:20:28] you will see
[1:20:30] that was our welcoming part um the first
[1:20:33] thing okay you're here marcus first is
[1:20:34] thank you
[1:20:37] and the midwife said okay during your 70
[1:20:39] 80 years on this earth you get some more
[1:20:42] but i'm happy
[1:20:43] life is more than 70 years in in ohio
[1:20:47] god thinks about eternity
[1:20:49] this is just a passage we just live in a
[1:20:51] tent for some time
[1:20:53] brother and full redemption is when we
[1:20:54] leave that tent and go into our real
[1:20:56] body who we are really can you say amen
[1:20:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:01] just just finish make the next make the
[1:21:03] next one so here we go we understand
[1:21:06] the tenth vision and god
[1:21:10] as
[1:21:11] as eve was taken at the cross out of
[1:21:14] adam brother bram calls her the second
[1:21:17] wife as adam was giving her second wife
[1:21:20] okay on the uh i'm in that time we don't
[1:21:22] go into it you know
[1:21:24] there was a time of the separation but
[1:21:26] after 2 000 years now god takes his wife
[1:21:28] back into his bosom
[1:21:31] this message is connecting the heavenly
[1:21:33] bridegroom with the earthly bride
[1:21:36] and it's not some kind of a reformation
[1:21:38] here it's connecting hearts our hearts
[1:21:40] with our heavenly father
[1:21:43] amen
[1:21:44] i mean there was a there was there was a
[1:21:46] there was a thing when brother branham
[1:21:48] uh heard that kind of of a prophecy and
[1:21:52] look what he said danny henry he said he
[1:21:56] said
[1:21:57] because thou have chosen
[1:22:00] thy way and brother ben said it was my
[1:22:02] choosing
[1:22:03] and god says
[1:22:05] it was my way
[1:22:08] do you see one thing it was his choosing
[1:22:12] but it was god's way
[1:22:14] in other words
[1:22:15] god says to his messenger you arrived
[1:22:18] your ambitions are not my ambitions
[1:22:21] when you speak it's me that i speak
[1:22:23] your heart is my heart
[1:22:26] you think like i think yes
[1:22:28] can you say amen
[1:22:30] i mean you have to see one thing is it
[1:22:31] fine for you can you say amen
[1:22:34] this message is transforming us into the
[1:22:36] image of our father but you must know
[1:22:39] who you are then you know one thing
[1:22:41] i will arrive there because it's
[1:22:42] somebody or a representation already is
[1:22:44] waiting for me
[1:22:46] i make it
[1:22:47] amen
[1:22:48] here you have to see one thing
[1:22:50] here comes elohim and he's and he's just
[1:22:53] pronouncing judgment i mean and and
[1:22:56] abraham says oh if there is 50 in in in
[1:22:58] toledo if there is 40 if there is 30 if
[1:23:01] there's 20 and god just don't waste my
[1:23:04] time but god in his heart said that's my
[1:23:06] boy
[1:23:08] because god wants to the salvation of
[1:23:09] each and every one
[1:23:11] god does if okay if there's one but he
[1:23:13] was so proud abraham that's my boy
[1:23:16] he thinks like me he's a savior like i'm
[1:23:18] a savior he's trying to to even make a
[1:23:21] deal with me
[1:23:23] abraham the first deal maker
[1:23:25] i mean before there was anything he was
[1:23:28] not a loser he was a deal maker
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:31] the same with moses god says i will
[1:23:33] disrupt them and moses said don't just
[1:23:35] take me and god says that's my boy
[1:23:38] that is christ in moses i can see myself
[1:23:41] in the reflection
[1:23:42] can you say amen legalism will never
[1:23:45] produce it
[1:23:47] you must understand god have you ever
[1:23:49] seen one thing and as i said i mean just
[1:23:52] being from from inspiration
[1:23:54] brother branham was together with
[1:23:56] uh these kind of bible scholars great
[1:24:00] men around his time then the new greek
[1:24:03] hebrew latin and so forth great man
[1:24:06] and they came to brother brandon and
[1:24:07] they said brother brahman you don't know
[1:24:08] your bible very well very well
[1:24:11] and you understand what brother braham
[1:24:12] said he said i don't know my bible maybe
[1:24:14] very well like you but i know the author
[1:24:17] and we always thought in the pentecostal
[1:24:19] way because our background is pure
[1:24:20] pentecost we came out of it you know in
[1:24:22] that sense of okay
[1:24:24] seeing in the power and the grace and we
[1:24:27] always thought blessing is volume that's
[1:24:30] what we always thought we nev we could
[1:24:31] not accept god can do in silence great
[1:24:34] things
[1:24:35] we did we did what it was not in our in
[1:24:37] our vision when the holy spirit comes
[1:24:39] from and then we saw the film the deep
[1:24:41] corners to the deep
[1:24:42] and everybody was just sitting and
[1:24:44] brother blame said he's here
[1:24:48] nobody jumping around and the sisters
[1:24:52] he's here
[1:24:54] so god can do
[1:24:57] do great things in volume but god can do
[1:25:00] great things in silence the same way
[1:25:02] don't limit god in our tradition our
[1:25:04] culture don't do this
[1:25:06] blessed be the name of the lord but but
[1:25:08] but then i understood look
[1:25:10] what did brother branham say
[1:25:13] he said you will first understand the
[1:25:15] book
[1:25:16] if you know the writer of the book if
[1:25:18] you understand how he thinks then you
[1:25:21] can see the book
[1:25:24] you say amen so you must know the nature
[1:25:26] and we never knew who god was in 2000
[1:25:28] years
[1:25:29] therefore we tried it with
[1:25:30] pentecostalism with reformation with
[1:25:33] legalism we tried everything we tried
[1:25:35] even to to make some kind like a uh like
[1:25:38] an entertainment so that they keep young
[1:25:39] people stay in church
[1:25:41] i'm a let's have some barbecue let's
[1:25:43] have some volleyball but nothing against
[1:25:44] it it's part of it but it will not keep
[1:25:46] the people in christ
[1:25:49] it's not the solution
[1:25:51] you just keep them until god is touching
[1:25:53] there's no problem about that
[1:25:54] but now we understand how god thinks how
[1:25:56] he is his care his love amen here it is
[1:26:00] psalm 27 now where is where is now the
[1:26:03] tenth absence of david the lord is my
[1:26:05] light and my salvation whom shall i fear
[1:26:08] the lord is my stranger of my life
[1:26:11] not the church amen amen that's fine not
[1:26:14] uh brother if you only would know
[1:26:15] brother marcus the lord is
[1:26:18] so to be a part of it when the wicked
[1:26:20] man ends the force for in the time of
[1:26:23] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:26:26] in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:26:29] you say that's brandon tabernacle no no
[1:26:31] no that is here
[1:26:34] that is the tent that is the that is
[1:26:36] that that is that
[1:26:37] body that is prepared for you ah he
[1:26:39] shall hide in his tabernacle he shall
[1:26:42] set me upon a rock which is revelation
[1:26:44] back into your tenth vision
[1:26:48] therefore when eliezer came he was not
[1:26:51] he he he was not marrying
[1:26:54] rebecca
[1:26:56] and do you remember that that in that
[1:26:58] calling there was something supernatural
[1:27:00] i mean because eliezer said look if i
[1:27:03] will say
[1:27:04] give my camels to drink
[1:27:06] and she will say i give my camels to
[1:27:09] drink and you to drink
[1:27:11] right
[1:27:12] okay then it will be the right
[1:27:14] so he was expressing only half of it the
[1:27:17] second half was in his heart
[1:27:19] so when rebecca came
[1:27:21] down
[1:27:23] i mean
[1:27:24] eliza said hey girl how are you doing
[1:27:27] fine
[1:27:28] do you give my camel something to drink
[1:27:31] sure
[1:27:32] that was the social part every
[1:27:34] denomination can do this
[1:27:36] i'ma do something and then eliezer was
[1:27:38] waiting does she get
[1:27:40] the thing which is hidden in my heart
[1:27:43] does she get does she get in the
[1:27:44] supernatural channel that god input and
[1:27:47] then
[1:27:48] rebecca says yes and do you want to
[1:27:50] drink something too
[1:27:53] that was not outspoken
[1:27:55] she got in the channel of what eliezer
[1:27:58] had in his heart and he's on one thing
[1:28:00] that's the same holy spirit gave in to
[1:28:01] my heart that is now working on her
[1:28:03] heart amen
[1:28:04] it's a secret in her
[1:28:06] can you say amen the bride knows
[1:28:10] aman the secret of god
[1:28:12] can you see amen and what happened
[1:28:15] when they were on the way amen
[1:28:18] they were just riding
[1:28:21] and eliza rebecca said can you say
[1:28:24] something about my bridegroom yes i mean
[1:28:27] who is this merchandise he was preaching
[1:28:29] for two hours i mean united signed and
[1:28:31] signed the united states is that so yeah
[1:28:34] sick the seventh seed is revealed
[1:28:36] so definitely so i mean i mean yes
[1:28:39] exactly so the token i will explain you
[1:28:40] the token and in the evening time
[1:28:44] when she met ellie is in the evening
[1:28:47] time where did they go in the tent
[1:28:50] of her mother
[1:28:54] we are the tent of our mother amma we're
[1:28:57] the fruit of our mother
[1:28:58] where is the meeting place today is it
[1:29:01] in toledo or is it in limer
[1:29:07] better make that
[1:29:09] dead meeting place right in your hearts
[1:29:12] do you understand i mean where is the
[1:29:14] meeting place in the tent am i right in
[1:29:16] his heart not in some kind of of of
[1:29:20] emotional part of the holy ghost which
[1:29:21] is fine but it must be deep in our heart
[1:29:24] where we meet our father can you say
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:27] blessed be the name of the lord and then
[1:29:29] this amen
[1:29:31] i mean
[1:29:34] there's too much people in this message
[1:29:36] if we're the brides
[1:29:38] they want to marry eliza
[1:29:40] you see
[1:29:41] amen they say oh eliza you're looking so
[1:29:44] good and you can preach so nice and what
[1:29:46] a wonderful thing
[1:29:48] but but
[1:29:49] somehow eliezer was not too nice
[1:29:52] because god wanted to make sure that
[1:29:55] that rebecca does not fall in love with
[1:29:57] eliezer
[1:29:58] so
[1:29:59] so so eliasa must have had some defects
[1:30:04] okay because he didn't want to be in
[1:30:06] competition with with isaac okay and and
[1:30:09] this messenger that we had had made sure
[1:30:13] that nobody falls in love with him
[1:30:16] that he leads us just to christ which is
[1:30:18] the word and when when she sees christ
[1:30:22] now this eliezer just turns away and
[1:30:24] just goes
[1:30:25] his ministry is over have you ever
[1:30:27] remarked when the seven seals were open
[1:30:29] brother bram never preached any more my
[1:30:30] life story
[1:30:32] never do never did because that was the
[1:30:34] story of william branham was over he led
[1:30:36] us to the person from the messenger to
[1:30:38] the message
[1:30:40] i'm from the messenger to christ who
[1:30:42] came down for ourselves
[1:30:44] can you say amen therefore when the
[1:30:46] tenth vision was he could only watch
[1:30:48] from sight and he says and people came
[1:30:50] out it was not anymore the men were
[1:30:52] laying hands
[1:30:54] nothing against this
[1:30:55] all kind of jewish tradition nothing
[1:30:57] against but we have something deeper
[1:30:59] than this today
[1:31:00] can you say amen read the last one i
[1:31:02] know i'm over time but man it's so
[1:31:04] wonderful to preach here can you say
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:06] i have to preach now for for a whole
[1:31:08] year because i will not be invited back
[1:31:11] i have no notes but mind is this an
[1:31:13] audience that really understands the
[1:31:15] things of god that is a pleasure from me
[1:31:16] and and make the last one
[1:31:20] do you understand what i said in the
[1:31:22] beginning this message must turn from a
[1:31:25] doctrine to a relationship
[1:31:29] and i say this in all respect
[1:31:32] and you have to have a spiritual insight
[1:31:34] this bible is the negative it's the
[1:31:36] shadow
[1:31:38] and this message is the positive of all
[1:31:40] things
[1:31:41] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[1:31:44] lord amen amen so
[1:31:47] here it is finishing amen the meeting
[1:31:50] place
[1:31:51] the coming of the king
[1:31:53] did you see the coming of the king in
[1:31:55] our time
[1:31:56] christ the word can you say amen or was
[1:31:58] it just god sent the prophet our message
[1:32:01] today is not anymore god said the
[1:32:02] prophet 100 years ago
[1:32:05] that's 100 years ago that's not our
[1:32:07] message god sent the prophet that's 400
[1:32:09] then you can say god said john
[1:32:10] wesley is true too
[1:32:12] amen but our message the king is here
[1:32:15] i mean i've seen i've seen something
[1:32:17] people will make a lot of demonstration
[1:32:18] this afternoon so therefore i said this
[1:32:21] afternoon is coaching for the young
[1:32:22] people coaching not preaching coaching
[1:32:24] i had some time a couple that came to
[1:32:26] our church and the young people that
[1:32:28] came in like this in the sunday school
[1:32:34] it's fine nothing against this and i
[1:32:35] wonder myself look
[1:32:37] am i if the presence of god is there
[1:32:38] it's another approach would be maybe
[1:32:40] more helpful in that situation so i i
[1:32:43] thought by myself now who are the
[1:32:44] parents i found out the paris reality
[1:32:46] fresh because here they come in the
[1:32:48] sanctuary
[1:32:52] the way we come is the way they come
[1:32:55] the way we treat
[1:32:56] the message in our homes shows our
[1:32:59] revelation that we have
[1:33:01] the way we dress shows a certain
[1:33:03] revelation you we we don't have to do to
[1:33:05] to preach about long dress and short
[1:33:06] rest i tell you if you know who you are
[1:33:09] amma you will know i'm a son of a king
[1:33:11] i'm a daughter of a king i'm a princess
[1:33:13] hey i'm not but okay
[1:33:15] so what happened is this
[1:33:17] so we see these three men
[1:33:20] everything is finished i put the bible
[1:33:21] away because if not there's always
[1:33:22] inspiration coming through
[1:33:25] and then i get a problem okay yeah
[1:33:26] something
[1:33:28] because i know every enough is said it's
[1:33:30] fine here come these three men they were
[1:33:31] led by a star like us
[1:33:34] so every time they were led just by the
[1:33:37] star okay they were just going i mean
[1:33:39] they didn't understand much they had
[1:33:41] only seen we have seen the star that was
[1:33:43] the only thing so when they had evening
[1:33:45] service they had only one sermon
[1:33:48] because they didn't understand the
[1:33:49] doctrine so one of the boys said let's
[1:33:51] have a son
[1:33:53] a service this evening wednesday evening
[1:33:55] and one of the somebody has something on
[1:33:56] his heart yes i have a sermon what is
[1:33:59] the title we have seen in star and bo
[1:34:01] said praise the lord
[1:34:03] i mean for two years there was the only
[1:34:04] sermon there but they were happy with it
[1:34:07] because it was a reality for them
[1:34:10] amen
[1:34:11] so when they came to jerusalem brother
[1:34:13] ram said they were mixing with the wrong
[1:34:15] kind of people
[1:34:17] and when they were mixing with the
[1:34:18] pharisees and so they couldn't see the
[1:34:20] star anymore therefore they had to ask
[1:34:22] the question where is the king of the
[1:34:24] jews brother braham said they were
[1:34:26] mixing was the wrong people have spirits
[1:34:29] people have anointings
[1:34:31] we have a slogan in germany which says
[1:34:33] if you go in a train
[1:34:35] and there is five smokers in the train
[1:34:37] and you are not smoker but if you come
[1:34:39] out of that train you're smelling like
[1:34:40] the smokers
[1:34:42] it's the show me your friends i show you
[1:34:44] your spiritual revelation even on
[1:34:46] whatsapp you know i always tell our
[1:34:48] young people don't give any comments
[1:34:51] about ministers and ministries and
[1:34:53] what's going on because it means it can
[1:34:55] happen that we're mispleasing god
[1:34:58] by giving our comments about things that
[1:35:00] we really do not understand
[1:35:02] leave it like this somebody has to say a
[1:35:04] new scandal comes up not a problem the
[1:35:07] bride goes forward
[1:35:09] but they were mixing with these kind of
[1:35:11] people and when they were mixing they
[1:35:12] couldn't see the star anymore and when
[1:35:14] they left jerusalem they saw the star
[1:35:16] again
[1:35:17] here we are
[1:35:18] so what happens now they come to
[1:35:21] bethlehem
[1:35:23] jesus is now two years old and look at
[1:35:25] this
[1:35:26] here they come with three gifts
[1:35:29] amen the first one comes
[1:35:33] and lays down gold he said because i
[1:35:35] know you are a king
[1:35:38] they did not go to toys r us
[1:35:43] they did not go to toys r us normally
[1:35:45] for a two-year old boy you go to toys r
[1:35:47] us
[1:35:48] okay
[1:35:49] but they didn't go to toys r us because
[1:35:51] they knew who was in the boy
[1:35:54] who told them god told him
[1:35:57] amen so the second one bring fragrances
[1:36:00] because your life will be in service the
[1:36:03] third one brings mirror because you will
[1:36:05] die
[1:36:08] the gifts of these three wise men
[1:36:12] were the expression of their revelation
[1:36:14] that they had
[1:36:16] and the way we treat the church and the
[1:36:19] way we treat the word and the way we
[1:36:21] treat god and the way we treat one
[1:36:23] another is an expression of our
[1:36:25] revelation that we have really
[1:36:28] do you get it
[1:36:29] sometimes you go home and there's
[1:36:31] message books just on the floor like
[1:36:33] this i i don't believe too much in those
[1:36:34] things
[1:36:35] i mean or
[1:36:37] are never read
[1:36:38] i was one time in a in a place where we
[1:36:41] wanted to support the brother and the
[1:36:42] brother i want to show he's a message
[1:36:43] believer
[1:36:44] okay to get message money
[1:36:47] if i would be a baptist he would be a
[1:36:48] baptist so he had books of everyone to
[1:36:50] to pull it out you know
[1:36:52] so he took the church edge book and said
[1:36:54] brother marcus i show you that i'm a
[1:36:56] message believer here's my church april
[1:36:57] and he opens it he opens it in the way
[1:36:59] how you open a book for the first time
[1:37:04] i said thank you this is your this is
[1:37:06] really your identification
[1:37:08] do you have a book on the shelf that is
[1:37:09] just tremendous
[1:37:11] i mean but but the time that we take for
[1:37:14] the word shows if we understood
[1:37:16] can you say amen so everybody we don't
[1:37:19] have to judge ours others we can judge
[1:37:21] just ourselves heavenly father maybe i i
[1:37:24] understand deep things in the doctrine
[1:37:26] but maybe i didn't understand the
[1:37:28] doctrine
[1:37:29] maybe i didn't understand you
[1:37:31] maybe i i really don't understand the
[1:37:33] plan for me and from my life
[1:37:35] can you say amen
[1:37:37] blessed be the name of the lord so just
[1:37:39] as an encouragement we have a wonderful
[1:37:41] father
[1:37:42] this message will produce what nothing
[1:37:44] else before produce rapturing face they
[1:37:47] didn't represent eruption faith in the
[1:37:49] first church age because you need seven
[1:37:51] thunders to be revealed
[1:37:52] we have more than they ever had
[1:37:55] but you cannot overstep what they had in
[1:37:57] the beginning just take it out and from
[1:37:59] that on go on every young people needs
[1:38:01] the holy spirit it needs a new birth
[1:38:03] but that's not the end of your journey
[1:38:05] this is what you have understand this is
[1:38:06] the beginning of your journey
[1:38:08] because now you have something to feed
[1:38:10] on i mean to build on can you say amen
[1:38:13] i mean if the musicians would come and
[1:38:15] we have a song together blessed be the
[1:38:17] name of the lord look
[1:38:20] amen
[1:38:21] to please god as a father
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] who ever heard about about um
[1:38:30] richard strauss
[1:38:33] richard strauss richard what's the
[1:38:35] world's king
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:38] there's a nice story
[1:38:40] and it shows
[1:38:42] you can touch the heart of god with the
[1:38:44] right kind of an of an attitude maybe
[1:38:46] you have a nice song like i have a
[1:38:48] father something like this or as the
[1:38:50] deer you know i like it always in the
[1:38:52] beginning
[1:38:54] now richard strauss had a son by the
[1:38:56] name of now richard strauss
[1:38:59] father and richard strauss
[1:39:02] i mean
[1:39:03] they say father because the son was
[1:39:08] more famous than the father
[1:39:10] richard straub's father and richardson
[1:39:12] richard's frost was much more famous
[1:39:13] much more gifted
[1:39:15] and there was some kind like a
[1:39:17] competition between both
[1:39:19] some kind like a
[1:39:21] uh friction that they separated from one
[1:39:23] another
[1:39:25] and so he made his career and his father
[1:39:27] made his career
[1:39:30] and what happened is one day they made
[1:39:32] both a concert
[1:39:34] on the same market it was not planned
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:38] so richard strauss was playing here
[1:39:43] and richard strauss father was playing
[1:39:44] here's a true story and i think hey if
[1:39:47] these people understand what our father
[1:39:48] is what about us let the holy spirit
[1:39:51] show what our father is and how god is
[1:39:53] such a wonderful caring father
[1:39:56] and the father was just playing here
[1:39:59] and after some time as they were not
[1:40:01] talking to one another
[1:40:03] you could see how more of the people
[1:40:05] went from the father to the son
[1:40:08] and at the end the father had hardly
[1:40:11] anybody listening to him everybody was
[1:40:13] because the son was much more gifted
[1:40:15] than the father
[1:40:16] yeah
[1:40:18] and
[1:40:20] at a certain time the
[1:40:23] when i'm telling you all it always
[1:40:24] struck me because you see life is
[1:40:26] reality
[1:40:28] life is not slow guns
[1:40:30] life is reality
[1:40:32] and there's so much real things in this
[1:40:34] message why should i search a slogan
[1:40:37] right
[1:40:38] and the boy was breaking the father's
[1:40:41] heart
[1:40:42] by doing this
[1:40:43] when all the people were there the
[1:40:45] father had to stop
[1:40:47] because nobody was listening to him and
[1:40:49] the boy said this
[1:40:50] i'm now proud to play a part
[1:40:54] a piece
[1:40:55] that my father wrote
[1:40:57] and when he started to play this and the
[1:41:00] father heard his own melody
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:03] he stopped and he cried and he went to
[1:41:05] listen to his own son
[1:41:07] i mean
[1:41:08] when the peace was over the father came
[1:41:10] to him hey boy
[1:41:11] i'm so proud about you amen
[1:41:14] brother i tell you you've got his place
[1:41:16] he gives you your place
[1:41:19] this message brought back respect
[1:41:22] true love agape love
[1:41:25] amen can you say amen
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:28] this message brought back
[1:41:30] a true relationship because we are more
[1:41:32] than just church members we are sons and
[1:41:34] daughters of god coming from his minds
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:40] and brother brown makes that little
[1:41:42] example really finishing by that
[1:41:44] he said here is that musician
[1:41:46] a man and he makes that concert and he
[1:41:49] plays it perfectly in the audience
[1:41:52] everybody is applauding every
[1:41:54] and the bot and the boy so knows one
[1:41:56] thing
[1:41:57] his teacher is way up in the balcony
[1:42:01] a man and he's not so much interested if
[1:42:03] everybody's happy but he said if his
[1:42:05] teacher would be satisfied
[1:42:08] then he would be satisfied and when the
[1:42:10] teacher starts
[1:42:12] to clap
[1:42:13] amen
[1:42:14] brother if you are a real christian you
[1:42:16] are not looking too much that everybody
[1:42:17] steps on your shoulder but but you are
[1:42:19] so in what does my father think about it
[1:42:22] do you understand that god leads us into
[1:42:24] situation
[1:42:25] just to see our reaction how matured we
[1:42:28] became already in all these years
[1:42:31] not how much we know
[1:42:32] but how much is this message now became
[1:42:35] our message we are the message of today
