[0:00] to go and call some
[0:02] call someone's uh to him that's that's
[0:05] what we do it for
[0:08] revelation two verse one
[0:10] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[0:13] right these things seth he that holdeth
[0:15] the seven stars in his right hand who
[0:18] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[0:21] candlesticks and we'll just ask the lord
[0:22] to bless his word this evening
[0:24] let's pray
[0:26] heavenly father we just thank you very
[0:27] much for your goodness and grace to us
[0:29] lord thank you that we can gather
[0:31] together in your name o lord
[0:33] father i just pray that you bless the
[0:35] service this evening lord i pray that
[0:36] you would
[0:38] lord minister your word in in clarity
[0:41] lord may it be the dissolver of doubt
[0:43] the answer of questions oh god that we
[0:46] might
[0:46] be able to stand on solid and firm
[0:49] ground and be able to recognize how firm
[0:51] the ground is on which we stand the lord
[0:54] in jesus christ and we pray amen
[0:57] you may be seated
[0:59] see if we can get started here
[1:03] super
[1:05] well um
[1:07] we started out with the opening verse
[1:10] revelation 2 1 we're speaking unto the
[1:13] angel of the church of
[1:14] ephesus and you would think
[1:16] as you read this that it would be
[1:19] so clear
[1:20] whoever the whoever this angel is that
[1:22] they whoever is listening to this angel
[1:24] speak look at this angel preach it'll
[1:27] just be
[1:28] very very apparent this is the voice
[1:30] that we need to be listening to right
[1:31] now this is god's man that who's
[1:33] speaking to us it should be perfectly
[1:36] clear
[1:37] and
[1:38] i'm sure paul wishes it had been that
[1:40] clear to the people he was preaching to
[1:43] because what we're going to take a look
[1:45] at this evening there was a struggle in
[1:47] paul's
[1:48] time just like there's a struggle in our
[1:51] time it seems like you would if you look
[1:53] at the scriptures unto the angel of the
[1:55] church of ephesus right you should have
[1:56] been very very clear to ephesus who
[1:59] their angel who was who their messenger
[2:02] was
[2:03] but whenever god's doing um
[2:06] a work leading his people forward he's
[2:09] using somebody to blaze a new trail
[2:12] and whenever you're blazing a trail
[2:15] so it's even dads if you're going on
[2:17] vacation and you're saying hey folks
[2:19] we're going to take the scenic route i
[2:20] know which way i'm going
[2:22] anybody get doubted sometimes by that
[2:25] yeah definitely so if we're a
[2:27] trailblazer in some way or another even
[2:29] more so spiritually speaking there's
[2:31] going to be a question
[2:33] are you really sure where we're going
[2:35] dad are you really sure where we're
[2:37] going
[2:38] angel or messenger that's
[2:41] that kind of goes with the territory of
[2:43] being a leader
[2:44] so
[2:45] the angel of the church of ephesus was
[2:47] the apostle paul
[2:49] and brother branham identifies paul
[2:52] as a new testament prophet
[2:54] and that is where
[2:56] brother branham and message of believers
[2:58] today we get a lot of blow back
[3:01] from folks saying that paul wasn't a
[3:04] prophet that's the that's the argument
[3:05] back but nowhere in the bible does paul
[3:08] claim that he was a prophet he was an
[3:10] apostle but not a prophet your brother
[3:11] branham states very clearly different
[3:13] places he was a prophet messenger to the
[3:16] first stage until god starts the work of
[3:18] how he's going to finish the work
[3:20] in the seventh age
[3:22] so the identification of paul is a new
[3:24] testament prophet
[3:26] that's
[3:26] highly disputed by christians and
[3:29] denominations and my folks have left the
[3:32] message and the purpose
[3:34] my purpose this evening is by god's
[3:36] grace to to kind of show
[3:38] the difficulties that paul encountered
[3:41] in getting people to recognize the
[3:43] position god gave to him
[3:45] it wasn't easy we kind of assumed that
[3:47] it was because everybody today anybody
[3:49] who claims to themselves to be a
[3:50] christian say yes paul was the apostle
[3:53] of the gentiles he wrote books of the
[3:55] bible god was speaking to him it's that
[3:58] that's an easy call for us now
[4:00] but when god's fulfilling his word
[4:02] before your eyes
[4:04] that's a different that's a harder call
[4:06] to make and it takes a step of faith it
[4:08] takes revelation
[4:10] so i want to show um
[4:12] that i believe that paul actually does
[4:14] make a case for himself
[4:16] uh being um
[4:18] having a having prophetic authority
[4:21] we'll take a look at some illusions that
[4:22] paul makes especially in the book of
[4:24] galatians
[4:25] this kind of want to tie together the
[4:27] struggles the challenges
[4:29] that
[4:30] christians had in paul's day and
[4:33] accepting this author this this this
[4:36] prophetic messenger authority
[4:39] they're similar to the challenges that
[4:40] we have today and that just kind of goes
[4:42] with the territory of living in the time
[4:44] when god's fulfilling his word right
[4:46] just it just goes with the terror this
[4:48] is the time that we live in this is the
[4:49] challenge we have to deal with and we'll
[4:51] do that
[4:52] but that doesn't just because there's a
[4:54] challenge out there doesn't mean that
[4:56] paul didn't have that authority or
[4:57] brother branham didn't have that
[4:58] authority
[5:01] paul was pretty clear though here in
[5:03] galatians 1 8
[5:05] he says but though we or an angel from
[5:07] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[5:11] than that which we have preached unto
[5:13] you let him be accursed
[5:16] it takes some guts to write that you've
[5:18] got to be really sure
[5:21] of your case he's saying
[5:23] if i come back and say something
[5:25] different what i've already said i
[5:26] should be cursed with i said to you the
[5:28] first time that was the gospel that was
[5:32] that was what god is doing if anybody
[5:34] comes with any other gospel than that
[5:37] they are wrong they're accursed
[5:41] he's got authority and he's not
[5:44] he's not afraid to to state it which
[5:47] means that the other
[5:48] authority holders of his day are going
[5:50] to look at this new kid on the block
[5:52] saying who are you who are you to claim
[5:55] this
[5:56] so when you make it when god is using
[5:58] you in such a way and you're making this
[6:00] authority claim
[6:01] which he was called to make
[6:03] it's going to be inviting
[6:06] challenges from other folks who already
[6:08] have authority they don't want that that
[6:10] threat
[6:11] here's one of the quotes that where
[6:13] brother branham identifies paul
[6:15] as a prophet he says the messenger angel
[6:17] to the church of ephesus was the apostle
[6:20] paul that he was the messenger to the
[6:23] first stage of the gentile era
[6:25] cannot be denied
[6:27] i will look at scriptures later he says
[6:29] i am the apostle to the gentiles
[6:32] though to peter was granted
[6:34] the authority to open the doors to the
[6:36] gentiles
[6:38] it was given to paul to be their apostle
[6:40] and prophet he was the prophet messenger
[6:44] to the gentiles his prophetic office by
[6:46] which he received the full revelation of
[6:48] the word for the gentiles
[6:50] authenticated him as their apostolic
[6:53] messenger
[6:54] brother brennan is making it pretty
[6:55] pretty clear here and later on in my
[6:58] notes i think the uh
[6:59] on the on on page six to message the
[7:02] unveiling of god
[7:03] brother branham talks about how you've
[7:05] got matthew mark luke and john the
[7:07] gospel writers he says they they wrote
[7:10] the things that they
[7:12] witnessed as they were with with jesus
[7:14] but it was paul who had the revelation
[7:17] of what was being done and he goes and
[7:19] declares even more it's on it's on page
[7:22] six says paul wrote the new testament
[7:24] matthew mark luke and john they only
[7:26] wrote what they saw but paul had the
[7:28] revelation he pulled it out for he had
[7:30] met
[7:31] the pillar of fire
[7:33] and the middle of that top quote
[7:35] paragraph 298 of the unveiling of god
[7:38] the disciples just wrote what they saw
[7:40] him do but paul had the revelation he
[7:43] went down to egypt for three years and
[7:44] studied and saw that god that the god of
[7:47] the old testament was jesus of the new
[7:50] the revelation and you could look and
[7:52] see that the gospels have a lot of great
[7:54] truth but paul does take it a step
[7:56] further this is this is that he's
[7:59] declaring making clear what what what
[8:02] was actually being done there in the
[8:03] gospels
[8:05] this kind of reviewing from uh from last
[8:07] week we talked about brother branham
[8:09] looking at the basic keys as he talks in
[8:11] the beginning of the ephesian church
[8:12] agent the keystone of the bible they saw
[8:15] was that there is an unchanging god
[8:18] with unchanging ways
[8:20] and would at the first stage you'll have
[8:22] to do it the last also there won't be a
[8:24] change and part of that we can take a
[8:26] look at
[8:27] paul the the first church age messenger
[8:29] he's the standard by which to judge
[8:32] every other messenger and help help
[8:34] actually help identify who they were
[8:36] brother brandon says his manner of
[8:38] ministering
[8:39] set the pattern that all future
[8:41] messengers were to aspire to and
[8:43] actually such the pattern for every true
[8:45] minister of god though he wouldn't
[8:46] attain to such heights in the prophetic
[8:48] realm as did paul
[8:50] and then
[8:51] brother branham highlights several
[8:53] characteristics he says he was
[8:54] absolutely true to the word he was led
[8:57] solely by the holy ghost he didn't check
[8:59] in he wasn't sent with the imprimatur
[9:03] the approval of the jerusalem council
[9:05] they weren't the ones telling him where
[9:06] to go he didn't communicate with them he
[9:08] was a brother but they were not his
[9:10] ultimate authority
[9:12] he was directly under the holy spirit
[9:14] and he ministered in the power and the
[9:17] demonstration of the spirit he wasn't he
[9:19] was trained in philosophy of his day but
[9:21] his books are not are not books of
[9:23] philosophy
[9:24] his books are books of of of of
[9:26] revelation showing everything is being
[9:29] rooted in the old testament showing how
[9:31] all that happened there is just
[9:33] god is continuing to reveal more and
[9:36] more and more by the assuring it's the
[9:38] power of the spirit jesus christ is the
[9:40] same yesterday today and forever it's
[9:42] not just words on the page when that
[9:44] eudecus falls in the book acts
[9:47] at a late night service that he falls
[9:50] out of the open window on under the
[9:52] floor it's a good thing we're all seated
[9:54] on the floor tonight we wouldn't have
[9:56] that but paul goes over there he raised
[9:58] him from the dead so
[10:00] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[10:01] and forever and he had the fruit
[10:03] of a god-given ministry
[10:06] and he says that brother braham says
[10:07] this is that we have an unchanging god
[10:09] with unchanging ways that's the first
[10:11] key to understanding how god works
[10:14] and he says the second is a key is a
[10:17] little bit less glorious so there are
[10:19] two vines running through the church
[10:22] and we kind of we went over that a
[10:23] little bit last time but um
[10:26] i was reading in the seals book this
[10:27] morning that in the second seal brother
[10:29] branham talks about how satan is a
[10:31] masterful impersonator whenever god
[10:34] starts to do something or something's
[10:36] getting ready to be fulfilled satan's
[10:38] has a sense of something getting ready
[10:39] to happen he runs out all kinds of
[10:41] different false impersonations of it
[10:44] ahead of time and at the same time and
[10:46] he uses the false vine to distract and
[10:49] confuse
[10:51] so that we can't see as easily what
[10:54] god's doing or there'll be a fear oh my
[10:57] we see the real thing happening if we've
[10:59] been burned so many times by the false
[11:02] that we're afraid to step out and
[11:03] actually believe the true
[11:05] and that's that's what satan has done
[11:08] and the second seal he says all these
[11:09] things he talked about how
[11:12] and the middle of page one
[11:15] on the last days as a prophet has
[11:17] predicted malachi chapter four
[11:19] but um he says i'm not here to cultivate
[11:22] a cult of elijah's man to religious
[11:25] robes we've had all plenty of those
[11:26] already and there were people before
[11:29] brother branham came who were doing
[11:30] those things so they had a sense of some
[11:32] of the great happened but that's the
[11:34] same way it was
[11:35] back when back in jesus's day
[11:38] gamaliel is having a counsel with with
[11:41] church leaders there in jerusalem and he
[11:43] says there was a sodus he he had this uh
[11:46] this this group following saying he was
[11:47] going to be the messiah and he had all
[11:49] 400 people go after him they all
[11:51] perished in the wilderness this was a
[11:53] similar thing but those false things did
[11:55] not
[11:56] make jesus ministry false
[11:59] there was they had nothing had no impact
[12:02] upon the verity or the or the accuracy
[12:04] or the truth of jesus christ ministry
[12:08] but brother bran says all those things
[12:10] the false
[12:11] are only for running the real thing that
[12:13] is to come
[12:14] to throw the people off
[12:17] he says now see satan raises those up
[12:20] watch the shrewdness of this fellow that
[12:22] we're talking about here satan where
[12:25] we're unfolding him right here just
[12:27] stripping him down by the scriptures and
[12:29] letting you see who he is
[12:32] that's one of the beautiful things of
[12:33] the message it's god going back and
[12:35] saying look how satan's working look how
[12:37] satan's working look how satan's working
[12:40] even now
[12:41] and brother graham says this truth that
[12:43] there are two vines throughout the
[12:45] church that's a that's a very special
[12:47] truth so that we can see what god's
[12:49] doing
[12:50] today um so then when the real true
[12:54] servant comes on with all the
[12:56] impersonation to it to upset the
[12:58] people's mind satan does that and those
[13:01] who can't discern right from wrong they
[13:02] just stumble over it but the elected
[13:05] won't do it
[13:06] but you know what if you've been burned
[13:09] by the false multiple times or if you've
[13:12] if you've if if you've put your hopes in
[13:15] this man or that man it can be really
[13:18] hard to put your confidence
[13:20] in another man some other time
[13:23] how god might be doing things because
[13:24] all those impersonations can lead to
[13:27] scars and
[13:29] and complexes for you
[13:32] okay let me turn this off
[13:55] all right i think we're back
[13:58] all the impersonations that we can see
[14:00] in in other ministries
[14:03] they can create scars they can create
[14:05] complexes that hinder us accepting what
[14:08] god might be doing for us later in in
[14:10] reality
[14:12] and
[14:14] they've been there done that you think
[14:15] you can get soured on things man there's
[14:18] so many things that have gone around
[14:20] i wish i could just be on an island
[14:22] somewhere and be by myself
[14:24] and
[14:26] i think brother brandon went through
[14:27] that too there's a quote i was a couple
[14:30] several probably six seven years ago
[14:32] i did some little study on on complexes
[14:36] and the quote about to read spoke to me
[14:39] immensely
[14:40] he's in he said he's in phoenix and he's
[14:43] preaching at brother outlaws church and
[14:44] if you're and brother outlaw his his
[14:46] church was the brother bran had been in
[14:48] i think in the early 50s or late 40s one
[14:50] of the first places out west where he'd
[14:52] been ministering
[14:53] and brother brahms just kind of
[14:54] reminiscing there how what a wonderful
[14:57] time we had those times top of page two
[14:59] here people would stand in the prayer
[15:01] lines be healed just praying laying
[15:03] hands on them and he says the ministry
[15:06] has come up higher certainly has the
[15:08] gifts have been multiplied but somehow
[15:10] or another
[15:11] i wish i was just back like i was at the
[15:13] first place you see
[15:16] why he wished he could just rewind
[15:18] because he had to go through so many
[15:20] things and everybody else who was
[15:23] following his ministry did too
[15:25] and all those trials
[15:27] built pain
[15:29] complexes calluses it wasn't easy
[15:33] but you say he says but more we just
[15:36] forget some of the things they ever
[15:37] learned i think it'd be a lot better off
[15:40] if we could forget some of the hard
[15:42] stuff we had to go through and the hard
[15:44] feelings have developed we'd be a lot
[15:46] better off but i think the road to god
[15:48] is the path of humility and service
[15:51] there's nothing better in the world to
[15:53] lift us up to christ than that
[15:56] and then he says you get to see carnal
[15:58] impersonations and so forth it just it
[16:00] dulls you
[16:01] and puts something in you and when i
[16:03] read this quote the first one it felt
[16:05] like it was a light shining right on me
[16:07] because yes it's exactly right it dulls
[16:09] you
[16:10] it
[16:11] it
[16:12] puts something in you i wish it didn't
[16:14] do it but it just makes you it kind of
[16:17] brings you up i think it gets you in the
[16:19] state of complex and i put in the word
[16:21] skepticism
[16:22] because you've seen this failed this
[16:24] failed this failed this failed something
[16:26] just kind of builds up and he says
[16:28] if god's going to do anything in my life
[16:30] i'm going to hold it at arm's distance
[16:32] for a good long time
[16:35] and that's what he was shining a light
[16:36] on there and he said i wish these
[16:38] brothers
[16:39] we should not be there
[16:41] but that is satan's goal
[16:43] so we can be disappointed so many times
[16:47] that whenever god's doing something
[16:49] we'll keep it at arm's length and never
[16:51] take a step of faith that yes that's for
[16:54] me
[16:55] so when brother branham says that the
[16:57] second basic key is is slightly less
[16:59] glorious it's still pretty glorious that
[17:01] there are two vines in the church and if
[17:04] we can he's he's stripping down and
[17:06] seeing where satan's working who satan
[17:08] is
[17:09] that's a glorious thing because we can
[17:11] recognize we can expect there's going to
[17:14] be some fanaticism there's going to be
[17:15] some crazy things that happen but that
[17:17] doesn't take away
[17:19] that god is doing something special and
[17:23] i should be looking for that when i see
[17:25] it
[17:25] i'm going to step out and take
[17:27] and and take faith take it with faith
[17:31] brother branson is in the revelation of
[17:32] jesus christ in the chapter one the
[17:34] church age book he says if people could
[17:36] get the true revelation
[17:38] of the true church and what she is what
[17:40] she stands for that she can do the
[17:42] greater work she will be an invincible
[17:44] army if they get a true revelation of
[17:46] the true spirit in the framework of the
[17:48] christian church
[17:50] and by god's spirit deserve to withstand
[17:52] the antichrist spirit
[17:54] satan will be powerless before her
[17:56] because the people say yes i am that i
[17:58] don't care if so many other people
[18:00] say they believe the same thing as i do
[18:02] they don't i'm still going to take my
[18:04] stand with boldness because it's the
[18:05] truth they're going to be people who
[18:07] might say they're the same
[18:09] they might say they believe the same but
[18:10] there are two vines and i'm not going to
[18:13] let the false detract
[18:14] my the boldness in my stand
[18:18] i've been reading a book lately on
[18:20] martin luther just finished it this last
[18:22] week and my goodness the extremism that
[18:26] went with his ministry his ministry
[18:29] resulted in a little bit of a civil war
[18:30] there in germany it was
[18:32] crazy
[18:33] but um brother branham says revival
[18:36] signifies a move of god and power and
[18:38] every time god moves satan is there to
[18:41] move also and he talked about luther in
[18:43] this same paragraph
[18:45] it's amazing that he was able to keep
[18:47] his head above the fanaticism
[18:49] but he says i hope you're spiritual
[18:51] minded enough to get that and capitalize
[18:54] on it
[18:55] don't let all the false things going
[18:58] around distract you from taking the true
[19:00] word of god and just devouring it
[19:04] that's how you capitalize on it the
[19:06] devil's purpose is to erode your trust
[19:08] erode your your confidence so that you
[19:10] won't take that step onto the true word
[19:13] of god as god's fulfilling his work by
[19:15] bringing it to pass he wants to keep it
[19:17] at arm's length keep it at arm's length
[19:19] and never really take it and make it
[19:22] your own that's his goal brother branham
[19:24] says hey be careful there are two
[19:26] spirits in the framework of the true
[19:27] church
[19:28] don't let the false keep from
[19:30] identifying the true
[19:31] and capitalizing on it
[19:34] amen
[19:37] so paul's authority like i said was
[19:39] frequently questioned during his
[19:41] ministry
[19:42] even though um everybody would accept
[19:45] every christian would accept the
[19:46] authority he claimed for himself today
[19:49] if he is kind of consider how his claims
[19:51] must have come across to his first
[19:53] century hearers
[19:54] and i just want to take a kind of get
[19:57] ourselves a little bit of acquainted
[19:58] with how god was moving in paul's life
[20:01] some historians will debate the actual
[20:04] dates
[20:05] that are on the chart here
[20:08] my purpose isn't so much to say was the
[20:10] was it this particular or that but the
[20:12] space between the years
[20:14] that's pretty certain based upon what
[20:16] paul uh talks about in his in his uh
[20:19] there in the book of acts what luke
[20:20] talks about in paul in his epistles
[20:23] so jesus christ is crucified resurrected
[20:26] i think 80 33 and then the holy ghost is
[20:29] poured out
[20:30] on the day of pentecost 80 33 then the
[20:32] church is just growing for several years
[20:35] there
[20:36] well in 1837
[20:38] approximately that that's when stephen
[20:39] would be stoned and those are that's the
[20:42] event that leads up to stahls conversion
[20:45] well um then saul will calling paul now
[20:49] he's going to be going to arabia and
[20:51] then in damascus
[20:53] and then he finally settles and settles
[20:55] in syria we'll look at this some of this
[20:56] in galatians chapter one
[20:59] in fact let's just go ahead and turn to
[21:00] galatians chapter 1.
[21:03] i don't have
[21:06] these scriptures on the screen if you
[21:07] have your bible be nice to look to them
[21:13] galatians chapter 1
[21:16] and then verse 17.
[21:22] it says
[21:24] after my experience there with
[21:26] the pillar of fire
[21:27] neither went i up to jerusalem to them
[21:29] which are apostles before me but i went
[21:31] into arabia and returned again into
[21:34] damascus
[21:36] and then after three years i went up to
[21:38] jerusalem to see peter and abode within
[21:40] 15 days
[21:41] so we have this idea that paul is the
[21:43] angel of the church and he's instantly
[21:45] out there
[21:46] ministering that's not the case he was
[21:49] he was he he was three years
[21:52] spending time
[21:53] with with with the lord
[21:55] getting them
[21:56] he was all he was already a student of
[21:58] the old testament he is having the
[21:59] revelation of the old testament just
[22:01] poor he it's all being revealed to him
[22:04] he's three years there
[22:07] other verse 19 other of the apostles saw
[22:09] i none saved james the lord's brother
[22:12] now the things which i write unto you
[22:13] behold before god i lie not afterwards i
[22:15] came into the regions of syria and
[22:17] cilicia
[22:18] and was unknown by faith to the churches
[22:21] of judea which were in christ so there
[22:22] was a period of time there i think
[22:24] that's probably close to 10 years that
[22:27] paul was unknown
[22:29] he'd been called of god yet he's
[22:31] somewhere in celestia perhaps tarsus we
[22:33] don't know exactly where but he's just
[22:36] mending nets
[22:38] he'd been called by god he had
[22:39] revelation but
[22:41] it wasn't his time yet
[22:43] and then barnabas from the church in
[22:45] antioch
[22:47] goes and barnabas is an interesting
[22:48] looking guy and an interesting brother
[22:50] in the book of acts he's always trying
[22:52] to
[22:52] further fellowship
[22:54] furthering fellowship he says hey we
[22:56] want to do mission work i know just the
[22:58] guy let's go get paul you guys don't
[22:59] know him yet but he's going to be a
[23:01] great one he's not making a name for
[23:03] himself i'm going to be the next
[23:04] missionary barnaby he's no he's not
[23:06] doing that he's saying
[23:07] paul's our guy
[23:08] paul might be the one he goes and brings
[23:10] paul to antioch and then they go on this
[23:12] mission trip together he was unknown by
[23:14] faith they think my
[23:15] how god works his angel of the church of
[23:17] ephesus he's an unknown for a long time
[23:21] and then
[23:22] so then he just goes on and then we can
[23:24] read through the book of acts and see
[23:26] how all these things take take time paul
[23:29] doesn't really come up in the book of
[23:30] acts until
[23:32] chapter
[23:34] 13 or 14 i believe a lot goes a lot goes
[23:37] on there
[23:38] maybe we can turn to the book of um
[23:41] turn to keep a finger in the book of
[23:43] galatians and then go over to the book
[23:45] of acts chapter 15. galatians in acts 15
[23:49] go together
[23:53] paul takes his first missionary trip up
[23:56] into galatia asia minor
[23:59] and he's out there for probably a couple
[24:01] years
[24:02] and then he gets back to antioch and he
[24:04] gets word from the churches he or the
[24:06] places where he had been that other men
[24:08] had been traveling behind him
[24:10] teaching another gospel
[24:14] which included
[24:16] you could be following jesus but you
[24:17] also need to keep all of moses law you
[24:20] can be a gentile you can come and put
[24:22] your faith in christ but you still have
[24:24] to be circumcised you have to fulfill
[24:27] all of the law and when paul hears this
[24:30] he feels like blow on the fuse because
[24:32] there's no that is not the gospel at all
[24:36] and think about it
[24:37] if you're a jew if you've been raised
[24:40] you've been reading moses's law
[24:42] you've got if you once you get to be
[24:44] your 13th birthday you have a bar
[24:46] mitzvah you memorize
[24:49] hundreds and hundreds of verses of it
[24:51] you you know it
[24:54] and then how revolutionary it is for
[24:56] somebody to come along and say you don't
[24:58] have to be circumcised
[25:00] that's a big deal because circumcision
[25:02] was the symbol of god's covenant with
[25:05] abraham all of a sudden you say that's
[25:07] no longer needed
[25:09] this is another gospel this is error i
[25:11] mean this is very a very understandable
[25:14] reaction
[25:16] to the jewish christians at that time
[25:18] but paul is paulie he's this is the
[25:21] message that's been given to him and
[25:23] he's not going to be browbeaten he's not
[25:25] going to be influenced away from it says
[25:28] no if any he says i marvel that you have
[25:31] been influenced so quickly to another
[25:32] gospel
[25:34] well um
[25:36] acts 15 1
[25:37] to certain men which came down from
[25:39] judea taught the brethren
[25:41] after i'd been through they teach except
[25:43] you be circumcised after the manner of
[25:46] moses you cannot be saved and paul says
[25:50] what that means that your works are more
[25:53] powerful than the blood of jesus christ
[25:57] that is completely false then jesus
[25:59] christ came for nothing he suffered from
[26:01] nothing that is false
[26:04] and so they have to have an independent
[26:06] their first church council their first
[26:08] brothers meeting and it wasn't filled
[26:10] with brotherly love
[26:12] it was a difficult meeting because if
[26:14] everybody who is
[26:16] with all sincerity they think
[26:18] the circumcision was given by moses
[26:21] we've all the prophets
[26:23] are are agreeing with this and here
[26:25] comes paul teaching something so
[26:28] different how could paul be right
[26:32] and think also about it what had paul
[26:34] done to many of their families
[26:38] he'd beat them up
[26:40] throwing them into prison i mean
[26:42] there could very well be some hard
[26:44] feelings
[26:45] i can remember
[26:47] brother marcus becker took me
[26:49] years back i was in germany he was
[26:51] taking me to nuremberg a couple
[26:52] different places he told me about the
[26:54] first european ministers meeting in the
[26:56] 70s maybe
[26:58] and you have that's not that long after
[27:01] world war ii
[27:03] and
[27:04] it was it was a little bit tense i mean
[27:06] i remember my dad's from the south and
[27:08] we'd have thanksgiving or christmas down
[27:10] there and the civil war would still be
[27:11] fought sometimes 120 years later but
[27:15] it's not easy and
[27:17] with the wounds that paul had caused
[27:19] were very very fresh
[27:22] but um
[27:23] he's surprised at this at this
[27:25] minister's meeting in acts 15
[27:28] he doesn't say about him there but he
[27:30] sure lets his pen
[27:32] go to work in the book of galatians
[27:35] so um
[27:36] and this jerusalem council paul and
[27:38] barnabas go there and they share what
[27:40] god has done among the gentiles
[27:43] and
[27:44] luke doesn't share a lot about of what
[27:46] paul had said there but paul does in
[27:48] galatians chapter
[27:51] 1 so we'll just
[27:52] we'll just move
[27:54] move back there
[27:56] let's go to galatians chapter 2 actually
[27:59] then 14 years after i went up again to
[28:01] jerusalem
[28:03] with barn
[28:04] i went up again to jerusalem with
[28:06] barnabas and took titus with me also
[28:08] this is 14 years since so there's a long
[28:10] silent period there
[28:12] i went by revelation i gave my testimony
[28:15] of what god was doing among the gentiles
[28:17] in verse
[28:18] two lest by any means i should run or
[28:20] had run in vain
[28:22] but he takes titus with him who is the
[28:24] greek and he was compelled to be
[28:26] circumcised because a false brethren was
[28:28] going to come in aware
[28:31] now and then
[28:32] verse 11 and then peter's there and he
[28:34] says i withstood peter to the face
[28:37] because he was to be blamed
[28:38] there's a there's a lot of tension there
[28:41] just to illustrate
[28:44] we talk about the angel of the church of
[28:45] ephesus the apostle of the gentiles
[28:48] it wasn't quite that clear to paul's
[28:51] hearers at the time
[28:53] if you look at the corinthian church
[28:56] paul found perhaps his most critical
[28:58] audience among the church at corinth i
[29:02] remember one time i
[29:03] counted up the number of chapters in
[29:05] each book of the new testament and the
[29:07] corinthians received most chapters if
[29:09] anybody in new testament were written to
[29:11] them and that wasn't because they were
[29:13] such a strong great church because they
[29:16] needed all those chapters written to
[29:18] them but he spent the whole three
[29:20] chapters of second corinthians defending
[29:22] his authority and testimony as a
[29:24] messenger of god
[29:27] um he lays out and i think
[29:29] first corinthians 14 i have here
[29:32] at the bottom of page two
[29:34] um
[29:35] if you think about what paul was saying
[29:37] and that we we read over it here in the
[29:39] 21st century very quickly if you think
[29:41] about what he's saying
[29:43] he's making some big statements he says
[29:46] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[29:48] or a spiritual let him acknowledge that
[29:51] the things i write unto you are the
[29:53] commandments of the lord
[29:56] if you think
[29:57] you're spiritual
[29:59] and don't believe what i'm saying
[30:02] you're ignorant
[30:05] that's some that's a big statement it
[30:07] almost comes across as arrogant
[30:10] but you know if you have the authority
[30:13] by god
[30:14] and you're hesitant to use it
[30:17] you're doing a disservice to everyone as
[30:19] well
[30:20] so paul is saying if you think you're a
[30:22] prophet if you think you're spiritual
[30:24] acknowledged what i'm saying has been
[30:26] given by god but if anyone wants to be
[30:28] ignorant i'm not going to fight with you
[30:30] just let you be ignorant
[30:32] that's a strong strong statement he's
[30:34] making
[30:36] he talks uh on the book of the in the
[30:39] his sufferings for the gospel nobody
[30:42] suffered for the gospel as paul suffered
[30:44] he probably he might have wished
[30:45] sometimes i wish i could have been
[30:47] martyred earlier because i would have
[30:48] had a much easier road home
[30:51] but you know what i think
[30:52] glory and suffering
[30:54] they often go together throughout the
[30:56] bible
[30:57] and if god gives you much you will
[30:59] probably have to suffer a lot for it i
[31:01] think about
[31:02] i think about brother uh brother ron
[31:04] spencer we we pray for him and talk
[31:05] about a man with testimonies i remember
[31:07] all the youth meetings growing up he
[31:09] always had the testimony if you count
[31:11] the things that happened to that man
[31:13] it's rough
[31:15] but you think my what wonderful
[31:17] testimonies i wish i had those
[31:18] testimonies
[31:19] do you
[31:21] do you want to go through the things
[31:23] that he went through
[31:24] so if you want to have a testimony you
[31:26] gotta have a vic take it takes a victory
[31:28] uh to to have that
[31:30] and he also had exceptional supernatural
[31:33] experiences
[31:35] visions revelations talks about a man
[31:37] that i knew which was speaking of
[31:39] himself
[31:40] humbly who was caught up into the
[31:42] seventh heaven i think i don't remember
[31:44] exactly but it's he's talking about
[31:46] these exceptional supernatural
[31:48] experiences he had his defense he says
[31:50] this corinthian church they want to have
[31:53] proof of my ministry
[31:55] excuse me from my father he says i'll
[31:57] become like a fool and glory but i think
[31:59] it's necessary that you know
[32:01] what god is doing through me so that you
[32:03] can accept
[32:04] god's grace to you
[32:08] now the question then is so we see
[32:10] paul's hearers had a hard time
[32:14] accepting his authority because we
[32:16] there's so much paul may take such pains
[32:18] to support that he has great authority
[32:21] which means he's answering questions
[32:23] but how did paul see his his own
[32:26] authority and to uh
[32:29] well i talked about galatians chapter
[32:30] one eight um and we can go back to
[32:33] galatians one versus we're still there
[32:35] galatians one one these brother branham
[32:37] says paul was led by no one but the
[32:39] spirit of god paul
[32:41] galatians 1 1 says paul an apostle not
[32:44] of men neither by man but by jesus
[32:48] christ and god the father raised him
[32:49] from the dead he was god's man he was
[32:52] not peter's man he wasn't james man he
[32:54] wasn't the jerusalem council's man he
[32:56] was god's man
[32:58] completely
[33:00] verses 11 and 12 galatians 1 i certify
[33:03] you brethren that the gospel which was
[33:05] preached of me is not after man i
[33:09] neither received it of man neither was i
[33:11] taught it
[33:13] because he was taught by gamaliel for
[33:15] years this is what i have now was not
[33:18] from grammaria i wasn't taught by
[33:19] anybody this i received it by revelation
[33:23] of god
[33:24] and that's why brother ben says the
[33:26] church is built upon revelation
[33:29] because revelation with revelation
[33:31] the sum is greater than the whole of the
[33:33] parts
[33:34] revelation gives you the complete
[33:37] picture
[33:41] and then the gospel he preached to the
[33:43] galatians is
[33:44] definitive and we reread that galatians
[33:47] 1 8
[33:48] already
[33:50] i think it's interesting though um
[33:52] sometimes brother brandon will make
[33:53] statements i like i have this one from
[33:56] is this a sign of the end yes sir um
[33:59] and people yeah he's a little it seems
[34:01] like he's got some false humility here
[34:02] he says
[34:03] um friends don't look to me i'm your
[34:06] brother don't pay any attention to me
[34:08] because i'm just immortal i have to die
[34:11] like everybody else don't you listen to
[34:13] me
[34:14] but listen to what i've said
[34:16] what i've said is the message don't pay
[34:18] attention to the messenger
[34:20] watch the message
[34:22] and somebody could ask
[34:24] what's the difference when you're saying
[34:25] don't listen to me
[34:27] but listen to what i've said
[34:30] what's the difference well i think the
[34:32] difference is very similar to what paul
[34:33] says in galatians 1 8
[34:35] but the weird angel from heaven preached
[34:37] any other gospel but we've already
[34:39] preached unto you let them be accursed
[34:41] don't just listen to me listen to what i
[34:44] said because if i ever say anything
[34:46] different from what i said the sample or
[34:49] there's that gospel then i'm wrong
[34:52] so it's paul saying something very
[34:54] similar don't listen to me listen to
[34:55] what i've said it's the mess and it's
[34:57] the message that's the key brother
[34:58] branham saying something very very
[35:00] similar but if we look at the rest of
[35:03] galatians chapter 1
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] he's people are going to see that paul
[35:08] is going to be
[35:10] echoing certain old testament prophets
[35:13] as he writes
[35:15] and
[35:16] he's going to be making illusions and i
[35:18] would say that anybody in paul's day who
[35:21] was raised in the
[35:22] um
[35:23] raised in the jewish faith raised in the
[35:25] synagogue went through the bar mitzvah
[35:26] the batman so that they would have
[35:28] probably made the connections to these
[35:30] illusions
[35:32] but if you weren't
[35:34] we might not make them as quickly
[35:36] because illusions are a reference to
[35:38] something outside the text that's going
[35:41] to give greater meaning to it so for
[35:43] example you can have
[35:45] you can have this this little play going
[35:48] on and then you some somebody might say
[35:50] man i've got so many goliaths in my life
[35:54] if you don't know the story about dave
[35:55] and goliath that line will not make as
[35:57] much sense to you you might have the
[35:59] idea that he's got obstacles he's got
[36:01] difficulties but when you know the story
[36:03] of dave's and goliath it takes on such a
[36:06] much greater meaning
[36:07] it's a reference to some to a story
[36:09] outside the story paul's doing that and
[36:13] i can the significance of illusions
[36:15] there's an example i have
[36:17] when i was in
[36:19] college i was i lived in i lived on
[36:21] campus and i can remember
[36:23] president bush it was in 2003 and he was
[36:25] giving the state of the union address
[36:27] and i'm in there in the in the in the
[36:29] dorm lounge watching the state of the
[36:31] union address with my fellow classmates
[36:34] and
[36:35] i hear brother i hear brother bush i
[36:37] hear president bush make the following
[36:39] statement
[36:40] he says
[36:41] he's saying um
[36:43] so many in our country the homeless the
[36:45] fatherless the addicted the need is
[36:47] great yet there is power
[36:50] wonder working power in the goodness and
[36:53] idealism and faith of the american
[36:56] people and i heard this
[36:58] he's preaching he's up there wonder
[37:00] working power in the blood i know that
[37:02] song it's a it's it's an illusion that
[37:05] that rung
[37:07] strongly with me
[37:09] nobody else in the room caught it
[37:12] nobody else did
[37:14] they said they just listened
[37:16] wonder working power don't we know where
[37:20] they missed it why is he saying that
[37:23] because he knows a lot of people who
[37:24] voted for him would know that him and i
[37:26] think man he's trying to get christian
[37:28] charities christian organizations to
[37:30] help with the needs of the time and this
[37:32] is this line is purposefully meant for
[37:35] their ears so they'd have special
[37:37] meaning to them
[37:38] and it's interesting though
[37:40] this is a another observer's uh
[37:43] statement about that he says
[37:46] there's power wonder working power the
[37:47] sentiments are classically revivalist
[37:50] the hymn was used in revivals
[37:52] but he says all bush did was replace
[37:54] jesus as the source of the wonder
[37:56] working power
[37:57] with idealism and faith of the american
[38:00] people
[38:01] and it's interesting that that happens
[38:03] very subtly where the we have this idea
[38:06] of civil religion
[38:08] high lofty sentiments without jesus
[38:11] but with our idealism and our own power
[38:14] but the illusion was there to
[38:16] communicate to his supporters i know
[38:18] you're christians i know you're voting
[38:19] for me i'm going to get you involved in
[38:21] the solutions to the needs
[38:23] so there can be this is like a coded
[38:26] message
[38:27] that i picked up on the different
[38:29] christians evangel from evangelical
[38:31] traditions they would pick up on but it
[38:33] would be lost on many other people
[38:35] and i i'm going to go through a couple
[38:37] of these
[38:38] from galatians chapter one that would be
[38:41] that we might miss
[38:43] but paul's hearers would certainly have
[38:45] gotten
[38:46] let's take a look at what paul writes
[38:48] here in galatians 1
[38:50] when it pleased god who separated me
[38:53] from my mother's womb
[38:55] and called me by his grace to reveal his
[38:57] son in me
[38:58] this phrase who separated me from my
[39:01] mother's womb
[39:02] are there any is that that is an
[39:04] allusion to a couple other old testament
[39:07] prophets who said something very similar
[39:11] our first one would be in jeremiah
[39:14] jeremiah says before i for his god is
[39:17] speaking before i formed thee in the
[39:19] belly i knew thee before you came forth
[39:22] out of the womb i sanctified thee and
[39:24] ordained thee a prophet to the nations
[39:27] think about for paul's jewish listeners
[39:30] or for the ex-pharisee believers
[39:33] they know what paul is saying when he's
[39:36] saying
[39:37] when it pleased god who separated me
[39:40] from my mother's what are you saying
[39:42] you're like jeremiah
[39:45] that's what he's saying and they would
[39:47] have caught that
[39:50] and he's not just jeremiah
[39:52] isaiah says it's also in isaiah 49
[39:55] listen no isles unto me and hearken you
[39:56] people from afar the lord hath called me
[39:59] from the womb
[40:01] that's what paul is saying about himself
[40:04] just like god separated jeremiah from
[40:07] from the womb and dedicated to himself
[40:09] like isaiah he's putting himself in
[40:13] their class
[40:16] that's huge
[40:19] we might not catch that right away but
[40:21] his listeners would have and they
[40:23] probably didn't appreciate it but he's
[40:26] stating it still the same
[40:28] and then we go on down later in
[40:30] galatians chapter 1
[40:34] yes verse 23
[40:37] paul is
[40:39] he says he was unknown by faith to the
[40:41] churches of judea
[40:43] but they heard the word only they didn't
[40:44] see him but they heard the word only
[40:46] that he which persecuted us in the times
[40:49] past now preacheth the faith with which
[40:51] once he destroyed and it says
[40:54] and they glorified
[40:55] god
[40:56] in me
[40:58] and then 14 years after i went up again
[41:01] to jerusalem communicated in the gospel
[41:03] which i preach among to the gentiles
[41:04] lest by any means i should run or had
[41:07] run in vain
[41:10] where do those underlying portions come
[41:12] from
[41:13] again
[41:15] he's not just writing this on his own
[41:18] he's making an illusion something that's
[41:20] said very similarly in the book of
[41:21] isaiah
[41:23] isaiah says in chapter 49
[41:26] again
[41:27] and that and said unto me thou art my
[41:29] servant of israel and whom i will be
[41:31] glorified
[41:33] it's a very similar phrasing and paul is
[41:36] appropriating that to himself and then i
[41:39] said i have labored in vain i've spent
[41:41] my strength for naught and in vain yes
[41:44] surely my judgment with the lord is with
[41:45] the lord and my work with god and paul
[41:48] is identifying himself and his concerns
[41:51] with the concerns of the prophet isaiah
[41:54] that he that god might be glorified in
[41:56] him as well lest he run
[41:59] in vain
[42:01] and then um
[42:03] we see this next one uh this language
[42:05] about how god hath commanded me to be a
[42:07] i have set thee to be a light of the
[42:09] gentiles
[42:11] this is also an illusion this is i think
[42:14] it's actually spoken to um to saul there
[42:18] on the road to damascus
[42:19] but this is the very same language that
[42:22] isaiah is using now set the lord that
[42:24] formed me from the womb to be his
[42:26] servant i will also give thee for a
[42:28] light to the gentiles
[42:31] saul is drawing the paul is drawing
[42:33] these connections saying there's great
[42:34] affinity between my ministry
[42:37] and the ministry of isaiah the ministry
[42:39] of jeremiah that puts me in a class with
[42:42] the old testament prophets
[42:45] and um i didn't i didn't pick up these
[42:47] illusions myself because i'd read
[42:49] through the book of galatians many times
[42:51] and didn't catch it but a couple years
[42:53] ago i was teaching a my high school
[42:54] bible class where we were going to go
[42:56] through the book of acts so i picked up
[42:58] a book by
[42:59] n.t wright he's an anglican theologian
[43:02] this is a biography of paul i picked it
[43:04] up and i'm going through here and he's
[43:06] and he was the one
[43:08] who drew all these connections
[43:10] and nt wright was making the case that
[43:14] paul should be considered the prophet
[43:16] and when i read that from a
[43:18] denominational theologian my jaw dropped
[43:21] says brother branham said that we've
[43:22] been saying it for years and we got
[43:25] knocked out of the park there's no way
[43:26] that's not true but here you've got a
[43:28] denominational theologian saying the
[43:30] same thing and showing some really
[43:31] interesting
[43:33] proof for it i was impressed
[43:35] he also shows from galatians 1 17
[43:40] where paul went he leaves damascus he
[43:43] goes down into arabia and then he comes
[43:45] back and he says that paul does this
[43:48] it's interesting why does he go to
[43:49] arabia later in the book of galatians he
[43:52] talks about mount sinai
[43:55] you have you have agar um mount sinai in
[43:58] arabia and that's just like the
[44:00] jerusalem of the day that's what the law
[44:01] was given and jerusalem today is full of
[44:04] law but the jerusalem of above that is
[44:07] grace he says what is he he's connecting
[44:09] the jerusalem church of that moment with
[44:12] hagar
[44:14] that wouldn't be appreciated by his his
[44:16] jewish listeners either
[44:18] but his connection to mount sinai is
[44:19] important this is these are nt rights
[44:21] words here it says mount sinai why does
[44:24] paul go there
[44:25] that's where god had come down in fire
[44:27] and had given moses the torah it was the
[44:29] place of revelation the place of law the
[44:31] place where the covenant between god and
[44:33] israel was made sinai the great mountain
[44:36] in arabia was in that sense the place of
[44:39] beginnings
[44:40] sinai was where elijah had gone when it
[44:43] all went horribly wrong
[44:45] inside it was where saul of tarsus went
[44:48] for the same reason because saul has
[44:50] felt
[44:51] where have we gone as a jewish faith
[44:55] we've all missed it
[44:57] the full the old testament has been
[44:59] fulfilled in jesus christ and we all
[45:02] missed it it's gone wrong
[45:04] and then the pillar of fire comes down
[45:06] to reveals it's the saul and he goes to
[45:08] the same place
[45:10] to kind of get
[45:11] reoriented he go god spoke to moses
[45:14] there god spoke to elijah there god
[45:17] speaks to paul there
[45:19] he goes back back then this is it all
[45:21] went horribly wrong it's the place of
[45:23] beginning it's the place of the where
[45:24] the old covenant was given this is the
[45:26] place where saul is also seeing what the
[45:28] new covenant completely means for the
[45:31] gentiles
[45:33] and
[45:34] so he says after that saul went back to
[45:36] damascus apparently confirmed in his
[45:38] understanding of himself as a prophet
[45:41] fulfilling the ancient rule of
[45:43] announcing god's truth and god's
[45:45] anointed king to israel and the nations
[45:49] that time that saul assault spent there
[45:52] in arabia going to the old testament
[45:54] having all the pieces put together for
[45:56] him
[45:57] he leaves
[45:58] a completely changed man
[46:01] he has truth that he hadn't they didn't
[46:04] have before
[46:06] paul in other words is not making it
[46:08] clear in galatians
[46:10] is not only making it clear in galatians
[46:12] one and two that his gospel was given to
[46:14] him directly not acquired second hand to
[46:17] the jerusalem leaders he is also making
[46:20] it clear
[46:21] that his call and commissioning have
[46:23] placed him in the ancient prophetic
[46:26] tradition whether of isaiah jeremiah or
[46:30] elijah himself his opponents
[46:32] are trying to go over his head and
[46:34] appeal to the jerusalem council
[46:36] but he is going over everybody else's
[46:38] head by appealing directly to jesus
[46:40] himself and to the scriptures as
[46:43] foreshadowing not only the gospel of
[46:46] christ but also the prophetic ministry
[46:48] that he paul had now received
[46:51] paul sees these things and it's because
[46:54] he sees
[46:55] i've been separated from my womb from
[46:57] from my mother's womb for this purpose
[46:59] just like isaiah was just like jeremiah
[47:01] was i've been a light to the gentile
[47:04] that's what i'm called to be
[47:06] jesus mentions that to me when i'm when
[47:08] i see them they're they're on the road
[47:10] to damascus and this is what isaiah
[47:12] prophesied about so other people
[47:15] i've been called to fulfill that
[47:18] for paul to stand so strong against so
[47:20] much opposition he would have to have a
[47:22] clear revelation of it and i think he
[47:25] really did know who he was and that he
[47:28] had a very unique ministry that we would
[47:31] see then as the angel of the church of
[47:33] ephesus but brother branham because he
[47:35] was the prophet
[47:36] messenger it's a pretty amazing call
[47:40] yes
[47:47] now wouldn't we think about
[47:50] if you think but put yourself in the
[47:51] position of
[47:53] paul's jewish listeners who've been
[47:55] raised and
[47:57] who were
[47:58] message believers of that
[48:00] day or who were raised in the church and
[48:01] everything and uh
[48:03] he then all of a sudden saul comes back
[48:05] and saying hey
[48:06] a circumvision doesn't profit you a
[48:08] thing
[48:10] it's not that
[48:11] it does it doesn't have any benefit into
[48:14] your relationship with christ
[48:16] what
[48:17] that is how that was the covenant with
[48:19] abraham now as as his listeners are
[48:22] hearing this
[48:23] i think they would have a question like
[48:26] wait wasn't paul adding to the word
[48:31] because that's a question that we can
[48:32] have when god sends a prophetic mystery
[48:35] like brother brandon says hold up
[48:38] he says now we're going to turn to the
[48:39] book of elijah hold up stop book of
[48:41] elijah we've got 66 books of the bible
[48:43] we can't add the book of the book of the
[48:45] bible because
[48:46] we're not supposed to add to the word
[48:48] and that's and that's true
[48:50] so we can have the question paul could
[48:52] have the question i believe he did it
[48:53] might not have been phrased this way
[48:55] but the question is saul aren't you
[48:57] adding to the word here
[48:59] and moses
[49:00] wrote in deuteronomy you shall not add
[49:03] to the word which i command you neither
[49:05] shall you diminish ought from it and i'd
[49:08] say people would say saul you're saying
[49:10] people shouldn't be circumcised
[49:13] that's definitely diminishing what moses
[49:15] taught us because he taught us that very
[49:17] very clearly and you're changing it and
[49:19] if you change or add to the word you're
[49:22] no longer keeping the commandments of
[49:23] the lord and
[49:24] john would later write in the book of
[49:26] revelation if any man add unto these
[49:28] things god will add to him the plagues
[49:30] if any man take away from the words of
[49:32] the book god will take his part out of
[49:34] the book of life the holy city this was
[49:37] a
[49:37] highly charged question a highly charged
[49:40] issue that saul would have that paul
[49:42] would have had to deal with and we have
[49:44] to deal with it too
[49:46] i just want to talk about that for a for
[49:48] a few minutes here
[49:50] um
[49:51] paul takes great pains
[49:54] and his epistles to show
[49:56] that his message sprouts out of the
[49:59] groundwork of the old testament
[50:02] that's what he does in the book of
[50:03] hebrews he's going through all the old
[50:05] testament types and shadows showing how
[50:07] look jesus christ ministry is a
[50:09] fulfillment of all these things it's not
[50:12] something it's not a new thing it's the
[50:14] fulfillment of the old things it's not
[50:17] um
[50:18] it's um it's completely consistent with
[50:21] what had already been
[50:22] revealed
[50:24] and
[50:25] when um when we looked at chapter one of
[50:28] the church age book there's a there's a
[50:30] quote there brother branham says about
[50:32] talks about how the greek word for
[50:33] revelation is apocalypse which means
[50:35] unveiling he compares it to unveiling a
[50:38] work of statue so here we have a
[50:41] sculpture we know the young men
[50:43] unveiling the sculpture who they are we
[50:45] recognize them
[50:47] it's princess diana's
[50:49] two sons william and harry
[50:51] and they're unveiling a sculpture here
[50:54] in 2021 in the particular uh garden and
[50:59] revelation is brands of revelation is
[51:01] compared to god take it to to the to the
[51:04] um to the covering being taken off the
[51:07] statue so you can see what what what it
[51:09] is
[51:10] and we can see right here
[51:12] very you probably can't see it at the
[51:13] bottom it says diana princess
[51:16] that's that's all that we can see so we
[51:18] can see we have a very vague idea of who
[51:20] the statue might be revealing kind of
[51:22] like in genesis 3 15 we're told that
[51:24] there's going to be some
[51:26] somebody coming a seat of the woman who
[51:29] will crush the serpent's head we don't
[51:31] have many more details than that
[51:33] but we know what the stats what what
[51:36] god's work is going to be about
[51:38] do we know who is underneath that
[51:42] that uh
[51:43] that blanket
[51:45] if you
[51:46] anybody know
[51:47] i didn't know who would we expect to be
[51:49] underneath the blanket
[51:52] princess diana and who else
[51:55] sorry
[51:56] perhaps the queen
[51:58] other ideas
[52:00] i would have thought
[52:02] william and harry
[52:04] but as you go through and the
[52:07] we do this because we have an idea where
[52:09] god might be going with something
[52:12] but when god unveils
[52:14] his actual work
[52:15] we can be disappointed not disappointed
[52:17] we can our our prediction wouldn't have
[52:20] come to pass because as the guys as the
[52:21] boys pull off the statue yes it is diana
[52:25] but when they take the rest of it off
[52:28] it's not william and harry it's
[52:30] a young boy a young girl and there's
[52:33] another set of two legs behind the young
[52:35] girl not the
[52:37] not that she's a four-legged girl but
[52:39] there's another child behind um the girl
[52:43] and if you look closely the young boy
[52:45] appears to be african-american
[52:49] so this is i when i expected this
[52:52] revelation of the statue to be diane and
[52:54] her sons
[52:55] that's now i would say that is like an
[52:57] old testament expectation of what god's
[53:00] doing
[53:00] i i've got it figured out i can see
[53:03] diana princess of wales there are two
[53:05] sons right next to it unveiling that's
[53:07] my expectation
[53:09] and i will in the old testament but i
[53:11] will die upon this mountain that is what
[53:14] it's all about it can't be anything else
[53:16] but once
[53:17] the cover is completely taken off
[53:20] what
[53:20] there's a girl that we didn't know about
[53:22] or there's an african
[53:24] what's going on here well it's it's
[53:26] symbolism of her love for children her
[53:28] love for the world etc etc but can you
[53:30] see when there's an unveiling we have to
[53:32] be ready
[53:33] for the sculptor to speak to us as he
[53:35] wants to speak to us
[53:37] we can't put the sculptor in the box
[53:39] even though i had a pretty good idea
[53:41] what i thought and could defend that the
[53:44] sculpture is going to be
[53:45] we can't do that we have to let the
[53:47] sculptor be the sculptor and god be god
[53:51] and in the ephesian
[53:52] church age brother brandon makes a
[53:55] statement god can't give a first
[53:56] revelation and then a second revelation
[53:59] you can't add he can't add to his own
[54:00] word either
[54:02] if he did he'd be changing his mind
[54:04] now he can give a revelation and then
[54:07] add to it oh stop didn't it say you
[54:09] can't add to the word
[54:10] he does say that let's just keep that
[54:12] thought and we'll he answers the
[54:14] question he can give a revelation and
[54:16] then add to it as he did in the garden
[54:18] of eden when he promised to seed the
[54:20] woman
[54:21] and then later designated that seed to
[54:24] come through
[54:25] abraham and even before that and then
[54:27] after through abraham and then later
[54:29] through the jewish people through moses
[54:32] and then later it would come by the same
[54:33] bloodlines in david and throughout the
[54:35] old testament
[54:37] there is additional clarity being given
[54:41] but none of those things are different
[54:42] revelations it's just more detail being
[54:45] given to the same revelation it was the
[54:47] same revelation it only gave the people
[54:48] more information to help them receive
[54:51] and understand it so when god shows more
[54:54] it's not a second sculpture
[54:56] it's not a second revelation it's just
[54:58] god revealing more of it
[55:02] amen
[55:10] hopefully we can see a little bit then
[55:11] that um
[55:13] that paul had challenges in his day
[55:16] of asserting his apostolic and prophetic
[55:19] authority those challenges are nothing
[55:22] are nothing new
[55:23] and we know brother branham and then we
[55:26] will encounter challenges and we assert
[55:28] brother branham's prophetic authority
[55:30] but that just kind of goes to the
[55:31] territory of following someone god is
[55:33] using to blaze
[55:35] a trail
[55:37] you would have thought at the ephesian
[55:39] church age after having had such a clear
[55:42] message a great messenger that this had
[55:46] been a revival fire that just went on
[55:48] for time and for
[55:50] time
[55:51] in eternity
[55:53] and i remember when brother burley spoke
[55:55] at the couple's dinner
[55:58] last week was that last week wow um he
[56:01] says that there didn't talk about the
[56:03] intimacy between god and the and and the
[56:06] bride there in the ephesian church and
[56:08] just how how how how close it was how
[56:10] had such a special connection and he
[56:13] said there didn't have to be a smyrnan
[56:15] age or a perk of me and age or a ladder
[56:17] change that didn't didn't have to be
[56:19] that way he says
[56:21] if the if you just maintained your your
[56:24] connection with god in the ephesian age
[56:26] that it didn't have you didn't have to
[56:28] fall away and he applied that then to us
[56:31] as couples we we can go through uh
[56:34] difficult times and if we don't don't
[56:36] handle those difficult times well then
[56:38] you can go
[56:39] from
[56:40] that fusion age to a time of suffering
[56:42] to a time of i mean all the way to where
[56:44] you're completely lukewarm and cold you
[56:46] can have that um but you don't have to
[56:50] you don't have to you can you can
[56:51] correct you can you can repent you can
[56:53] you can go back to that first love
[56:55] that's not destined to go off into
[56:57] lukewarmness and coldness
[57:01] but brother branham talks about how
[57:03] there was um that the church ages i saw
[57:06] this cycle of apostasy and it was there
[57:08] in the ephesian age
[57:10] he talks about in the uh
[57:12] here on the right you have a um
[57:15] a image of diana and this is a very
[57:18] different image than mo it took me a
[57:20] while i actually find one like this this
[57:22] is not the one that was in ephesus it
[57:23] was one that was found in germany in the
[57:25] church age book he says that the image
[57:27] of diana found
[57:29] in the temple of ephesus was unlike any
[57:31] of the other ones there were many other
[57:33] temples it was just a wooden block
[57:35] hardly with any kind of form at all it
[57:38] says there were just two iron arms going
[57:40] out
[57:41] he says it looked very innocent
[57:44] what could be look at a block of wood
[57:46] like that he doesn't have most images of
[57:48] diana will be this elegant uh female
[57:50] huntress with her bow ready to go and
[57:52] slay
[57:53] that looks threatening
[57:55] this doesn't this is the antichrist
[57:57] spirit in ephesus it starts out very
[57:59] innocent
[58:01] nothing nothing too dangerous here but
[58:04] that that thing that got started led to
[58:06] a cooling off of their love and it says
[58:08] the very name ephesus has this compound
[58:10] meaning
[58:11] meaning aimed at and relaxed the high
[58:14] aspirations of this age that began with
[58:16] the fullness of the spirit the depth of
[58:18] god whereby they were aiming at the high
[58:20] calling of god
[58:22] began to give way to a less watchful
[58:25] attitude i just remember the burley talk
[58:27] how easy it is as couples then at the
[58:29] very beginning you want to do everything
[58:30] you can to please one another and then
[58:32] after a while
[58:33] i really don't care if my dirty socks
[58:35] are next to the bed anymore i really
[58:37] don't care i'm going to do it
[58:39] and uh sorry honey um but we we can get
[58:42] that way we just don't care
[58:45] and that that where you can be you start
[58:47] out aimed at to please to love one
[58:50] another then just kind of relaxed and
[58:51] not really caring anymore and that
[58:53] happened spiritually a less ardent
[58:55] following of jesus christ began to
[58:56] manifest itself as an omen that in the
[58:59] future ages the physical vehicle called
[59:01] the church would sink the awfulness of
[59:04] the depths of satan
[59:05] it become relaxed and was drifting
[59:07] already the age was backsliding it had
[59:10] left
[59:11] its first love and
[59:13] during the church book there's lots to
[59:15] be said on that but here on page 95 he
[59:17] continues how history keeps repeating
[59:19] itself
[59:21] in the generations of israel we see
[59:22] revival in one generation
[59:25] only to see the fires fading in the next
[59:27] and then in the third generation if you
[59:29] look up third generation and quote
[59:31] you'll see a couple places where he
[59:32] talks like this in the third generation
[59:35] embers may be glowing slightly but in
[59:38] the fourth there'd be no there may be no
[59:40] vestige whatsoever
[59:41] of that original flame
[59:44] but look at the grace of god
[59:46] then god lights the fire again in the
[59:48] same process repeated it's the
[59:50] manifestation of the truth that god has
[59:53] no grandchildren amen
[59:55] and kind of going back this is a cycle
[59:57] of apostasy that you see in the old
[59:59] testament and you think about what book
[1:00:00] of the old testament parallels with the
[1:00:02] ephesians well joshua
[1:00:05] and ephesians parallel one of the
[1:00:06] ephesians is
[1:00:08] going out and possessing the the work
[1:00:10] the the the the promises of christ in
[1:00:12] the new testament joshua's where they're
[1:00:15] possessing the promised land
[1:00:17] well what book follows after joshua it's
[1:00:20] the book of judges and in the book of
[1:00:21] judges you see that cycle of apostasy
[1:00:24] going very very quickly just that cycle
[1:00:26] just kind of rolls throughout the old
[1:00:28] testament
[1:00:30] well if you look at the we don't have
[1:00:31] time to go into it now i'm just going to
[1:00:33] give you a short uh a short summary and
[1:00:35] then we'll be finished but in the last
[1:00:37] four chapters 17 18 19 20 last five
[1:00:40] chapters of judges 17-21 we see
[1:00:44] this atmosphere where every man is doing
[1:00:46] right in his own eyes
[1:00:48] that summarizes today
[1:00:50] that summarizes
[1:00:52] not just the world of today it
[1:00:53] summarizes the religious world of today
[1:00:56] every man does which is right in his own
[1:00:58] eyes and those last few chapters of
[1:01:00] judges we see a
[1:01:02] traveling levite
[1:01:04] who
[1:01:05] is going around and he's selling his
[1:01:07] priestly services to the highest bidder
[1:01:09] and there's one young man named micah
[1:01:12] who has stolen money from his mother
[1:01:14] and he ends up making a an altar and a
[1:01:17] false god
[1:01:19] and he's a he's amazing ephraimite so
[1:01:21] he's uh he's not in the in he's not in
[1:01:23] the priestly tribe so he's his own
[1:01:25] priest but once this levite comes around
[1:01:27] he says hey
[1:01:29] micah knows enough that
[1:01:31] levites are better priests than
[1:01:32] ephraimites i should ask this guy to be
[1:01:34] my priest and he pays him to be his
[1:01:36] priest
[1:01:38] and that goes along well for a while and
[1:01:40] then the danites come they're traveling
[1:01:42] along because they want to posses the
[1:01:43] danites were given land
[1:01:45] where the philistines settled in the
[1:01:47] south of israel but they want to go and
[1:01:49] possess this area way in the north
[1:01:51] because they've got too many battles
[1:01:52] here so they want to go and do their own
[1:01:53] thing and possess this village it's not
[1:01:56] causing anybody any problems they're
[1:01:58] going along their way and they see this
[1:02:00] this man this levite priest and they
[1:02:02] recognize him because he's been around
[1:02:04] obviously gotten a name for himself
[1:02:07] and sure enough
[1:02:09] it's better to be a priest for a whole
[1:02:10] tribe than for one family and he goes
[1:02:13] with them
[1:02:15] and later in the judges 1830 we are told
[1:02:18] the name that this levite it's his name
[1:02:20] is jonathan
[1:02:22] his dad was gershom
[1:02:24] and the king james version says that his
[1:02:26] name
[1:02:27] is
[1:02:28] manasseh
[1:02:30] if you look at other bible versions
[1:02:32] it'll be moses
[1:02:34] and this was very likely moses's
[1:02:37] grandson
[1:02:39] because moses's son was a gershom
[1:02:41] and if you look it's thought that why is
[1:02:43] there a name change well in hebrew
[1:02:46] the name of moses looks like that
[1:02:48] manasseh
[1:02:50] just adds one letter
[1:02:52] and it's thought that
[1:02:54] that the the scribe writing this copying
[1:02:57] this out that is so terrible the
[1:02:59] disgrace that moses's grandson
[1:03:03] would be doing this
[1:03:04] they added the letter there because
[1:03:06] manasseh means forgetting
[1:03:08] they added the letter there so that
[1:03:09] despair moses
[1:03:11] the shame of being associated with what
[1:03:13] his grandson was doing
[1:03:15] now brother branham talks about the
[1:03:16] cycle of revival apostasy the first
[1:03:19] generation
[1:03:20] got this great revival second generation
[1:03:24] third generation embers just
[1:03:26] dying out
[1:03:28] you see this how quickly this happens
[1:03:31] in the book of judges
[1:03:33] and then at the
[1:03:34] another thing you see at the end of the
[1:03:35] judge you see all kinds of moral
[1:03:36] atrocities but you see a sexual
[1:03:39] perversion on a terrible scale where
[1:03:42] there's even a story that's hard to
[1:03:44] fathom where this man's traveling with
[1:03:46] his concubine of his and he goes to this
[1:03:48] city and she's abused all night and he
[1:03:51] gets up in the morning she's dead in the
[1:03:52] doorstep he hacks her into pieces sends
[1:03:55] pieces of her body all the tribes of
[1:03:56] israel to get them all to judge this is
[1:03:58] a terrible it's a grisly story terrible
[1:04:02] but it just shows everybody does what's
[1:04:03] right in their own eyes and when you do
[1:04:05] what's right in your own eyes you're
[1:04:06] going to get some really bad stuff
[1:04:09] if you wonder about it just look at the
[1:04:11] stuff that you can watch today
[1:04:13] it's bad because everybody does what's
[1:04:15] right in their own eyes
[1:04:17] well in the so this launches all of
[1:04:19] israel into a civil war all the 11
[1:04:21] tribes go to the tribe of benjamin and
[1:04:23] they try to wipe him out and
[1:04:25] there's a man named phineas who's going
[1:04:27] on offering sacrifices to intercede to
[1:04:29] god for these 11 tribes and if you look
[1:04:34] aaron
[1:04:35] eliaser phineas this is again
[1:04:37] this connection between moses and
[1:04:39] manasseh this sorry moses and jonathan
[1:04:41] just three generations that supported
[1:04:44] his phineas aaron's grandson
[1:04:46] as here in the story as well
[1:04:48] just how quickly
[1:04:50] this falling away can happen and when i
[1:04:52] saw this i got to thinking
[1:04:54] where are we today
[1:04:57] if you look at
[1:04:59] brother branham and then how many
[1:05:01] generations are we further i asked
[1:05:03] brother paul on the before service was
[1:05:06] brother john lafontaine in brother
[1:05:07] branham's meetings he said he wasn't but
[1:05:09] this his dad was
[1:05:11] but i put this and then if you look at
[1:05:13] brother branham brother john wasn't
[1:05:15] there but he was of an age where he
[1:05:16] could have been
[1:05:18] and then we're we're we're a third
[1:05:20] brother paul's a third generation away
[1:05:22] and
[1:05:24] how quickly a revival can fade and
[1:05:27] launch into when joshua's introducing
[1:05:29] the people they're going on and claiming
[1:05:31] their land
[1:05:32] and caleb says give me my mount and they
[1:05:34] just have all kinds of victories
[1:05:37] how quickly
[1:05:39] it falls there's a falling away there's
[1:05:42] a cooling off
[1:05:43] and that's the very that's that's the
[1:05:46] challenge of today because brother
[1:05:49] branham says to understand um
[1:05:52] revelation 2 5 where um
[1:05:55] john writes remember therefore from
[1:05:56] whence you are fallen and repent
[1:06:00] remember where you've fallen from he
[1:06:01] says it's not just a message to there
[1:06:03] but this talks about to understand this
[1:06:05] you must realize that the spirit is not
[1:06:07] speaking to the original saint of
[1:06:09] ephesus alone
[1:06:10] this message is to the entire age which
[1:06:13] lasted about 120 years its message then
[1:06:16] is to all the generations in that span
[1:06:18] and he says and history keeps repeating
[1:06:21] itself and it talks about the first
[1:06:23] generation second what i showed before
[1:06:25] salvation is not passed along by natural
[1:06:28] birth any more than there's any truth to
[1:06:30] apostolic succession we have to repent
[1:06:33] and i just think back
[1:06:35] we want to we don't have to have a leg
[1:06:37] to see an age in our own personal walk
[1:06:39] with god
[1:06:40] we don't have to have a cooling off when
[1:06:42] we're called we want to keep on with
[1:06:44] that have that close walk don't ever
[1:06:46] leave your your your first love
[1:06:49] we don't we're not doomed to this
[1:06:51] cooling off and that that you see all
[1:06:54] around the world we don't want that we
[1:06:56] don't have to have that god has
[1:06:57] something better for us and if we see
[1:06:59] the place where we have cold office
[1:07:00] remember where you've fallen from
[1:07:02] because if god started to work in you
[1:07:04] he's not going to leave you halfway he's
[1:07:06] there all you have to do is repent and
[1:07:07] say and brother bran says you're back
[1:07:09] now it's that easy we don't have to say
[1:07:12] all these kinds of prayers burn candles
[1:07:14] you're back repent you're back now
[1:07:17] and do the first works and this if you
[1:07:19] don't
[1:07:20] i won't remove your candlestick but
[1:07:21] repent because repentance is the game
[1:07:24] changer repentance changes the story so
[1:07:27] if you find yourself the story of your
[1:07:29] life and you don't like how the chapters
[1:07:30] reading
[1:07:32] we have to choose your own adventure
[1:07:33] story you could say what i want a
[1:07:34] different story repent
[1:07:37] that takes you a different page in the
[1:07:38] book and you're good to go
[1:07:41] amen
[1:07:42] well i trust that uh that hopefully
[1:07:44] brought a little bit of
[1:07:46] clarity to how god how god works he
[1:07:49] worked with a prophet messenger earlier
[1:07:52] in the first age and i believe that paul
[1:07:54] had
[1:07:55] he had scriptural basis for how god was
[1:07:57] using him he he stood upon that and if
[1:08:01] we can see how the devil likes to work
[1:08:03] showing uh showing false impersonations
[1:08:05] to to to distract us to keep us
[1:08:08] to help it to get us to keep god's truth
[1:08:10] what god's doing at arm's length
[1:08:12] we can see that there's two spirits
[1:08:14] capitalize on that truth and embrace the
[1:08:16] true don't let him don't let the devil
[1:08:19] keep you from that
[1:08:20] amen let's pray and then brother gideon
[1:08:23] i will give her an overview let's pray
[1:08:25] heavenly father we thank you very much
[1:08:26] for your
[1:08:28] goodness and grace to us lord i thank
[1:08:29] you for the
[1:08:30] for the great uh
[1:08:32] unveiling of truth lord that you did
[1:08:34] lord to brother branham's ministry of
[1:08:36] father i thank you for opening
[1:08:38] our eyes to that
[1:08:40] and lord i just pray if there's
[1:08:43] anyone here who
[1:08:44] like myself may have built up a
[1:08:46] skeptical attitude or skeptical complex
[1:08:50] to that lord i just pray father that you
[1:08:52] would
[1:08:53] lord grant deliverance
[1:08:55] from mass that we might be able to
[1:08:57] rejoice in what god has done instead of
[1:08:59] just
[1:09:00] keeping at arm's length if you've got a
[1:09:02] skeptical complex nothing will ever
[1:09:04] actually be good enough for you you'll
[1:09:06] keep everything at arm's length you'll
[1:09:08] be left alone
[1:09:10] i pray the lord that you would open our
[1:09:12] eyes to that that we might be able to
[1:09:13] rejoice in your truth oh god
[1:09:16] father just pray that you
[1:09:18] move in each and every life of god
[1:09:21] lord i pray that you would
[1:09:23] do a
[1:09:24] do a do a review of each of our hearts
[1:09:26] of god
[1:09:27] lord that we might
[1:09:30] lord not leave our first love or we
[1:09:31] might go back to that first level god an
[1:09:34] intimate personal relationship that's
[1:09:36] what we that's what elijah was sent
[1:09:37] forth to have a not just have new
[1:09:39] doctrines new new principles revealed to
[1:09:42] us but to have that relationship
[1:09:43] restored and i pray o lord that you
[1:09:45] would
[1:09:46] do that in each and every one of us
[1:09:48] lord we love you thank you in jesus name
[1:09:51] amen
