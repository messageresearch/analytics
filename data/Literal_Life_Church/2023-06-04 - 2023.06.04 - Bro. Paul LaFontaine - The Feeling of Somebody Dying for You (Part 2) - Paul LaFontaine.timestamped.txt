[0:00] chapter 10 and we'll join in reading the
[0:02] scripture together
[0:10] we appreciate brother Phillips singing
[0:12] that song I'm going to continue with
[0:13] that subject today that we were on last
[0:15] week somebody died for me and get to a
[0:18] scripture a couple of references that we
[0:20] didn't get to last Sunday to add to the
[0:22] subject a little bit and I trust it will
[0:24] be a blessing to your you and your
[0:26] Christian Journey God bless you each one
[0:28] we welcome all that's here I think we
[0:30] have a few visitors so we don't want to
[0:32] miss anybody God bless you good to have
[0:33] you with us this morning Hebrews chapter
[0:35] 10 just been a special section of
[0:38] scriptures here the last couple of weeks
[0:40] to me and looking at over Hebrews
[0:42] chapter 10 and I'm just going to pull
[0:44] out a few things in relation to our
[0:46] subject of somebody died from me and I
[0:49] want to speak this morning on the
[0:51] feeling of someone dying for you the
[0:53] feeling of someone dying for you Hebrews
[0:56] chapter 10 and I'll just pull out a few
[0:58] places here I'll just start at verse six
[1:00] and burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:03] sin thou has had no pleasure then said I
[1:06] lo I come in the value of the book it is
[1:08] written of me to do thy will o God above
[1:11] when he said sacrifice and offering and
[1:13] burn offerings and offering for sin thou
[1:15] what is not neither has pleasure therein
[1:17] which are offered by the law then said
[1:19] he lo I come to do thy will O Lord
[1:22] he taketh away the first that he may
[1:24] establish the second by the which will
[1:27] by the which will we are Sanctified
[1:29] through the offering of the body of
[1:32] Jesus Christ and every priest standeth
[1:35] daily ministering and offering
[1:36] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:39] never take away our sins but this man
[1:42] this man after he had offered one
[1:45] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[1:48] the right hand of God from henceforth
[1:50] expecting till his enemies be made his
[1:52] footstool for by one offering he hath
[1:55] perfected forever them that are
[1:59] Sanctified what is this saying somebody
[2:01] died for us
[2:03] and guess who it affects it affects all
[2:05] of them that they be Sanctified for by
[2:08] one offering he hath perfected forever
[2:10] them that are Sanctified somebody died
[2:13] for us now I want you to notice
[2:15] something here towards the end of the
[2:16] chapter that Paul brings in here and uh
[2:20] it's kind of like our response or our
[2:23] feeling and our continuance of the value
[2:26] of what God has done for us and that
[2:29] here in verse 22 what would we do in
[2:32] response how should we live and the
[2:35] first thing he says in verse 22 says
[2:37] because because he's died for us let us
[2:40] draw near with a True Heart in full
[2:42] Assurance of Faith having our hearts
[2:45] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[2:47] our bodies washed with pure water I'm
[2:49] just going to cover this while you're
[2:51] standing here just a minute first thing
[2:52] is he says knowing he's done this for us
[2:55] we should not draw away but we should
[2:58] draw near
[3:00] we should keep drawing near him
[3:03] when we have a a a value for someone who
[3:07] has given his life for us then we don't
[3:10] draw away we actually draw near
[3:13] so that's the first thing the second
[3:14] thing verse 23 is let us hold fast the
[3:17] profession of our faith without wavering
[3:19] for he is faithful that promise so part
[3:22] of our value of knowing what he has done
[3:23] is that we not only keep drawing near
[3:25] but we hold fast our profession you know
[3:28] our profession doesn't need to be one
[3:29] week I'm in one week I'm out one week
[3:32] I'm weak one week I'm strong our
[3:33] profession needs to be faithful our
[3:36] profession of faith that we believe
[3:37] Jesus Christ we believe is word we
[3:39] believe the message that he sent our
[3:41] profession needs to be consistent can
[3:43] you say Amen
[3:45] verse 24 says let us consider one
[3:47] another so that's another part of this
[3:50] uh Drawing Near to God is considering
[3:53] one another did you know the person
[3:55] sitting next next to you is more than
[3:57] likely a part of the body of Christ and
[3:59] you can't be an island they're part of
[4:00] the body of Christ and so we it's about
[4:03] one another as well part of drawing near
[4:06] him is drawing near the body of Christ
[4:09] not further away
[4:11] let us consider one another to provoke
[4:14] unto love and to good work stir up Good
[4:17] Works among one another verse 25 says
[4:20] not forsaking the assembling of
[4:23] ourselves together as the manner of some
[4:25] is so what are they doing they're
[4:27] drawing away and even makes the emphasis
[4:30] here that if we're drawing closer then
[4:33] we're not forsaking the assembling of
[4:35] ourselves together
[4:38] it's part of it I could you know I could
[4:40] preach a sermon on that
[4:43] but there are those forsaking the
[4:44] assembling of themselves together for
[4:46] lots of reasons I won't give all those
[4:48] reasons but but we see that but this is
[4:50] part of let us draw near let us hold our
[4:53] profession it's part of you have a
[4:56] feeling for this person that has died
[4:58] for you that you're Drawing Near I'm not
[5:00] going to forsake the assembling of
[5:01] myself together why because that's how
[5:03] you draw near as the matter said but
[5:06] exhorting one another that's how we draw
[5:07] near and so much the more as you see the
[5:09] day approaching now this next scripture
[5:11] and I'm I'm gonna
[5:13] close my opening here in a minute
[5:17] this is serious scripture here
[5:19] for if we sin willfully after that we
[5:23] have received the knowledge of the truth
[5:25] their remaineth no more sacrifice for
[5:28] sins
[5:29] now that's been used for years and for a
[5:32] lot of different agendas I don't want to
[5:34] try to interpret it and I don't use it
[5:35] to try to kick people out but it's the
[5:38] soberness of that scripture should make
[5:40] us all sober because that's what Paul
[5:42] wanted it's not just an animal that's
[5:44] died for you because that doesn't take
[5:46] your sins someone has died for you and
[5:49] we need to never lose the feeling when
[5:52] someone is willfully sinning and just
[5:54] trampling upon the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:56] that's a serious serious thing
[6:00] because they lose the feeling of It Go
[6:02] assemble yourself together draw near to
[6:05] me keep this cycle going of staying
[6:07] close to the Lord why because it shows
[6:09] you have a value that somebody died for
[6:12] you
[6:14] we sin willfully after that we have
[6:15] received the knowledge through their
[6:17] remaineth no more sacrifice their sins
[6:18] but a certain fearful looking for the
[6:20] judgment and fury ignition which shall
[6:22] Devour the adversaries he that despise
[6:25] Moses law died without Mercy into under
[6:27] two or three Witnesses my what severe
[6:29] Judgment of how much sore punishment
[6:31] suppose ye shall ye be thought or worthy
[6:34] who have trodden underfoot the Son of
[6:36] God and have counted the blood of the
[6:38] Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified
[6:40] an Unholy thing and hath done despite
[6:43] unto the spirit of Grace for we know
[6:46] that he has said Vengeance belong let's
[6:48] just skip down here to uh if you would
[6:51] all the way to verse 35 cast not away
[6:55] your confidence which has great
[6:57] recompense or reward for ye have need of
[6:59] patience that after ye have done the
[7:01] will of God you might receive the
[7:02] promise for yet a little while and ye
[7:04] shall he that shall come will come and
[7:07] will not tarry now the just shall live
[7:10] by faith but if any man draw back now
[7:14] notice if any man draw back my soul
[7:17] shall have no pleasure in him that's God
[7:19] speaking
[7:21] I began in verse 22 if you compare let
[7:24] us all draw near
[7:27] but here's a soul who draws back in
[7:30] other this says in unbelievers this is
[7:32] somebody who knows about the finished
[7:34] work of redemption of and they just draw
[7:37] back from it
[7:38] they draw back their lives the just
[7:40] shall live by faith but if any man draw
[7:42] back my soul shall have no pleasure in
[7:44] him but praise the lord we are not of
[7:47] them who draw back unto Perdition but of
[7:49] them that believe to the saving of the
[7:52] Soul I'm not I don't want to be in that
[7:55] group that draws back
[7:57] I want to be in that group that draws
[7:59] closer and draws nearer to the cross
[8:03] father bless your word today and we
[8:05] commit it to you and the word you've
[8:07] spoken Lord and had in your mind before
[8:09] the foundation of the world you gave a
[8:11] word even for this Sunday for me to
[8:13] speak for the benefit of the people of
[8:15] God I pray they would catch it Lord and
[8:17] we pray for their souls that you'd bless
[8:19] and prosper them in Jesus name amen God
[8:23] bless you may be seated so we're on this
[8:25] theme that someone died for you last
[8:27] Sunday we were on it and it's an
[8:29] appreciation for the reality of someone
[8:32] I mentioned taking a bullet for you if
[8:35] someone took a bullet for you next to
[8:37] you jumped out in front of you and they
[8:39] took a bullet you would be very
[8:40] appreciative of that person dying for
[8:42] you you would attend the funeral you
[8:44] would be appreciative to the family and
[8:46] you'd probably probably live a very
[8:48] grateful life knowing that person
[8:50] personally stood in the stood in the Gap
[8:53] and jumped in front and took a bullet
[8:54] for you and it's like the song that's
[8:57] ministered to me that brother Phillips
[8:58] saying is that we're forever grateful
[9:00] and I like that lyric at the end that
[9:03] says every day every day is a gift to me
[9:08] because somebody died for me this isn't
[9:11] just it lasted two years and you forget
[9:13] what he did for you every day is a gift
[9:15] to me because somebody and when you keep
[9:18] the feeling of it when you keep the the
[9:20] honor of it can you say Amen when you
[9:22] keep that in your heart then every day
[9:24] is the gift because I'm the one that
[9:26] deserved to die but somebody else took
[9:28] the bullet for me
[9:30] and so every day is a gift so now I was
[9:32] reading to you an article how the
[9:34] generations sometimes when they're not
[9:36] connected with somebody who has served
[9:39] in the military we're getting more and
[9:40] more where the generations don't know
[9:42] somebody that served in the military
[9:44] they haven't served themselves and they
[9:46] don't know somebody personally who
[9:48] actually died for them if they know
[9:49] somebody like that especially a family
[9:51] member then we realize that they're more
[9:53] connected to that sacrifice that was
[9:56] made so that there's an appreciation for
[9:58] the freedoms that came for that
[10:00] sacrifice and they were saying I was
[10:02] reading it to you last week that about
[10:04] 12 percent of the total U.S population
[10:05] were a part of the Armed Forces during
[10:08] World War II and so as she goes on she
[10:11] says uh uh she's I'm just picking up I
[10:14] don't want to read the whole thing again
[10:15] of course
[10:16] um she says that the she talks with the
[10:18] veterans excuse me I just wanted to
[10:21] catch this last part in our society
[10:23] we've seen this real shift she said not
[10:26] less than one percent of our population
[10:27] has served the experience of going to
[10:29] war and coming home we don't have as
[10:31] much awareness we have a disconnect in
[10:33] our society about what's going on who
[10:36] has served what they've experienced and
[10:38] the ones that also that have died as I
[10:41] said a half a million people over the
[10:43] nation's history those have died in
[10:45] order to preserve our freedom and one
[10:48] place he says here of the military
[10:50] related task fewer Americans have a
[10:54] personal connection to someone in the
[10:56] armed forces or someone who died for
[10:58] them this is something that happens over
[11:00] generations and I'm I'm pulling that out
[11:02] fewer Americans have a direct connection
[11:05] or a personal connection this relates to
[11:09] the Gospel of Jesus Christ because every
[11:12] believer must have a personal connection
[11:15] with the one that died for them
[11:18] I know that's simple this morning but if
[11:21] you don't have that you'll lose the
[11:22] feeling of it you won't see what it's
[11:24] done for you personally
[11:26] you'll be like a grandchild that carries
[11:28] things on in the church and I'm I'm here
[11:30] and I go to church because my parents
[11:31] told me to do it but that's not what
[11:33] church is all about you go someone has
[11:35] died for you someone has sacrificed
[11:37] their life because of your sin and your
[11:40] life and so if you don't catch a
[11:42] revelation of that and see what God's
[11:44] done for you you won't have a value and
[11:46] appreciation to say I'm living today
[11:48] spiritually and naturally even but I'm
[11:51] living today spiritually because someone
[11:53] sacrificed their life for me
[11:56] I'd like every Christian to keep that
[11:58] value the rest of their lives
[12:01] and stay near The Cross can you say Amen
[12:04] so we see then that there's a Detachment
[12:07] when it says that you lose the Personal
[12:09] Touch of someone that died there's a
[12:11] Detachment Generations become too far
[12:13] removed from the reality of War for the
[12:16] freedoms that they have and as I
[12:18] mentioned last Sunday you take a mom
[12:19] who's lost their son to war she's going
[12:22] to feel that because it's personal and
[12:24] and she's going to feel proud that he
[12:26] served but she's going to hurt from the
[12:29] pain of losing her son it's a personal
[12:31] thing to her and the same thing applies
[12:33] even more to what the Lord has done for
[12:37] you this morning
[12:38] [Music]
[12:39] if the new generation has no personal
[12:42] connection with the blood that was shed
[12:44] for our country or someone who died they
[12:47] become listen now they become
[12:49] insensitive they become carnal they
[12:52] become violent they become destroying
[12:55] one another and destroying things in our
[12:57] country of True Value isn't that
[12:59] happening right now to this generation
[13:01] they don't care anymore they have no
[13:03] sensitivity to hold up our freedoms they
[13:06] actually mock it their carnal they're
[13:09] violent people they'll destroy one
[13:11] another and they'll kill they'll turn
[13:13] their guns towards the innocent
[13:15] nobody would ever do that number one if
[13:18] they had God in their life but if they
[13:19] had an appreciation for human life and
[13:21] that God saved us and gave us a free
[13:23] country because people died for their
[13:26] lives to be able to enjoy this Freedom
[13:27] now in our own country now we have guns
[13:30] turned towards one another
[13:32] violence comes
[13:34] uh carnality comes destroying one
[13:37] another why are you elaborating on that
[13:40] brother Paul because I'll tell you why
[13:41] when someone begins to lose their
[13:44] feeling for what God has done for them
[13:46] they'll do the same things within the
[13:49] Christian church
[13:51] they'll turn their guns towards one
[13:52] another
[13:53] they'll turn their hatred towards one
[13:55] another
[13:57] and lose their appreciation for the body
[13:59] of Christ
[14:03] why because you take your freedoms for
[14:05] granted and humility is lost it's Pride
[14:07] it's humility when a person loses a real
[14:09] touch with our dying lamb they also
[14:12] become carnal and as brother Matt
[14:15] Watkins was saying the scripture the
[14:17] carnal mind is an enemy against God and
[14:19] he says we all have a carnal mind I was
[14:22] just amazed to think that is that we as
[14:24] Christians we have we have the Holy
[14:26] Spirit or we should have the Holy Spirit
[14:27] we have the Holy Spirit but we still
[14:29] have a carnal mind and that carnal mind
[14:31] left to itself is a continual enemy
[14:34] against God if you don't live by the
[14:35] spirit and the feeling of what Calvary
[14:37] has done for you on a daily basis you
[14:40] will let this carnal mind turn as an
[14:42] enemy against the people of God and
[14:44] against God himself
[14:47] because that's what the carnival it's an
[14:48] enemy against God and and you know the
[14:51] thing is is that this new generation and
[14:53] just that if if you look at a child like
[14:55] my grandchild here this morning uh you
[14:58] know and if you have a child you learn
[15:01] that they they don't have the maturity
[15:04] yet but they they they don't have a
[15:06] regard for precious things
[15:07] uh
[15:10] and they're not connected not connected
[15:12] to things that are of value that you
[15:14] have paid for they don't have a value
[15:16] for it and even teenagers for that
[15:19] matter I mean somebody pays for that
[15:21] light bill
[15:22] and they won't turn their lights off
[15:26] they have no idea of the sacrifice
[15:28] that's made somebody else I feel like
[15:31] tell them somebody died for you somebody
[15:34] paid the light bill for you
[15:38] just use your sermon and they don't have
[15:41] a value of the sacrifices made can you
[15:44] say Amen a lot of ministers have made
[15:46] sacrifices to their lives for countless
[15:49] years in prayer when they could have
[15:51] been off Saturday doing some enjoyable
[15:53] thing they're in study all day and
[15:55] fasting and prayer for your lives if
[15:57] people don't have a value of it I think
[15:59] we should appreciate the fifo ministry
[16:01] and the you may not like them personally
[16:03] but the sacrifices that are made is
[16:06] because of where you're at today
[16:09] amen
[16:11] the children you know it's like
[16:12] yesterday she come over while I was
[16:15] studying and uh Ryan brought over you
[16:18] know and so Ellie you know you have to
[16:20] watch over because she you know I've got
[16:22] a nice piano the Lord's blessing bless
[16:25] me with lately nice baby grand piano and
[16:28] uh then Ellie has Ellie are you
[16:30] listening she has a little baby grand
[16:32] piano that's a toy grand piano and she
[16:34] plays that and I get on mine and she
[16:36] gets on that and we get to going and she
[16:38] but the problem is I only paid about 50
[16:41] bucks for hers
[16:44] and she doesn't know what I've paid for
[16:46] this one and she wants to get on and
[16:49] bang that one like her toy and it's not
[16:52] a toy but she doesn't know that
[16:54] just just going on and hit it and then
[16:56] she's got a stick in her hand and you're
[16:57] going oh she just could scratch that
[17:00] and it's not their fault they just don't
[17:03] have a value of the bill that's coming
[17:06] in for that piano still I'm still trying
[17:08] to pay it off
[17:10] and you know they don't have a feeling
[17:12] for it and who who paid you wish you
[17:14] could tell three-year-old do you know
[17:16] how much I paid for that thing stay away
[17:17] from that
[17:20] so we go outside and we get something
[17:23] else if they want to throw sticks out
[17:25] there Ellie you can throw all the sticks
[17:27] you want to outside
[17:30] okay
[17:32] we get them distracted we get them away
[17:34] from the valuable things and then you
[17:36] get you you turn on baby shark for an
[17:39] hour
[17:47] I'm only saying that because it's still
[17:49] ringing in my ears I had to do
[17:51] everything to work on studying last
[17:53] night because all night long
[17:55] baby
[17:58] get that out of my mind
[18:03] but you do what you got to do
[18:06] you got to do things because they don't
[18:08] see the value and so this is a
[18:09] reflection of the immaturity of a
[18:12] generation of people who are not
[18:14] connected with the sacrifices that have
[18:17] been made
[18:18] this applies more to Christianity and
[18:20] the gospel legit and applies to this
[18:22] message movement as well I can tell you
[18:24] someone can have all of the Seven Seals
[18:27] and all the books of the prophet and all
[18:29] these other things but when you lose a
[18:31] feeling for the people of God for what
[18:33] God has done for you and keep a humility
[18:36] about yourself then you become carnal
[18:39] and you lose the value of things and
[18:41] that's why your tongue slips and you
[18:43] gossip and you give yourself permission
[18:44] to do this and divide and do everything
[18:46] else because why you've lost something
[18:48] and then people draw away he said draw
[18:51] near you draw away I don't need anybody
[18:53] you draw away no no we're supposed to
[18:55] draw near to him and draw near to one
[18:58] another
[18:59] can I get a few amens that's what your
[19:02] Bible says that's what the Bible says so
[19:04] now I want to bring in something before
[19:06] I read a quote and I won't be long today
[19:09] but I just want to finish up what we got
[19:10] started last week but you see now
[19:12] there's in the Old Testament there's
[19:14] seven feasts that the people celebrated
[19:16] and they came three times a year to
[19:18] celebrate in these feasts there was
[19:20] seven of these feasts and they all
[19:21] represented something in a shadow they
[19:23] all represented the Christ coming Christ
[19:25] was the Fulfillment of all seven feasts
[19:28] let's see if I can remember a feast of
[19:29] Passover feast of unleavened bread Feast
[19:32] of first fruits uh Feast of Pentecost
[19:35] Feast of uh Tabernacles uh somebody have
[19:39] a feast of atonement uh and there's
[19:42] another piece of trumpets trumpets atoma
[19:45] Tabernacles and so there's seven of them
[19:47] and that's just types and shadows and
[19:49] the people went three times a year and
[19:51] they worshiped and they were they were
[19:53] supposed to be at these feasts they were
[19:54] coming Worship in Jerusalem at all three
[19:56] times a year bring their families and
[19:58] then you're supposed to be there you're
[19:59] supposed to show up and they would bring
[20:01] sacrifices and they would do this and
[20:03] this is how they worship so now bringing
[20:05] it to the New Testament Jesus is in in
[20:08] Jesus in his bodily form is a
[20:11] fulfillment spiritually of all seven
[20:13] feasts how many know that Jesus is the
[20:15] Passover Lamb
[20:17] so he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of
[20:19] Passover and given a little teaching
[20:21] here it's preaching preaching and
[20:23] teaching together
[20:25] pass over lamb what's the next one Feast
[20:28] of unleavened bread how many know that
[20:30] Jesus is the unleavened bread no sin
[20:32] leaven means sin there's no sin in him
[20:34] so he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of
[20:37] unleavened bread all right the Feast of
[20:39] first fruits which is the resurrection
[20:41] he is the Fulfillment he's the one that
[20:44] come up the third day so he's the
[20:46] Fulfillment he not only went and it's an
[20:48] interesting thing about Jesus is when he
[20:50] was here on Earth he was attending these
[20:53] feasts and while he was there at the
[20:55] temple attending these natural feasts he
[20:57] was the Fulfillment and they didn't
[20:58] realize that he's not only just a
[21:01] tradition of going to the feast he is
[21:03] the Fulfillment of the feast
[21:05] to say that this morning I don't want to
[21:07] just come to church I don't want to just
[21:09] come because it's a duty but I want to
[21:11] be the Fulfillment of why we come to
[21:13] church
[21:14] I want to see Christ lived out in these
[21:16] things
[21:18] so now the last four the last four
[21:20] Feasts
[21:21] I want you to catch this they're
[21:23] fulfilled also by Christ but not in the
[21:26] body of Christ in the sense of his body
[21:28] two thousand years ago the last four are
[21:30] still Christ but he fulfills them
[21:32] through the body of the Bride
[21:36] so number four is the Feast of Pentecost
[21:38] who was it that was in the upper room
[21:40] while this Feast was being fulfilled it
[21:42] was 120 believers
[21:44] so it was Jesus in them can you say Amen
[21:47] not in his body that came to Jesus of
[21:50] Nazareth but now it's in the body of
[21:52] people that he has actually fulfilling
[21:54] during the time of the Feast of
[21:56] Pentecost while there in the temple in
[21:59] an upper room God is fulfilling that
[22:02] reality
[22:03] that's why I say these things have to be
[22:06] a reality to you church has to be a
[22:09] reality it's not about coming and seeing
[22:11] friends and showing off what we wear no
[22:13] it has to be a personal connection when
[22:16] you and the Christ of this message can
[22:18] you say Amen you have to be connected to
[22:21] him
[22:22] because this is a reality this isn't a
[22:24] ritual this is a thing that we go
[22:25] through in time in our clock to say I
[22:27] got to give about a two hours to go to
[22:29] church with my family then I got lots
[22:30] more to do shame on us we we got to come
[22:33] for deeper reasons for that
[22:36] and so now we see that number four I got
[22:39] to finish with this because this is not
[22:40] my subject but I want you to just catch
[22:42] one thing out of it number four is the
[22:43] Feast of Pentecost it was fulfilled then
[22:45] we have a long period of time in the
[22:47] seven feasts the last three from the
[22:49] fourth one there's a longer period of
[22:51] time interestingly in the Old Testament
[22:53] from the fourth all the way to the last
[22:55] three which is perfect because when you
[22:57] come from the day of Pentecost two
[22:59] thousand years of church history when
[23:01] you get to the end time is the
[23:02] Fulfillment of the last three feasts
[23:04] still through the bride but you're going
[23:07] to have the Feast of trumpets you're
[23:08] going to have the Feast of atonement and
[23:11] then you're going to have the Feast of
[23:14] Tabernacles
[23:16] all to be fulfilled at the end time so
[23:19] if you live in the end time which you do
[23:21] then you realize wow
[23:23] where am I living I'm living in the
[23:25] Fulfillment of these three
[23:27] I need I need Lord help me to catch this
[23:30] we're not just going to church here
[23:31] we're fulfilling the word here can you
[23:34] say Amen you're actually fulfilling the
[23:36] word when the Bible says not forsaking
[23:38] The Sibling of yourself together Hey
[23:39] listen you're fulfilling the word when
[23:41] you come through these doors it isn't
[23:42] just church hey I'm walking in the word
[23:44] when I come praise be to God and listen
[23:47] again on the internet as far as because
[23:49] you're hungry you want to hear the word
[23:50] of God and I think that's a wonderful
[23:52] thing so now we we see then that the the
[23:54] lamb and in the last three feasts then
[23:57] let's let's hone in on the Feast of
[23:59] atonement all right the lamb was killed
[24:02] under the Feast of Passover he fulfilled
[24:03] that in his body the and they said now
[24:06] the Jews will experience these feasts as
[24:09] well spiritually they will experience
[24:11] these feasts because they have in the
[24:12] Feast of the trumpets the prophet dreams
[24:14] about brings out that it's a drawing and
[24:17] Gathering his people well when he had
[24:19] Hitler and all these men that that
[24:21] persecuted the Jews it was spiritually
[24:24] being used to drive it was part of the
[24:26] trumpets driving the Jews back into
[24:28] their Homeland
[24:30] that's why we look at our trials not as
[24:33] curses can you say man but it's getting
[24:35] us to where we need to be can he say
[24:37] Amen
[24:38] even Hitler and I don't endorse Hitler
[24:40] here today he was an evil evil man but
[24:42] God in his big plan used it to get the
[24:44] Jews back into their Homeland
[24:47] a lot of deaths a lot of sacrifices for
[24:49] that to get the people in the Homeland
[24:50] you see but it's the Feast of trumpets
[24:52] and so we're under spiritually these
[24:53] pieces of trumpet because where's the
[24:55] scripture for us wheresoever the carcass
[24:58] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[25:01] together
[25:02] there's a trumpet that's called you here
[25:07] I've heard a spiritual trumpet the voice
[25:09] of God that's called me here we got some
[25:11] new ones you think a fat preacher is
[25:14] drawing you here no God's calling you
[25:16] here God's drawing God's Gathering you
[25:19] together it better be God
[25:21] I reminded somebody of children this
[25:22] morning we don't go to church for people
[25:24] we go to church because we're hungry for
[25:26] the word of God and that's it
[25:28] that's it are you hungry and you need to
[25:30] ask yourself that question am I coming
[25:32] because I'm hungry for the word
[25:34] and if you're not that's a serious
[25:36] question to ask yourself because you're
[25:37] coming for other reasons you need to
[25:39] come because you're hungry for the word
[25:40] of God
[25:41] that's why I come I also enjoy the
[25:44] fellowship this is my family I was with
[25:46] a few of you on Monday for Memorial Day
[25:47] I love it the sincerity lack of guile
[25:50] just the purity of people I love the
[25:52] fellowship I love being around there's
[25:53] no there's no clouds or something that's
[25:55] just pure fellowship and enjoying one
[25:58] another we don't always talk about the
[25:59] word sometimes it's just about funny
[26:01] stuff or whatever life but there's
[26:02] there's not this well pins and needles
[26:05] you have to walk on and this is my
[26:08] family
[26:10] I love it
[26:12] I love to be in the house of Lord
[26:14] with my family and be with my family
[26:18] it's just the way I look at it
[26:20] amen so now they gathered where's
[26:22] whatever the carcasses so now when you
[26:24] come to this Feast of atonement this is
[26:26] an important one must be so important
[26:28] because I'm spending a lot more time on
[26:30] it than what I wanted to
[26:33] so the Jews will experience this Feast
[26:35] of atonement and when they do someday
[26:37] the Bible says that they were mourned
[26:39] for days they'll go into repentance
[26:41] because it's not that they're that their
[26:44] Messiah
[26:45] is coming they're looking for their it's
[26:47] not they realize that their Messiah has
[26:49] already come
[26:50] and the lamb for their sins has already
[26:53] died
[26:54] so Jesus won't have to come again and go
[26:57] to the Cross he's already done that so I
[27:00] want to make this one the Feast of
[27:01] atonement is not another killing of the
[27:04] Lamb
[27:05] he's already died for you
[27:07] so what's the Feast of atoma because we
[27:09] know that Calvary and when he did 2000
[27:12] years ago gave us our atonement for our
[27:14] sins what is the feast of atonement is
[27:16] it another killing no the Jews will come
[27:18] back in Repentance and realize that he's
[27:21] already come and die for them they
[27:23] didn't know it and when they recognize
[27:25] it they will mourn and repent for days
[27:27] feeling feeling that they crucified the
[27:31] one that they were looking for remember
[27:33] the Jews didn't reject the Messiah they
[27:36] rejected the way that he come
[27:40] wow
[27:42] they were they were singing about the
[27:44] Messiah they were prophesied he's coming
[27:45] he's coming then he came and they didn't
[27:47] know him because he didn't come the way
[27:48] that they thought could it be everybody
[27:51] listening on the broadcaster that could
[27:53] it be Christ could come again
[27:55] people are not rejecting Christ but
[27:57] they're rejecting the way that he comes
[27:59] they did it before history repeats
[28:02] itself the Jews never rejected the
[28:04] Messiah they rejected the way the
[28:06] Messiah came
[28:09] very very deep point to think about
[28:12] but now they realize they've killed
[28:14] their Messiah
[28:16] and after two thousand years of
[28:18] Christianity this happens to us too
[28:21] because we get away
[28:24] from what Calvary did we get away from
[28:26] the true atonement we get away from the
[28:29] True Fellowship of it
[28:31] religion and tradition for two thousand
[28:34] years takes the place of the reality of
[28:36] God
[28:37] we get away from the feeling of the
[28:41] atonement we get away from the power of
[28:43] the atonement
[28:45] it becomes a tradition it's not personal
[28:49] so that's why we need a Revival and a
[28:53] revelation of what the atonement really
[28:56] was what did he really do for me at
[28:58] Calvary this power needs to come into my
[29:02] life the power the feeling the
[29:04] sensitivity the the the all that's come
[29:07] from Calvary because the church lost it
[29:10] it's a powerless religion
[29:13] God hates a powerless religion God hates
[29:16] a religion that has no power has no
[29:18] Supernatural in it has no God in it can
[29:21] you say amen and specifically not so
[29:23] much for miracles but he hates the fact
[29:25] that religion replaces the power of the
[29:28] spirit to change a life and transform
[29:30] their desires that they have no more
[29:33] conscience of sin That's The Power of
[29:36] somebody dying for you that it so Burns
[29:39] sin out of your soul that you no longer
[29:41] have a conscience of sin
[29:46] that's how powerful this is I know you
[29:48] got your mind that tries to think about
[29:49] it but in the desires
[29:52] Calvary so it's not just saying I shook
[29:55] the preacher's hand and I believe Christ
[29:56] died for my sins mechanically
[29:58] intellectually
[29:59] they don't have the feeling of it you'll
[30:01] baptize
[30:03] uh
[30:04] dry Sinners and bring up wet centers
[30:09] if they don't have a reality
[30:12] of what God has done for them
[30:14] there's a power in this atonement
[30:16] there's a fellowship of it there's a
[30:18] feeling of it can you say amen and over
[30:20] time it becomes impersonal I just want
[30:23] to pull up this first quote it's just a
[30:25] few sentences it's always been a
[30:27] powerful quote to me the seventh Angel's
[30:29] message under the same trumpet same
[30:31] everything exactly the same seal is to
[30:35] so go to the first line the seventh
[30:37] Angel's message and by the way here we
[30:39] we quote a lot from the seventh
[30:41] messenger there were seven Messengers
[30:43] Seven Stars in his right hand in the
[30:45] Book of Revelations and so we because we
[30:47] live in the seventh age then we would be
[30:49] looking for if we're in the seventh age
[30:51] the seventh uh star in his right hand
[30:54] the seventh messenger Earthly messenger
[30:55] we live under that now because we live
[30:57] in the seventh age so we quote a lot
[30:59] from him we quote a lot from that so
[31:01] just to explain that but this is what
[31:02] that seventh Angels message is supposed
[31:04] to do the seventh Angels message under
[31:06] the same chapter everything is to call
[31:08] the people the bride out of the
[31:11] Pentecostal and World tradition to the
[31:14] Gen genuine atonement the word
[31:18] there's a lot in that statement what
[31:21] happened
[31:24] did something wrong
[31:28] thank you appreciate it God bless you
[31:32] assistants have to do everything I'll
[31:34] tell you
[31:36] seventh angel message under the same
[31:38] trumpet same everything exactly the same
[31:39] seal it's called The Bride you want to
[31:42] know what the purpose of the last day's
[31:43] message is to call us out of Pentecostal
[31:46] and World tradition to the genuine
[31:48] atonement of the word there's a lot in
[31:49] this let me say first of all if we had
[31:52] to be called back after 2000 years back
[31:54] to the atonement that means we lost the
[31:57] meaning of the atonement
[31:59] and there's thousands of churches
[32:00] getting up and singing about the cross
[32:02] this morning but some of them have lost
[32:04] the meaning and the power of what the
[32:06] atonement purchased for us what the
[32:08] atonement is people say I believe Christ
[32:10] died for my sins but there's no power in
[32:12] the atonement they don't know what it
[32:13] did for them they don't know the apost
[32:14] they don't have a clue and I think
[32:16] that's a a tragedy to mislead people as
[32:19] long as you just confess with your mouth
[32:21] he died for my sins you're saved I think
[32:23] that's a tragedy that life has to be
[32:25] transformed and chased that Soul has to
[32:28] be converted there has to be a new birth
[32:30] Jesus said it himself you must be born
[32:32] again by the power of the Cross not a
[32:36] head knowledge of the cross that means
[32:38] your life has changed that means your
[32:40] desires are changed that means you come
[32:42] to an altar in your seat whatever it is
[32:43] is that I accept what God has done
[32:45] somebody died for me and now I want to
[32:48] live for him
[32:51] that's an experience with God that tears
[32:53] the world out
[32:55] and like Sherry's song says it's true I
[32:57] can do whatever I want I can do whatever
[32:58] I want but my wants have been changed
[33:03] that's the work of the Lord I can do
[33:05] whatever I want today I can leave this
[33:07] service and go to the bar and go do
[33:09] whatever I want but I don't want to go
[33:10] to the bar I don't want to look at the
[33:12] things of the world Calvary took care of
[33:14] that I don't have a desire for those
[33:15] things
[33:20] so we must have lost the genuine
[33:23] atonement over 2000 years history and
[33:25] guess what the seventh Angel's message
[33:27] is to call us out of did anybody notice
[33:30] out of Pentecostal traditions
[33:34] now if you didn't know there's
[33:35] Pentecostal Traditions you should know
[33:37] it by this quote there are Pentecostal
[33:39] Traditions now the original Pentecost on
[33:42] the in the upper room that's the
[33:44] experience we want can you say man that
[33:46] the reality of it but Azusa Street was a
[33:49] fulfillment only of the gifts of the
[33:51] church California Azusa Street that was
[33:53] a work of the Lord to restore the gifts
[33:54] only to restore the gifts not the full
[33:56] word it was only a work of reformation
[33:58] it was part of the work of God and
[34:00] that's why the gifts were restored but
[34:02] but out of I don't know why I'm taking
[34:05] so long on this out of
[34:07] Azusa Street after just a few years we
[34:11] developed Pentecostal Traditions now why
[34:15] did that happen because every time God
[34:17] does a work of a work of the lord the
[34:20] devil jumps into that work and misleads
[34:23] the people from the real experience of
[34:26] Luther's day Wesley we heard it
[34:27] Wednesday night with brother rap at
[34:29] where I loved how he said how he worded
[34:31] his study I love being here with him I
[34:33] was so enjoyable I love the word I love
[34:35] sitting and being taught the word of God
[34:37] I love it brother Ralph I I was sitting
[34:39] there and I thought of the Glorious
[34:42] Reformation with a question mark was it
[34:44] So Glorious because the in the church
[34:46] age book and also in the in the Book of
[34:48] Revelations they didn't peg him So
[34:49] Glorious in that day and yet it was
[34:51] Luther day it was the start of the
[34:53] Reformation it was a great day right
[34:55] well some of the men took Luther's
[34:57] message begin to twist it up
[35:00] it become a denomination
[35:02] now every age does that including
[35:06] Pentecost
[35:08] so now we have Pentecostal traditions
[35:13] that we're calling many churches are
[35:15] calling it what happened in the upper
[35:17] room but how do you know that
[35:21] be careful you don't take an Azusa
[35:23] Street tradition or something that come
[35:25] from Isuzu Street and attach it and say
[35:28] we need to see this one Minister said we
[35:30] the young people need to see people
[35:32] doing this well listen now let's make
[35:36] sure that that's the original work of
[35:38] God changing a young person's life
[35:40] instead of pressuring them or bringing
[35:43] an atmosphere that you better do this or
[35:45] you don't really have the Holy Ghost
[35:48] is it okay to say that
[35:51] I'm very concerned because this message
[35:54] was not to take us back to Pentecostal
[35:57] traditions is to take us further not
[36:00] backwards
[36:01] there's no rapturing faith back in Azusa
[36:04] Street there's no rapturing faith back
[36:06] in the Traditions that came from Azusa
[36:08] Street
[36:10] actually the prophet said it was a
[36:12] different word that fell in the day of
[36:13] Pentecost and even today that was a
[36:15] different word
[36:16] they had a word they grabbed a hold of
[36:18] for that day and the Holy Ghost fell
[36:20] because the Holy Ghost was always tied
[36:21] for the word of your age they had a
[36:23] different word even for in the upper
[36:24] room that they got a hold of today is a
[36:26] different message a different word
[36:27] that's come and it's not to take us back
[36:29] to Pentecostal traditions so God may you
[36:32] help us Lord to separate original true
[36:35] dying out Pentecost repentance change of
[36:39] lives can you say Amen the supernatural
[36:41] all that was in the book of Acts bring
[36:43] it all back but Lord help us not to
[36:46] develop Pentecostal traditions
[36:49] because the message has come to call us
[36:51] out of them
[36:53] it's also called us out of world
[36:55] Traditions as well this is what the
[36:57] message in the last days was sent to do
[36:59] and so because you have Lutheran
[37:01] traditions in a western tradition you
[37:02] have Pentecostal traditions because when
[37:04] they leave the word and denominate then
[37:06] they get traditions because the devil
[37:08] always has to give somebody else
[37:09] something to do as a tradition to think
[37:12] that they're still in Christ instead of
[37:14] following the word for every age
[37:18] you can't denominate the word of God in
[37:20] the last days
[37:22] but people can certainly have
[37:24] denominational spirits
[37:27] that make movements within our ranks
[37:30] to make this camp in that camp in this
[37:34] camp and separate
[37:36] yeah it's happening
[37:39] it's happening because wherever God's
[37:41] working the devil is working can I get
[37:42] an amen
[37:44] and that's why when the devil fights us
[37:46] so hard here I said well praise the Lord
[37:48] God must be doing something I must be
[37:50] doing something right because the
[37:51] devil's fighting like crazy if you got
[37:53] in your life and the devil's fighting
[37:55] you then you ought to just look at the
[37:56] right way and say I must be doing
[37:58] something right because the devil don't
[37:59] like me
[38:03] wherever God is that's where the devil
[38:06] is wherever he's doing a work of God
[38:08] which is the message of this age he's
[38:10] right there he's got everybody else he
[38:13] wants to take this and make it a
[38:15] tradition because of what you wear
[38:16] you're okay and gonna make a Rapture I'm
[38:18] here to tell you it's not because of
[38:20] what you wear that gets you in a rapture
[38:22] we do that out of appreciation for God
[38:24] because he asks for the women to rest
[38:26] dress different and the men to dress
[38:28] different thank God the prophet said
[38:29] things and reminded us of the Bible
[38:31] about it because of this trans world we
[38:33] live in thank God the prophet reminded
[38:35] us of the word of God but we don't do
[38:37] that to gain Heaven sisters no it's not
[38:40] a dress code that we make it in a
[38:42] Rapture it's because the Holy Ghost is
[38:44] living on the inside and we're filled
[38:46] with the spirit
[38:48] you see how you can take the message and
[38:50] make it a tradition
[38:52] I'd say after 40 50 years whatever it's
[38:55] been now I'd say the devil's working to
[38:58] try to do that
[38:59] young people sitting around without the
[39:01] new birth older people raised up in the
[39:04] message and they don't have the new
[39:05] birth yet
[39:07] so I get all confused you know and you
[39:10] wonder what was their start in this
[39:11] because it just I'm questioning
[39:13] everything now I don't know I'm
[39:14] teeter-tottering well you better look at
[39:16] your whole experience because
[39:18] something that anchors down here it's
[39:21] sealed into the day of redemption and
[39:23] when those thoughts have come doubting
[39:25] this message to me which they do come
[39:27] they're quickly dismissed because the
[39:30] soul dismisses them
[39:37] wow I'm taking a lot of time the Feast
[39:39] of atonement
[39:40] I want to draw three elements out of it
[39:43] it's okay I got next Sunday to finish
[39:45] this
[39:46] and the next and the next
[39:51] praise the Lord God is good amen
[39:53] out of Pentecostal and World traditions
[39:57] I am so excited about what that says
[40:01] I'm excited about the word
[40:04] I'm so glad this is getting me off of
[40:07] baby shark doo doo doo doo baby
[40:12] this is wonderful
[40:14] that's what the message was said to do
[40:16] bring us out of Pentecostal and World
[40:18] Traditions two the genuine atonement the
[40:22] words so it's a feast
[40:24] to bring us back to the meaning and the
[40:27] power of what the atonement did for us
[40:29] what the atonement is so I draw three
[40:31] elements out of it if you want to read
[40:32] them in Leviticus 23 in Leviticus 23 you
[40:35] find all the the feasts there at the
[40:38] very if you read the atonement one
[40:40] you're going to find three elements out
[40:42] of the Feast of atonement
[40:44] repenting
[40:46] um
[40:46] they they were in
[40:49] I forget the word that's used or you can
[40:51] read it in Leviticus 23. their souls
[40:53] were smitten
[40:55] their souls were spitting
[40:57] they were repenting
[40:59] so it's repenting it's resting and it's
[41:02] rejoicing you'll find those three things
[41:04] in the Feast of atonement repenting
[41:07] because they realize what the atonement
[41:08] has done for them the Jews will repent
[41:10] because they killed their Messiah
[41:12] okay but the bride repents because you
[41:15] know be zealous therefore and repent
[41:17] Revelations 3 says if you're in the
[41:19] lateral cnh the you want to have Zeal
[41:22] how many want to have zeal
[41:24] brother Brian says in later see it Zeal
[41:26] is to repent and say we're wrong and
[41:28] he's right we're wrong
[41:31] I've been studying why people won't
[41:32] admit they're wrong
[41:34] so that's another sermon but
[41:36] the Zeal of this age is to say I'm wrong
[41:39] he's right I'm wrong people can't say
[41:42] they're wrong so repenting resting which
[41:45] means the Sabbath honor the Sabbath
[41:47] that's rest and this rejoicing so we
[41:50] will come we we will talk about afflict
[41:52] ourselves that's the word they Afflicted
[41:54] their souls in there in this time don't
[41:55] do any work and celebrate so the first
[41:57] thing that is mentioned is deflict our
[41:59] souls Souls that come this this this
[42:02] refers not to the inner man but to the
[42:05] body and actually the whole flesh of man
[42:07] then
[42:08] uh to afflict the souls in Hebrew uh it
[42:12] means to fast most Jews still do this on
[42:14] the day atonement Yom Kippur uh July
[42:17] 10th uh Kipper and kafir is Hebrew for
[42:21] atonement means cover to purge to
[42:23] reconcile
[42:24] atonement means reconcile today it means
[42:27] that one minute
[42:28] Oneness at one minute atonement at one
[42:31] minute making us in God one being in
[42:34] harmony with someone but it's deeper
[42:36] it's a humbling ourself it's a remorse
[42:39] it's a deep regret when it refers to
[42:41] afflicting your souls it's a deep regret
[42:44] for the wrongs committed the Jews will
[42:46] acknowledge that he was the source for
[42:48] their cleansing of their sin and they
[42:50] killed the source for the cleansing of
[42:51] the sin and I have rejected that source
[42:54] and I want to repent it's one thing to
[42:56] reject the Messiah it's another thing to
[42:58] realize that he was the true atonement
[42:59] for sin and the only way to being
[43:02] reconciled back to God when a person
[43:04] really sees this for the reality of what
[43:06] it is there's a Mourning in their heart
[43:09] a Brokenness a deep regret a real
[43:12] genuine repentance I would say if we're
[43:15] under the spiritual Feast of atonement
[43:17] it starts with true genuine repentance
[43:20] and Brokenness in our heart God forgive
[43:24] me
[43:25] let your blood cleanse me
[43:28] you should never lose true repentance
[43:30] I'd rather see a Revival when there's
[43:32] true sobereness and repentance than any
[43:35] healing Revival
[43:37] and I mean that respectfully
[43:39] but if you get all the healings God
[43:41] performing those things and no true
[43:43] repentance
[43:45] no Brokenness of the heart
[43:47] The Pride isn't broken
[43:49] then you haven't really had a Revival
[43:52] can I get an amen
[43:54] but when a person sees the reality that
[43:56] Brokenness comes a deep regret a real
[43:58] genuine repentance
[44:00] that that which is coming from a
[44:02] revelation it's not a dry-eyed I'm sorry
[44:05] it's a repentance repentance is not just
[44:08] words but a broken and a humble heart
[44:09] admitting that they have done wrong also
[44:12] repentance has fruits of change to it I
[44:14] may know that repentance as fruits of
[44:15] change
[44:17] Scholars have a tough time seeing this
[44:20] part because afflict your souls don't
[44:22] seem to go with rest in the Sabbath when
[44:24] we rest and afflict your souls that
[44:26] don't seem to go together and rejoicing
[44:28] in this those don't but you see I don't
[44:30] believe this morning under the Feast of
[44:32] atonement I don't believe this morning
[44:34] or this remorse listen now is to carry
[44:37] cause you to carry guilt the rest of
[44:40] your life
[44:41] that doesn't match Romans where Paul
[44:45] says in Romans in a Justified State he
[44:48] says there's there's therefore no
[44:51] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[44:53] Jesus so this morning or this Affliction
[44:56] under this Feast of atonement can't mean
[44:59] that you carry guilt the rest of your
[45:00] life for sin no there's no condemnation
[45:03] in Christ Jesus
[45:04] but I believe this morning and this this
[45:08] jolting this reality is that what God is
[45:11] somebody's died for me and it keeps it
[45:13] in our life didn't Paul say I Die daily
[45:17] because he's living a life that every
[45:19] day I live because he died for me and so
[45:23] now I want to die out to myself because
[45:25] I want to do that I don't want to do it
[45:26] yearly at Camp I don't want to do it
[45:28] every five years Paul said I Die daily
[45:32] give us this day our daily bread
[45:35] blessed be God that daily loaded us up
[45:38] with his benefits it's a daily thing
[45:40] serving the lord can I get an amen this
[45:42] is not every year at camp this is a
[45:44] daily thing this is not every Sunday in
[45:46] church this is a daily dying out to
[45:49] yourself
[45:52] I don't believe it's a condemnation
[45:54] under this Affliction of souls I believe
[45:56] it's a morning and it's a sensitivity to
[46:00] what our atonement has done
[46:02] I don't believe this morning where most
[46:03] is carry guilt sad faces the rest of
[46:05] your life sad faces on Christians until
[46:07] the Rapture we're just gonna barely make
[46:10] it in oh we're just so woe as me and
[46:14] this is the bride we're just gonna just
[46:16] barely large grab my hand please and
[46:20] pull me out of this
[46:24] that's sad
[46:26] that's really sad that's not the bride
[46:30] oh I just grabbed my hand I can't take
[46:33] this and just jerk me up in the rapture
[46:36] no there's a rapturing faith in the word
[46:38] of God and it keeps growing can you say
[46:41] Amen
[46:42] it says I'm ready to go humming's been
[46:44] saying that I'm ready to go
[46:45] I'm ready to go now
[46:48] keep building my faith I'm ready to go
[46:52] jump into that other dementia not drag
[46:55] me it's not when the saints come
[46:57] dragging you
[47:03] it's when the saints come marching in
[47:07] excited praise the Lord
[47:10] I'm having a good time today praise the
[47:12] Lord
[47:12] having more fun
[47:15] than a human being should be allowed to
[47:17] have
[47:18] so now not sad faces beat yourself up
[47:21] and do Penance the rest of your life for
[47:23] things you have done can't be that
[47:26] there's no condemnation but in this
[47:28] Affliction of souls as part of the
[47:30] atonement is true repentance and I
[47:33] believe a constant sober reverence and
[47:37] gratefulness for his grace
[47:41] see they've messed up Grace in the
[47:43] church world today
[47:44] they've messed it up
[47:46] to me Grace is bigger than just saying
[47:49] uh
[47:50] he forgave me of my sins Grace is when
[47:53] he keeps me from sin
[47:55] can you say Amen
[47:59] there's a soberness in humility
[48:00] maintained always in the heart of the
[48:02] believer for wrongs they've done for
[48:04] rejecting but not guilt all sin all
[48:06] guilt of sin all desire sin all
[48:08] condemnation is washed away with the
[48:10] believer and there's a Zeal to repent
[48:12] all the time why lest I should
[48:14] disrespect all that God has done for me
[48:18] by my pride it's an Affliction of
[48:21] yourself if you want to write down
[48:23] Zechariah 13 is when the Jews return and
[48:27] when they begin to recognize in their
[48:29] feast of atonement what they've done for
[48:31] days they'll go from house to house
[48:32] mourning and repenting Zechariah 13.
[48:37] if it has that effect on the Jews then
[48:39] what should this spiritual Feast have an
[48:41] effect on us
[48:42] I don't arrogantly say I'm in the
[48:44] message and I know all the quotes and
[48:46] I'm good because I went and did
[48:48] something nice to somebody this week all
[48:50] that's washed away
[48:52] I stand humbly grateful for the cross of
[48:55] Jesus Christ I need his atonement I need
[48:58] it for my sins and I need it every day
[49:00] to live
[49:08] but it's coming back to the fullness of
[49:09] what he died for you for your life and
[49:12] victory repenting resting and rejoicing
[49:15] is the Feast of atonement repenting
[49:17] resting what's the rest mean okay what's
[49:21] the rest mean what's the Sabbath mean it
[49:22] means arrest in other words you're not
[49:24] laboring to try to gain your way into
[49:26] heaven
[49:28] you're resting in the Holy Ghost the
[49:29] Holy Ghost is arrest
[49:31] you're resting in a finished work of
[49:32] Calvary so there's no labor in it but
[49:34] then he says celebrate he said rejoice
[49:37] in the day of atonement this is a
[49:39] celebration that's why when he took the
[49:41] book in Revelations 5 when he took of
[49:44] the book all creation heard John
[49:46] shouting hurt me he's seen his name
[49:48] there can you say amen he looked at
[49:50] those 12 elders and he's seen he was one
[49:53] of those 12 elders and he said I'm there
[49:55] I'm around the Throne of God I'm one of
[49:58] them he started to shout he said
[50:00] everything down in the Earth above
[50:01] everything in the sea heard him shouting
[50:03] he was saying amen a lot louder than you
[50:06] are this morning
[50:07] because he's excited this is a time of
[50:11] rejoicing when you know what the
[50:13] atonement has done for you you don't
[50:15] mind lifting your hands you don't mind
[50:17] shouting a little bit you don't mind
[50:19] being expressive
[50:24] this isn't a dead religion can you say
[50:26] Amen
[50:28] notice the connection to the real Quirk
[50:31] of Christ and I realize the time now so
[50:33] I'm I'm being mindful notice the
[50:34] connection to the real work of Christ
[50:35] what he did the feeling for it just like
[50:38] it happens for Generations who don't
[50:40] appreciate the lives given for a free
[50:42] country it's magnified and peace of
[50:44] people losing the feeling and sincerity
[50:46] for Christ the message the lamb that not
[50:49] only went to Calvary but broke the seals
[50:51] off 2000 years later for us there's a
[50:54] lack of feeling sometimes and sincerity
[50:56] for the work of Christ for our lives and
[50:59] so the prophet brings out this feeling
[51:00] of sacrifice even in the Old Testament
[51:03] something bled and died and he would go
[51:07] back even up to 1965 and refer to the
[51:11] way that the people brought the bulls
[51:13] and goats and I'm going to read it so he
[51:15] can that it can be said the way he said
[51:17] it but he says it's true with the Old
[51:19] Testament and it's true also with the
[51:21] New Testament our sacrifice that our
[51:24] Lord made can never become so detached
[51:28] from us from the feeling of it it can
[51:30] never become common to us
[51:36] I fear in the message sometimes we've
[51:39] complicated things way too much
[51:42] and several messages the prophet drops
[51:44] in this hint of the concern for losing
[51:48] the feeling of this death
[51:50] one place these Praises oh dear dying
[51:53] lamb dear dying lamb what a term to use
[51:55] dying loud because he said the word
[51:57] bleeds for you that's why it's a
[51:59] Perpetual benefit coming through the
[52:02] word as he's washing Us by the bleeding
[52:04] word that's come to us can you say Amen
[52:06] what floated Calvary is still flowing to
[52:09] his people through the bleeding word
[52:12] something that's alive something that's
[52:14] bleeding it's dying but it's something
[52:16] that's alive
[52:20] the word is alive today
[52:22] and if you'll receive it it's bleeding
[52:24] for you it bled for you two thousand
[52:26] years ago but the benefits of the blood
[52:28] can come to you this morning
[52:30] I fear in the message we have
[52:32] complicated things so much and he lays
[52:34] this in he has the concern this becomes
[52:36] powerless because God hates a powerless
[52:38] religion we complicate things we narrow
[52:41] things down to just teaching and and
[52:43] dazzling everyone so many things can be
[52:46] said but I don't want to be negative but
[52:48] dazzling everyone with how much
[52:49] revelation we know and how much the
[52:51] message has brought us and how deep the
[52:53] preacher can be and it becomes about
[52:55] everything else and about the pride of
[52:57] it and the guile what's in the people
[52:58] sometimes the Simplicity is lost the
[53:01] sincerity is lost can you say amen and
[53:03] it becomes just a dress code
[53:05] but it must be something real
[53:08] the Christ of this message must be real
[53:10] to you every day
[53:12] and not live in some fictitious world
[53:16] we're called to live in God's world
[53:19] God's reality can you say Amen I'm
[53:21] preaching sometimes and there are people
[53:23] look at me like I'm from a different
[53:24] planet well I am from a different planet
[53:28] I'm not called to hear this world is not
[53:31] my home can you say Amen
[53:34] they even said Men Are from Mars and
[53:36] women from Venus and all that different
[53:38] planets trying to explain the
[53:39] differences in men and women I don't
[53:41] know about all that but I know I'm I'm
[53:43] not from Earth
[53:46] and by the way
[53:48] I was in Long Island last week two weeks
[53:51] ago
[53:52] and uh
[53:55] I got weight on a scale we went to the
[53:58] aviation museum there it's a nice place
[53:59] I got weighed on a lunar scale
[54:03] brother Stephen
[54:07] and all I could say is I'm going if you
[54:10] ask me I'm going with my lunar weight
[54:13] 50 pounds
[54:16] and I don't have to tell you I just it's
[54:18] looter wait unless you ask
[54:21] that's it I loved it
[54:23] what a skill
[54:26] honey on the moon I weigh 50 pounds
[54:33] all right let's get in this quote and
[54:34] then we'll close
[54:36] so in the old days when God accepted
[54:39] this substitute how the Jew used to come
[54:41] down the road with his slick Bullock and
[54:44] he'd say you know I'm a sinner Jehovah
[54:47] requires me to offer blood so he goes
[54:49] and gets his lamb or his bollock he
[54:51] takes it down to the high priest down to
[54:53] the temple and he lays his hands upon
[54:56] his sacrifice what does that do that
[54:59] identifies the worshiper with his
[55:03] sacrifice
[55:04] this is not a detached thing
[55:07] this is not something we're not
[55:08] connected to he does it for us he dies
[55:11] for us but we're not disconnected from
[55:13] it
[55:16] not got some distant Christianity
[55:19] God is watching us from a distant Bette
[55:22] Midler
[55:24] God is watching us God is watching us
[55:28] number one song here I'm aging myself
[55:31] here God is watching us
[55:35] I'm a distance
[55:37] and it's so warm
[55:38] and to have a god that's just watching
[55:40] and if we get into trouble he'll step in
[55:42] for us that's the god that they want
[55:46] just watch us from a distance we don't
[55:48] want you in our home we don't want you
[55:50] in our soul we don't want you in our
[55:52] everyday life we like you from a
[55:54] distance
[55:56] that's religion that's idolatry
[56:00] because the idolater has no connection
[56:02] with the god he's worshiping
[56:04] he can't connect with that with that
[56:05] Scott you can connect with and become
[56:08] one with
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:12] and he lays his hand upon the second
[56:13] what does he do that that identifies the
[56:15] worshiper with his sacrifice and the
[56:18] priest comes and kills the boa and
[56:20] catches the blood and sprinkles it upon
[56:22] and this worshiper sincerely knowing
[56:25] this Jew that that's what Jehovah
[56:28] required of him the man went home with a
[56:31] good feeling
[56:33] feeling the quiver and shaking of that
[56:36] lamb I'm not so sure here but other
[56:38] places it refers to the priest laying
[56:40] his hands on it maybe the worshiper
[56:42] laying his hands on I'm not so sure
[56:43] about that but he still feels it the man
[56:45] went home with a good feeling feeling
[56:46] the quiver and shaking of that land the
[56:49] blood spraying all over his hands and so
[56:51] forth and see that little fella kicking
[56:53] and dying as his throat was cut
[56:57] it's not some distant relationship he
[57:00] sees what's happening
[57:02] that that something is dying for him
[57:07] he feels that he's connected with it can
[57:09] you say amen that's in the Old Testament
[57:12] look what happens now
[57:15] and he knowed he ought to be that one
[57:18] he looked at his sacrifice he thought he
[57:21] knowed he should be that one dying he
[57:23] looked at his sacrifice he identified
[57:24] himself by laying his hand upon it I
[57:26] should be that one and then when they
[57:28] cut its throat it's dying and bleeding
[57:30] and going on and the little fellow
[57:32] quiver and quieting down and the
[57:34] worshipers stand there and say oh
[57:36] Jehovah you've accepted that instead of
[57:39] me I'm ashamed of myself
[57:44] and the man went home Justified because
[57:46] he had done exactly what Jehovah
[57:48] required that was fine but by and by it
[57:52] became a family tradition
[57:57] now he takes this sacrifice say well
[58:00] let's see now oh yes it's getting to be
[58:03] a new moon Feast I guess I better it's a
[58:06] cleanse in the Tabernacle it's a feast
[58:08] of Pentecost they tended three times a
[58:11] year and they used to do it with
[58:12] excitement they used to do it with
[58:14] fervor he used to come to church with a
[58:16] smile on their face
[58:18] now it's become a tradition they don't
[58:20] come with a smile anymore
[58:22] they come because it's a duty a clock in
[58:25] my time
[58:27] losing the sincerity losing the feeling
[58:29] the passion of it
[58:31] by might became a family Tradition now
[58:33] he takes a sacrifice say well let's see
[58:35] oh it's getting to be new moon Feast I
[58:37] guess I better it's a cleanse in the
[58:39] Tabernacle it's a feast of Pentecost I
[58:41] guess I better go down and offer me a
[58:44] lamb
[58:45] go on down there and kill it with no
[58:48] feelings at all but go on back with the
[58:51] same idea he had coming in there and
[58:54] then what did he do Jehovah said here in
[58:58] Isaiah speaking a little later on he
[59:00] said your solemn feast
[59:03] are become a stink in my nose
[59:07] now before Calvary God had to accept
[59:10] that is the as the sacrifice for their
[59:14] sin
[59:15] but after a while why didn't he accept
[59:17] it like we read in Hebrews 10 he says
[59:19] the sacrifices now because the Covenant
[59:21] had changed but even back then it's
[59:23] become a stink in my nostrils
[59:26] it's become a stink to me in Isaiah 66
[59:30] it says
[59:32] the heaven is my throne and the Earth is
[59:34] my footstool where is the place you will
[59:36] build me God said to this man will I
[59:39] look
[59:40] to him that it's poor humble and of a
[59:43] contrite spirit and that trembleth at my
[59:46] word that's what I'm looking for and
[59:48] then he goes into the sacrifices your
[59:50] sacrifices become a stench in my
[59:51] nostrils it's as if you offered swine's
[59:53] blood it has no meaning it has no
[59:55] feeling to it if you really want to know
[59:57] what I'm looking for in all this I'm
[59:59] looking for humility I'm looking for a
[1:00:02] Brokenness and keep a Brokenness about
[1:00:05] what you're doing
[1:00:07] when you lose that you lose a lot
[1:00:12] we must come not like a bunch of rickies
[1:00:14] and rickettas we must come not like a
[1:00:16] bunch of formal and so forth that they
[1:00:18] have today of these traditional
[1:00:19] religions we have Pentecostals let's
[1:00:22] come with a deep sincerity lay our hands
[1:00:24] upon the sacrifice Yonder at Calvary and
[1:00:27] feel the bleeding and suffering of Jesus
[1:00:31] Christ as we identify ourselves that we
[1:00:33] are dead to the things of the world and
[1:00:36] this modern ideas of the day
[1:00:40] were as Sodom and Gomorrah and were
[1:00:43] living there this is 1963. here we are
[1:00:46] in 2028 I would you say we're in Sodom
[1:00:48] and Gomorrah yeah whereas Sodom and
[1:00:51] gomor and we're living in that let the
[1:00:53] righteous spirit in US these sins Vex
[1:00:56] are so daily let the sins of this world
[1:00:59] and the Fashions of Hollywood and all
[1:01:02] this Hollywood evangelism and nonsense
[1:01:05] all this makeup and beat the music and
[1:01:08] jump up and down the Music Stops down
[1:01:11] you go
[1:01:12] when a man is washed in the blood of the
[1:01:15] Lamb he don't need music or nothing else
[1:01:17] the power of God just works upon him and
[1:01:21] he can Shout Scream praise God and do
[1:01:24] anything else whether there's music or
[1:01:26] not the Holy Ghost is in him and he's
[1:01:29] identified with Jesus Christ
[1:01:34] but today we just want to we have to
[1:01:36] jump around a little bit as Pentecostals
[1:01:39] because our fourth fathers did it it's
[1:01:41] the only reason they're doing it says
[1:01:42] their forefathers did it become a
[1:01:44] tradition
[1:01:45] there's no connection with what the
[1:01:46] blood has done for you
[1:01:48] I tell you that's when somebody's really
[1:01:50] shouting and dancing you'll enjoy
[1:01:52] that's when it's real the blood has
[1:01:54] struck somebody and they realize the
[1:01:56] revelation of what God did for me
[1:01:59] and I thought it was supposed to be when
[1:02:00] that Revelation come then the after
[1:02:02] effect is stimulation of Revelation
[1:02:05] we don't push the stimulation first
[1:02:09] we just preach Revelation and let the
[1:02:11] stimulation worry about itself
[1:02:15] and if I see somebody sit and weep and
[1:02:17] cry and Brokenness that's fine with you
[1:02:19] somebody's going to shout you're gonna
[1:02:20] it's not going to scare me dance all
[1:02:22] over whatever but it's a reaction it's a
[1:02:25] reaction to True Revelation Brokenness
[1:02:28] in your heart true Revelation that's
[1:02:30] what we do we don't promote the
[1:02:32] stimulation first we don't hand out the
[1:02:36] wine first
[1:02:42] it's the wine and the oil
[1:02:45] it's the true Holy Spirit
[1:02:47] You Preach Revelation just preach the
[1:02:49] word Brothers if you're listening
[1:02:51] pastors Brothers young ministers
[1:02:54] just preach this message in power
[1:02:57] and let the stimulation take care of
[1:02:59] itself
[1:03:01] don't legislate it don't work it up
[1:03:04] just preach this message
[1:03:08] let God do the work
[1:03:15] they had something to jump around about
[1:03:16] then this Holy Spirit making them jump
[1:03:19] and when they come back now down always
[1:03:22] live as high as you jump if you don't
[1:03:24] don't jump at all we come down today
[1:03:27] we come down today and live all kinds of
[1:03:30] lives we come down from jumping and
[1:03:31] shouting and live all kinds of life no
[1:03:33] no something's not right
[1:03:35] we bring a reflection upon the very
[1:03:36] thing that we're standing for
[1:03:41] okay this is okay
[1:03:44] okay yeah I didn't expect to do this one
[1:03:47] but this is what when you've been
[1:03:49] pardoned
[1:03:50] this isn't just okay I accept the pardon
[1:03:52] the Lord's pardon me of my sin you're
[1:03:54] released from guilt is what you wish to
[1:03:57] place this on apart from God as a
[1:03:58] release from guilt not the Turning Away
[1:04:00] by psychological doctrine of some sort
[1:04:02] that might in some way give you a little
[1:04:04] feeling that you've done what's right by
[1:04:06] joining Church taking up a Creed but
[1:04:08] it's a release from your guilt by the
[1:04:10] power of Calvary something has released
[1:04:12] you there's no more guilt
[1:04:15] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:04:17] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:04:19] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:04:21] now a man when he's released from sin a
[1:04:23] man or a woman there's no more desire in
[1:04:25] their heart to walk after the things of
[1:04:26] the world he is freely pardoned and
[1:04:29] becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:04:32] and his affections are set on the things
[1:04:34] that are above where Christ sets at the
[1:04:37] right hand of God he's freely released
[1:04:40] pardon isn't just saying I accept the
[1:04:43] pardon it's a release from guilt it's a
[1:04:45] release from sin it's a power to live
[1:04:48] can you say Amen praise be to God and
[1:04:52] I'm early today it's only twenty to one
[1:04:54] I'll go ahead and take the next one
[1:04:58] but it pleased God to Smite him and he
[1:05:01] was smitten stricken Afflicted he bore
[1:05:04] our transgressions was bruised for our
[1:05:07] iniquities and by his stripes we are
[1:05:11] healed we were healed oh it should be
[1:05:14] attractive to people
[1:05:17] no I think it's a Believer who
[1:05:19] recognizes that that's attractive to
[1:05:21] them that's not attractive to the world
[1:05:22] smitten stricken Afflicted he bore our
[1:05:26] transgressions but it should be
[1:05:27] attracted is that attractive to you
[1:05:29] today
[1:05:32] are you looking for some Modern Church
[1:05:34] they're just
[1:05:35] pat patty on the shoulder and say you're
[1:05:38] doing pretty good
[1:05:40] there's plenty of them out there
[1:05:42] plenty of them out there
[1:05:44] but if this is attractive to you coming
[1:05:47] through the bleeding word being preached
[1:05:49] it's what our Lord has done for us it
[1:05:51] should be attractive to be what really
[1:05:52] should it should stir the heart but you
[1:05:54] know what's the matter we've took out
[1:05:55] the Wednesday night prayer meeting and
[1:05:56] put in a television program that keeps
[1:05:58] all the people in her team
[1:06:02] and where the heart is the treasure is
[1:06:04] there's your heart also and what makes
[1:06:05] people want to go to the things of the
[1:06:07] world you know the reason you do that
[1:06:09] the reason people does that What Makes a
[1:06:11] Man want to get drunk what makes people
[1:06:12] want to act the way they do the world
[1:06:14] what would a person stay home on
[1:06:15] Wednesday night from a prayer meeting to
[1:06:17] watch a certain television program
[1:06:19] what would they do that for is because
[1:06:20] there's something in them that desires
[1:06:22] to be satisfied they want there's a
[1:06:24] little place in a man's heart or woman's
[1:06:26] heart and God made that place for
[1:06:27] himself and dare you try to take the
[1:06:30] things of the world and put it in there
[1:06:31] where God made for himself to set there
[1:06:33] God is our joy God is our pleasure God
[1:06:37] is our satisfaction
[1:06:39] oh Lord Jesus let me let you know this
[1:06:42] morning I may not be perfect but through
[1:06:44] the blood I am and that's my desire
[1:06:46] right there that he's my satisfaction
[1:06:48] he's my pleasure I don't care what's
[1:06:51] being said on social media he is my
[1:06:54] pleasure he's my satisfaction
[1:06:58] that's where it belongs in here let God
[1:07:01] in and then the other things are so dead
[1:07:04] you don't even care about nothing about
[1:07:07] them no more praise the Lord I think
[1:07:10] those said it well amen Senator let's
[1:07:14] Stand Together God bless you friends we
[1:07:16] have a sacrifice and a pardon that has
[1:07:19] been done for us somebody died for you
