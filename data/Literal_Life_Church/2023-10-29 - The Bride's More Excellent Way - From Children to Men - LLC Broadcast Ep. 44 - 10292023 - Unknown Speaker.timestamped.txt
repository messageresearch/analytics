[5:03] through this is my prayer
[5:07] now this is my prayer for
[5:17] you for
[5:19] [Music]
[5:28] you
[5:31] 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that which
[5:33] is perfect is come then that which is in
[5:37] part shall be done away when I was a
[5:39] child I spake as a child I understood as
[5:43] a child I thought as a child but when I
[5:46] became a man I put away childish things
[5:49] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[5:52] but then face to face now I know in part
[5:55] but then shall I know even as also I am
[5:58] known and now abideth faith hope charity
[6:02] these three but the greatest of these is
[6:06] Charity think of a Christian only
[6:08] talking to God when they need
[6:10] something think of a Christian only
[6:13] coming to God when there's an
[6:15] emergency that's a a childishness that's
[6:19] that's an emotional walk with God
[6:21] running to the Lord when there's an
[6:23] emergency in life running to God but see
[6:26] God wants fellowship and love from us
[6:29] even when there's not an emergency going
[6:31] on he wants relationship with you he
[6:33] wants Fellowship something that's an
[6:35] everyday love relationship with him not
[6:38] something that's I'm running back to you
[6:40] God I'm sorry I've been away from you so
[6:42] long I'm sorry but you see now now I
[6:44] need to get back with you because I got
[6:45] an emergency in my life somewhere the
[6:48] church has got to grow out of those
[6:49] immaturities that there's a consistent
[6:52] love for God no matter what's happening
[6:54] in our
[6:56] lives consider a Christian that says
[6:58] Lord I Need You Now it's emergency bail
[7:00] me out of this God bail me out living
[7:02] off of temporal blessings of God think
[7:04] about always living in the rush of a
[7:06] prophecy over your life that was from
[7:08] God how many's had a prophecy over your
[7:10] life and it come from God you knew it
[7:12] come from God I've had that and I
[7:14] appreciate those things but I can't live
[7:16] expecting just on a prophecy to live by
[7:19] I have to have a consistent love of God
[7:21] and passion for him if I never get
[7:23] another prophecy over my life if God
[7:25] never does another miracle for me if God
[7:28] never heals s the sick again I am here
[7:31] for the duration I stand and I want to
[7:34] let God know and I want to let the devil
[7:37] know this fellow is not moving from his
[7:39] stance in the word of God that's
[7:42] immaturity that's this love working no
[7:44] matter ups and downs blessing God
[7:46] blesses me God doesn't bless me doesn't
[7:48] matter that doesn't change it I'm right
[7:50] here ready to serve him and love him
[7:52] think about a Christian Living off the
[7:53] rush of a prophecy over your life or the
[7:56] pre or a healing that's come as I said
[7:58] you could receive healing a miracle from
[8:00] God you can receive but you might get
[8:02] sick again and need another healing see
[8:04] it's temporal listen we need that
[8:05] atonement that healing we will always
[8:08] need that and it's so powerful we
[8:09] appreciate those things or we love it
[8:11] when the presence of the Lord sweeps
[8:13] down and baptizes Us in his presence
[8:16] it's glorious isn't
[8:18] it but it's
[8:20] temporal here it's
[8:22] temporal and we can't just live on
[8:25] temporal things with our walk with God
[8:27] and that his love does not change when
[8:29] he doesn't we need to live that his love
[8:31] does not change when he doesn't answer
[8:33] like we thought he should answer it
[8:35] don't change if our healing doesn't come
[8:38] in a miracle form his love doesn't
[8:40] change that if I ever was able to be in
[8:42] another feeling the strong love of God
[8:45] keeps me no matter what I love Laura
[8:48] Story song She Wrote a few years ago I
[8:50] can't remember what year it was the
[8:52] lyrics says and this is the one that
[8:54] says says we pray for blessings we pray
[8:57] for peace and comfort for our family we
[9:00] pray for protection while we sleep we
[9:03] pray for healing for Prosperity we pray
[9:05] for your Mighty hand to ease our
[9:07] suffering and all the while you hear
[9:09] each spoken need yet love is way too
[9:12] much to give us lesser things cuz if
[9:14] you're and and the then the course says
[9:16] what if your blessings comes through
[9:18] raindrops what if your healing comes
[9:20] through tears what if a thousand
[9:23] sleepless nights are what it takes to
[9:25] know you're near and what if the trials
[9:27] of this life are your Mercies in
[9:32] Disguise Joseph even before Calvary
[9:35] Joseph was able to look at life this way
[9:38] at the end when he was completely
[9:40] mistreated by his brothers he had every
[9:42] right to be bitter and write them off
[9:44] and at the end of it he he he connected
[9:47] to the predestinated plan of God somehow
[9:51] and bitterness was gone and the past was
[9:53] gone and he was able to look at his
[9:55] brothers and say listen what you did God
[9:59] intended it you intended it for evil but
[10:01] God has done that for my
[10:05] good what an eternal
[10:08] perspective what a theophonic what a
[10:11] what a a deeper perspective that most of
[10:14] us live temporary affected by temporary
[10:17] things but he tapped into something else
[10:19] here to say listen what you meant an
[10:20] evil God's turned it around it's meant
[10:22] for good that was supposed to happen in
[10:24] my life that was I've been fighting it
[10:26] saying God why did you let that happen
[10:28] in my life but now that was supposed to
[10:31] happen because I wouldn't be here
[10:34] today somebody listening to me this
[10:37] morning my story is my story I can't
[10:40] change my story but I know some things I
[10:42] wouldn't be here today loving God this
[10:45] way unless my story would have been
[10:47] written the way that it was I won't get
[10:50] angry in the midst of my trials I don't
[10:52] conduct myself like a little child in
[10:54] hard times that doesn't get what he
[10:56] wants and Stomps his feet how many you
[10:58] ever seen little Little Johnny in the
[10:59] store stomp his feet cuz he's not
[11:01] getting what he wants we can see that in
[11:03] children but spiritual children
[11:05] spiritual children can live that
[11:09] way I don't come conduct myself like a
[11:12] child in hard times I don't get temporal
[11:14] temporal with my love for him I don't
[11:15] live on highs and then show a lack of
[11:17] passion for him when I'm in a low his
[11:20] love does not change and does not fail I
[11:22] want to give some faithfulness back to
[11:24] him I don't fade in and fade out with my
[11:27] love back towards the towards him can
[11:29] you say Amen Lord when I was a child and
[11:31] this is why Paul brings it up when I was
[11:33] a child I spake like a child I acted
[11:35] like a child I thought like a child but
[11:38] when I became a man I put away childish
[11:42] things he's typing the childhood
[11:44] naturally with our spiritual walk and
[11:46] he's telling the Corinthians you're
[11:48] childish and how you're doing things
[11:50] you're depending on a prophecy but
[11:52] listen your love has to be tapped into
[11:54] the love of God to love me back and it's
[11:57] consistent it doesn't fade in and fade
[11:59] out with trials can you say Amen Lord
[12:01] when I I was a child I acted that way in
[12:03] my attitude but now I'm becoming a man
[12:06] put away this dependence on feeling
[12:08] temporal things put away childish things
[12:10] this is what Paul said here when I was a
[12:12] child I spake as a child you know the
[12:14] Corinthians were Christians with the
[12:16] Holy Ghost how many believe that the
[12:18] church that Paul wrote to in the book of
[12:20] Corinthians were a people that had the
[12:22] Holy
[12:23] Ghost yes they were but they were babies
[12:27] spiritually
[12:30] why why were they babies because they
[12:33] spoke and they understood and they
[12:36] thought in spiritually childish
[12:40] ways what were
[12:42] they I had this uh typed in years ago
[12:46] when I went through the whole book of
[12:47] Corinthians and I listed all the carnal
[12:49] babyhood of the Corinthian Church I
[12:51] couldn't find it so I went through and
[12:52] found them again last night here's the
[12:55] Corinthian Church outside of their
[12:57] services
[13:02] yeah don't look at me funny like
[13:05] that if you had attended a Corinthian
[13:07] Church service my goodness you say this
[13:10] is the most spiritual people on the face
[13:11] of the
[13:12] Earth remember when I read these what's
[13:15] happening in the Corinthian Church when
[13:16] I read it's all from my King James
[13:19] Version
[13:21] Bible said there's division among you
[13:23] there's contentions among you there's
[13:25] playing favorite
[13:27] preachers
[13:29] you say Amen if you've read this in the
[13:30] book of Corinthians he called them
[13:32] carnal babes I have to feed you with
[13:35] milk among you is envying Strife
[13:38] carnality you walk as men he said you
[13:40] are puffed up fornication is reported
[13:43] among you a man sleeping with his
[13:45] stepmom even worse a man sleeping with
[13:48] his stepmom coming to church taking
[13:50] communion even worse the church the
[13:53] Corinthian Church was covering it up not
[13:55] talking about it not dealing with it too
[13:57] scared to call out the
[14:00] sin I wonder if it was pressure from the
[14:03] family don't talk about the problems in
[14:04] my
[14:06] family they were going to court with one
[14:09] another cuz when the church should have
[14:11] handled it themselves because the church
[14:13] didn't deal with things maybe they had
[14:15] to go to court and that's what I feel
[14:17] sometimes is that the church should be
[14:19] able to deal with issues outside of
[14:20] worldly courts but sometimes when the
[14:22] church doesn't deal with it properly
[14:24] then sometimes you have to go to court
[14:26] but you see now the church should be
[14:27] dealing they were going to court with
[14:29] one another and Paul said you shouldn't
[14:30] have to do that you should be mature
[14:32] enough to handle matters amongst
[14:33] yourself but you're not mature
[14:36] enough praise the Lord he had to remind
[14:40] and teach the women that they shouldn't
[14:42] cut their hair and he had to remind the
[14:45] men that it's a shame for a man to have
[14:48] long hair it's a shame for a man to have
[14:51] long hair I don't know why he had to
[14:54] remind that generation of it I don't
[14:55] know I could go back into the history
[14:57] I've studied it have you i' go back to
[14:59] the history and say because the church
[15:00] world has written off that scripture and
[15:02] says that does not that's not relevant
[15:04] today let me say publicly you don't have
[15:06] a right to pick and choose what you want
[15:08] out of this Bible and say that belonged
[15:10] in this era that belonged to that if
[15:11] there's scriptural truth that's
[15:13] generational that's Timeless generation
[15:15] nobody no denomination no man no great
[15:18] preacher has a right to interpret those
[15:20] scriptures leave it alone leave it the
[15:22] way it is and for some reason Paul had
[15:25] to talk about hair that a woman's long
[15:29] hair is her
[15:30] glory it's in the
[15:33] Bible and that it's a shame for a man to
[15:37] have long hair women leave their hair
[15:39] long and uncut men cut their hair and
[15:42] then he says there's heresies among you
[15:44] you're getting they're get they were
[15:45] getting drunk at the communion
[15:49] table this Bible letting an unknown
[15:51] tongue manifest without anyone to
[15:53] interpret it Paul had to correct that
[15:55] you know want unbelievers coming in and
[15:57] think that you're mad and it was all a
[15:59] bunch of unknown tongues no
[16:00] interpretation Paul said you can't do
[16:01] that when you speak when you sing a song
[16:04] when there's a prophecy let there be an
[16:05] interpretation because we must be a
[16:07] people of understanding the unbeliever
[16:09] should understand what's going
[16:12] on sing with understanding speak with
[16:15] understanding it's not just about a a
[16:17] bunch of unknown stuff and everybody
[16:18] says oh it's such a spiritual thing
[16:20] going on but nobody understands what's
[16:22] being said from God God is not the
[16:24] author of confusion he wants everybody
[16:26] to understand what he said everyone has
[16:29] a song everyone has a tongue when they
[16:31] come together and then he says you're
[16:33] being unequally yolked together some
[16:35] must have been unequally Yol with
[16:36] unbelievers unequally yolk with it
[16:38] doesn't mean marriage you're forming a
[16:40] too close of a union with an unbeliever
[16:42] how can you fellowship with that how can
[16:44] you form such a close Union with an
[16:45] unbeliever uh it's he said uh that we we
[16:49] shouldn't do that you're unequally
[16:51] yolked when you give your offering he
[16:53] says when you give your offering don't
[16:55] give
[16:57] grudgingly give with a cheerful
[17:01] heart this is the Corinthian Church I'm
[17:03] not preaching at you this morning I'm
[17:04] preaching at the Corinthian Church not
[17:06] you Corinthian Church none of you ever
[17:09] do things like
[17:11] this
[17:14] so he says at the end of Corinthians
[17:16] examine yourself whether you're even in
[17:18] the faith he says I'm using sharpness
[17:22] with you that's the word I'm being sharp
[17:23] with you but I love you and I'm going to
[17:25] tell you the truth if you would have
[17:27] been in a servant in the Corinthians you
[17:29] might not have seen all this carnality a
[17:31] lot of good things were going on in the
[17:35] services but there's some childishness
[17:37] going on behind the scenes it's very
[17:39] quiet now and understand
[17:42] that people say we're a book of Acts
[17:44] Church we're book of Acts Church there's
[17:46] some environments but it looks like the
[17:47] book of Acts Church on the outward but
[17:51] where's the discernment to expose sin in
[17:53] the camp that's a book of Acts church
[17:56] too where's the discernment to to expose
[17:59] Brothers Bound by pornography and incest
[18:01] going on and rape going on and ananas
[18:04] and Sav were corrected for for lying to
[18:06] the Holy Ghost if you're a book of Acts
[18:08] Church where's all the other attributes
[18:10] of the book of Acts church so grow up
[18:13] and act like men and women of God where
[18:15] God knows where you stand not up and
[18:17] down doubting all the time and Satan and
[18:20] and and live so God knows where you
[18:22] stand every day there's no question
[18:23] about it how many would raise your hand
[18:25] and say I want to know and God wants go
[18:28] I want God to sense my spirit my soul my
[18:30] attitude I want God to sense he knows
[18:33] exactly where I stand 24/7 there's no
[18:36] question about it my mind is disciplined
[18:39] God knows where I stand but even better
[18:42] Satan knows where I stand I want the
[18:44] devil to know 24/7 where I stand and if
[18:48] I have to vocalize it I'm going to say
[18:50] it so he knows I love to preach about
[18:53] Hannah because Hannah uh her husband had
[18:56] two wives and and the one wife started
[18:59] to have a bunch of babies and Hannah
[19:01] couldn't have a child and the worst
[19:03] thing is it's bad for a woman not to be
[19:05] able to have one and got she loves that
[19:07] but she couldn't have it and so now you
[19:09] look at L you know all through the years
[19:11] she becomes bitter she had an adversary
[19:13] she had a tormental Tormentor so Hannah
[19:16] started to get bitter about God not
[19:17] answering her
[19:19] prayer uh to have a child and then she
[19:22] looks over and and she sees the other
[19:25] wife I can't remember her name and she's
[19:26] having babies and then she gets
[19:29] complexes you know the other wife is
[19:30] having and she's prospering and God
[19:33] you're hearing her prayer and not my
[19:36] prayer there's all this mental stuff
[19:38] going on they must be favored of you I'm
[19:41] not I'm I'm unworthy and and as this
[19:44] this grows it grows in a bad attitude
[19:47] towards God now it's one thing to not
[19:50] understand what God's doing it's another
[19:52] thing to have a bad attitude about it
[19:54] come on say amen and bitterness develops
[19:57] and and and things develop and what what
[20:00] was just a simple hurt by somebody years
[20:02] ago people can hold that Grudge for
[20:04] countless
[20:05] years ask God to help you get over it
[20:08] don't let it Tain your whole
[20:10] life let the forgiveness and blood of
[20:12] Jesus just wash it away from you but you
[20:15] see now she had this she be developed
[20:17] that and then then the Tormentor come it
[20:20] says the Tor she had a Tormentor that
[20:21] tormented she was in depression she was
[20:23] low but every year her and Alena her
[20:26] husband that was her husband's name
[20:27] brother Alena every year they went to
[20:28] the temple to worship God every year
[20:30] they went and they wanted to worship and
[20:32] so every year she went with the same
[20:34] prayer Lord I I don't understand why
[20:37] you're not giving me a child but she
[20:38] started to go towards her towards more
[20:40] bitterness towards it and her attitude
[20:42] and torment her she was depressed all
[20:43] the time and so now when you look at the
[20:45] promise and predestinated plan of God
[20:48] there was a predestinated plan of God
[20:50] for Hannah to have a
[20:52] baby she just didn't know it but her
[20:55] baby would be a special baby that's
[20:58] right amen she was not to produce just
[21:01] what the other wife was just a baby she
[21:04] was to Pro produce a
[21:06] Prophet this bride is not to produce
[21:09] another denominational thing we are
[21:12] meant to produce Christ coming out of
[21:14] us Mary didn't just have another baby
[21:17] she brought forth Christ don't look at
[21:19] everybody else don't even look at
[21:21] everybody else in the
[21:23] congregation what is God wanting to do
[21:25] in your
[21:27] life and I can tell you Hannah didn't
[21:30] know that she was not supposed to bring
[21:32] just another baby she was praying for a
[21:34] baby but it wasn't just there was a
[21:36] predestinated plan of God for her life
[21:38] and that's why God was just holding up
[21:40] everything but who was really holding up
[21:42] the promise I can tell you with from my
[21:45] study it wasn't just God holding up it
[21:48] was Hannah's attitude holding it
[21:51] up some of you heard me preach on this
[21:53] before and I'm going to keep preaching
[21:55] because I love this little story it's a
[21:56] type of the bride of Christ you're not
[21:58] called to be a denomination you're not
[21:59] called to be other churches you're not
[22:01] called you don't compare yourself with
[22:03] the other wife there's a foolish virgin
[22:05] don't compare yourself don't borrow can
[22:08] you say
[22:09] Amen praise the
[22:11] Lord so every year she came and I always
[22:15] say that Hannah probably sang the same
[22:18] special every
[22:20] year can sister Hannah sing a special
[22:23] and after so many years people just
[22:24] under their breath saying does she have
[22:26] to sing another special cuz she sings
[22:28] the same one every
[22:31] year and she's she's depressed she pours
[22:36] a wet blanket over that whole service
[22:38] every time she gets up for her special
[22:40] but every year it's the same one and she
[22:42] gets up Hannah comes up and everybody
[22:43] said do we have to hear Hannah sing
[22:45] again okay just let her sing and and the
[22:48] the priest Eli said can we have sister
[22:50] Hannah come up and sing her special
[22:52] please don't please don't have her sing
[22:54] there's other singers please don't get
[22:55] hand she gets up every year and she's
[22:57] got the same s song wo is
[23:01] me wo is
[23:04] [Music]
[23:06] me wo is
[23:10] me whoo is
[23:15] me I am
[23:18] sad because the Lord won't give me a
[23:21] [Music]
[23:23] bab whoo is
[23:26] me
[23:30] whoo is
[23:33] me every year it's the same thing every
[23:36] year she takes her depression home with
[23:38] her she takes everything and what was
[23:40] needed is for Hannah to tap into the
[23:43] mind of God because in the mind of God
[23:45] she was going to have a baby but it was
[23:48] her attitude about it and her depression
[23:51] about it and her prayer was tainted with
[23:54] her now her anger towards God why can't
[23:57] I have a baby I ask you and look at this
[23:59] woman prospering over here she even said
[24:01] to her husband I just and you know
[24:03] living with a wife like this every day
[24:06] must have been hard on brother
[24:09] Elena she's in constant
[24:13] depression and it's like honey please
[24:16] pull yourself out of this please this is
[24:18] terrible and she says you favor her more
[24:21] than me God favors her she's having okay
[24:23] I can't have a baby for you they just
[24:25] going on he said he said hone listen I
[24:28] love you with a double blessing I love
[24:30] you double more than her I love you
[24:33] anyway and you're you're better than a
[24:36] thousand Sons so just just love me you
[24:40] know what am I chop
[24:43] liver you're good but I want a
[24:48] son and then one year she comes she
[24:52] comes to church with a different prayer
[24:55] she Taps into the predestinated plan of
[24:57] God amen and her prayer now was aligned
[25:01] with the predestinated plan of God and
[25:04] she comes in that year different and she
[25:07] comes in and she raises her hand to
[25:09] almighty God and she said Lord I have
[25:11] prayed for years for a baby but I want
[25:14] to bring this prayer to you if you will
[25:16] bless me with a baby I will have that
[25:18] baby I will wean that baby and I'll give
[25:21] that baby completely back to you to the
[25:24] service of the Lord for the rest of its
[25:26] life that was a different prayer that
[25:28] was a humble prayer that was a
[25:30] sacrificial pray prayer see her prayer
[25:32] before was really
[25:35] selfish I want it for myself but when
[25:38] unselfishness came in her prayer that
[25:40] she was thinking of others instead of
[25:42] herself her attitude changed that here
[25:45] and she said God if you give it to me
[25:48] and and the thing is the Bible says she
[25:49] began to just get into the flow and the
[25:51] spirit of God so much that she looked
[25:53] drunken from the whole congregation and
[25:55] Eli the priest said what have you done
[25:58] have you been drinking what is going on
[26:00] what's the matter with you and she got a
[26:02] little tiff at him says I'm not a a
[26:04] child of B I'm not an m i don't drink
[26:07] and get myself drunk I'm drunk in the
[26:09] spirit of God I have released this
[26:12] thing read your Bible she got on the
[26:15] priest for saying that to her I'm not
[26:17] drunk with wine I'm not drunk I'm drunk
[26:19] in the spirit because I've release
[26:21] something to God I released a bad
[26:24] attitude towards God I got rid of my
[26:26] anger right now I got right of my
[26:28] bitterness and I'm releasing this to God
[26:30] and she's running around shouting and
[26:32] Eli saidwell why don't you sing a
[26:34] special and everybody goes no no please
