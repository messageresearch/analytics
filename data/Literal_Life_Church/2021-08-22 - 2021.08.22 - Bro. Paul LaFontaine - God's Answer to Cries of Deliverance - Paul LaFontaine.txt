========================================

like this lord and with no pretense or no preconceived ideas or we just want to let you have your way and we pray you'll open up the word to us today and lord i pray that if there's a need for encouragement that you'll give encouragement if there's a need for healing in the body i pray that you will administer healing to the body i pray if there's a need in the spirit a spirit has been damaged someone's emotions have been damaged i pray that you'll be their friend and heal them today in their emotions i pray that your word will go forth and as it says here as we the people begin to cry lord we our christ go before you and you you hear the cries of the people we're thankful for that lord the deepest cry can be heard by your ears this morning and you have the answer for that cry we thank you father and we commit the service to you now in jesus name amen once you shake hands with somebody and say god bless you before you're seated this morning of all the places that god throughout the bible has come down or has spoken to the people or has moved spoken through a prophet he spoke through many prophets god did many mighty things and we have read those for many years now as i don't know how long you've owned your bible but you can read through the bible and see that god moved in situations he spoke in situations but out of all of those things there are three major moves of god or i'm going to call them three exoduses that happen in the bible times and in our day three exoduses and in those these were what we would call three major exoduses or exodus means deliverance there were three major ones in the bible and exodus means a coming out exodus means a deliverance exodus means that the people are caught in something and there's no way that they can get themselves out it's a major deliverance needed and only god showing up himself can bring deliverance to the people and he did that and and our prophet separated this into three major is the first one i've read the text this morning and the first one was a physical exodus out of pharaoh's bondage in egypt it was a fig physical exodus and that's where we have the first exodus the second exodus was a spiritual exodus out of bondage of the law into grace that second exodus was the time of jesus where god came down through jesus and he was going to deliver a people that was in bondage to the law and bring them to the the to grace can you say amen and that was the second exodus and that's huge because a a spiritual exodus is greater than a physical exodus matter of fact if you have a physical need this morning if you have a fix physical deliverance that you need i can tell you that god could deliver you physically and but but the greatest exodus and deliverance would he deliver you spiritually from the bondage spiritually that's the greatest deliverance and when he went to calvary and rose the third day it was an exodus for the people of god out of law unto grace can you say amen and then when we come to the third exodus which actually is on our day the third exodus i would say had both spiritual and physical deliverance because he not only delivers us spiritually out of the bondage of this satan's eden and of religious education and of the education of the world and a crumbling the crumbling world systems that we're living in the middle of now and also delivering us from the complete insanity and perversion in the world that we live in this final third exodus is a spiritual deliverance can you say man but thank god it's also a physical deliverance out of this inner rapture to a millennium someday this exodus i want to be a part of can you say amen this exodus is an important one just like the first one was the important one the second one was an important one but this one is both a spiritual and a physical deliverance out of the conditions that we're in to freedom we're living in the third exodus and if incidentally every exodus god did his order for it was the same way he ordered things this is going to be my answer this is going to be my deliverance this is how i'm going to do it and he didn't change his order in each one of the exoduses it's the same pattern if you want to look to see the way he will do it today you look back in the time of moses and he's going to do it exactly the same way that god doesn't change his ways and in three exoduses he's definitely going to do it the same way as he did it before but think about what i said this exodus is out of the bondage of satan's eden of religious education and creeds and dogmas and denominations and things that have twisted up god that's the deliverance we need and it's also a physical exodus out of the bondage of this satan's eden this crumbling world of systems that are falling apart and the complete insanity of the world and perversion of this world there will be no answer for this getting out of this perversion except god's answer it'll be his exodus it'll be his deliverance if we ever get out of this it'll be because god provided a way to get out and how arrogant man is to think that he can come up with those own answers how arrogant is our governments and our presidents and our our senators and all of them trying their best to find an answers to the problems around the world and won't look to the word of god that what god did back in egypt he's going to do the same thing again our deliverance will come through the word of god starting through a prophet can you say amen and there will be a voice that goes out and that voice will be our answer to get out of this world praise the lord now in each of these exoduses there was quite a few years that went without a visitation from god at least in the form of a major visitation where he came down himself in a major way it was 400 years that they were in bondage excuse me a little bit of coffin sickness and yesterday yesterday i woke up and uh something real strange happened to me there as i was waking up a couple of um the room was spinning and such and i think it's just from the sinus issue and uh so i just you know have been feeling better ever since and i just been rebuking that thing and i've come i'm here this morning to give the devil a black eye i'm going to preach amen so now it was 400 years 400 years that the people of israel were in bondage in egypt so there's a period of time even though god heard the cries there was a period of time where he finally moved in on the situation incidentally and i never knew this but it was about 400 years about the same time from the last prophet in the old testament malachi to the time of the second exodus of jesus coming it was about 400 years it actually as we if we place that in the church ages around the same time that it took now from the time of the dark ages of the churches back in in thyatira and those church ages before and next sunday brother uh i think it's next sunday where brother rap continues to study on the church ages in the class at 10 30 here if you want to try to be here early wonderful study on the church ages that he's doing he'll start that again next sunday morning but we find that it was actually from the dark ages to 1963 from the dark ages stopping and the reformation beginning that was actually a time of about 400 years as well so we see even in the years it's a pattern that god's people come into a real dark time of bondage real dark situation and after so many years god stepped in and began to move on the scene and said i have heard the cries of my people and i am come down to deliver them he's still that god this morning friends he's still that god this morning but the trouble we get is how god is going to do it and we have to be submissive and look at god doesn't change his ways he does it in the same way the world keeps ignoring that god's gonna deliver his people the same way he did before and here he comes at the end now the end time and in all those years of 400 years things begin to mount up things begin to climax and things begin to get to a certain point in so many ways there's so much bondage that the people are under and i personally believe today it's not physical bondage we're not physically bound by anything it's spiritual bound bondage it's emotional bondage it's mental bondage it's a mental battle today can i get some more amens it's more of a mental battle than someone being in jail now overseas our brother from laos he's in jail that doesn't happen a lot here it's coming someday but he's in jail for preaching the gospel but i find in america and in these lands we're not going to jail being in bondage from the government yet but we are under a spiritual warfare that is bringing even sometimes christians under a bondage in their mind a bondage in their spirit and they are underneath things that they have never our children our young people are underneath spirits and bondage and emotional things that they've never been under before and can't even make heads or tails of why it's happening or what's going on they can't figure it out can you say a match and it is it is in other words when someone comes to that state there they begin to cry for an answer and look for an answer because but but it's so dark that they begin to believe there's not an answer for this i will always be this way i might as well just finish it off or whatever they the the spirits start to talk to them and say i there's no answer for this there's no answer so i i don't know what to do we've tried everything there's no answer for this but in israel's bondage in egypt god had an answer god had an answer to the cries of their heart god had the answer for the bondage they were feeling don't you ever lose hope that god has an answer for you we serve a god of deliverance we serve a god who has the answer we serve a god that no matter what kind of bondage it is god has the answer this morning god wants to deliver you god wants to hear and address and respond to your cries why are we even here preaching if we didn't believe god is still the same way why do we have this building why do i preach why why do we give these efforts why do because we believe there's the god of moses is still alive today the god of william branham is still alive today the god of paul can you say amen is still alive and we need more we need deliverance this morning more even than the children of israel we not only need this deliverance from think temporal things here but we need to get out of here i don't know if anybody's feeling the same thing but when i read this scripture friday night when he read it i could i have been feeling lately i have been feeling deeply just deeply moved by the state that this world is in i'm losing friends through covet i'm using we're losing warriors of the faith if this doesn't affect us may god may you just say lord make me broken so this will affect me if you're just cold towards this listen friends things are happening things are changing in this world and the only reason that maybe you're not moved yet is it hasn't come to your front door yet but where we're at now with afghanistan with with so many other situations taking place and the changes that's going on it won't be long where it's going to come to our door and affect us in whatever way it does but we will be affected and if you're a believer it will increase the cry of your heart that lord send us deliverance that it gets to the end of the book of revelations and he says i will come quickly and john responds who's the type of the bride says even so come quickly lord jesus come quickly lord jesus the only reason that you wouldn't feel that deep cry is maybe you're too bound to your possessions and life is still too convenient and you're just still having you have inconveniences sometimes that frustrate you but there's no cry yet well now i'm not preaching just nominal christians here i'm preaching to believers yet is there a deep cry in your heart lord deliver us or is life too comfortable see you're just inconvenienced when the covet thing came along when the the the atmosphere changes we're still pretty good economically in this nation but all that may change so you're just inconvenienced and so you may not have reached out to god but there's times coming will increase the cry of the heart where we have nothing else to depend on for our families except god may lord may the lord just use and anoint our words this morning and so the bondage climaxed to a certain point and god's people were living in the middle of all that going on in egypt and when it climaxed then them god's people were living in the middle of it and god's people began to cry out for deliverance because god had promised them but you see many years for many years they held the promise but there was no cry see i believe that it's not just that we believe the promise that we will be delivered i believe it's not just that we believe there will be a rapture but i believe there'll be a cry increase in our hearts because it's when the cries increased that's when god said i'm hearing i'm hearing and now i'm come down to deliver oh come quickly lord jesus so that's the question this morning and maybe a convicting question for every one of us i had to examine my myself how i've been preaching on lord moved me with compassion for the lost because of the times but lord how increased is my cry how comfortable am i in am i here and how high is my cry lord you maybe have some things that you're going to allow down the road to increase the cries but i say lord do it to me now increase the cries in my heart lord let me cry for the right things you know people cry about and i was talking about jonah he was crying over the crazy plant that was dying and his priorities were all messed up you remember i preached on that god don't help me cry over some plant that's dying but lord let me cry over souls that will be lost my family members can you say amen we cry over the wrong things sometimes but may god direct us that we're really crying out for his not just his promise but to see his promise manifested in our lives i hope message people are listening because we i believe that god has blessed us with the promises we hold the promises can you say amen we hold the promise of the rapture we hold the promise of these things they're not just stories in the bible they're not just something that lays there but there's something more to us but it can't be just a promise the cry has to rise in her heart lord come quickly amen how many would admit that we've had enough things in your life happened the last five years that has increased your cry praise the lord it's funny to say praise the lord to that but it could end up a very good thing in the end he said i never dreamed this would happen i never dreamed this was going to happen in my life and i didn't plan things that that happened this way and lord why me and and all these other things and why have you forsaken me and and all these other things but could it be could it be that it was to increase your desire and your hunger and your cry for the lord to be closer to him could it be to increase the cry to bring the promise of the rapture to past could it be god's allowed these things and increases all this bondage increases that we cry out for deliverance praise the lord so notice the words that are the people are under and i want you to notice these things and in egypt there was bondage under pharaoh and the bondage created and here's the words that were in the bible you just read groaning affliction sorrows oppression and cries that's all the words and god mentions all of them god named all of them to show you he knew that there was oppression going on he named them all bondage the cries of your heart oppression your sufferings he's letting you know i know what they are and i see you going through that i'm naming them aren't you glad to know and our brother said it the other day aren't you glad you know god's got it covered god knows all these things that are going on god knows your depression god knows your oppression god knows you're suffering god knows what you go there god knows your questions because the israelites had questions where's my god where's god in all this after all these years i've been doing this but where's god at they had questions in their heart and god said i know about all of these things i know about your suffering and i am come down to address these things in other words i want you if you don't get nothing else today when god came on the scene and did what he did through the prophet and then later on as they begin to come into the deliverance and leave egypt god i want i want you to know god god's answer was the answer to all of these sufferings the bondage the cries the suffering the oppression the mental battles god said i've got it covered i've got a deliverance in mind for you aren't you glad there isn't anything that i'm not aware of and also don't run to everyone else for the answer i have the answer and if i don't get time to get into it today i'll just tell you it was in that voice it was in that voice and some people think it was the voice of moses no moses it was only his vocal cords that god was using but it was a much greater voice there than moses it was the voice of the lord that from that point come into the land and then god said i'll even give the people signs because some of them are going to doubt whether this prophet is true or not i'll give them vindication i'll send the pillar fire over them and it'll have its picture taken i'll have them bleeding by a pillar fire i'll show them i'll come in a bill of fires or i'm with my prophet i'm not with all the other ones i'm with moses i'll give him vindication i'll give him two signs a sign he'll put his hand in his bosom it'll be leprosy puts it back i'll throw his staff down i'll give you signs but listen the sign has only convinced you of vindication it's not the sign that will deliver you it's the voice in the sign my voice is in the land my voice i'm here not the voice of moses the voice of god in moses and if you obey and follow that voice it is the answer glory be to god it is the answer for your deliverance you see people can't tie it together because they got their oppression they've got their problem they got their suffering but he's tying together his visitation and his voice he's tying it together for your deliverance from all those things questions for the paul that i don't understand it's been 20 years and i still understand why this happened in this church 20 years ago i don't understand how that preacher acted this way i don't understand why my family has treated me this way i don't understand what's going on in this marriage whatever it is i i can't make hesitation but god does not want you to stay there bound by that thing hear his voice trust his voice his voice is in the land and if you think that the voice was just in the prophet of the today and that's it then your voice is gone wasn't the voice of william branham the voice of god that's come in the land i'm i'm a vocal cord for his voice in this service this morning and when his voice is in the land it is our deliverance it's your deliverance from anything religious bondage pride suffering depression it's not in me but he's got something here that is the answer now remember it took a while for the deliverance to take place right so we can't be impatient we got to know that he's got the answer for us here but it took a while for it to manifest can you say man the first day that god says that there you read around the story and he actually told moses and the elders he said when you go to pharaoh first time he's not going to listen to you he's not going to give in just by you saying it that's why he gave the signs and then there was 10 plagues as soon as the voice of the lord spoke judgment fell on egypt as soon as moses began to speak i like what the brother said brother timothy friday night i could preach on this boy but he did such excellent job as soon as the voice was spoken pharaoh's days was numbered can you say man didn't that and then what he said brother jim as soon as the voice went out pharaoh and egypt's days were numbered it was as good as done but it took a while to happen but because the voice was there judgment came on the whole egyptian thing judgment came on pharaoh you let my people go that's it you're going to let them go and so now he knew there would have to be plagues so he began to send plagues on the earth even while the children of israel were sitting in bondage in egypt they sat and watched and there was a preacher here the other day i don't know who mentioned it i can't remember we've had a few in but i thought it was awesome he said the preacher said israel watched all the plagues and none of it affected them they watched as the frogs came they watched in goshen they were safe right so they watched and they're watching on the news they're watching fox news hopefully or newsmax and they're watching all these plagues fall around them and all this happening in the world and they're and it's not affecting them but this brother said the other night i can't remember if it's brother rich or windsor who was but he said all nine plagues didn't affect them but the tenth one came to their home oh i wish i had an hour to preach about it the tenth one the death angel was not only going to the egyptians but visiting the jews homes and every firstborn would die in other words i want you to listen now there is a plague deeper than just the plagues of covid and all these other things that are going on there there's a plague of spiritual death and it's not good enough to kill people spiritual out there it's coming for your teenager it's coming for your firstborn it's coming to invade your home just like sodom knocking on the door to come in lots home this spirit this plague they could not be exempt from it was going to attack and come for to bring spiritual death in that home you know why i can talk about this so freely because i experience this almost every day the attack of the enemy to try to attack my family relationship with my family my relationship with the lord to get into my home and to bring spiritual death instead of revival i fight against it all the time i get low kind of lollied or leg back into some kind of thing and i have to stand up and say wait a minute satan has taken over for some religion but this isn't a religion this is the mighty god i want to have a revival in my soul every day i want to pray when there needs to be praying i want to be on my knees i want to pray with my children if they're sick i want to pray if they need the holy ghost can you say mine and if i don't do that this this death in the land is not just to the egyptians it's trying to come in our homes as well but god gave brother brahma says there was three things in this exodus same today he gave a prophet he vindicated that prophet with a pillar of fire and then he sent a token we have the same thing under this third accident we have we have had the same thing and they put that red blood from the sacrifice bring the lamb into your house bring the lamb into your own house it was no longer at the church the synagogue had to be brought in your home the token the presence of the lord the holy ghost whatever you want to call it you have to bring it into your life it has to become a life and it was put on the home on the doorpost of the home so that when the death angel came let the death angel pass were safe at last so when the voice of the lord spoke then all of these things begin to happen in egypt but god was addressing the sorrows the oppression and the cries of the people and the answer would be in the voice can you say amen i skipped some of this i believe we're in a place in the world in the state of the world right now we're at a tipping point and i believe that the state that we're in it will not go back to a normal state and some of the things that are happening around the world it won't go back to a normal state as much as we want it to the things that are happening right now are the type of things that will bring greater pressures and then soon hit our doors and be affecting us i wish i wish if i was a prophet this morning i could be specific about how that will all play out but i wouldn't dare try to interpret it but we have enough holy ghost discernment to know when these situations get in these places then the next step is not to go back to a normal state it'll be an increased pressure and come to our door as well because if i can articulate it might shake some of you up more to have a greater cry in your heart for more of god i would love that but i'm not going to mechanically do it i'm going to ask you to trust the holy spirit this morning that you would in this service by saying god let me not be tied to this world in any way increase my cry for our deliverance and so when he mentioned the word cry and we read it in the scripture here i you know crying is more than weeping i believe when he says i heard the cries of the people it wasn't just there was tears people can cry sometimes in tears and it's fine but when i speak of the word cry it's something deeper that's in the heart it's something that rises up that's an inner craving it's an inner burden and i've been feeling this and not even able to articulate it and it's just something that that's crying out within us it may not even be a verbal cry but it's something within us that's a that's a an earnest cry in our hearts for something i remember my when i lived in slovenia there was a neighbor boy i told you the testimony and he's a just a little uh child there that had went over to the neighbor's pool and drowned in the neighbor's pool and uh the grandmother lived there and and and so they were friends of ours and so i remember sitting in my living room and i heard some commotion next door and they already had the emergency out and they were trying to revive the boy but one of the things that got my attention to get up and go over and see what was going on was this blood curdling cry from a man you know usually it's the women that do more of the screaming and crying which but but this was a man and and he was this cry got my attention it was a cry and it started just just it was deeper than just a verbal cry there was something yearning in that man's soul and this was the boy's father and he was over he wasn't even near the boy and when i walked over they asked me to come and pray and and the the the father was over there he was in the neighbor's yard he was way further away but you could hear us cry all over the neighborhood he was wailing before god and crying for mercy from god and the boy they were they were working on him the emergency and trying it i just standed off and prayed because the neighbor lady asked me to do it and they worked on work kept going and he was just but it was just something i'll never forget so that wasn't just a verbal thing there was something in here come to find out later he had already lost a son in an accident and this was the new son and here this boy is laying here nobody knows how long he was in that pool this was a different cry i tell you friends may god put in us a deeper cry not just weeping because we feel bad for what we've done but a a more dispensational looking at the times we're living and look in our position saying god this is too big for me i'm crying for you to give me the deliverance that i need you see people can try to help you from your problems you can help you can try to help somebody and people can try to help you on your problems but really it comes down to you when you get a cry in your heart that you want to change that you want deliverance you have to say lord i need you everybody's trying to help me but there has to be a cry within you to get help please lord help me and when you begin to cry in your heart and cry out to him from the depths i really need help lord that's when god responds to you and he has the answer and the boy was revived they didn't know how long he how long he was there and they took him in i think honey if he was in the hospital a couple weeks that boy is completely normal today not one not one ounce of brain damage nothing is completely normal god healed him completely [Applause] praise god [Applause] the doctor said he was a miracle that he was living he was normal again i give glory to god but i wanted to point out there was something in that man's heart that god heard that was a daddy and it wasn't just feeling bad it wasn't just a bad feeling it was a cry and when our cries get that earnest for god god's going to move god's going to step in is anybody with me here this morning amen so now we utter both verbal christ and enter christ sometimes as israel did no doubt israel was in the bed and there was a lot of verbal crying out to god but it climax and in this satan's eden the combination of religious confusion and the hollywood filth and messing with the minds of the people and all the filth that our young people have had to look at you don't think it messes with the mind it messes with the mind the filth that's in the world brings bondage to a mind to a mind pornography and filth of hollywood's movies in slaves of mind and they are bound by it but god was saying i know of your bondage i know of where the state that you're in and i have an answer for you anyone with the holy ghost is going to be grieving deeply inside over the condition this world is in but let it be known god knew and heard the christ god knew every detail of it can you say amen and i'd say the difference in this exodus and that one is he has come down in the flesh and can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows what it's like because now in this exodus he was here 2000 years ago he came down in a body and the bible says he was tempted in every point as we are now the children of israel were crying out to a god that didn't had never experienced bondage before and so god still delivered them but now in this exodus when you cry out to god about a particular thing god has actually been here in a body and experienced what it's like to have a headache he's experienced what it's like to be tempted by a woman the bible said he was tempted in all points as we are so that he could be a faithful high priest to us and as i was saying to the young people the other night so that when we go to prayer it's not this strange thing that god looks back and say i'm sorry i i've never heard this one before i'm sorry i have never experienced that so i don't know really how it feels you're not talking to a god like that when you go to him about something now because he's been to earth and experienced these things brother bram says he was a baby he does why didn't jesus why didn't god send jesus and he come and come through jesus and go directly from that right to the cross because that's what he came for right he came to be the sacrifice right why didn't he why did he go through all the stages of life because when you go to pray today he's been through it and he knows he was a baby he was a toddler he went through the twozies jesus come on brother paul he might have the terrible twos which my granddaughter is getting way too close to that point you laugh but he was a human being and he went through all the stages and brother bram says he was a teenager so that he can understand what a teenager went through and how a teenager thought and how they process things in their mind and sometimes in their immaturity how they're trying to figure things out and he went through peer pressure and he went through trying to understand these things and in in the identity crisis and all of that you don't think jesus had it sometimes you know his mom's telling him this story and you know he's he and one day he's looking in the mirror and he's trying to figure out who he is and he looks in the mirror like teenagers do for long periods of time jesus is looking in the mirror and he's he's looking at his features and he's you know saying he looks over at his dad and he don't look anything like his dad joseph he looks over at mary and he says you know what i don't look anything like mary either and he's kind of going through an identity crisis like who am i where am i really from comes to his mom mary says well i'll tell you the story again goes to church that sunday the priest starts to read the bible in isaiah and as he reads every sunday jesus finally gets his true identity and i'm not the son i'm not the son of mary and joseph i'm the son of god i found my identity in the word of god he comes through those later teens comes through that didn't start his ministry to his 30 years old but why did he live through that so that when you pray when you pray it's not a god who doesn't understand he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he can feel it himself i'm really glad that i can go to a god like that but he has something greater than just staying with the feelings of it he feels the feeling of it but he has the answer he has the deliverance and it may not come for a while but for for the children of israel uh it was on its way as soon as moses started to speak it pharaoh's days were numbered as soon as he began to speak that voice all the wheels were in motion and i personally believe today that that when god sent this prophet in the last days in this third exodus although he's finished his work when god set that in motion the same way he did in the book of exodus and i want you people listening whoever it is listening whether you're in a denomination whether you're in an independent church you you watch the systems and you can't help but admit those systems are failing even in the independent churches because why there's something unraveling people can't get back to the absolute of the word of god and if you can't admit that we need a third exodus we need to get out of here but don't forget god started it through a prophet and i'm going to be very bold to you to say you cannot interpret the word and say he's going to do it something different today we're all going to find and get our deliverance by just coming back to the bible no god has an order god has a pattern and he did it the same way he did it in the first accident he done it in a third he's doing it in the third exit it's the same way can you say amen god doesn't change his pattern and you don't have a right to misinterpret it and make it some other thing for the last days he said and i can give you 5 10 15 scriptures maybe more it shows you there will be a ministry come to launch that restoration to bring us into a rapture it's in the bible don't you dare take that out and ignore and say i don't need a prophet don't you dare do it the scripture says too much about it and if there's an exodus god comes down he says i am come down to deliver my people but i'm sending you with a voice and in that voice he will continue his work he hears the cries of his people he hears their prayers but there's a period of time and then he finally finally steps in i'm not going to be long here i'll finish this up in another service finally god comes and begins to move there comes a point when god moves in and he moves in a big way and he heard them even when they didn't think he was hearing it's kind of like daniel when he went to prayer and fasting for 21 days he didn't hear anything no answer from the lord for 21 days and then when the angel finally makes it to get to daniel he says to him i heard you i heard you when you first gave the first utterance out of your mouth i heard your prayer and i headed towards you but the prince of persia held me up i had to fight against demons to get to you but i want to let you know the first time you uttered that cry of your heart i heard you right then see we have to look at it according to the bible because we have cries we have things we request from god we have things and answers we're looking for can you say amen but we have to realize god heard you the first time that you said it so now we wait on the lord to do it his way we wait on the lord to bring his answer his way you know what we do as americans we're going to google it and figure out the answer ourselves that's the way the whole world does it i can figure this out it's like one guy who did a tile job for us said have you ever done this before he says well i can just google it you can learn anything today on youtube we were going and the job ended up kind of turning out that way too everybody's got answers today everybody can go and find all the answers and i just think i'm not against i'm just i think we should be careful of looking for answers everywhere else when the voice of god is in the land and god says it sends his answer you may have to wait a while but you want to take his answer for your problems over your concoctions can i get a greater amen than that you'll want god's answer because that'll be the best answer i need to move i need to do this i need to change careers i need this if a million questions what do i do next i got to make a decision this that and some some decisions have to come up quick unfortunately i don't like those kind of decisions that we don't have time to pray but as as much as you can take the time to pray and say god what is your will in this situation don't be in a hurry about anything some things you're considering some business adventures or whatever it is under this climate of this time in this economic world you better pray and make sure that's the will of god or you could get yourself into a lot of trouble we have a god to go to we have a god of deliverance we have a god who has the answers can you say amen his people were caught in conditions in those conditions and they knew but they knew they were called to something better do you know today that you might be caught in the conditions of this world a little bit but you know you're called to something better the children of israel had to know that my god's going to deliver me someday and i'm called to something better than this bondage i'm not called to be in the middle of this bondage i'm not called to stay here my whole life can you say amen you have a promise the egyptians didn't have that the jews had a promise you need to know that we're sitting in these conditions in the world but you know what i'm not called to stay here the whole time i'm not called for tribulation if you want to stay for tribulation go right ahead but i'm not called to stay here for tribulation i'm not called to be underneath these plagues of tribulation i've got a promise can you say but i've got to deliver that's going to come and get me and hopefully soon the sooner the better the sooner the better every time a leader would change in israel i brought this up at the beginning of the service just give me a couple more minutes here every time a new leader changed the pharaoh they were hoping the leadership would have the answer but it only got worse under biden i mean pharaoh the bible says in the the bible says in the process of time things increased they thought there's a new pharaoh in they thought this will release the bondage but it actually their size went up more and their cries went up more so the the the the leadership changing actually increased the cries of their heart for deliverance i say so be it let it be let it be in the process of time things increase and when they crea increase their cries increase the pressure deepen their cries and that's a good thing because when the cries deepen god moves in when it's more sincere i'd like to say for some people they're feeling an inconvenience sometimes but no cry yet oh somebody say praise the lord amen it's like the song says talking about a man he's not ready he's not he's not on his knees yet he's too strong to be weak he might be coming to church but if there's no brokenness and no breaking of that pride he's not ready yet for god's deliverance because he's not on his knees yet there's no cry of the heart yet he may have been inconvenienced but no cry yet with some people even as message believers it's not a cry yet for deliverance they still have it too easy there's no revival there's no brokenness to get up closer to get up close to god you miss a lot of church because of no real good reason there's not a deep enough cry there yet i love you but i'm gonna tell you the truth if there was a deeper cry you'd make your priorities right this isn't about church attendance nobody's keeping track of church attendance this isn't some denomination that keeps track of that this is based on a hunger and a cry of god and in these times that we're living on what is the priority i need more of god i need the fellowship of god i need the presence of god i need to be around god's people i need to be around this person i need to hear the word of god my children need to hear it my family needs to hear it we need more of the word not less of the word we need more of the cry of god not less of it i need my cry to increase not less my wife woke up this morning she says i don't know i can't wait to get to church she said i don't know how people survive without it in these times i have to get someplace and hear the word of god it's based not upon church i can guarantee you she's not here because she's the pastor's wife even though if she missed a lot you'd probably say well the pastor's wife ought to be here but i know her heart i know her cry she's not here because she's paula fontaine's wife she was going to church way before she met paula fontaine she was on the front row of happy valley way before she met me and she was a singer before she met paula fontaine too people don't know that great singer before she even met me but she was had the cry in her heart by the holy ghost way before she was a pastor's wife she'd be here i'm not trying to build her up there's many but listen pray that the cry of god would increase in your heart god's cries in your heart you can't wait till the doors are open see you made it in your mind that this is something about some type of church attendance record how your daddy and your mommy taught you or something they might have done that but i'm here i'm the new kid on the block and i'm here to tell you this has nothing to do with church attendance nobody's looking at keeping records here nobody this has to do with hunger this has to do with a cry you think the jews missed synagogue in egypt if they missed it was because the government made them stop beating egypt made them stop meeting maybe covet hit they couldn't meet anymore i tell you i'm going to be here when the doors are open until they close the doors when they close the doors and we're not able to then we won't but i want to take this might be my last sunday i'm going to be here until they shut the doors because i'm going to need it i have something down here crying for more i think when it becomes more serious upon the heart of a person you know i was watching the young people the other night so many sincere hearts coming to the altar and i welcome you this morning to speak to the lord come and we'll pray with you but you watch a meeting like that and you know there are sometimes people that get in the flesh it's not sincere they get in the flesh and they're just caught up in the emotion of the camp i know that happens but let's let's not criticize that because in that group there's some sincerity there's a cry of the heart god i need deliverance you see young people can get around that and sometimes they get caught up in the emotion of it and a lot of times they get in the flesh and they're not really getting anything depth of god they're just caught up in the emotion i understand that that's fine but what i was praying is that those are really there's some people that really need help there's some young people in there that i know that need a real filling of the holy ghost with the problems they have in life and when their cries go deep because i was watching and there was one boy there one of our own and i went to pray because i seen first time i seen brokenness weeping crying out to god just quietly just quietly but just something that was much deeper than just the just the shouting or some type of jumping there was something happening for one of our boys the crying went deeper never seen that yet but the but god touched him through the ministry and the cry i need more of god god needs that cry in your heart watch another boy he's getting married next week he's from brother ray's church and getting married you know you think he'd be sitting with his girl and his fiance and thinking about the wedding he's at the altar and there's just there's tears coming down and snot coming out of his nose had to get him a kleenex it's a week before his wedding he's getting married god's blessed them with a lovely wife but i say praise the lord that a man's at the altar like that broken such joy setting before his life and yet god i need you my cries i need you in this marriage i want to be a good leader i want to lead my home correctly when you see depth like that and it's not surface just shallow bubble dances you say that's what we need to see always this may not be a loud service this morning but the holy spirit is here this morning speaking to your heart all you need to do is just respond say lord this is what i need this morning i need my cry to deepen within my heart can we stand together when his voice began pharaoh's days were ended and when his voice began there was deliverance was as good as in the bag it was coming can you say man our deliverance is coming because of the voice of god being in the land and there was a there's a scripture there i don't know if i read it when they i did read it he says when they he says when they begin to hearken unto your voice i want to break down that word arkan because hearken it means to heark it doesn't mean just to to hear something it means to listen it means to step in and it gives attention to it when when they begin to give attention to this voice it will be their deliverance when they stop being distracted when they stop distrusting the prophet when they stop distrusting people and they'll hark and say listen this morning you don't have to necessarily trust me but if the voice of the lord speaking to you i would trust that voice no matter what you've been through i would trust that voice and say god you have a voice of god in the land and it is our only deliverance out of this mess that we're in political systems are crumbling government systems are crumbling nations are crumbling earthquakes are in the land everything jesus said can you say amen earthquakes in divers places men's hearts failing for fear everywhere fear of what fear of covet fear of the plagues fear of new diseases they said there could be up to four thousand variants to this coven did we solve the problem i asked you to listen listen listen do what you have to do but listen don't live by the fear that's in the land put your trust in the lord take all the precautions you feel personally responsible for but you better put your trust in the lord because there's no end to this thing we may be doing this forever 4 000 variants 4 000 different things that breaks off and the politics would love that to keep it going sorry about that i don't want to get political but they're going to use it as much as they can truth is we have a national pandemic right and jesus said jesus said all these things will begin to take place it should really make us convicted in our heart lord i'm crying out to you really need you lord you do it in your own way this morning but as they play softly i want you to speak to the lord i won't tell you what to say you speak to the lord you may have to ask the question lord where am i at this morning where where do i stand but he listed all these things jesus said all these conditions that we would be living in men's hearts failing some almost 200 000 people crossing the border they have another 70 000 to bring from afghanistan and some of them end up here i'm just going how is our economy going to take care of all these people now you have to do it now you got to bring them you have to take care of them children with no parents coming in all this is going to change the dynamic of this country can you say man it's overwhelming so what what who's who's got the answer this god has the answer man doesn't have the answer i think it's a time for us believers to be sober about it this may have been a sobering service for you this morning but i pray the love of god is in it to tell you he's got his eye on the cries of your heart he's got his eye on your oppression your depression your struggle and confusion in your mind god has his care and his eye upon it and he has the answer his voice is in the land let me raise your hand and say i know his voice is in the land if his voice wasn't in the land we wouldn't have any hope and that voice is going to take us to a rapture his voice is in the land he can change us he can deliver us he can deliver you this morning if he can bring us in a rapture he has power to deliver you this morning if you say lord i'm crying out to you if you're saying lord i need you [Music] i come to we're gonna pray you can come to the altar this morning and pray to the lord speak to the lord i need oh i need you it's in this very hour [Music] me [Music] i come to heavenly father we just

few weeks that there was no hope for lot except for abraham praying on the mountain for him what position do we stand in lord i pray for these that are here lord if they're going through a mind battle

struggling i pray that you'll bring them in a sobering focus towards you lord and the cry of their heart would increase for more of you and nothing else lord is more important than you [Music] if
