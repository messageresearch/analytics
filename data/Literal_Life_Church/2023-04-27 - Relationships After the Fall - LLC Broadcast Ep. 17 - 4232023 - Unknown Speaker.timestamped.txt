[6:29] [Music]
[6:31] oh
[6:34] that's the story right now it's time
[6:38] [Music]
[6:43] Genesis Chapter 3 The Serpent was more
[6:46] subtle than any beast of the field which
[6:48] the Lord God hath made and he said unto
[6:51] the woman yea hath God said ye shall not
[6:54] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[6:57] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[6:59] of the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[7:00] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[7:02] the midst of the garden God hath said ye
[7:05] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[7:07] touch it lest ye die and the serpent
[7:10] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[7:12] die for God doth know that in that day
[7:15] ye thereof then your eyes shall be
[7:17] opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing
[7:19] good and evil and when the woman saw
[7:22] that the tree was good for food and that
[7:24] was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to
[7:26] be desired to make one wise she took of
[7:29] the fruit thereof and did eat and gave
[7:31] also unto her husband with her and he
[7:34] did eat and the eyes of both of them
[7:36] were opened and they knew that they were
[7:38] naked and they sold fig leaves together
[7:40] and made themselves aprons and their
[7:43] heard the voice of the Lord God Walking
[7:45] In The Garden in the cool of the day and
[7:48] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[7:51] the presence of the Lord God Among the
[7:53] Trees of the garden so as as they have
[7:57] fallen from the word and believing the
[7:59] word eve has I want you to notice now
[8:02] what begins to unravel because Eve has
[8:06] fallen from the word she's taken Satan's
[8:08] interpretation of the word how many know
[8:11] that everything this whole world come
[8:13] under a curse everything unraveled when
[8:16] she left the word
[8:18] and so this is the transition and so
[8:21] they're hiding and now the voice comes
[8:24] in the garden and they never had to hide
[8:26] before never felt guilt before never had
[8:29] any of this happen but everything has
[8:31] lost now their their Glory their their
[8:33] holy Veil their Fellowship their Oneness
[8:36] everything unravels and they're hiding
[8:39] from God hiding from the presence of the
[8:41] Lord
[8:42] verse 9 said in the Lord God called unto
[8:44] Adam and said unto him where art thou
[8:46] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[8:48] garden and I was afraid he'd never been
[8:50] afraid before never been afraid of God
[8:53] I was afraid because I was naked and I
[8:55] hid myself and he said who told me that
[8:58] thou was naked hast thou eaten of the
[9:00] tree where have I commanded that thou
[9:02] shouldest not eat and the man said now
[9:05] the normal answer would have been yes I
[9:08] Vader that tree look at his answer and
[9:11] the man said the woman whom thou gave us
[9:13] to be with me she gave me of the tree
[9:17] and I did eat and what should have been
[9:19] an honest answer and owning up to what
[9:21] he had done he passes the buck to his
[9:24] wife
[9:26] Fallen condition
[9:29] when you're blaming everybody else
[9:32] man said the woman thou gave us to me
[9:34] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[9:36] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[9:38] what is this thou Hast done and her
[9:41] response was not normal either the woman
[9:43] said the serpent beguiled me and I did I
[9:47] would like to title this this morning
[9:49] relationships after the fall a few weeks
[9:52] ago we talked about relationships before
[9:55] the fall and now I'd like to begin to
[9:57] talk about relationships after the fall
[10:00] because relationships changed after the
[10:03] fall everything changed after the fall
[10:05] and in some ways we have lived out our
[10:09] lives dealing with relationships after
[10:12] the fall and after everything happened
[10:14] we've dealt with a lot of that in our
[10:16] lives until Christ comes in our lives
[10:18] and Redemption power begins to affect us
[10:22] and we realize when we get the Holy
[10:24] Spirit In Our Lives the Holy Ghost In
[10:26] Our Lives it begins to change everything
[10:28] and redeem us back to what we lost
[10:31] before the fall in the garden but all of
[10:33] us have lived with what it means to live
[10:36] with families and to live in situations
[10:39] and live in schools and go to schools
[10:41] and we've all lived with broken
[10:43] relationships we have all lived in
[10:46] families that have been broken it amazes
[10:48] me what family situations some of you
[10:51] have come from and as I hear it I just
[10:54] say that person is a miracle that
[10:56] they're even standing that's a miracle
[10:58] that the grace of God has them even have
[11:00] any desire for God it's a miracle that
[11:03] they know that their true fathers on the
[11:05] face of the Earth because of what their
[11:07] fathers did to them and I stand amazed
[11:10] and that's the Redemption power of God
[11:12] to show you it doesn't matter how broken
[11:14] the relationships are God through his
[11:17] holy spirit is out to restore
[11:19] relationships that have been broken the
[11:22] blood of Calvary is the Redemption to
[11:25] bring us back to what has been lost in
[11:27] the garden when God moves upon the
[11:29] people of God who are who are not in
[11:31] Oneness with God he sends a prophet and
[11:34] he does two things the first thing he
[11:36] has to do is separate the people from
[11:38] The False Oneness that they're in
[11:40] first thing he has to do is speak boldly
[11:43] through the prophets and say you're
[11:44] going to have to leave first thing he
[11:45] said to Abraham he says leave your
[11:47] Kindred leave the people that are around
[11:49] you and he separated them and why was he
[11:52] separated him from unbelief because he
[11:54] wanted to bring him to True Oneness you
[11:57] cannot come to True Oneness with God as
[11:59] an individual until you're willing to
[12:01] separate from the things that are a
[12:03] false Union
[12:04] if you're not willing to separate from
[12:06] friends in the world if you're not
[12:08] willing to take that step and trust me
[12:10] the Holy Spirit while he's wooing you
[12:12] back we'll speak to you about separating
[12:14] from all the things that are keeping you
[12:16] from God there must be a separation from
[12:19] wrong things for you to be properly in
[12:22] Union for with God
[12:24] so now
[12:25] even though
[12:27] true Oneness was brought after Calvary
[12:30] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:33] how many believe that's when true
[12:34] Oneness came back
[12:36] whatever was lost in the garden was
[12:38] restored
[12:39] on the day of Pentecost and that promise
[12:42] is unto you and your children as many of
[12:44] God should call throughout Generations
[12:46] this is how we would come back to a
[12:48] union like in the Garden of Eden is that
[12:51] he would fill his people with his spirit
[12:53] and he would come and live in the heart
[12:55] that's where we come back to Eden again
[12:57] that's the that's how Redemption takes
[12:58] place he went to Calvary poured out his
[13:01] Spirit on the people and now we come
[13:03] back into what we lost in the garden
[13:04] everything that was lost we now receive
[13:07] the power of redemption to begin to rise
[13:09] above the fall and come out of the fall
[13:11] but the thing is after Calvary and after
[13:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost after 2
[13:16] 000 years then we needed Malachi 4 and
[13:20] this is great that I'm talking about
[13:21] Malachi 4 and Elijah because it says in
[13:24] the Bible this in case the young people
[13:25] don't know it says the last scriptures
[13:28] of the Old Testament Malachi the prophet
[13:32] prophesies and says in Malachi 4 he says
[13:37] verse 5 the last two scriptures of the
[13:39] Old Testament behold I will send you
[13:41] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[13:43] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[13:45] that was not John the Baptist it was at
[13:48] the just before
[13:49] um Judgment Day and he shall turn the
[13:52] heart of the fathers to the children and
[13:54] the Heart of the children to their
[13:56] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[13:59] with a curse so now this is the prophecy
[14:03] of Elijah coming but I want you to
[14:04] notice now what he does all right this
[14:07] prophet
[14:08] first part of it is to turn the hearts
[14:10] of the
[14:12] fathers the Mosaic fathers that were in
[14:16] Israel during Jesus time to the children
[14:19] of Pentecost who would receive the Holy
[14:21] Ghost so that's one part of it but then
[14:22] he says that he'll turn the hearts now
[14:24] there's a second part he'll turn the
[14:27] hearts of the children back to the
[14:29] father so now after 2000 years
[14:32] they would they would have to be
[14:33] restored back to the Pentecostal fathers
[14:36] and the original thing of what happened
[14:38] the original Oneness that happened on
[14:40] the day of Pentecost in that time so we
[14:42] would here's the subject I want to make
[14:44] it as simple as possible that scripture
[14:46] shows us if we needed someone to tie our
[14:49] hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers
[14:52] in in the day of Pentecost that means we
[14:55] have become disconnected from the
[14:58] fathers
[15:00] if we weren't disconnected with that
[15:02] Holy Ghost Oneness and that original
[15:04] Pentecost if we weren't disconnected
[15:06] he'd never have to send a prophet
[15:08] because we'd be fine after 2000 years
[15:09] we've got the same Holy Ghost we're
[15:11] filled with it everything's good but
[15:13] everything isn't good because even after
[15:15] Calvary and even after the Holy Ghost
[15:17] fell on the ability to bring us back
[15:19] into Eden again after two thousand years
[15:22] of Creeds and dogmas and worldliness and
[15:24] laodicea and all this stuff we are not
[15:28] in Union with God anymore we lost it
[15:31] and the children are disconnected from
[15:35] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so
[15:37] he said I'll send Elijah and I'm going
[15:39] to reconnect you back to True Oneness
[15:42] again I'm going to take the children the
[15:44] Christians the children of the
[15:46] generation and I'm going to speak
[15:48] something to reconnect him to the
[15:50] Pentecostal fathers and they're going to
[15:52] get the same Holy Ghost
[15:54] the same faith
[15:58] oh it ought to make us rejoice friends
[16:01] there's no hope without without what God
[16:03] sends us we are disconnected from the
[16:06] Pentecostal fathers we're disconnected
[16:08] from a true baptism of the Holy Spirit
[16:10] we're disconnected and by the way I'll
[16:12] let you know without that you don't have
[16:15] any overcoming power to live in laodicea
[16:18] but God said I'll restore you back to
[16:21] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[16:28] so
[16:30] did you ever notice the wording
[16:33] the hearts
[16:34] of the children to the fathers
[16:38] when you talk about children and fathers
[16:40] that's a that's a relationship thing
[16:43] that's a that's a word picture
[16:46] you know he could have used anything
[16:48] there
[16:49] he could have said he shall turn the
[16:51] theologians back to the correct Doctrine
[16:54] Elijah shall come and turn all the
[16:56] theologians back to True Doctrine he
[16:58] didn't word it that way
[17:00] Elijah shall come in the end time and
[17:02] restore Christians of this generation
[17:04] back to the true Christians of the
[17:07] original he could have worded that
[17:08] though but look with the way he worded
[17:10] it he shall turn this is about
[17:12] relationship
[17:15] this is about Oneness this is about
[17:17] family
[17:19] when you talk about children fathers
[17:22] mothers
[17:24] dads
[17:25] Sons daughters it's about relationship
[17:30] he said I'll restore
[17:33] the faith of the children back to the
[17:35] faith of the fathers in other words I'll
[17:38] bring them back to the word back to the
[17:41] true baptism the Holy Ghost back to
[17:42] Bible Faith back to holy living
[17:45] back to relationship and back to living
[17:48] Holy by relationship I'll get to that in
[17:50] a minute Elijah will call us back to
[17:53] holy living
[17:54] but by relationship
[17:57] the children will be turned back he
[17:59] could have said turn back theologians to
[18:01] correct Doctrine and all these things
[18:02] but it's worded children and fathers and
[18:04] that puts an image in our minds that
[18:06] this is about relationship a
[18:07] disconnection from the children of today
[18:09] to our fathers in the Pentecost
[18:12] spiritually it's a spiritual connection
[18:14] first in other words the children were
[18:17] disconnected from the fathers everybody
[18:18] in our generation the children
[18:20] spiritually were disconnected from the
[18:22] Pentecostal fathers and Elijah is going
[18:24] to come and restore us back to the
[18:26] father
[18:28] and the Pentecostal fathers so a
[18:30] disconnection from the children of today
[18:31] to our fathers in Pentecost spiritually
[18:34] and it says did you catch it he shall
[18:37] turn their hearts back to the fathers
[18:41] not their heads
[18:46] not their intellect
[18:49] he shall turn their hearts
[18:52] I can't see anything else but a
[18:54] relationship in this it's relationship
[18:56] it's fathers it's children it's Sons
[18:58] it's daughters and it's hearts
[19:03] it's not about the mind
[19:05] it's not about the father just just
[19:07] providing for you but it's about the
[19:10] father coming into relationship with you
[19:13] the worst problem we have today is
[19:16] there's broken Fellowship between
[19:17] Mankind and the heavenly father
[19:21] there's no connection to the original
[19:22] faith of Oneness of God
[19:25] connection with God and the sons of men
[19:27] but the word brings us back to that
[19:29] relationship
[19:31] now because of that disconnect because
[19:33] of that disconnect spiritually people
[19:36] are not getting the true relationship of
[19:38] the Holy Ghost they're getting a
[19:40] religion
[19:42] and because of that
[19:44] because of that now you have another
[19:46] problem that to me is the second most
[19:48] problem in our world
[19:50] natural
[19:52] disconnections from fathers and children
[19:56] brother Rapp sent me one uh something
[19:58] last week and he also sent me something
[20:00] here of a film documentary that's just
[20:04] been recently done I haven't seen it yet
[20:05] but I do want to see it and it comes
[20:07] from
[20:08] it comes from the Kendrick brothers and
[20:10] I thank God for the Kendrick Brothers
[20:12] some Baptist men from brothers from from
[20:15] Georgia who have put so many films
[20:18] together with strong biblical themes
[20:21] they don't care about what people think
[20:22] they just say it and I I love the films
[20:25] because guess what there's like a very
[20:28] small percentage of movies to watch
[20:30] today
[20:33] there's a very small percentage that
[20:35] Christians can watch and it not affect
[20:38] the Holy Ghost that's in them
[20:42] I praise the Lord but the Kindred
[20:43] brothers did this and I'm anxious to
[20:45] watch it but brother Rapp said it's it's
[20:46] titled uh show show me the father
[20:51] and it's this whole subject that has
[20:53] people are begin to pin down what's the
[20:56] problems come from most problems come
[20:58] from in our generation disconnect
[21:02] fathers that don't know how to be
[21:04] fathers
[21:06] fathers who provide for their kids but
[21:09] they don't need there's no relationship
[21:12] with their children
[21:15] and that breakdown in relationship with
[21:18] fathers is actually the cause of so many
[21:21] problems I've said it before if you talk
[21:23] to most men on Death Row in the prisons
[21:27] you'll narrow it down most of them
[21:29] confess I hated my father I had no
[21:32] relationship with my father
[21:34] murderers rapists
[21:37] and you tie it back now you never
[21:39] justify that as being the problem if
[21:41] someone's murdered somebody but but you
[21:43] got to look at the core of where it come
[21:45] from it's a breakdown in fathers and
[21:46] children we got parents in this
[21:48] generation that's disengaged
[21:51] clocked out timed out of parenting and
[21:54] besides that besides that if they don't
[21:57] have the word to hold them and to
[21:59] instruct their sons and they're just
[22:01] functioning then they buy into
[22:03] everything's okay well yeah go do that
[22:04] go out and be with a girl at 14 years
[22:06] old go out with 17 years old go out with
[22:08] somebody and so and and we're taught
[22:10] that if you tell them they can't do that
[22:12] you're not allowed to tell them that
[22:13] you're too strict of a parent even in
[22:15] the message of saying you're too strict
[22:16] of a parent you're a legalist I am not a
[22:18] legalist if I tell my daughters you're
[22:20] not going out with that boy
[22:23] I don't know why I don't have more amens
[22:25] here I am not a legalist I'm in charge
[22:27] of my home
[22:29] and I have a right to tell them right
[22:31] and wrong this is a Timeless truth and
[22:34] if we'll live by it God says I'll bless
[22:35] your home I'll bless your marriage I'll
[22:37] bless your family I'll have a
[22:39] relationship with you somebody say Amen
[22:41] this morning
[22:43] Satan has devalued all this stuff and
[22:46] made it a religion but the message is
[22:48] not relented it's relationship with God
[22:52] God was saying I want a relationship
[22:54] with you and when you get that you will
[22:56] have a relationship with your children
[22:58] you won't be afraid of your children you
[22:59] won't be afraid to speak up you'll love
[23:01] them gently gently love them you won't
[23:04] be a dictator to them I don't believe in
[23:06] that
[23:07] but love is corrective
[23:10] if you love them you'll correct them
[23:12] love is corrective
[23:14] now not all correction is love
[23:19] but because not all correction is love
[23:21] it doesn't dump out the fact that love
[23:24] is corrective
[23:27] how many know that Eve
[23:30] left the word
[23:32] and because she left the word that's
[23:34] when the fellowship was broke with God
[23:37] so
[23:39] leaving the word
[23:42] is the thing that unraveled everything
[23:44] okay
[23:45] but
[23:46] I thought of it last night in the Garden
[23:48] of Eden it wasn't just
[23:52] the word it wasn't just that God
[23:55] spoke and said don't even don't eat of
[23:57] that tree they didn't have a Bible they
[24:00] just God spoke to them that you can eat
[24:02] of all the trees but stay away from that
[24:05] one don't eat of that or that day you
[24:06] eat that die and that's the only word
[24:08] they had from God but guess what it
[24:10] wasn't just the word that God spoke to
[24:12] him to live by and if you stay by this
[24:15] you'll have life you'll live
[24:18] but it wasn't just the word his presence
[24:21] who was the Tree of Life a person
[24:25] so even though he spoke the word his
[24:27] presence was there as a person coming
[24:30] down every day in the cool of the
[24:32] evening and fellowshipping with them
[24:35] Eden was not this thing of rules without
[24:39] relationship
[24:42] they had relationships
[24:43] and because they stayed with the word it
[24:46] kept that relationship intact
[24:48] when they left the word then the
[24:50] relationship was broken with God
[24:53] you see and so you know you have uh
[24:57] rules for a home I'm going to get into
[24:59] that you have rules for a home we try to
[25:01] base it upon we tried to base upon the
[25:04] message and different things so you got
[25:05] these rules but the rules as it says
[25:07] rules without relationship breeds
[25:09] Rebellion
[25:10] relationship without rules breeds
[25:14] rowdiness
[25:17] I've seen it
[25:19] parents want whole relationship I want
[25:21] to be a buddy to my teenager my friend
[25:23] to him but I can't tell them what's
[25:24] right and wrong I just want to be a
[25:26] buddy to them we'll see how that goes
[25:30] rules without relationship breeds
[25:32] Rebellion
[25:33] but relationship without rules brings
[25:35] rowdiness
[25:37] so Eden was not a place of rules without
[25:40] relationship they were fellowshipping
[25:42] with a with the Lord every day
[25:46] it's wonderful wasn't it there was a
[25:48] there was a person there it was the tree
[25:50] of life and they fellowship with the
[25:52] Lord they were with them it wasn't this
[25:53] this thing and in my home how would it
[25:56] be if I had rules to my home the the
[25:58] nice thing about the rules of my home is
[26:01] that it's not just the rules I've set
[26:03] for my home and you're going to abide by
[26:04] these if you're going to live here but
[26:06] I'm a person they can come and talk to
[26:08] me about the rules
[26:10] I think they can come and talk to me
[26:12] they can come and fellowship with me
[26:14] they can come and talk it out can you
[26:16] say Amen and and Adam and Eve the word
[26:19] that they were given to obey yes they
[26:21] obeyed it but it was a relationship it
[26:23] was beyond just the word it was the word
[26:25] brought relationship and so as I have
[26:28] rules to my whole whole sold household
[26:30] I'm a person as well and so I'm I'm a
[26:33] person who sets the rule but the person
[26:35] who sets the rules is present he's
[26:37] available
[26:39] can you see what I'm preaching if I
[26:42] preach the word to you I'm not preaching
[26:45] the word there's a person here
[26:48] Jesus Christ and the person who wrote
[26:51] the rules is present and wants a
[26:53] relationship with you but isn't it
[26:56] interesting when it all begins to
[26:58] unravel and they broke the word they
[27:01] broke the word and when they broke the
[27:02] word they hindered the relationship
[27:04] isn't it interesting that the person the
[27:08] Lord
[27:08] is still trying to find them
[27:13] so they broke the word they'd lost the
[27:15] word they lost the glory of God it's a
[27:18] mess can you say Amen but I can tell you
[27:20] when they're hiding in the bushes he the
[27:23] Lord come after them to try to find them
[27:26] this message this word is not just about
[27:29] the word and the Commandments and doing
[27:31] them this is about a person can you say
[27:33] amen and I don't care how far you try to
[27:36] leave the word if the person loves you
[27:38] he's going to come and find you
[27:40] Adam where are you
[27:43] who told you you was naked what's going
[27:46] on here
[27:47] I've said it many times but I think it
[27:49] was brother Ron Spencer has said it when
[27:51] when when when Lucifer drew a third part
[27:54] of the Stars God never went after him to
[27:57] try to bring him back but when one son
[27:59] when one son Falls he comes down and
[28:03] he's looking for that son trying to find
[28:06] a relationship again thank for watching
