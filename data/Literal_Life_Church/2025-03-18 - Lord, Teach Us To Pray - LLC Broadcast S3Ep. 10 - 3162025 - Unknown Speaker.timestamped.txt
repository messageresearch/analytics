[4:56] someone else
[5:00] and it will only bring you
[5:04] [Music]
[5:07] pain and I can't even judge
[5:13] [Music]
[5:15] myself only the Lord can
[5:20] say Well
[5:26] done I want to hear him say
[5:30] well
[5:38] done Luke 11 and verse 1 and I might add
[5:42] in a scripture we've been referring to
[5:45] uh in Philippians chapter 4 but we'll
[5:47] read this one first and it came to pass
[5:49] that as he was praying in a certain
[5:51] place when he ceased one of his
[5:54] disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
[5:58] pray as John also taught his disciples
[6:02] and then it goes into verse two as he
[6:05] begin to say when you pray Our Father
[6:08] which say Our Father which is in heaven
[6:09] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[6:12] thy will be done as in heaven so in
[6:15] Earth give us this day our daily bread
[6:18] and forgive us our sins for we also
[6:20] forgive everyone that is indebted to us
[6:23] and lead us not into temptation but
[6:25] Deliver Us from Evil so it was the
[6:28] disciple here asking the Lord to teach
[6:31] us to pray that's my title this morning
[6:33] Lord teach us to pray and I think it's
[6:36] interesting that we've always called
[6:38] that the Lord's Prayer but it's not
[6:40] really the Lord's Prayer it's the
[6:42] bride's prayer because this is what he
[6:44] told us to pray and then uh something
[6:47] we've been referring to over in
[6:48] Philippians if you just turn there
[6:51] chapter 4 verse 6 says be careful for
[6:55] nothing don't be worried about anything
[6:57] but in everything by prayer and
[7:00] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[7:03] request be made known unto God and the
[7:05] peace of God which passes all
[7:08] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[7:10] Minds through Christ Jesus seems like
[7:13] when I was researching more and more of
[7:15] the scriptures that Express the
[7:18] particular time that we live in today
[7:20] which I've called the time of trouble
[7:22] the day of trouble the times of trouble
[7:24] Daniel called it Troublesome times and
[7:28] uh as we look at at that particular
[7:30] season that we live in that it's a great
[7:32] time of trouble it seems like as I keep
[7:35] researching I I'm looking for things of
[7:37] the answer how God wants us to respond
[7:40] to him choosing us to live within these
[7:42] times of trouble and I find it in uh
[7:46] emphasized many times is there's an
[7:49] encouragement for us always to pray uh
[7:52] the biggest emphasis above all the
[7:55] challenges that the is coming from the
[7:57] attack of the enemy and we've talked
[7:59] about the the greatest attack being on
[8:01] our minds and being on our hearts our
[8:04] thoughts and our emotions are under
[8:07] attack uh in this hour in this time of
[8:10] trouble it's our minds it's our thoughts
[8:12] it's our emotions that get that get um
[8:16] and we we've talked about our minds
[8:17] being manipulated by the wisdom of this
[8:20] world and intentional manipulation to
[8:24] form thoughts that are worldly thoughts
[8:26] we talked about our hearts and emotions
[8:28] being clouded being perverted even and
[8:31] being distressed and being surrounded
[8:34] and filled with fear these are all the
[8:36] things that are mentioned in the Bible
[8:38] about this time our minds being attacked
[8:41] with fear and surrounded by fear and
[8:44] men's Hearts failing for fear and
[8:46] distress of Nations and perplexity and
[8:49] our hearts being weighed down these are
[8:51] all terms that I read from the Bible to
[8:53] show you this is particular pressures
[8:55] for our time and our day that we see
[8:57] under this time of trouble but I believe
[9:00] the Lord has provided a place for us to
[9:02] run into and be safe the name of the
[9:05] Lord is a strong tower where in the
[9:07] righteous can run into it and be safe in
[9:10] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[9:12] his Pavilion and in the secret place of
[9:15] his Tabernacle I'm glad to say that in
[9:17] these times God knew it was coming God
[9:20] knew the hard times God knew the
[9:22] financial trouble God knew all the
[9:24] distress and God said I'll provide a
[9:27] place for my people to run into I'll
[9:30] provide a place for their families I'll
[9:32] provide a place for their soul to rest
[9:35] I'll provide a place that they can come
[9:37] under the protection of my presence can
[9:40] you say amen and they will be safe in
[9:42] that place it's a place to hide it's a
[9:45] place of peace and one of the main
[9:47] things that comes out of these
[9:48] scriptures though is for us to pray for
[9:53] us to pray one of the main responses and
[9:56] resources we are are to pull from
[9:59] is our prayer now this may seem a bit
[10:02] strange because uh brother Paul we know
[10:05] that already we know we're supposed to
[10:06] pray not that we are praying but I as a
[10:09] pastor I want to talk about prayer this
[10:11] morning because sometimes Believe It or
[10:15] Not people do not know how to
[10:18] pray sometimes people know how to pray
[10:21] but they don't know they won't pray
[10:24] because there's many reasons that the
[10:26] devil gives that that holds us back from
[10:29] our prayer but I want to give value to
[10:31] our prayer because in those places in
[10:34] hard times in the time of trouble he his
[10:37] number one thing for us to do is to
[10:41] pray and to keep praying and the term
[10:44] says to always pray to guard our hearts
[10:47] but to always pray and so now we're
[10:49] going to have to have a value that when
[10:52] we go to God that our prayer is going to
[10:54] get through to him we're going to have
[10:56] to watch over a devil who tries to
[10:58] hinder our prayer make us feel unworthy
[11:01] to pray we're going to have to remove
[11:03] those hindrances because I'll tell you
[11:04] we're in a time we're going to have to
[11:06] pray but we're going to have to ensure
[11:09] that our prayer gets
[11:10] through can you say amen and so so now
[11:14] we when we pray we want our prayer to be
[11:17] effective we don't want it to be
[11:19] hindered so I'm LED as a pastor to talk
[11:22] a little bit deeper about prayer because
[11:24] we need the kind of prayer that moves
[11:27] God in these times we need the kind of
[11:30] prayer that getss through to God we need
[11:32] the kind of prayer of faith that goes
[11:35] Deeper Than Just Words Can you say Amen
[11:38] it can't be just words it can't be a
[11:41] ritual it can't have hindrances that
[11:43] somehow that we're unworthy to pray if
[11:46] sometimes there are some situations that
[11:48] we're in in this hour that the only
[11:51] thing that we have left that we have is
[11:54] prayer and so sometimes if the only
[11:56] thing we have left is our prayer we we
[11:59] want to know that we can pray the prayer
[12:02] of faith and we want to know our prayer
[12:04] is going to get
[12:05] [Music]
[12:06] through so I want to talk about that
[12:08] James is the one that refers to the
[12:10] prayer of faith shall save the sick the
[12:13] prayer of faith not just praying not
[12:15] just saying prayers not just repeating
[12:18] prayers but the prayer of faith shall
[12:21] save the sick he goes on to say he says
[12:24] confess our faults one to another and
[12:26] the effectual Fair uh the effectual
[12:28] prayer read it in a minute the effectual
[12:31] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[12:34] availeth much it's a prayer that'll get
[12:36] through because it's not only a
[12:38] righteous man but it's effectual prayer
[12:40] it's fervent prayer it's supplication
[12:43] prayer it's not saying a quick prayer at
[12:45] dinner say Lord God in the morning say
[12:47] God bless me bless our day we may have
[12:49] to do that but that's not the prayer
[12:51] that we're talking about we're talking
[12:52] about prayer that has supplication
[12:54] behind it it has burden behind it can
[12:57] you say amen and it's a Son of God
[13:00] behind it which God will hear a son and
[13:02] daughter of
[13:04] God we have to have that confidence when
[13:06] we go to
[13:08] pray oh I'm going to have somebody else
[13:10] pray for me somebody else may not be
[13:12] there to pray for you and Believers have
[13:15] a direct line to the throne of
[13:19] God can you say Amen can you raise can
[13:23] you raise your hand I'm a Believer this
[13:25] morning I'm a son and daughter of God
[13:27] did you know you have a direct line to
[13:28] the throne of God God you don't have to
[13:30] go through anybody you don't have to go
[13:31] through the pastor it's nice to have
[13:33] hands laid on and the Bible says that
[13:36] there's sometimes the pastor is not
[13:37] around somebody else is not around
[13:39] you're going to have to know and have
[13:40] confidence that you are a believer that
[13:43] everything's under the blood can you say
[13:44] amen and when I go to pray God hears my
[13:48] prayer we're going to need it more and
[13:50] more in this hour we're going to need it
[13:52] when we don't have anything else to turn
[13:55] to say brother Paul I don't see myself
[13:58] as a a prayer Warrior I think we're all
[14:00] going to have to be molded into prayer
[14:04] warriors how many would like to be a
[14:06] prayer
[14:07] Warrior so in you know when he says the
[14:11] prayer of faith that's that's not just a
[14:13] prayer but that's a confidence when we
[14:16] pray in order to have a confidence when
[14:18] we pray you will need sometimes uh to
[14:22] remove hindrances to your prayer so that
[14:26] the channel is free and clear I believe
[14:29] the channel for prayer should always be
[14:31] stayed free and cleared up that we can
[14:33] go to God at any time and so sometimes
[14:36] there's hindrances uh one thing is that
[14:39] when we have trouble rise in our life
[14:42] sometimes you can have trouble but it's
[14:45] worse to have trouble with your
[14:48] prayer you see because if you had all
[14:50] kinds of trouble but you didn't have
[14:52] trouble with your prayer then you can
[14:54] lean on that you say listen everything's
[14:56] intact everything's in place and and I
[14:59] don't have anything left but to speak to
[15:00] my God from the burden of my heart and
[15:03] know that it gets through it's worse if
[15:05] you have trouble in your life it's worse
[15:07] that you have trouble having
[15:09] confidence in your
[15:11] prayer that's worse because then you're
[15:14] really left with
[15:15] nothing we got to be able to speak to
[15:17] God we got to be able to have confidence
[15:19] when we speak to God we got to be able
[15:21] to talk to him freely um I just
[15:24] mentioned this I didn't have it in my
[15:26] notes but you know some of the things
[15:27] that I look at and stud in in people's
[15:30] lives still studying it and I'm just on
[15:32] a real journey right now because I want
[15:34] to help people more I want to help
[15:36] people's hearts and you know that I
[15:38] preached for years now it spills out
[15:40] over my Ministry to realize people can
[15:43] love the word have the some of the best
[15:45] preaching they can have all that but if
[15:46] there's a hindrance in their heart then
[15:48] it can cause other trouble and it just
[15:50] lays there God wants to deal with our
[15:52] heart so in in research and all these
[15:54] other things sometimes people have
[15:56] trouble once something in their heart is
[15:59] exposed and they realize the devil's
[16:00] using this to hinder me then it that has
[16:04] created a condemnation that they don't
[16:07] have the confidence to pray and be
[16:10] specific in their prayer so I've watched
[16:12] some of these uh these things where they
[16:14] actually lead a person and teach them
[16:16] how to pray and they teach them you
[16:18] should say this and to be honest in your
[16:20] prayer to be to be to to to not try to
[16:24] um how should I say it to make it really
[16:26] sound real holy before God so we answers
[16:29] no God wants you to be real God wants
[16:32] you to be honest even when you've made a
[16:35] mistake he wants you to tell him exactly
[16:37] what you've done don't smooth it over
[16:40] don't make it try to make it holy can
[16:41] you say man he just wants you to talk to
[16:44] him from your heart whatever it is and
[16:47] sometimes people have to be taught
[16:48] because they don't know they smother
[16:51] over their prayers they don't feel
[16:52] worthy to pray they don't know how to
[16:54] talk to God so they have to be coached
[16:56] talk about it this way you don't need
[16:58] any of that you just need to know that
[17:00] you can talk to God honestly from your
[17:03] heart and sometimes they encourage
[17:06] somebody have had bit they've had
[17:08] bitterness towards somebody for years to
[17:10] actually name that person in their
[17:12] prayer people are afraid to do it
[17:15] they're afraid to talk about the person
[17:17] that they've held bitterness for but see
[17:20] when we bring that all kind of like
[17:22] Esther in front of the enemy she exposes
[17:25] her enemy in front of her King
[17:28] payman sitting there and holding this
[17:31] over the Jews and Esther says I want to
[17:33] invite you over for dinner she invites
[17:35] the her King and she invites her enemy
[17:37] and all in the same room she exposes the
[17:40] enemy I think our prayer should be that
[17:42] way we shouldn't hold anything back
[17:45] expose what's wrong in your life this is
[17:47] what I did this is what I said God I'm
[17:50] so sorry for it but I'm not going to let
[17:52] the devil hide behind some Grudge or
[17:55] hide behind something that I'm going to
[17:56] expose this I'm going to be open with it
[17:59] in my
[18:03] prayer people don't really know how to
[18:05] do that sometimes and so maybe that part
[18:08] of it needs to be talked about that
[18:11] sometimes if we are saying like the
[18:14] disciple that day and I'm going to get
[18:16] into this in a minute why he's saying
[18:19] Lord teach us how to
[18:21] pray how many to raise your hand and say
[18:25] Lord if this is all I'm left with
[18:27] sometimes teach me how to pray and you
[18:30] know why they're asking that because
[18:31] when he prayed those Jews those
[18:34] disciples those Pharisees all of them
[18:36] they prayed all the time Jews pray but
[18:39] why are they asking Jesus to teach them
[18:41] how to pray because I'll tell you why
[18:44] number one when he prayed he got through
[18:46] to the father his prayer had results and
[18:51] some of they they got into saying
[18:53] prayers they may had a books of prayers
[18:55] maybe I'm going to copy what the
[18:56] Pharisee I just heard him at synagogue
[18:58] and he prayed so maybe that's my way and
[19:00] They're copying things no no no no no
[19:02] you don't have prayer books can you say
[19:03] Amen you have direct access to the king
[19:06] can you say amen and so they seen they
[19:09] seen the Son of God the Lord and they
[19:12] seen that he was a Son of God and he
[19:14] wasn't afraid to ask whatever he could
[19:17] from the
[19:18] father and he got
[19:20] results when they've seen that say you
[19:22] know I pray but I don't pray like that
[19:25] they said Lord would you just teach us
[19:28] how to pray
[19:30] pray maybe you say in your heart this
[19:32] morning Pastor Could you teach us how to
[19:34] pray because when I pray I want to pray
[19:38] the prayer of
[19:39] faith I want confidence behind my prayer
[19:43] a lot of you people we've got some pray
[19:46] prayer warriors in this church that
[19:47] actually taught me and made me a lot uh
[19:51] um you know how you have peer pressure
[19:53] there's such thing as a good peer
[19:56] pressure and God has put those people in
[19:58] my life that they've grown in areas that
[20:00] I haven't yet and that's good peer
[20:02] pressure because I see man that man's a
[20:04] prayer where all all I hear of him is
[20:05] praying that woman she's got this she's
[20:07] got this strength that I don't have and
[20:09] that's why you get in a body of Christ
[20:11] because don't feel condemnation or
[20:13] guilty or you're less just look and say
[20:15] God's made them to grow further I'm
[20:17] watching
[20:21] that but he said Lord teach us to pray
[20:24] so you know there's a lot of things that
[20:28] you just know so you know let me just
[20:30] say it this way there's we want
[20:34] confidence when we speak to God and
[20:37] there's a lot of items sometimes and you
[20:39] just don't
[20:41] know your god-given rights as a Believer
[20:44] you have god-given rights as a Believer
[20:48] and they are given to you not because
[20:50] you are always
[20:53] perfect those rights have been purchased
[20:56] through Calvary and you have God given
[20:58] rights this morning and Satan tries to
[21:01] steal or question your rights and weigh
[21:06] your rights with whether you're worthy
[21:08] of those rights I want to remind the
[21:10] devil this morning I want to say that to
[21:12] him this morning and encourage you as a
[21:15] Believer you have rights as a Believer
[21:18] and those rights have been purchased
[21:20] through Calvary and they're not weighing
[21:22] upon whether you're perfect or not you
[21:24] have those rights because he's given you
[21:26] those rights and one of those rights is
[21:29] I have a right to pray I have direct
[21:31] access to
[21:32] him Hallelujah so you know sometimes
[21:36] Satan he's stealing our rights or tries
[21:38] to act like that we he's questioning our
[21:40] rights you don't have you don't have
[21:42] worthiness to speak to God this week
[21:44] look what you've done he's a
[21:46] professional at bringing up all of our
[21:47] mistakes he's a professional at
[21:50] condemnation he's a professional of
[21:52] trying to question whether you're a son
[21:54] and daughter of God if Satan did it to
[21:56] Jesus himself he's going to do it to
[21:58] every son and daughter of God if he came
[22:01] blatantly to Jesus and said if you the
[22:04] son of if thou be the Son of God and
[22:06] tried to make him question whether he
[22:08] even was a son if he'll do that to Jesus
[22:11] he's going to do it to you and that's
[22:13] what Satan does he's always and and so
[22:16] we know going to the hindrances we know
[22:18] there's certain hindrances that we know
[22:20] that can be to prayer certainly we one
[22:22] of the standard ones we know is
[22:24] unconfessed sin is a hindrance to prayer
[22:27] you must bring that sin sin underneath
[22:29] the blood so we must put things under
[22:30] the blood but Satan is so clever he he
[22:34] tries to bring you when even when you
[22:36] confessed your sin he's the one that
[22:38] brings you under a certain Penance a
[22:41] certain payback plan it's not a part of
[22:44] the Bible that we do a residual payback
[22:47] for our mistakes is anybody listening
[22:50] here this morning you say well we know
[22:52] no no no listen Believers get struggled
[22:54] sometimes and that is you have to pay
[22:56] back or do penants for something you've
[22:58] done wrong my Bible says if we're if we
[23:01] we repent he's faithful and just to
[23:04] forgive us of our sins and there is no
[23:06] Penance program there's only one way to
[23:08] be accepted and that's accept what he
[23:10] did for you at Calvary and let him wash
[23:13] away your sins the devil's religion to
[23:15] work off debt debts work different with
[23:18] God Satan twists God's forgiveness and
[23:20] justification say what are you doing
[23:21] brother Paul I'm trying to build
[23:23] confidence in our prayer I'm trying to
[23:25] say that Satan twist up God's
[23:26] forgiveness and justification
[23:29] and he mixes in a repayment plan for
[23:33] debt with interest cuz any of you go get
[23:36] your loans you know it's going to be
[23:38] with interest you can't borrow money
[23:40] unless there's an interest with it if
[23:42] you get a chance to do it without
[23:43] interest you're getting pretty lucky but
[23:45] that's Satan's plan and we know the
[23:47] Bible says debt and interest is slavery
[23:50] the borrower is servant to the lender
[23:53] anytime you put yourself under a bunch
[23:55] of debt you're not going to be free I
[23:58] think I think we should be working and
[23:59] praying to get out of debt as I said
[24:01] there'd be a lot of testimonies here if
[24:03] we gave just the entire service to Money
[24:05] Matters we realize there's tons of
[24:07] testimony people in h 100,000 $200,000
[24:11] in debt but they begin to take God's
[24:13] structure of the word pay their tithes
[24:15] first put a structure for it pray and
[24:17] when they begin to pray and be faithful
[24:19] and tell every dollar where to go and
[24:21] they got discipline with it I have my
[24:22] own testimonies of a lot of debt with
[24:25] some rental properties somehow by by
[24:27] God's grace today I don't know how I was
[24:29] going to get out of it but God I didn't
[24:31] even deserve it but God helped me and
[24:33] gave me the wisdom to get out of it and
[24:35] today I stand completely debt free and
[24:38] accept my home which I'm working on to
[24:40] pay it all off I'll tell you when you
[24:42] get that paid off you feel
[24:44] free debt is slavery and the devil knows
[24:48] that we got a world that's full of loans
[24:49] and debt and interest on it where does
[24:52] that come from it's Satan's system to
[24:55] bind somebody up and so in your heart he
[24:59] binds you up with a debt payback system
[25:02] for your mistakes and your
[25:04] sins with
[25:06] interest Satan's religion Satan doesn't
[25:09] want you to have rights and no you can't
[25:12] have rights you you're going to pay for
[25:14] years it lingers for years it's because
[25:17] Satan don't want you to feel that you
[25:18] have rights the right to pray the right
[25:21] to be happy God does not have a Penance
[25:23] plan to set up to make you pay for years
[25:26] for your mistakes he he pays it
[25:29] all when a heart asks in sincerity for
[25:32] forgiveness he pays it all paid in full
[25:35] by the blood of the Lamb can you say
[25:37] Amen it's not a residual Penance that
[25:39] you have to do well I need to do this
[25:42] and I need to do that somebody sometimes
[25:44] people even give out of guilt you heard
[25:46] the scripture we should not give out of
[25:47] guilt we should give as a cheer cheerful
[25:50] Giver God loves that kind people give
[25:52] maybe if I help this it'll relieve the
[25:54] guilt of my sin you don't do that to
[25:56] relieve your sin you bring your conf
[25:58] ction to God and when you do then he
[26:01] says the devil says you don't have any
[26:03] rights while you're under that cloud but
[26:05] the de devil says it but God says you
[26:08] have God given rights would you like to
[26:10] hear some of them brother brah says in
