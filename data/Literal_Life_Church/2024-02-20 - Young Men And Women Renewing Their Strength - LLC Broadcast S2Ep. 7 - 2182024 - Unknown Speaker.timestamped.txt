[4:29] one
[4:31] he's been so good he's been so
[4:35] good thank you
[4:38] Lord got a reason to
[4:42] praise give a praise I'm a
[4:48] re hast thou not known hast thou not
[4:51] heard that the Everlasting God the Lord
[4:54] the creator of the ends of the Earth
[4:56] fainteth not nor is neither is weary
[5:00] and aren't you glad tonight that our God
[5:02] doesn't faint he doesn't get weary he
[5:05] doesn't get weak he's never weak he's
[5:07] strong because when we get weak he is
[5:10] strong can you say Amen uh when we have
[5:13] where we're fainting when we're having
[5:15] when we're that way then we know that
[5:17] our the creator of heavens and earth
[5:18] does not do that there is no searching
[5:21] of his understanding verse 29 he giveth
[5:24] power to the faint and to them that have
[5:26] no might he increaseth strength
[5:30] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[5:34] and even the young men shall utterly
[5:37] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[5:40] shall renew their
[5:42] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[5:45] as
[5:46] Eagles so if it's about eagles we ought
[5:50] to perk up our tension because we're
[5:53] Eagles how many's an eagle here tonight
[5:56] and it was the end time that have to
[5:57] give the story about the chicken and the
[5:59] chicken in the barnyard and the eagle
[6:01] getting misplaced there and he never
[6:03] felt comfortable we know the story and
[6:05] so it took Mama Eagle to come up above
[6:07] and scream and then he knew who he was
[6:10] and once he was able to fly then he
[6:11] could fly and get in his category so to
[6:14] speak that we are not just to we're not
[6:16] called to be chickens but Eagles and the
[6:19] other scripture says wheresoever the
[6:20] carcass is in the end time there will
[6:22] the Eagles be gathered together so when
[6:25] something perks up when we when we hear
[6:27] the term the Eagles and they shall round
[6:29] up with wings as eagles they shall run
[6:33] and not be weary and they shall walk and
[6:36] not faint you see now when we have
[6:38] extreme weakness we have a fainting we
[6:40] have giving up and this this word when
[6:43] it speaks of weariness it's an
[6:44] exhaustion exhaustion it's a depleting
[6:47] this age depletes our strength from us
[6:50] it's a weakening of our spirit many
[6:52] times and it's all related to the spirit
[6:55] and the mind not physical but the spirit
[6:57] and the mind weak mind
[7:00] weak thinkers not strong in Godly
[7:03] thinking or Godly principles that's the
[7:06] age that we live in and so much could be
[7:09] said about that that's not my subject
[7:11] tonight but I want to hone in on how
[7:13] it's going through this and saying when
[7:15] men are weak and this generation is weak
[7:18] he giveth power verse 29 to the faint
[7:20] and to them that have no might he
[7:23] increases strength who does it it's not
[7:25] by our own abilities it's not by what we
[7:28] can offer but our strength is in the
[7:31] Lord and thankfully he provides strength
[7:34] when we are weak as a matter of fact
[7:36] when we're weak then that's when he
[7:37] becomes strong he's the source of our
[7:40] strength and so if we go to the source
[7:43] then what are we going to be we're going
[7:44] to be strong we're going to be strong in
[7:46] our thinking we're going to strong in
[7:47] our minds we're going to be strong in
[7:49] our Spirits we're going to be strong in
[7:51] our soul God's calling a people to be
[7:53] strong in the Lord not weak in the Lord
[7:56] and so but he provides it but right in
[7:59] the in the middle of this he said even
[8:00] the young people shall
[8:04] faint and be
[8:06] weary and the young men shall utterly
[8:09] fall now that's interesting because when
[8:11] you have young
[8:13] men and you young people that are
[8:16] getting weary and faint it's talking
[8:18] about spiritually now um that's
[8:20] interesting because young people are
[8:22] known for their energy and they've got
[8:24] all these things but here now look at
[8:25] our generation where it used to be older
[8:28] people that was suicid used to be older
[8:30] people that was in depression now the
[8:32] last 10 15 years we deal with young
[8:34] people in a state of depression we deal
[8:36] with young people considering suicide so
[8:39] now the devil's come in and this
[8:40] weariness and this giving up Spirit
[8:43] comes to the youth and that's really bad
[8:45] when our young people are getting that
[8:47] way it gets you know the devil's really
[8:50] trying to take us when he takes the
[8:51] young hearts that should be excited
[8:53] about life they should be en energetic
[8:56] about life and looking forward to the
[8:58] future and you find all of them they're
[8:59] they're afraid of the future they're
[9:02] scared of what's going to take place
[9:03] next it should never be that way the
[9:06] excitement in their eyes the the the
[9:08] excitement about the future what does
[9:10] God have for me and the energy and all
[9:13] that should be there and yet they're
[9:15] becoming depressed and of course I could
[9:17] elaborate how what encourages that
[9:19] depression with social media and all of
[9:20] it but that's what they become they
[9:22] become weary our young youth shall
[9:24] become faint and shall be weary and then
[9:27] they have the same problem is everyone
[9:30] of this AE everyone in this age but they
[9:33] that wait upon the Lord they that pursue
[9:37] the Lord they that are looking towards
[9:40] the Lord they that have a Pursuit
[9:43] towards God they're going to find a
[9:46] place to renew their
[9:48] strength glory be to God there's a place
[9:51] tonight to renew your strength there's
[9:54] there's a there's a heart of God that's
[9:56] provided something for this hour that
[9:58] when you're weary in spirit when that
[10:00] Devil's telling you to give up there's a
[10:02] place we can go and set your wings can
[10:04] you say amen and you feel a renewal in
[10:07] the
[10:08] Lord oh my so you know being my subject
[10:12] is for the young people then we thank
[10:13] God that there's a promise that our
[10:16] strength young people if you're
[10:17] listening there's a promise that your
[10:19] strength can be renewed
[10:22] too we will have a source in this new
[10:24] generation and the youth will have that
[10:27] Source too I want to say that we need
[10:30] young people today that are
[10:33] strong in fact there's a calling going
[10:36] out during this in the middle of of
[10:40] Satan's Eden there's a calling going out
[10:42] to the new generation right now through
[10:44] the preaching there's a calling going
[10:46] out how many believe that there's a
[10:48] calling in the middle of Satan's Eden
[10:50] the vision of God is to have young
[10:52] people and what's he calling for he's
[10:55] calling for strong young people he's
[10:57] calling for young people there strength
[10:58] in their Minds calling for young people
[11:00] that are strong in their hearts strong
[11:03] in their
[11:04] convictions strong in their protective
[11:06] boundaries away from the enemy strong
[11:09] girls who can resist a weak
[11:12] boy he's calling for strong boys that
[11:15] can resist a weak
[11:18] girl strong girls that know how to say
[11:20] no to the wrong type of boy strong boys
[11:23] that know how to say no see when when
[11:25] you talk to boys they always think that
[11:27] they're strong Rel to their muscle uh
[11:30] buildup and their tone but go God give
[11:33] us strong boys who stand for the
[11:35] convictions of the word that can say no
[11:38] to Temptation that's strengthen this
[11:40] hour you're just a statistic if you're
[11:43] just strong in your in your muscles can
[11:45] you say amen and go ahead and do that
[11:47] it's it's great and you know that work
[11:49] your muscles do all that but listen
[11:52] Solomon said he said uh something about
[11:55] a man that could take and Conquer a
[11:57] whole city he said but his Spirit he
[11:59] can't
[12:01] conquer so he could Flex his muscles and
[12:04] say I've conquered that whole city with
[12:06] the Sword and the Army and then he can
[12:08] turn around and he don't have enough
[12:09] strength to ward off the wrong kind of
[12:11] woman that's right and Samson was that
[12:15] way when the anointing would come on him
[12:18] he'd pick up the fence of a city he you
[12:20] know he could do anything but a woman
[12:23] that's where his weakness was and it
[12:25] weakened him until she cut his hair and
[12:27] found the source of his strength
[12:29] that's right a woman did that found the
[12:32] source of his strength cut his strength
[12:34] off and so he might have been such a
[12:37] mighty man but what is strength today
[12:39] strength is young men and young women
[12:41] that can stand for their convictions
[12:43] strength is young girls who can stand
[12:45] against the wrong guy and say no
[12:47] strength is young guys who can say no to
[12:49] the Temptations on the
[12:52] internet there's a calling going out to
[12:54] young people today that would be strong
[12:57] young young people and let it it be said
[12:59] that strength that does not come as
[13:01] brother Danny was saying this past
[13:03] weekend strength does not come from your
[13:05] ability it comes from the Lord right
[13:09] strength does not come from your own
[13:11] mental exercise it comes from the Lord
[13:13] there's a source in the Lord as we wait
[13:16] on him as we look to him as we pursue
[13:20] God then we find the source of strength
[13:23] and the renewal of strength if you're
[13:25] weak there's a call for young men first
[13:28] John 21:14 says I have written unto you
[13:31] young
[13:32] men because ye are strong and the word
[13:37] of God abideth in you he's not talking
[13:39] about old man he's talking about the
[13:41] young man what's God's vision for young
[13:45] boys and young men what's God's Vision
[13:47] that you're strong
[13:50] right why do you have to preach this
[13:52] because we got a bunch of weak Lily
[13:54] livered
[13:55] men they can't stand for any convictions
[13:58] yeah we live in a generation with men
[14:01] with no backbone whatsoever there's a
[14:03] calling for young men and he says I've
[14:06] written unto you because you are strong
[14:08] the vision for young men is that they be
[14:11] strong and the word of God would abide
[14:13] in them and you have overcome the W
[14:15] Wicked one that's the men that God wants
[14:17] to write to that's the men that God
[14:19] wants strong in the word the word's
[14:21] abide in you and you have overcome the
[14:24] wicked God give us young men that are
[14:26] overcoming the wicked
[14:27] one
[14:29] come on people say amen can you believe
[14:31] that that's the vision see well what
[14:33] about a woman well look here in Proverbs
[14:36] 31:10 Proverbs 31:10 says who can find a
[14:40] virtuous woman for her price is farra
[14:43] rues skipping along to verse 17 she
[14:46] girth her loins with
[14:50] strength and strengtheneth her arms now
[14:54] that's not a bodybuilder either don't
[14:56] use that scripture for bodybuilding for
[14:59] women no that's talking about
[15:02] spiritually that's talking about
[15:03] character that God wants strong women of
[15:07] God strong women that know where they
[15:10] stand and know their convictions and
[15:11] know their principles he said she GTH
[15:14] her lo the strength and strength and
[15:15] arms and then later in verse 25 strength
[15:17] and honor strength and honor are her
[15:20] clothing and she shall rejoice in time
[15:23] to come everything reeks everything
[15:26] comes from her is a strong woman of God
[15:29] it's strength even her clothing speaks
[15:31] of strength not IM modesty but strength
[15:34] in the Lord modesty in the Lord a
[15:38] beautiful woman they don't have to dress
[15:39] like an Alish or something I'm not
[15:40] knocking the Alish but her clothing even
[15:43] says I'm strong in the
[15:45] Lord I'm not weak I'm not sell making my
[15:49] body cheap to someone else showing parts
[15:51] of my body showing a little more leg and
[15:53] all this stuff that's weakness
[15:55] everybody's doing that but the woman of
[15:57] proverbs 31 she's not only strong and
[15:59] she's not only uh virtuous and she's not
[16:01] only uh taking care of the things of her
[16:04] household and doing all these things but
[16:06] yet she's her loins are GT with strength
[16:08] she strength in her arms and strength
[16:10] and honor are in her clothing and she
[16:13] shall rejoice in time to
[16:16] come Hallelujah I don't have this
[16:19] scripture up there but I thought this
[16:21] was interesting as I found hundreds of
[16:23] scriptures related to this I can't read
[16:25] them all tonight this is about parents
[16:29] Ezra
[16:30] 9:12 says now therefore give Not Your
[16:33] Daughters unto their sons that's the
[16:35] Heathen don't give your daughters unto
[16:38] their sons neither Take Your Daughters
[16:40] unto your sons nor seek their peace or
[16:43] their wealth forever that ye may be
[16:47] strong and eat the good of the land and
[16:48] leave it for inheritance for your
[16:50] children forever did you hear what that
[16:52] just said who you give your daughters
[16:55] and sons to will either weaken you or
[16:58] strengthen
[17:00] you parents heads up heads up don't be
[17:04] weak when it comes who you give your
[17:05] sons and daughters to and by the way you
[17:08] do give them
[17:09] away but if you start getting weak and
[17:12] who they're giving away to and give them
[17:13] to the Heathen you're not going to be
[17:15] strong it's going to weaken
[17:17] Generations so you pray about it with
[17:19] them that's a serious thing that's a
[17:22] sober thing well I fell in love well
[17:25] praise the Lord I believe in love but I
[17:27] believe love has a lot more to it than
[17:29] just a
[17:31] feeling he says to the parents don't
[17:34] give your daughters to their sons don't
[17:36] give your sons and their daughters that
[17:38] ye may be strong
[17:41] families strong in the Lord eat the good
[17:43] of the how many want to eat the good of
[17:45] the land and leave an inheritance to
[17:47] your children forever that's not a
[17:49] physical inheritance that's a spiritual
[17:53] inheritance I'm going to go to the story
[17:55] in 1 Samuel chapter 3 13 now and there's
[17:58] so much that young people can learn out
[18:01] of this story it's a tragic story it's a
[18:03] terrible story it's not unbelievers it's
[18:05] Believers within the kingdom of God it's
[18:08] it's terrible the story of amnon and
[18:11] Tamar is a terrible story it's but it's
[18:13] in the Bible for some reason and every
[18:15] time we have something in the Bible it's
[18:17] for our admonition it's for for our
[18:20] instruction there's so much young people
[18:22] can learn from this story it's so
[18:25] relevant for today because in our time
[18:29] love is not
[18:32] understood true love genuine love even
[18:35] the love for a man for a wife has been
[18:39] misconstrued it's been Twisted it's been
[18:43] perverted and where has it been
[18:45] perverted in the minds of the young
[18:46] people to where today they don't know
[18:49] when you when I say love and they say
[18:51] love it could mean two different things
[18:53] they're thinking about because the
[18:55] generation has uh uh Tamp tempered with
[18:58] the meaning of
[19:00] love and so it it it's uh love this is
[19:04] so important for today because love is
[19:06] misunderstood love is not understood
[19:08] love is Twisted it's perverted and
[19:10] another thing that's uh messed up and
[19:12] not understood is strength as I just
[19:14] spoke of strength is interpreted as I
[19:17] said in physical strength or what uh
[19:20] pton Manning or uh Thomas Tom Brady
[19:23] could do in football and we look into
[19:25] our heroes for strength and the and uh
[19:28] the the you know there was a a little uh
[19:31] documentary on Tiger Woods that we were
[19:34] looking at when we come home and uh from
[19:37] Ireland and I just I wanted to go
[19:39] through it and see and such a rise and
[19:41] such a tragic story because the the push
[19:44] from his father to push him to the very
[19:46] top and he came to the very top golfer
[19:48] in the world and then to watch as he
[19:51] wasn't addressing things in his life
[19:53] then to watch him fall and have to go he
[19:55] went into sexual addiction and he had to
[19:57] go to different therapies for that and
[20:00] then he was in drug therapy and just
[20:02] just his life was all messed up and but
[20:05] yet you got this great Fame and this
[20:06] gate strength and nobody could beat him
[20:09] and the world Praises them and lifts
[20:11] them
[20:12] up because the world's Twisted about
[20:15] what's strong but inside he wasn't
[20:19] strong his Spirit wasn't strong so we
[20:22] got to be real careful that we don't
[20:23] take the world's view of what strong is
[20:26] what strength is 2 Samuel 13 and it came
[20:30] to pass after this that Absalon the son
[20:33] of David had a fair sister whose name
[20:36] was Tamar and amnon the son of David
[20:40] loved her
[20:45] a that is so beautiful
[20:50] a I tell you if you to stopped with that
[20:52] verse quit reading I didn't tell you to
[20:54] go any further yet if you stopped with
[20:56] that verse this would have been a normal
[20:59] love story she was fair and he loved her
[21:03] and all you can do is just go
[21:05] a that's so nice the baby's trying to do
[21:08] it right there
[21:12] oh but now you get to see what this love
[21:16] really
[21:17] was okay if you'd have stopped at that
[21:20] scripture then you wouldn't have read
[21:21] the story right or his mind right or the
[21:24] whole purpose because he's calling it
[21:27] love
[21:28] and amnon was so vexed what what's going
[21:32] on here this boy is calling this love
[21:35] but he proves it has nothing to do with
[21:39] love at every turn he proves he's using
[21:44] the term love but everything he does
[21:47] there's no love in it so my first point
[21:48] to the young people to learn love what
[21:51] is love love has
[21:55] honor love has respect
[22:00] love has obedience to God and to
[22:03] authorities
[22:05] right love is rooted in truth not
[22:10] lies and doesn't sneak
[22:14] around Love Goes deeper than sexual or
[22:18] natural
[22:20] attraction infatuation is a real thing
[22:23] you can be infatuated and then
[22:25] infatuation can turn to uh obsession
[22:28] that's what it did with amnon just an
[22:30] infatuation with her beauty turned to
[22:32] into an obsession with her obsession is
[22:35] not
[22:36] love a lustful obsession is not love so
[22:39] the first thing you have to learn about
[22:41] this story he's calling it love but
[22:44] everything he does from this point in
[22:45] his fruits to his life shows it's not
[22:48] love and the young people need to know
[22:49] how do I know it's true love brother
[22:51] Paul I may be attracted she may be
[22:53] pretty he may be handsome he may be
[22:56] good-look great wonderful but when you
[22:59] start using the term love don't think
[23:02] that just looks is love don't think that
[23:05] just attraction is
[23:08] love don't think that physical
[23:10] attraction to her body I must love her
[23:12] because I'm attracted to her body Love
[23:15] Goes deeper than that and so the second
[23:18] point I want to make to you young people
[23:21] is being vexed in your spirit for the
[23:23] opposite sex is never of
[23:26] God God provides
[23:30] peace if the relationship is right being
[23:34] vexed in your spirit for the opposite
[23:36] sex is never of God God provides peace
[23:40] if a relationship is right my third
[23:42] point to you any
[23:44] boy any boy or girl who is trying to
[23:47] push back god-given boundaries and
[23:50] protection is not to be
[23:55] trusted if you could take this girls
[23:59] and get you a magic marker and write it
[24:02] on your purse or something I don't know
[24:05] even this one any boy or girl who's
[24:07] trying to push back the god-given
[24:09] boundaries that's been laid in your
[24:11] hearts for all these years push back the
[24:13] boundaries and get around the
[24:15] protections that's a boy not to be
[24:17] trusted that's a girl not to be trusted
[24:19] thing the next point I want to make is
[24:22] but amnon had a
[24:24] friend whose name was jonadab
[24:29] the son of shimya David's brother and
[24:32] jonadab wasn't just a friend but was a
[24:35] very subtle man interesting word that
[24:39] comes from the fall in the Garden of
[24:41] Eden that the serpent was more subtle
[24:44] than any beast of the field and so this
[24:48] jonadab somehow became the friend of
[24:51] amnon and he was
[24:54] subtle wrong kind of friend to have
[24:56] right
[24:58] anamon not only had a mind that was
[25:01] perverted and messed up he also chose
[25:03] the wrong type of friend young people
[25:05] are you
[25:06] listening if you got a mind that's
[25:08] messed up and then you choose the wrong
[25:10] friends which if your mind is messed up
[25:12] you're going to choose the wrong friends
[25:14] uh you got a double whammy going against
[25:17] you Amna not only had a mind perverted
[25:19] and messed up he also chose the wrong
[25:21] friend I think the definition of a
[25:24] friend today has been watered down so in
[25:28] order to have the right friends you must
[25:30] know how subtle your enemy is and that
[25:32] you must choose the right friends Point
[25:35] number four out of this lesson you must
[25:37] purpose that you can never have a close
[25:40] intimate relationship with someone who
[25:42] rejects your Christ or the convictions
[25:45] and principles you live by if they
[25:48] reject them they are really rejecting
[25:52] you maybe it hasn't happened yet but I
[25:56] got to tell you you know the story the
[26:00] moment this was
[26:01] over his love changed to
[26:05] anger and he ditched her out of the
[26:09] room hated
[26:10] her which which doesn't mean he loved
[26:13] her because how can you love her and
[26:15] then you hate her after the moment that
[26:17] you get and fulfilled your lust on
[26:20] her so you must purpose young people
[26:23] that you can never have a close intimate
[26:25] relationship with someone who rejects
[26:28] your Christ or convictions and
[26:30] principles you live by you should never
[26:32] have a close friendship like that
[26:34] acquaintances be cordial be nice but
[26:38] never form bonds with somebody who
[26:40] rejects your Christ or disrespects your
[26:42] Christ or disrespects your convictions
[26:44] the last point is amnon and his friend
[26:48] conceived the plan to draw Tamar out of
[26:50] her protected world out of the
[26:52] protection and headship of her parents
[26:54] into being in a place alone with him any
[26:57] guy or girl that draws someone else away
[27:00] from accountability and protection into
[27:03] being alone too much is not the right
[27:06] guy or the girl for
[27:08] you this applies even to private
[27:10] messages in private messages if he's
[27:14] drawing you out of the protection of
[27:16] your what you believe and what you stood
[27:19] for or for your what your church stands
[27:21] for or what your your parents is De for
[27:24] any guy or girl that's not the right guy
[27:26] or girl for you right it's
[27:28] not and this applies even to private
[27:32] messages can you say
[27:34] Amen praise the
[27:36] Lord so hey even the youth will become
[27:40] weak and faint but they that wait on the
[27:43] Lord even the youth the ones who await
