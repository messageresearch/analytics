[2:23] the will of the Lord is but let's pray
[2:25] for them as they're with him tonight and
[2:27] just that God would give them strength
[2:29] through this time can you say amen amen
[2:32] we're going to reading our scriptures
[2:33] tonight from Exodus chapter 12 and we
[2:36] want to just
[2:38] say thank you for your prayers we uh had
[2:41] to fulfill a meeting there in Phoenix
[2:43] and had a very very nice time with the
[2:45] Saints and Phoenix brother Ron
[2:46] Peterson's church so uh we appreciate
[2:50] the opportunity to be able to minister
[2:53] there Exodus chapter 12 we're reading
[2:56] and we're going to continue on with the
[2:57] subject of blessed families tonight how
[3:00] many want your family to be
[3:01] blessed and uh we have different
[3:04] sometimes different uh facets of that in
[3:06] the generation we live in sometimes we
[3:08] have a single mom raising children well
[3:10] that's a family too sometimes we have uh
[3:12] different situations that's come up not
[3:14] because of the the of them so much but
[3:17] because of the times we live in but I
[3:19] believe your family can be blessed no
[3:21] matter what combination that is I think
[3:24] the Lord can bless your family as well
[3:26] so want to make sure that we qualify
[3:27] that Exodus 12 and we'll read together
[3:30] here uh several verses uh concerning the
[3:33] token and this is the next place in
[3:35] scripture where families are mentioned
[3:37] the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in
[3:38] the land of Egypt saying this month
[3:41] shall be unto you the beginning of
[3:42] months it shall be the first month of
[3:44] the year to you speak ye unto the
[3:46] congregation of Israel saying in the
[3:48] 10th day of this month they shall take
[3:50] to them every man a lamb according to
[3:52] the house of their fathers a lamb for a
[3:55] house and if the household be too little
[3:57] for the lamb let him and his neighbor
[3:59] next unto his house take it according to
[4:01] the number of the souls every man
[4:03] according to his eating shall make your
[4:05] count for the lamb your lamb shall be
[4:07] without blemish a male of the first year
[4:10] ye shall take it out from the sheep or
[4:11] from the goats and ye shall keep it up
[4:14] until the 14th day of the same month and
[4:16] the whole assembly of the congregation
[4:18] of Israel shall kill it in the evening
[4:20] and they shall take the blood and strike
[4:22] it on the two doorpost excuse me the two
[4:24] side post and on the upper door post of
[4:27] the houses wherein they shall eat it and
[4:28] they shall eat the flesh in the night
[4:30] roast with fire and unleavened bread and
[4:32] with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat
[4:35] not of it raw nor Soden at all with
[4:37] water but roast with fire his head with
[4:39] his legs and with the uh pertinence
[4:42] thereof and ye shall let nothing of it
[4:44] remain until the morning and that which
[4:47] remaineth of it until the morning ye
[4:48] shall burn with fire and thus shall you
[4:50] eat it with your loins girded your shoes
[4:52] on your feet your staff in your hand and
[4:54] ye shall eat it in haste it is the
[4:56] Lord's Passover for I will pass through
[4:59] the land of Egypt this night and will
[5:01] Smite all the firstborn in the land of
[5:03] Egypt both man and Beast and against all
[5:05] the gods of Egypt I will execute
[5:07] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[5:10] shall be to you for a token upon the
[5:13] houses where ye are and when I see the
[5:15] blood I will pass over you and the
[5:18] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[5:20] you when I smite the land of Egypt and
[5:23] then if we skip over to verse 21 it says
[5:26] then Moses called for all the Elders of
[5:28] Israel and said to them draw out and
[5:31] take you a lamb according to your
[5:34] families and kill the Passover amen
[5:37] heavenly father bless your word tonight
[5:39] I pray that you make it real to us Lord
[5:41] and we just commit this time together
[5:43] and fellowship around your word we
[5:44] commit it wholly to you may the Holy
[5:46] Ghost speak tonight through these things
[5:48] Lord we just pray you will remember the
[5:50] ball family Lord with Mr Ford and just
[5:53] encourage them and be with them Lord and
[5:55] also want to remember the mayor's family

[6:05] funeral tomorrow just be with them and
[6:08] comfort their hearts as well father and
[6:09] we just commit that to you we commit

[6:15] that's done and each word that's said
[6:17] would be a blessing and be an
[6:18] encouragement to the people of God we
[6:20] commit the service to you in Jesus name
[6:23] amen and amen praise the Lord Shake
[6:25] somebody's hand tonight God bless you as
[6:26] you take your seats and you've come out
[6:28] here in this cold weather it's going to
[6:30] get a lot of Colder this weekend but uh
[6:33] we appreciate you coming out won't tell
[6:35] you how warm it was in Phoenix over the
[6:37] weekend just to be
[6:39] nice amen well we want to go back into
[6:42] this uh part four here of blessed
[6:44] families and we want to we've been taken
[6:46] just um each time it's mentioned through
[6:48] the scripture and we started of course
[6:50] with Abraham that's where we got our
[6:52] text where it said that the the families
[6:54] of the earth will be blessed through
[6:56] Abra Abraham and uh we've seen that it
[6:59] was the faith of Abraham that brought
[7:01] the blessings on all the fam so uh we
[7:04] wanted to start there because we believe
[7:06] that it takes the faith of Abraham to
[7:08] bring this kind of blessing on the
[7:10] families and on our lives we uh we are
[7:13] the Seed of Abraham and that's because
[7:15] we believe like Abraham it's because we
[7:17] have the faith of Abraham we believe
[7:19] we're Abraham's seed because we have the
[7:20] same faith that he had and uh so that's
[7:24] that's what he said when he said the
[7:25] families of the earth will be blessed
[7:27] we're not interested in this world's
[7:29] blessings and such but we want God's
[7:30] blessings we want our God's blessings on
[7:33] our family and uh we can pursue a lot of
[7:36] things but boy we want to know what
[7:37] God's blessings are and we want those
[7:39] blessings to fall on our families
[7:41] especially as we realize the great
[7:43] attack on our families uh all the time
[7:45] there seems to be something Lord that
[7:47] Satan's trying to get in on attack
[7:49] marriages attack families and so we're
[7:50] aware of that that's no new news to you
[7:53] and so we're in a great battle for Satan
[7:55] to try to uh split up those things but
[7:58] we want God's blessings on our families
[8:00] we want to be able to know we're in his
[8:02] will and we want that and we we we if we
[8:04] look in scripture we find that Abraham
[8:06] in that faith and I just want to go back
[8:08] over it just a little bit so we
[8:10] understand in case somebody wasn't here
[8:11] we want to realize that Abraham's Faith
[8:14] was uh we can say it this way that what
[8:16] Abraham found was his six sense and the
[8:19] six sense declared to him what his other
[8:22] five senses wouldn't declare and that's
[8:24] what faith is um I was reading the
[8:27] definition of faith that the Sunday
[8:28] school teacher wrote on the board
[8:29] tonight I didn't bring it out with me
[8:31] but I thought it was excellent it was
[8:32] just a a belief a belief in uh something
[8:36] that you don't have proof for but you're
[8:38] completely confident and you trust in it
[8:40] and the reason that if it's true Faith
[8:41] it's Revelation faith and the reason
[8:43] that you can put confidence in it when
[8:46] these eyes don't declare it there's no
[8:47] proof of it it's because the six sense
[8:49] is stronger than the other five senses
[8:51] the six sense declares that it's true
[8:54] faith is the substance of things hoped
[8:56] for the evidence of Things Not Seen so
[8:58] when there's no no uh there's no
[9:00] evidence as far as see taste feel smell
[9:02] and hear there is evidence as far as our
[9:04] Revelation faith in the six sense and
[9:07] this is what Abraham found this is the
[9:09] this is having a revelation and Abraham
[9:11] had a revelation particularly of the
[9:13] promise of his day the promise that it
[9:15] was related to him for his hour that's
[9:18] what he had faith in it was actually a
[9:20] personal word for him that you shall be
[9:23] the father many nations it began with
[9:25] God speaking to him and calling him out
[9:27] from amongst his Kindred a a separation
[9:29] had to take place and then God begin to
[9:31] tell him the promise of that day that
[9:33] you're going to be the father of many
[9:34] nations you're going to have a child and
[9:36] all these promises for the hour for that
[9:38] day was related to Abraham can you say
[9:41] amen and the promise of the day is
[9:44] always related to the people of that day
[9:46] our promise of this day one of the major
[9:48] ones is the is the rapture and that's
[9:50] related to the people who's going to be
[9:51] raptured am so we have to believe the
[9:53] promise of the day just like Abraham had
[9:56] to believe the promise of the day we've
[9:58] got to believe all the word of God but
[10:00] we've got to believe the promise of our
[10:02] day and we've got to have faith in that
[10:04] promise of the hour that we live in we
[10:06] have to believe it because uh there
[10:08] there's there's no other reason except
[10:10] it it had a revelation it has to have a
[10:12] revelation just as Abraham had of the
[10:15] day he lived in it's a revelation of the
[10:17] promise related to that hour this is
[10:19] Abraham's seed in every age is those who
[10:23] believe the promise of their day how do
[10:26] you prove that how do you know that
[10:27] because in we find when John talked to
[10:30] the when Jesus talked to the Jews in
[10:32] John 8 and: 31 when Jesus talked to the
[10:35] Jews and the religious men he he who
[10:38] were claiming to be Abraham's seed
[10:41] physically we are Abraham's seed
[10:43] remember they claim that and Jesus said
[10:45] no you're proving that you're not
[10:47] Abraham's seed now how could they say
[10:49] that they said we're from the lineage of
[10:51] Abraham we are we are his seed
[10:53] physically that's why there's no
[10:55] grandchildren in the message everyone
[10:57] has to have a birth everybody's sons and
[10:59] daughter of God there's no grandchildren
[11:01] and so here they were by a a natural
[11:03] lineage they were claiming Abraham but
[11:05] Jesus could safely say you're not
[11:07] Abraham's seed because it's the faith
[11:09] seed and you're not believing the
[11:11] promise of your day your hour you don't
[11:13] believe in me so thus you're not
[11:15] Abraham's seed that was a pretty strong
[11:17] thing to call those people that and say
[11:19] that you're not Abraham's seed it's
[11:21] pretty rough it's pretty harsh but it's
[11:24] in John 8:31 and he says say you may be
[11:26] Abraham's seeds naturally is the way he
[11:28] was saying it but not truly why they
[11:31] didn't believe the promise of their day
[11:33] right they didn't believe the promise of
[11:35] their day and history holds a mystery in
[11:39] every age history holds a mystery in
[11:41] every age and Believers catch the
[11:43] mystery of their age Abraham's seed keps
[11:45] the mystery of their time from Paul's
[11:48] day all the way through the church ages
[11:50] the Believers caught the mystery of that
[11:52] hour under the angel messenger of that
[11:54] hour there was seven stars in his right
[11:57] hand the same Jesus that was in Naz
[11:59] Nazareth this been exciting me lately
[12:01] because and I I might bring more of this
[12:02] on Sunday because the same Jesus that
[12:05] lived three 33 years on the face of the
[12:07] Earth was not dead he resurrected can
[12:09] you say amen and we pick him up there
[12:11] and then we we see him fill the people
[12:13] with the Holy Ghost on the day of
[12:15] Pentecost but we can pick him up in the
[12:17] first chapter of Revelations where we
[12:18] see Jesus again and and and the the
[12:21] Sevenfold Glory of his person and it
[12:23] describes all of his glory and all of
[12:26] those things that he is all of the
[12:28] things that his his his character is and
[12:31] there he is again right in the midst and
[12:32] he's standing in the midst of where in
[12:34] the midst of the candlesticks he's
[12:36] standing in the midst of every Church
[12:38] age Jesus is standing there and we find
[12:40] that's where Jesus the same one that
[12:42] went to Calvary is standing there now
[12:44] and uh that's our Christ but he stand
[12:46] there with seven stars in his right hand
[12:48] right and at the very end of first or
[12:50] second chapter it says and those seven
[12:51] stars are the seven angels to the seven
[12:53] Church ages so now as we see every age
[12:57] and every time Old Testament new New
[12:59] Testament we find this distinction in
[13:01] Abraham's seed as they believe by faith
[13:05] the promise for their day that's how we
[13:08] know the distinction they caught the
[13:09] mystery of their time and they believed
[13:11] it by understanding no they believed it
[13:13] by Revelation they they held to it by
[13:15] Revelation it's by Revelation and so and
[13:18] then as we uh have preached several
[13:20] times is that in their age they didn't
[13:23] necessarily understand all the details
[13:25] of that
[13:26] promise now we can read our Bible and
[13:29] would find that they didn't understand
[13:30] all the details remember uh the prophet
[13:32] saying in Christ the mystery he says
[13:34] those people he says they didn't know
[13:36] all what they were doing they just know
[13:38] that they were LED of God to do
[13:39] something here they are living out their
[13:41] age and they didn't know all the details
[13:43] of what they were living out in that
[13:44] time didn't have the full mystery of God
[13:46] for that time but they caught it by
[13:48] Revelation can you say amen and they're
[13:51] even living it out brother B says they
[13:52] didn't even know all all the details of
[13:54] it but they're living it out they're
[13:56] living out the vision for that day
[13:58] because that's what they're called to in
[13:59] that day God is Christ is always giving
[14:02] his word in relation to what his people
[14:04] are going to live out in that day he
[14:06] gave a word to each generation it's
[14:07] related to his people his seed living
[14:10] that out and so uh the seed who believes
[14:13] it then we can conclude and say it was
[14:16] that kind of faith that brought a
[14:18] blessing in all the families of the
[14:19] earth that's right that kind of faith
[14:22] that brought a blessing on all the
[14:23] families of the earth we also talked
[14:25] about Oneness we went back to the
[14:26] beginning and broke down what Oneness
[14:28] was in the beginning the first family
[14:31] and the the beautiful subject of Oneness
[14:33] and the Oneness that was in marriage uh
[14:36] between Adam and Eve came because of
[14:38] their Oneness with God they had a
[14:40] Oneness with one another because they
[14:42] had a Oneness with God you can't have
[14:43] Oneness in a family unless that family
[14:46] is serving God and wanting to be one
[14:48] with God Amen you can't have Oneness in
[14:51] a family you're going to have disruption
[14:53] in the family if if one of those persons
[14:55] is not connected with God and in
[14:57] fellowship with God and I and I and I'm
[15:00] going to break that down just a little
[15:01] bit more in in a bit but it's difficult
[15:03] because Oneness is the most important
[15:05] thing that's why he created the family
[15:06] to have Oneness to have it with him have
[15:08] it with one another and that they came
[15:11] uh in a the reason they had Oneness is
[15:14] because they came into agreement with
[15:16] one thing they they were and then he
[15:18] says then he says they had the same
[15:20] nature as God that's why they could be
[15:22] one with God because they had the same
[15:24] nature of God there's no way to be in
[15:26] Wess with him unless we have the same
[15:28] nature that's why he fills us with the
[15:30] Holy Ghost and when he fills us with the
[15:32] Holy Ghost it's him not the third person
[15:34] of him it's him so we have the same
[15:36] nature as wrote the word the same nature
[15:39] within ourselves and that's why you come
[15:41] into this Oneness and unity with Christ
[15:44] is because you have the same nature
[15:45] living within yourself and so true
[15:48] Harmony is lined up then with a single
[15:51] uh Melody line we talked about Melody
[15:53] and Harmony and things and how that uh
[15:56] there's a there's one Melody line but
[15:57] true Harmony lines itself up with that
[15:59] Melody line brother says you have
[16:01] Harmony in the home one perfect picture
[16:03] of Harmony in the marriage in the home
[16:05] and agreement with one
[16:10] another there has to be a
[16:12] Melody it's not necessarily or or the
[16:16] mommy
[16:17] orology no it has to be the word of God
[16:20] the word of God is the absolute and we
[16:21] all agree we're going to follow this
[16:23] word of God when life brings a question
[16:25] we're going to search the word out and
[16:26] find the answer and then you'll have
[16:28] Harmony when everybody's in agreement
[16:29] with one with one thing amen that's the
[16:32] only true Oneness that there is at least
[16:34] in serving the lord you can come one
[16:35] into we want to build a career we want
[16:37] to build a family business to where you
[16:39] grandkids are multi-millionaires and
[16:41] people can come together in Oneness and
[16:42] stuff like that and do some incredible
[16:44] things but I'm talking about God's
[16:47] Oneness and God's Oneness says we have
[16:49] to be of the same spirit and come in
[16:51] agreement to have harmony with the
[16:53] melody amen that's what brings a blessed
[16:56] family as well there has to be an
[16:58] absolute and the best form of agreement
[17:00] is when the Holy Ghost nature of the
[17:03] word comes in and that's why was just
[17:07] take take a step back for families
[17:08] because before you're a family you're
[17:10] have a marriage before you're marriage
[17:11] you're single like many of you sitting
[17:13] here tonight and so that's why it was
[17:15] emphasized so much from Brother bradam
[17:18] make sure that person has the Holy Ghost
[17:20] and make sure you have the Holy Ghost
[17:21] before you get married why because you
[17:23] want a happy family you want Harmony you
[17:25] want Oneness right and so where does it
[17:28] start having the same nature as who
[17:30] wrote the word so that's why he says
[17:33] don't don't he told his own daughter uh
[17:35] she liked George Smith there and said
[17:37] you know hey uh does he have the Holy
[17:39] Ghost and even on the phone he says
[17:40] George do you have the Holy Ghost yet
[17:42] that was his question to a potential
[17:44] son-in-law do you have the Holy Ghost he
[17:46] said honestly I can say brother Bram I
[17:48] don't have it yet he said well you guys
[17:50] might might better wait and I'll be
[17:51] praying for you that you receive the
[17:53] Holy
[17:54] Ghost and so I think it was two or three
[17:56] months later I I'm just um guess in
[17:59] because I don't know why this come up
[18:00] but this story come up where uh one
[18:02] night there in in a service or I think
[18:04] maybe it was in a motel room he prayed
[18:06] through to God and he just really feel
[18:08] like he received an experience with God
[18:10] and I think a couple hours later brother
[18:13] randam calls him and says George you
[18:16] received the Holy Ghost didn't you
[18:17] tonight and so he say yes sir I did and
[18:20] so then they began their courtship out
[18:22] that but why is he making such an evence
[18:24] don't don't don't make any plans and
[18:26] don't get close to someone unless you
[18:28] can see the evidence and know that that
[18:30] person has the Holy Ghost for because
[18:32] you'll have no true Oneness oh you'll
[18:35] get together you'll have relations
[18:37] you'll have children you'll build a home
[18:39] together you'll do all these things but
[18:40] the foundation's not right for Oneness
[18:44] you got to have the Holy Ghost you might
[18:46] make sure that guy that good-look guy or
[18:48] not so good whatever it is that tall
[18:51] blonde oil well you better make sure he
[18:53] has the true Holy Ghost you know you got
[18:56] to start asking the question does he own
[18:58] a Bible is he around at church do you
[18:59] see him what's he into uh and do you see
[19:02] the evidences in his life that's showing
[19:05] I know friends that we can't tell
[19:06] anybody we can't come and say you don't
[19:08] have the Holy Ghost only a prophet can
[19:10] see into those things we got to leave
[19:12] that alone but yet we can see the fruit
[19:14] coming the overall fruit coming from a
[19:16] life that's right and they can look at
[19:18] your life young girl and they can see
[19:19] the fruit what's the biggest thing in
[19:21] your life what's the most important
[19:22] thing in your life is your life lining
[19:24] up with the word of God and if you can't
[19:27] see that man I'd wait I'd wait it out
[19:29] because you know one place brother Bram
[19:30] says if he doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[19:31] he'll make your life hell on Earth
[19:33] that's right right there'll be no
[19:36] Oneness there it it could be really
[19:37] really bad and so first we start that
[19:40] that's why it has to be the Holy Ghost
[19:42] before you get married and then as you
[19:45] get married and have children bring them
[19:47] up and want to bring them the admonition
[19:48] of the Lord you may have children that
[19:50] don't have the Holy Ghost yet you will
[19:51] have children that don't have the Holy
[19:52] Ghost yet and the only way that works
[19:54] right is that the children have enough
[19:56] respect in the parents Holy Ghost for
[19:58] while until they get it the parents have
[20:01] enough holy ghost in them they can see
[20:03] it in their lives that the kids respect
[20:05] it and you can have Harmony in the home
[20:08] if those children respect that
[20:09] experience with God and their parents am
[20:11] if they lose respect for it then there's
[20:13] going to be there's going to be turmoil
[20:15] but they they without the Holy Ghost can
[20:17] have enough respect and honor and for
[20:21] for this experience that Mom and Dad has
[20:23] had they've gave their testimony you can
[20:25] see God in their life see the change in
[20:27] their life and they resp ECT that enough
[20:29] and say I trust them and I'll follow the
[20:31] instructions for this
[20:32] home and what a blessed thing that is
[20:34] but you know what that's not the best
[20:37] the best is that the parents begin to
[20:39] pray and the young people begin to pray
[20:41] that they get the Holy Ghost because the
[20:43] ultimate is to have that home where
[20:45] everybody has the same nature as Christ
[20:47] the nature of Christ then then you're
[20:50] headed towards a real a goal here
[20:51] because then there's not this when it
[20:53] comes to the absolute of the word
[20:54] there's not this fight that come
[20:56] together in harmony you guys excuse me
[20:58] for looking like you know this with this
[21:01] down I broke two pairs of glasses and I
[21:04] I don't have the money right now to go
[21:06] spend for the astronomical am amounts
[21:08] that they are so I got these from the
[21:10] store my wife hates them you probably
[21:12] hate
[21:13] them um so I can't look at you this way
[21:16] and then I have to keep looking at this
[21:17] and it looks like I know it looks like
[21:19] my dad looks like an old man so let just
[21:21] get that out of the way all
[21:24] right so when when the whole family
[21:27] would have the Holy Ghost wouldn't that
[21:28] be quite a
[21:29] family wouldn't that family be something
[21:32] that's really charged to accomplish
[21:34] something for the kingdom of God oh that
[21:37] doesn't mean they're not they're not
[21:38] that doesn't mean they're perfect okay
[21:40] we're still in the flesh and you're
[21:42] going to get in the flesh sometimes
[21:44] you're going to say things in the flesh
[21:45] but I find when there's a holy ghost
[21:47] there there's there's more willingness
[21:49] to reconcile there's more willingness to
[21:51] get make sure that was made right can
[21:53] you say Amen there's something
[21:54] motivating a Holy Ghost and even that
[21:56] child that has it that that that they
[21:58] want to come together and say let's not
[21:59] let the devil get in between us here
[22:01] that was the devil doing that and you
[22:03] you hear all that in a holy ghost person
[22:05] it's not it's not some mechanical
[22:07] psychological thing is said let's call
[22:08] the let's pray together let's get this T
[22:10] it's so wonderful to have others in the
[22:12] house that have the same Spirit man it's
[22:16] wonderful and and so now the top prayer
[22:19] of parents should be before any other
[22:22] prayer for the future for their kids is
[22:24] that they receive the holy
[22:27] ghost that that you get them in the
[22:29] atmospheres the camps the services
[22:32] wherever it is you do everything because
[22:34] that's the top desire every true parent
[22:37] in here can say that's my desire above
[22:39] all things that your top desire not is
[22:42] not that they you send them to college
[22:44] not that did you send them off to get
[22:46] married not that you uh that you get
[22:49] them the best clothes that's not your
[22:51] number one priority for having children
[22:53] right or for your children right you got
[22:55] to say it's like John said I have no
[22:58] great Joy than to see my children walk
[22:59] in
[23:00] truth and he was speaking about his
[23:02] children spiritually but I've used it as
[23:04] a father my dad has said it to me he's
[23:07] he's happy that all four of his children
[23:09] are serving the lord and he's written
[23:11] text to me I have no Greater Joy matter
[23:13] of fact they they put it on their uh
[23:15] bedroom the other day in big stencil
[23:17] things you know I have no Greater Joy
[23:19] than to see my children Walk In Truth
[23:22] see ultimate I don't care if they make a
[23:24] million dollars it would be nice
[23:28] but but I that's not the priority pray
[23:32] those children through to the Holy Ghost
[23:34] because that's the ultimate thing they
[23:36] have to have to overcome in this
[23:39] day that's the answer to everything can
[23:42] you say Amen it truly is it truly is as
[23:44] so many parents even in the marriage
[23:46] message they come along and they're
[23:48] raised up but that's not the priority
[23:49] and they're giving them this and giving
[23:51] this the best clothes and they're
[23:52] getting them all the you can get them to
[23:54] all the camps but you should be praying
[23:55] God deal with them and fill them with
[23:57] your spirit
[23:59] it amen that's the way it should be for
[24:02] sure and so when we have that the and
[24:04] I'm just slowing down on this things so
[24:06] I can just uh give these encouragements
[24:08] to you this is what we should do for our
[24:10] families uh to for them to receive the
[24:12] holy ghost that they walk in truth then
[24:14] you can come into a Harmony to The
[24:16] Melody of the word and the next thing we
[24:18] talked about then is the hand of faith
[24:20] that must be used to cut away the things
[24:22] that come to try to break Oneness you
[24:25] can have you can have the sword brother
[24:27] Bram said
[24:29] but it takes a strong hand of Faith to
[24:31] drive it to the heart of the enemy and
[24:32] obvious we have to cut off unbelief and
[24:34] cut off things that try to break Oneness
[24:37] right so it doesn't come easy does it we
[24:39] still have to have the hand of faith and
[24:41] use the sword to cut things away that
[24:43] are trying to break the Oneness in the
[24:45] family and to be in agreement with with
[24:47] the word now in Exodus 12 we better get
[24:49] going here looking at this uh scripture
[24:51] we find another key place that families
[24:54] are mentioned in the scripture and it is
[24:56] the night that the token was applied to
[24:59] the homes of the children of Israel
[25:01] while they were living in Goan and it
[25:04] was after uh Moses had displayed the
[25:06] signs to pharaoh and all of them and
[25:09] they went up and down Janice and jamas
[25:11] withstood them and uh they they copied
[25:14] some of the things Moses did and that
[25:15] whole thing when it come to the end God
[25:17] finally said that's enough and he's
[25:19] going to send the death angel throughout
[25:20] the land and so now he drew the families
[25:23] and gave the the Jewish people
[25:25] instructions here that they should come
[25:27] together this this evening this night
[25:30] and uh this evening time and that's why
[25:32] it says in in the this this night that
[25:34] the death angel was going to come uh
[25:36] whenever whenever I look the at the
[25:39] evening time in scripture I always perk
[25:40] up my uh my attention because it may be
[25:44] a type for our evening time because in
[25:46] the whole history of time we live in the
[25:48] evening time of God's history and so
[25:51] whenever it says the evening time
[25:52] there's other places you know that uh I
[25:54] I think uh uh Isaac was introduced to
[25:57] Rebecca
[25:58] and then they he came in the evening
[26:00] time and brought Rebecca to him who who
[26:02] was that brought it to him elizar
[26:04] brought Rebecca to him and it was it the
[26:06] evening tide I think and so you know all
[26:08] those things are typed in ch so this
[26:10] evening when the token was to be applied
[26:12] is speaking of our time because the
[26:14] death angel was getting ready to come
[26:17] and uh so we are in the evening time of
[26:19] history and guess what the most
[26:21] important thing to do was in this
[26:23] evening time the lamb must be brought
[26:26] into every house right
[26:29] the lamb must be brought into every
[26:33] home in the evening time the priority is
[26:36] bring the lamb in the house and we're
[26:37] going to find this helps us in this
[26:40] subject of blessed families is that is
[26:42] this is typing our day and that probably
[26:45] one of the most important things you can
[26:47] do to bless your family and to have a
[26:49] good family is to make sure you're
[26:51] eating the lamb in your
[26:54] home your best meal will be lamb amen
[26:58] that's right to make sure you're
[27:01] bringing the lamb and every house had to
[27:04] slay a lamb every house individually had
[27:07] to have the lamb in their home that's
[27:09] right you you you you couldn't borrow
[27:11] off of somebody else you had to bring
[27:13] the lamb into your home and I like the
[27:14] if you look at the third verse there or
[27:16] the fourth if the household be too
[27:18] little for the lamb let him and his
[27:19] neighbor next to his house so to me uh
[27:22] that's sharing the lamb that's sharing
[27:23] Christ with somebody can you say Amen so
[27:26] so I I believe that we should do that
[27:28] but every every there was a lamb for a
[27:30] house and so this points to how
[27:33] important it is that we bring the word
[27:35] of God and bring the lamb into our house
[27:37] and present Christ to our children and
[27:39] have it is the thing that we partake of
[27:42] so it you can't depend on what just
[27:44] comes through Sunday
[27:46] school you have to bring the lamb into
[27:48] your home there's a whole church world
[27:51] and maybe even some message people that
[27:53] get so religious they depend on what's
[27:55] going to be taught to their kids at
[27:56] Sunday school or at church but this rure
[27:58] says in the evening time you bring the
[28:00] lamb into your home you feed on the word
[28:02] of
[28:03] God Amen and so a lamb for a house you
[28:07] can't depend on Sunday school and eating
[28:09] the lamb is a type of eating the word
[28:12] because Jesus is the Lamb can you say
[28:15] Amen we can move swiftly along this
[28:17] because we understand the lamb in the
[28:18] Old Testament type Christ he is our
[28:21] perfect lamb he is our Lamb with no
[28:23] blemish uh pilate said I find no fault
[28:26] in this lamb he exam him and there was
[28:28] no fault in our lamb there's faults in
[28:30] you my friend but there's no fault in
[28:32] our lamb tonight you've got mistakes in
[28:35] you but there's no fault in our lamb and
[28:37] and so now the a lamb for a house the
[28:39] the the lamb is types to eating they
[28:41] were going to eat it they they prepared
[28:43] it they dressed it they did they they
[28:45] even uh uh had certain things that they
[28:47] wore and all these other things and so
[28:49] they're going to eat it and when we
[28:50] partake of something like that
[28:52] physically when they did that it's a
[28:53] type and what they were eating was the
[28:55] lamb well that that goes perfectly with
[28:58] what Jesus said in John chapter 6
[29:00] because he actually presented himself as
[29:04] something we spiritually partake of
[29:06] right when he said except you eat my
[29:08] flesh and drink my blood now we could
[29:10] just stand back and say well that's the
[29:12] lamb here's our lamb Christ he's going
[29:14] to Calvary but Jesus Took the Revelation
[29:16] further when he says I will come in a
[29:19] form that you will spiritually partake
[29:21] of
[29:22] me it isn't that you just believe me to
[29:25] be the lamb you've got to eat me right
[29:28] amen come on now right am I staying
[29:30] scriptural now Jesus said except you eat
[29:32] my FL and that's why that that that
[29:35] statement stumbled so many of them 5,000
[29:38] at the beginning of the chapter and
[29:40] there's there's 70 left uh plus 12 and
[29:43] the 70 when he got to that point they
[29:45] said this is a hard saying who can hear
[29:48] and 70 of his closest ones the ones he
[29:50] gave power to cast out Devils early 70
[29:52] of those guys said this is too hard
[29:54] which the word hard there it goes back
[29:56] to a meaning of harsh this is too harsh
[29:59] this is too harsh of a statement and
[30:01] they walked away from him that's when he
[30:04] asked his disciples will you go away
[30:05] also so the whole nature of Christ is
[30:07] that way uh is that he's not about
[30:09] crowds friends right the nature of
[30:12] Christ is to tell you the word tell you
[30:14] the truth and this way he says I am
[30:16] something I am in a form when I come in
[30:19] flesh I'm in a form that you can eat of
[30:21] course it doesn't mean physical eating
[30:23] of Flesh we know he didn't mean that but
[30:25] he did come in a form that we could eat
[30:28] in what is that form eating the word
[30:31] because the word is Christ he put
[30:33] himself in a form that we could
[30:36] spiritually eat and partake of amen amen
[30:40] type perfectly with Exodus 12 it's
[30:42] perfect because they had to eat the lamb
[30:45] now if back in Exodus it would have said
[30:46] eat the lamb would have continued on
[30:48] bring the lamb uh you know sacrifice the
[30:52] lamb but in this night it was bringing
[30:55] into your house and it's not good enough
[30:58] just to to to sacrifice the lamb but eat
[31:01] the
[31:03] lamb my and
[31:06] so Jesus says further in that chapter he
[31:11] says just to to describe what he meant
[31:14] by except you eat my flesh and drink my
[31:17] blood showing that he is life he said
[31:20] later he says my words I speak unto you
[31:24] they are spirit and they are life so so
[31:28] now you have the blood you have Christ
[31:31] you have now you have the word my words
[31:35] I speak he gave it away he told what it
[31:38] was you know the disciples are trying to
[31:40] understand even the 12 what he just said
[31:42] and they didn't understand but he really
[31:44] explained it when he said what do I eat
[31:46] of my words that I speak unto you they
[31:49] are alive the blood the blood is going
[31:52] to have life in it we will not
[31:54] physically drink the blood of Jesus
[31:56] Christ but we will partake of the life
[31:58] of the blood and where do we find the
[32:00] path of life to the blood we find it he
[32:02] said through my words he saiden it'll be
[32:05] through the
[32:06] word can't separate the the blood from
[32:09] the word amen it's the path to the blood
[32:13] the path to the blood is the word that's
[32:15] right Jesus said it himself you can't
[32:18] separate the blood from the
[32:20] word his words coming out of his mouth
[32:23] then is what we eat and I might add this
[32:25] to say that the mouth that he uses
[32:27] Through the Bible the mouth is always
[32:30] referred to as the prophets the mouth of
[32:33] God is referred to as the prophets the
[32:36] mystery of Christ is declared through
[32:38] the prophets according to Revelations
[32:40] 10:7
[32:42] amen the mystery of
[32:44] Christ is declared All Through the Bible
[32:48] because the mystery of Christ didn't
[32:49] just start at the evening time right
[32:50] didn't just start in just when Paul
[32:52] began to preach the merer of Christ I
[32:54] I'm having some studying this recently
[32:56] with uh a little bit study and talk on
[32:58] the phone with brother Aaron McGary
[33:00] because he looked at Paul's Ministry and
[33:02] how uh Paul's I I don't want to get into
[33:05] this completely but Paul was called to
[33:08] bring the mystery of Christ not just the
[33:10] days of Flesh of Christ right he said
[33:13] I'm here to preach the mystery of Christ
[33:15] and so it was a further revelation of
[33:17] Christ wasn't it and you're in that
[33:19] Revelation because you're in Christ
[33:21] that's right so he didn't the disciples
[33:23] knew Jesus after the
[33:25] flesh but Paul knew him by the by
[33:27] greater Revelation that's why he's
[33:29] called to his position that day to bring
[33:31] the mystery of Christ well that mystery
[33:32] was preached throughout the whole Bible
[33:34] and you know it was declared by
[33:35] revelations 10:7 in the days of the
[33:37] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[33:38] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[33:40] be finished in the seventh angel it will
[33:42] be finished the mystery but did you ever
[33:44] read the rest as he had declared to his
[33:47] servants the prophets that's right the
[33:50] mystery of Christ was spoken All Through
[33:53] the Bible amen by the mouth of who by
[33:56] the mouth of the prophets amen that's
[33:58] what the Bible says and then you'll find
[33:59] in 2 Chronicles 36:12 Jeremiah was
[34:02] declared the mouth of the Lord Jeremiah
[34:04] the prophet was declared the mouth of
[34:06] the Lord so now let's let's move on now
[34:08] then the blood comes in a form that we
[34:11] partake of it when he when he has it in
[34:13] the word we partake of it we don't
[34:15] partake of the literal blood of the Lord
[34:17] uh these things are so easy to
[34:18] understand we we realize that even that
[34:20] day uh when he said except you eat my
[34:23] flesh and drink my blood if you looked
[34:25] at it carnally uh what in the world do
[34:27] he say you know is he a vampire you know
[34:29] are we vampires that's the carnal look
[34:32] at what you would see what Jesus says
[34:35] there and look at what Jesus is saying
[34:37] but it's a spiritual meaning that we
[34:39] ourselves we don't have a connection
[34:41] with the physical blood of Jesus
[34:44] Christ but our connection is the life of
[34:48] the blood and US partaking of the life
[34:50] of the blood amen as we partake of the
[34:53] word we can never separate the blood
[34:56] from the word and we can never SE
[34:58] separate the blood from
[35:00] light right we can never separate the
[35:03] blood from the word in scripture you
[35:05] can't isolate a scripture on the blood
[35:07] in the Bible and separate it from other
[35:09] scriptures that's right because other
[35:11] scriptures declare the path to the blood
[35:14] is the word amen other scriptures like 1
[35:17] John 1:7 declare that the path to the
[35:19] blood and the cleansing of the blood is
[35:22] light you know what I'm talking about if
[35:24] you walk in the light as he is in the
[35:26] light uh
[35:29] you have fellowship with one with
[35:30] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:31] cleanses you from all sin so there John
[35:34] as first second third John as John warns
[35:36] of the Antichrist Spirit coming he he
[35:39] begins talking about light and he ties
[35:41] the blood of Jesus Christ there with
[35:43] with light be and and what is light Thy
[35:46] word is a lamp unto me my feet and a
[35:48] light unto my path right so now you'll
[35:51] find the path to the blood is through
[35:53] the word of God and through light when
[35:55] he puts the light out and light is what
[35:57] understanding
[35:58] right everybody understand what I'm
[35:59] saying tonight this is this is rocking
[36:01] science it's just these are scriptures
[36:04] that often quite often people isolate
[36:06] scripture sometimes to themselves and
[36:09] form a Doctrine on it right but we don't
[36:12] want to do that every man's capable of
[36:14] doing that denominations are capable of
[36:16] doing that every man's capable of doing
[36:17] it but a lot of times they isolate
[36:19] something and try to form oh okay this
[36:21] is what it means but then it doesn't
[36:22] match the rest of scripture so you can
[36:25] never separate the the blood of Jesus
[36:27] Christ from the word or to the or the
[36:28] light or understanding John says you'll
[36:31] start to walk in darkness he says he
[36:33] that uh he that W uh can we read it just
[36:36] a
[36:38] minute because we're trusting my uh
[36:40] recol recollection and it's not
[36:42] good first
[36:48] John verse 5 this then is the message we
[36:51] heard of him and declare unto you that
[36:53] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[36:55] all remember the theme through these
[36:56] first three chapters
[36:58] is to give warning of what how to go up
[37:00] against the Antichrist Spirit and the
[37:02] first subject he's going to deal with
[37:03] here is is light the True Fellowship of
[37:06] God and the light God is light and in
[37:08] him is no Darkness at all if we say that
[37:09] we have fellowship with him and walk in
[37:11] darkness we lie and do not the
[37:14] truth person can say that they're
[37:16] walking in the light and that they're
[37:18] walking in the darkness of the word in
[37:19] other words they're not walking in the
[37:21] understanding that God is God has shed
[37:23] light on something and they refuse to
[37:25] walk in it they say I'm walking in the
[37:27] light no you're you're not that's right
[37:28] right no you're not but if we walk in
[37:30] the light as he is in the light we have
[37:32] Fellowship one with another and the
[37:35] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[37:37] us from all sin can you say praise the
[37:39] Lord there's the path to the blood and
[37:42] listen we're finished without the path
[37:44] to the blood without the blood of Jesus
[37:46] Christ friends we're lost there is no
[37:48] hope for any man outside of the blood of
[37:50] Jesus Christ it's all in the blood it's
[37:53] in the blood of Jesus Christ Alone that
[37:56] we have salvation amen but we find that
[37:59] then the I'll just say this before we
[38:01] move on the Antichrist Spirit separated
[38:04] the blood from the light and the word
[38:07] and thus made it more and more
[38:08] ineffective throughout church history
[38:10] I'm going to say it again the Antichrist
[38:12] Spirit separated the blood from the
[38:15] light and from the word and thus made it
[38:17] more and more ineffective made the blood
[38:19] ineffective throughout church history
[38:22] true were they still believing in the
[38:24] blood oh yeah we believe the blood the
[38:27] Catholic Church believes in the blood of
[38:28] Jesus Christ that's what began the
[38:30] Antichrist Spirit can you say Amen it
[38:33] was already working in the early church
[38:35] but what's the main distinction of it
[38:36] the main distinction of the Antichrist
[38:38] spirit is to separate the blood from the
[38:41] word and from light further light and
[38:45] and present light because because John
[38:47] referred to present truth Peter referred
[38:49] to that we walk in he says that we be
[38:51] established in present truth why do you
[38:52] have to say present truth why didn't you
[38:54] just say we be established in the truth
[38:55] yeah he he made a states that present
[38:58] truth because he knew the Revelation
[39:00] that there's when the light comes to the
[39:02] age that's what the people need to walk
[39:05] in good is anybody getting anything out
[39:08] of this
[39:09] tonight and so so now as as the
[39:12] Antichrist Spirit came it separated the
[39:14] blood from the light in the word and
[39:16] thus made it more and more effective the
[39:17] Catholic Church separated the blood from
[39:20] the word because they begin to take out
[39:21] the parts of the word that they didn't
[39:23] want right got got their own Bible now
[39:26] right right and and separated from from
[39:29] uh all these other things and then we
[39:31] but we still want to hold on to the the
[39:33] subject of the blood we want to hold on
[39:34] this to this but look at all the stuff
[39:36] and look at all the stuff they added to
[39:38] it they added to the blood of Jesus
[39:40] Christ they said it's the blood yeah but
[39:42] you got to burn candles you got to do
[39:43] this you could pay yourself out of
[39:44] purgatory they had all these additions
[39:47] and that's the Antichrist Spirit now you
[39:49] have daughters of the Antichrist
[39:51] Daughters of the mother of harlots the
[39:53] mother of harlots daughters and systems
[39:55] that do exactly the same thing this
[39:57] pulling out different parts of the word
[39:59] but every time you take away the word
[40:01] you interrupt the effect of the blood of
[40:04] Jesus
[40:04] Christ every time you isolate a
[40:07] scripture and not take the whole word
[40:09] you you uh you interrupt the effects of
[40:12] the of the blood of Jesus Christ that's
[40:14] why at the end time he said I will
[40:15] restore what's he restoring well first
[40:18] the truth of the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:20] the truth and Luther caught a little bit
[40:22] of it Luther caught it he's he's saying
[40:25] he's saying I this this candle doesn't
[40:27] save me right he come to a truth to
[40:30] purify the revelation of what the blood
[40:33] of Jesus Christ was and what
[40:34] justification was God began to reveal
[40:36] that to him you know what it was it was
[40:38] light yes and when those people come
[40:40] under that light of that messenger that
[40:42] U fifth angel messenger when they come
[40:44] under the light of that and light was
[40:46] shed on it they they come into an
[40:48] experience with Christ of the true
[40:51] measure of the blood of Jesus Christ for
[40:53] their lives because the Catholic church
[40:55] and the systems had d destroy the
[40:58] effects of the blood changing somebody
[41:00] that's right by Creeds and
[41:04] dogmas so the I'm only elaborating on
[41:07] this so that we understand the blood of
[41:09] Jesus Christ and that we understand how
[41:11] powerful it is and what it is to us so
[41:14] that's what it means by bringing now the
[41:16] lamb and the home Christ bring the word
[41:20] Christ being brought in and eating it
[41:23] together as a family we're speaking of
[41:25] blessed families not by the world's
[41:27] standards but blessed in God's books and
[41:29] this is it my question is are you
[41:31] bringing the lamb into your home are you
[41:33] eating
[41:34] it h are you preparing it look what they
[41:37] did in Exodus 12 they prepared it they
[41:40] took time it was a priority yes bringing
[41:44] the word into your home is just just not
[41:45] just a flimsy thing but it's it was an
[41:48] important thing that night they took
[41:50] time they they dressed it here back in
[41:53] Exodus and even there was a certain way
[41:56] that they ate it it he says and thus
[41:57] shall eat it with your loins girded your
[41:59] shoes on your feet your staff in your
[42:02] hand just a a little bit of a dress code
[42:05] there and I'm not bringing one here
[42:06] tonight I'm just saying here's details
[42:08] of how they prepared this this was an
[42:09] important thing in the home that
[42:11] night bringing the lamb to eat it
[42:14] together preparing it they took some
[42:15] time with it it must have been a
[42:17] priority by what God is bringing it to
[42:18] them in this way and they took some time
[42:20] with the lamb and homes today are not
[42:23] blessed because they think a little
[42:25] visit to church on Sunday and hearing us
[42:27] scripture is enough they're not bringing
[42:29] the lamb into their
[42:32] home it's not just the written word of
[42:35] Christ too say well I read my Bible no
[42:38] Christ is more than just the Bible we
[42:41] want to see Christ Living in Mom and Dad
[42:44] we want to see Christ Living in those
[42:46] children we want to see the expression
[42:48] of the person because remember he's not
[42:50] a book He's a
[42:51] person this Reveals His person but he's
[42:54] more than just a book so when we why do
[42:56] we read the book then because that's our
[42:58] access to get to the person that's how
[43:00] does the person what's his
[43:01] characteristics who is he and we glorify
[43:03] him and bring him and brother R says we
[43:05] when we talk about him he comes near how
[43:08] wonderful when we talk about Christ he
[43:10] comes near that's how we welcome the
[43:12] person of Christ into our home is when
[43:14] we talk about his precepts we talk about
[43:16] we're reading and sometimes it seems so
[43:18] mechanical you you got those little kids
[43:19] that are falling asleep on you I got a
[43:22] 12-year-old that falls asleep on me
[43:24] shouldn't have said that sorry honey
[43:27] she only does that like once a
[43:29] year she usually she's listening really
[43:32] good but uh you know that's the thing
[43:35] they they fall asleep but you know what
[43:37] they read the word of God to them read
[43:40] the word because it's our access talk
[43:42] about it talk about what he's doing
[43:43] because when you talk about him he he
[43:46] comes near then it's more than a book
[43:48] and then those K children get the to the
[43:50] AES that mine AR now they know when they
[43:53] feel the presence of God they've been to
[43:55] enough camps they've been in enough
[43:57] and they've actually been in our home
[43:59] where they know when the presence of God
[44:01] comes in the
[44:02] room and I mean he's always there but I
[44:05] mean in in a real more effective way
[44:07] where you can actually feel his presence
[44:09] it's so wonderful to know that you know
[44:11] something else is happening here and
[44:13] it's so wonderful it's so wonderful that
[44:16] it's more than just a book it's more
[44:18] than just a Book and Tape it's more than
[44:20] just something of of of of the the
[44:23] message it's a person can you say you
[44:26] Lord hallelujah thank you Lord I'm about
[44:28] ready to cry here because I this is
[44:30] what's important amen this is what's
[44:32] important is the person of Christ in our
[44:34] homes bring the lamb into your home and
[44:37] and so it's not just the written word
[44:39] but it's the living Christ take time to
[44:41] eat it and it becomes so real we want to
[44:43] see him by Revelation this is not meant
[44:45] to put a a lot of pressure on you men to
[44:47] be preachers because a lot of times you
[44:50] say bring the word to your family you
[44:52] know they feel that they have to you
[44:53] know give a whole and you know I'm not
[44:56] asking you to get out out of your
[44:57] calling the Bible says stay in your
[45:00] calling please because that's that'll
[45:02] that'll be worse for your families if
[45:04] you get out of your calling if you're
[45:05] not a teacher don't teach the word of
[45:07] God if you're not a preacher Don't
[45:08] Preach the word of God brother sister if
[45:10] you're a farmer be a good farmer serve
[45:12] the Lord because and he say the man that
[45:14] gets his lunchbox in God in Simplicity
[45:17] he says he says the man that grabs his
[45:19] lunchbox kisses his family has devotions
[45:22] with his family gets his Lon goes to his
[45:23] Factory job he said God can do more
[45:25] through that simple man than all the
[45:27] priests and all the big dignitaries and
[45:29] all and all the
[45:31] intellectuals god in simplicity so God
[45:34] can reveal himself even more in that man
[45:36] than the preachers amen amen but don't
[45:39] get out of your calling and I'm not
[45:40] pressuring you you got to bring a whole
[45:42] discourse on the Seven Seals to your
[45:45] six-year-olds good luck with
[45:50] that but you know what still teach them
[45:55] and and read to them the word of God and
[45:58] teach them and live the word to
[46:01] them is the Lamb the center of your home
[46:04] when your kids are small when our kids
[46:07] were small we had to be brief in our
[46:08] family alter time because of their
[46:10] attention spans when they're
[46:13] two-year-old and got the
[46:14] twozies there's not much attention span
[46:17] there on the things of the word of God
[46:19] so we had to you know be brief and then
[46:21] as they got older we been begin spending
[46:23] more time breaking it down to them and
[46:26] we read sometimes we read interesting
[46:28] stories like biographies and stuff like
[46:31] that biographies of great Christians
[46:33] sometimes we use that for our devotional
[46:35] but as they get older you begin spending
[46:37] more time breaking things down for them
[46:40] and tell them what the Lord is opening
[46:42] up to you share with them brothers and
[46:45] sisters share them with them what God
[46:47] has opened in the word to you in this
[46:51] time this great unveiling of God in the
[46:53] last days that's what it is it's
[46:56] Revelation means the unveiling it's
[46:57] taken taking the unveil off it's the
[46:59] unveiling of God and all of it's
[47:02] unveiled in the end time and what he
[47:03] unveils to you share it with your
[47:04] children share it with everybody share
[47:07] it with your business partners share it
[47:09] with tell what the Lord is showing you
[47:10] but certainly don't tell the whole world
[47:13] and not tell your children that's
[47:15] right amen amen and so when and when
[47:19] they get older and do get a relationship
[47:21] with him then it's not as hard because
[47:24] there's a hunger there to eat the lamb
[47:26] too and so so they come on board with it
[47:28] more the best meal served in your home
[47:30] is lamb the lamb can you say amen amen
[47:34] we sat a couple Sundays I I we miss
[47:36] church last Sunday was it two Sundays
[47:38] ago and we sat and listened to the
[47:40] message uh brother brand preach respects
[47:43] and we really really enjoyed it as the
[47:46] prophet just went from scripture to
[47:47] scripture and example example teaching
[47:50] us how important it is to have respect
[47:52] to God's servants that's right so if I
[47:55] would encourage if you want to start
[47:57] somewhere just start there it goes along
[47:59] with what Solomon said that the fear of
[48:01] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom it's
[48:04] hard to teach wisdom if you don't have
[48:05] the fear of the Lord and fear and
[48:07] respect not fear in the sense you're
[48:09] scared but it starts with the fear of
[48:11] the Lord and respect that God is real
[48:14] God speaks through his servants and even
[48:16] when we don't understand he says
[48:17] somebody he said brandom Tabernacle he
[48:19] said someone I know people get in the
[48:21] flesh sometimes people speak in tongues
[48:22] sometimes it's real sometimes not he
[48:24] says but don't say anything about it
[48:26] don't criticize it what's he doing he's
[48:28] and maybe that thing was wrong maybe
[48:30] that prophecy was wrong but he's
[48:31] teaching the people from the word of God
[48:34] don't criticize it don't say anything
[48:36] about it because when you criticize it
[48:39] you may find yourself disrespecting
[48:40] criticizing God that's God servant and
[48:43] God did speak through a my be careful of
[48:46] that what a tremendous time it was and
[48:48] you know I want to say qualify and say
[48:50] don't get the impression that we do that
[48:52] all the time we listen to tapes all the
[48:54] time we don't do it enough but or that
[48:56] we have devotions every night we don't
[48:57] have devotions every night um everybody
[49:00] has their time they probably spend in
[49:01] the word but two or three times a week
[49:02] we just gather everybody together for
[49:04] prayer and devot devotion time and then
[49:06] we have a lot of time we'll do something
[49:08] like that but I tell you it was
[49:09] wonderful and we just encourage you I
[49:11] don't want to give the impression
[49:12] tonight that we do this all the time
[49:14] we're the perfect family in doing this
[49:15] we need more of a lamb in our home and
[49:18] we we could use more of it and I just
[49:19] tell you how much we enjoyed from the
[49:22] youngest age all the way up how much we
[49:24] enjoyed just sitting and listening to
[49:25] that um message of the Prophet it was
[49:28] just
[49:30] wonderful so when we it's just gathering
[49:33] together and focusing on something in
[49:35] the word and you when you do it the
[49:37] family will feel more secure in facing
[49:40] life's
[49:41] problems your wife will feel more secure
[49:45] that you're solidly based on the word
[49:46] and that you know where you're going you
[49:48] know and and and it just brings a
[49:50] security about it those children feel
[49:52] more secure they may face all kinds of
[49:54] things the next day they may face all
[49:56] kinds of things at school but that's the
[49:58] anchor isn't it it's just an absolute
[50:00] that there's a security we we prayed
[50:02] together and and we've invited God and
[50:04] no I know he's on our side to fight our
[50:06] battles with us
[50:08] amen when brother Bram speaks of family
[50:11] altar he spoke back in a quote uh an
[50:14] early quote he says he's praying he said
[50:16] heal the sick tonight father make the
[50:18] blind to see father make the deaf to
[50:21] hear the dumb to speak the cripples to
[50:22] walk cure the Cure the heart trouble
[50:25] Lord cure the cancer and all kinds of
[50:28] troubles and then he says God and I pray
[50:30] that you'll mend up broken
[50:33] homes and make the ones that's in homes
[50:36] that's indifferent fathers and mothers
[50:39] who doesn't pray give them an experience
[50:42] tonight that they'll start a family
[50:44] altar in their home Grant it Lord so
[50:47] he's praying for cancer to be healed
[50:49] he's praying for the deaf ears to be
[50:51] open God can do all of this but he's
[50:54] also praying for broken homes to be
[50:55] mended
[50:57] and he's praying that fathers and
[50:58] mothers who are indifferent towards each
[51:00] other and their uh he says here that
[51:04] homes that are broken up broken homes
[51:07] that they'll experience something
[51:08] tonight that they'll start bringing
[51:10] family altar back in their home again
[51:13] 1963 he says you fathers you mothers are
[51:16] you ready to establish altar in your
[51:19] house and take the television out are
[51:22] you ready to take the deck of cards off
[51:24] the table and them comic book books that
[51:26] your children's reading preparing their
[51:28] little mind for the blast the devil that
[51:31] the devil's going to give them are you
[51:33] ready to establish the old family altar
[51:35] again or you do you just want to
[51:37] continue on the way you
[51:40] are
[51:44] amen so I want you to see something in
[51:46] this tonight that uh was a little
[51:48] different that evening another thing
[51:49] that's a little different I I don't know
[51:51] the time uh yeah I do it's on my iPad
[51:54] 8:20 all right so I got about 10 minutes
[51:56] here or however long the Lord
[52:02] wants I want you to see something else
[52:05] that was different that
[52:07] night never before had God instructed
[52:09] them to apply the blood to the doorpost
[52:12] of their home remember now it's the
[52:14] evening time so we can bring that to our
[52:17] evening time and say that they had the
[52:19] blood they had the lamb but this night
[52:21] they were to apply it to their home I
[52:23] want you to understand that they apply
[52:24] it to the doorpost of the home in other
[52:26] words words it was on the outside it was
[52:28] on display why why first of all because
[52:31] it was going to be time for the death
[52:33] angel to come so the blood had to be in
[52:36] the form that was displayed to show the
[52:39] death angel who you were as a family
[52:42] because it's was going to hit all of
[52:43] Egypt it's going to hit all the families
[52:46] but you had to openly display your
[52:49] identity with the lamb in order for the
[52:52] death angel to pass your house so it was
[52:54] all about identity who are you ident
[52:56] ified with right and so the death angel
[52:58] could tell that's a believer's home by
[53:01] the display of the blood on their home
[53:02] not just they had the blood in their
[53:03] home but they had it on display there
[53:06] was a distinction in that night that was
[53:08] made that is a type in scripture I
[53:11] believe of of our time because God
[53:13] wanted to bring something through the
[53:14] holy ghost that the blood of the Lamb
[53:17] the blood of the Lamb would not just
[53:19] stay there but the blood of the Lamb
[53:20] would be on display by the Holy Ghost by
[53:23] what was called in in uh Exodus 12 the
[53:26] token
[53:27] it's called The Token which is a type of
[53:29] the Holy
[53:30] Ghost the token and so now we have the
[53:33] blood but we also have the blood on
[53:36] display and so that becomes a token and
[53:38] it shows the price has been paid the
[53:41] death angel said the looked at the blood
[53:43] and says I'll pass over that home when
[53:45] we have the blood applied to our lives
[53:47] then the death brother Bram says death
[53:49] is in the land today spiritual death is
[53:51] already in the land going through
[53:53] killing people killing families
[53:54] spiritually
[53:56] and he says he passes he looks in there
[53:58] says and that's a sign that the price
[54:01] the full price has been paid other words
[54:04] a lamb has died for their life there has
[54:07] to be something on display to show that
[54:09] right aren't you happy tonight friends
[54:11] the full price has been paid
[54:14] amen that's a great thing to display to
[54:16] the world but that that thing to say the
[54:19] price is that token means like going to
[54:21] the years ago when you went to the train
[54:22] station you were get received a token
[54:24] not so much a ticket but a ticket it's
[54:26] like token and when the the head of the
[54:29] train looked at your uh ticket he seen
[54:32] that the price had been paid you might
[54:34] have paid it a month ahead of time but
[54:35] the price had been paid so the token in
[54:37] your life is the Holy Ghost it shows the
[54:40] price has been paid by Calvary can you
[54:42] say
[54:43] Amen but something had to be on display
[54:46] and so the death angel knew you as
[54:48] identity as a family I am identified
[54:50] with my lamb and I I have the blood of
[54:53] the Lamb on display no one could tell
[54:55] that from the outside unless it was on
[54:58] display and we should have kept
[55:00] something in this that's what we call
[55:01] the token a sign the price has been paid
[55:04] in this case a lamb died the price was
[55:07] paid but what's the evidence that the
[55:09] price was paid the token the Holy Ghost
[55:11] it shows to the world the price has been
[55:13] paid so you you have that distinction is
[55:16] that uh the lamb died yes the lamb died
[55:20] Christ died for our
[55:22] sins but there's something beyond that
[55:24] in the sense of the whole the Holy Ghost
[55:26] displays to the world that price has
[55:29] been paid and it also causes the death
[55:31] angel to
[55:32] pass Jesus shed his blood on Calvary and
[55:35] we believe that but then he applied the
[55:37] blood to the lives of the people in the
[55:40] upper room and gave them the token that
[55:42] the blood had taken effect that's good I
[55:46] have to say that one again Jesus shed
[55:48] his blood on Calvary how many believe
[55:50] that but then he applied the blood to
[55:53] the lives of the people in the upper
[55:56] room 120 he applied the blood to them
[55:59] through the Holy Ghost can you say amen
[56:02] and he gave them a token that the blood
[56:04] had taken effect on their
[56:06] lives so you may believe in the blood
[56:08] but has the blood taken effect and
[56:11] everybody could tell something had taken
[56:13] effect up there they knew themselves for
[56:16] sure this is what was promised by the by
[56:19] the prophet Joel it's happening right
[56:21] now I have been filled with the Holy
[56:23] Ghost you know what that was it was the
[56:24] effects of the Bloodshed on
[56:26] Calvary you could believe it all you
[56:28] want to but in that Upper Room it was
[56:30] more than just believing they were
[56:32] feeling the effects of it
[56:34] hallelujah hallelujah praise God and so
[56:37] they gave them that token that the blood
[56:38] had taken effect notice for years they
[56:41] had the Jews before that night for years
[56:45] the Jews had kept up the blood for years
[56:48] the Jews had had a lamb you know even
[56:51] job before job was the oldest book of
[56:54] the Bible job brought a lamb Abel
[56:56] brought a lamb he brought a sacrifice
[56:58] because and he did it because he didn't
[57:00] read no Bible that said it what do I
[57:01] bring to worship before God he caught it
[57:03] by Revelation c a revelation and he's
[57:06] bringing a bloody lamb it's all bloody
[57:07] and everything Abel all the way through
[57:09] they kept up the lamb they kept up the
[57:11] lamb they they believed they they kept
[57:13] up the lamb but this night it wasn't
[57:16] enough just to keep up the lamb it
[57:18] wasn't enough just to have the
[57:20] sacrifice I hope you're listening real
[57:22] close when that night changed it wasn't
[57:25] enough just to believe in the sacrifice
[57:27] or just to have the
[57:28] sacrifice it had to be on display that's
[57:32] right at the end time it's not enough
[57:36] just to believe in the blood but you
[57:38] have to have the token of the
[57:40] blood on display in your life for the
[57:43] death angel to
[57:49] pass after that night see job brought
[57:52] the lamb All Through the Bible they
[57:54] brought the lamb Abraham all of them
[57:56] bringing the lamb bringing the sacrifice
[57:58] but that night at the evening time
[57:59] keeping it up was not enough believing
[58:01] it was not enough showing there was more
[58:03] to just a mental exercise of believing
[58:06] in the blood that brings results that's
[58:09] right showing us today that there's more
[58:12] than a mental exercise of believing the
[58:15] blood that brings the results there has
[58:18] to be an
[58:22] experience with the life of the blood
[58:26] amen amen right and teachers who don't
[58:30] teach this take their people off track
[58:32] I'll give you an example I was at a
[58:35] concert one time and during the concert
[58:37] I was enjoying the concert and this fell
[58:38] got up and uh he gave us testimony of
[58:41] how he gave his heart to the Lord and
[58:43] was saved and I was rejoicing it he had
[58:44] a great testimony and I was just you
[58:47] know he was just going on and I thought
[58:48] that was wonderful God's really touched
[58:49] that man and it was just like one of the
[58:52] southern gospel concerts so that was
[58:54] good we went out to music and then I was
[58:56] over in the parking lot and I looked
[58:57] over the parking lot and there's that
[58:58] man behind the behind the car kind of
[59:01] hiding I guess but he was behind there
[59:03] just just smoking a cigarette just going
[59:04] on and on and on smoking it so I tried
[59:07] not to judge but I said at that young
[59:08] age I just I just thought I'm going to
[59:11] challenge this guy I'm just to talk to
[59:13] him and I just went up to him I said I
[59:15] said brother I said you know you just
[59:17] gave your testimony how God changed your
[59:18] life I said you're up there Tes him how
[59:20] God saved you and I said I don't want to
[59:22] knock that but I said How's it that you
[59:24] can fit that with with uh your temple
[59:26] being the Holy Ghost and you smoking
[59:28] these cigarettes boy he got so defensive
[59:31] he just said I just want to let you know
[59:32] I'm saved I'm Sanctified and when I
[59:35] believed I received the Holy Ghost I've
[59:37] got the Holy Ghost and I'm heading to
[59:38] heaven and kept just smoking
[59:40] off now I don't blame that
[59:43] man and I'm I'm not going to question
[59:46] what he has I'm not going to tell him
[59:47] what he don't have I don't blame him I
[59:49] blame the teacher that taught him
[59:51] wrong that's right he wasn't taught
[59:54] correctly in the scripture what a true
[59:55] experience with God is because with that
[59:58] experience of the blood is going to
[59:59] bring you to the Holy Ghost feeling to
[1:00:00] realize the scriptures that say my
[1:00:02] temple is a temple of the Holy
[1:00:04] Ghost so it wasn't that man's problem no
[1:00:06] some hopefully let's pray someday he
[1:00:09] caught further light in on the scripture
[1:00:10] and he realized further truth because
[1:00:12] that teacher misled him I don't know
[1:00:14] what denomination it was but he misled
[1:00:16] him he isolated a certain scripture and
[1:00:18] said okay you did that you're saved bang
[1:00:20] bing bang that's it you don't have to
[1:00:22] change your life you don't have to do
[1:00:23] anything you don't have to you know no
[1:00:24] it's a deception it's a deception it's
[1:00:27] the same deception that's watered down
[1:00:29] throughout the ages the effects of the
[1:00:31] blood of Jesus Christ listen God can
[1:00:33] change a life in the worst condition
[1:00:36] that it is whoever it is God can change
[1:00:38] your life if the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:40] there and when he does it he does it
[1:00:42] well we don't want to water down the new
[1:00:44] birth can you say am man we don't want
[1:00:46] to water down the blood we want to see
[1:00:48] its full effect in our lives and we want
[1:00:50] to we want to witness of it to see the
[1:00:52] full effect in other lives that's right
[1:00:56] am praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:00:58] amen so he gave them he applied the
[1:01:01] blood on in the upper room so that the
[1:01:04] effects of the blood could take
[1:01:06] effect so the token was applied to the
[1:01:10] home not the
[1:01:12] church the first that applies to your
[1:01:15] house this house okay I'm not just
[1:01:18] preaching tonight to your physical homes
[1:01:20] but I'm going to get to that in just a
[1:01:21] second but it's this house that the
[1:01:23] blood is applied and it's on on display
[1:01:26] and the blood is on the doorpost of the
[1:01:28] house the people of the world ought to
[1:01:30] see the results if you say you have the
[1:01:32] Holy
[1:01:33] Ghost they are seed in your life if
[1:01:36] there's no Sanctified set aart life
[1:01:39] there that's that's the second stages of
[1:01:42] Grace justification sanctification and
[1:01:44] then onto the Holy Ghost it it it brings
[1:01:46] even other things in your life but we
[1:01:48] ought to see a Sanctified life separated
[1:01:50] life it's not that you're a perfect
[1:01:52] person but overall we see a Sanctified
[1:01:55] life if you're going to claim the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost separated from the things of the
[1:01:58] world let's not water down the Holy
[1:02:01] Spirit let's leave it how it is if you
[1:02:03] don't feel like you're there then don't
[1:02:05] try to water it down and bring the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost listen to me now don't try to
[1:02:08] bring a new interpretation of the Holy
[1:02:10] Ghost to fit your lifestyle so you feel
[1:02:12] better about the sin that you're doing
[1:02:15] let's leave it as it is and let's
[1:02:17] surrender to him say Lord take my life
[1:02:19] further because obviously I've got some
[1:02:21] compromises let's not water down
[1:02:23] Salvation let's not water down the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost so the token was applied to your
[1:02:31] home and it's applied to this house Your
[1:02:33] Vessel the holy ghost in your holy ghost
[1:02:36] in your
[1:02:37] life showing that you are identified
[1:02:40] with your lamb the word right it'll show
[1:02:43] who you're identified with your life
[1:02:46] will show who you're identified
[1:02:48] with whether it's with the word or not
[1:02:51] so and that's Amen to every word of God
[1:02:53] how do I know the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:55] is there by the life that I can see that
[1:02:58] displays the word of God if the word
[1:03:00] says it then that's it this also applies
[1:03:03] though as we close brothers and sisters
[1:03:05] to our
[1:03:06] homes Exodus 12 is not applied to the
[1:03:08] church or the synagogue it's applied to
[1:03:10] the home and so that tells us there is
[1:03:13] there's actions to what we believe that
[1:03:17] we uh administer in our home based upon
[1:03:20] what we believe and one of the things
[1:03:21] the prophet taught us in the token here
[1:03:23] is and I'm going to read a couple quotes
[1:03:25] and we'll close the end time is one of
[1:03:27] an application of the token just like
[1:03:29] that evening was that it wasn't just
[1:03:31] having the blood in your home but it was
[1:03:33] applying the blood right it wasn't just
[1:03:37] and this is the hour of the application
[1:03:40] of the
[1:03:41] blood if there ever was an hour for it
[1:03:43] this is the hour of the app not just
[1:03:45] believing the blood but the application
[1:03:48] of the blood and because of that that's
[1:03:50] what led the prophet to say things like
[1:03:52] this in Egypt when they went down to
[1:03:55] Jericho if you want to read this in Acts
[1:03:57] 6631 excuse me not in Egypt but in uh in
[1:04:00] Jericho acts 1631 Paul told the
[1:04:02] Centurion believe I am the Messenger of
[1:04:05] the hour believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ thou and thy house shall be saved
[1:04:08] that's right believe for your house
[1:04:10] bring them all under and now you've seen
[1:04:12] the god of Heaven perform a miracle it's
[1:04:14] before judgment do you believe it yes
[1:04:16] what can I do and he said rise and be
[1:04:17] baptized Paul took him out baptized him
[1:04:19] said now believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:21] Christ and thou and thy house shall be
[1:04:24] saved so we have the ability to be able
[1:04:27] to believe for us but to believe for our
[1:04:29] house as well to believe for our
[1:04:31] children this effect can go to our
[1:04:32] children as
[1:04:33] well believe what believe the Lord Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ for your house apply the token to
[1:04:39] your house then what do I do when you
[1:04:41] apply it to your house move all of the
[1:04:44] trash out so now where's now is where
[1:04:46] this application comes now is not where
[1:04:49] this home is like a a Bible believing
[1:04:51] home that says Do You Believe In The
[1:04:53] Blood yes I believe in the blood do you
[1:04:55] believe this this yes I believe in that
[1:04:57] no it's a home that actually when light
[1:05:00] is shined on a thing in the word that
[1:05:01] they need to do they apply it they go do
[1:05:05] it say uh children you know uh God
[1:05:09] showed me something in the word we
[1:05:10] haven't been doing this for years but I
[1:05:11] can see it clear now in the word it's
[1:05:13] what we should do and so we're cleaning
[1:05:15] up this place around here that's the
[1:05:17] application of the blood token applied
[1:05:19] to your home he says move all the trash
[1:05:21] out get all the short
[1:05:24] skirts amen
[1:05:28] catch the theme Now Catch the theme it's
[1:05:31] the blood it's the application of the
[1:05:33] blood and these things that work their
[1:05:36] way in obviously are not in harmony
[1:05:40] right are not in harmony with a home
[1:05:43] that's Christ centered and following the
[1:05:45] word that's right get the short skirts
[1:05:48] out the shorts the cards the cigarettes
[1:05:51] the televisions and whatever more and
[1:05:53] kick them out the door when you go to
[1:05:54] apply the token
[1:05:56] you won't stand for it yes sir take it
[1:05:57] all out all the dances the parties the
[1:06:00] rock and roll can you say Amen to that
[1:06:03] all the vgar newspapers and the stuff
[1:06:05] that's of the world kick it out the door
[1:06:07] and say we're cleaning up this place
[1:06:09] around here if you don't feel like
[1:06:12] you're in a spiritual Revival this may
[1:06:14] be the reason that you don't realize you
[1:06:15] have to apply the token to your
[1:06:17] home that's right if you feel
[1:06:19] spiritually destitute maybe this is the
[1:06:21] part of your life that you haven't
[1:06:23] applied is that we're cleaning up this
[1:06:25] place around here and getting this stuff
[1:06:26] out and like Jacob did he told his wife
[1:06:29] he said wash your clothes and everything
[1:06:30] put away them gobs we're going over
[1:06:32] Jordan you know when Joshua said when he
[1:06:33] was crossing over he said wash your
[1:06:35] clothes come not at your wives when they
[1:06:37] crossed Jordan there was a
[1:06:39] sanctification there and say we're
[1:06:40] getting ready to go over so get ready
[1:06:42] for within three weeks across Jordan
[1:06:44] he's getting ready was applying the
[1:06:46] token that's what he was doing some
[1:06:47] actions had to be taken we're getting
[1:06:49] ready across door he brings it all
[1:06:51] through the Bible there he shows he
[1:06:53] shows two examples showing us that that
[1:06:56] that theme of actions to sanctify your
[1:06:59] life something's coming up that night
[1:07:01] I'd say something was coming up the
[1:07:02] death angel was passing through the L
[1:07:04] amen that's pretty important right and
[1:07:06] friends we're living in in in we're
[1:07:08] living in the the last Dark Hour here
[1:07:12] this is almost over in fact I pray that
[1:07:14] it's over sooner than later I even so
[1:07:16] come quickly Lord
[1:07:18] Jesus but there was a preparation of
[1:07:21] those who were looking for him to come
[1:07:23] to sanctify their lives applying this to
[1:07:25] their lives in preparation for that come
[1:07:27] it's it's in the Bible it's in the Bible
[1:07:29] he says let your family let your loved
[1:07:31] ones let them now this is the part that
[1:07:34] if you give me three more minutes I
[1:07:37] don't like to leave this part out of
[1:07:39] applying the token because usually we
[1:07:40] only hear kick the TVs out kick the
[1:07:42] short skirts out kick them out do it
[1:07:44] apply it and it kind of gives this
[1:07:46] impression that there's this real
[1:07:47] arrogant dad that's just going through
[1:07:49] the home and throwing out stereos and
[1:07:51] you know just yeah get this stuff out of
[1:07:54] here
[1:07:56] so I want to read the rest of the quotes
[1:08:00] amen CU there's something wrong with
[1:08:02] that picture matter of fact you're not
[1:08:03] going to have much respect for your
[1:08:04] family if you do it that way but so many
[1:08:06] years in the message friends that's the
[1:08:08] way it was done there was divorces took
[1:08:10] place because the way the guy thought he
[1:08:11] was applying the token to his home wife
[1:08:13] said I don't even proud of that I don't
[1:08:14] see any Christ in that
[1:08:19] right had had had men confess to me says
[1:08:23] I lost my wife because of the wrong way
[1:08:25] of applying the word of
[1:08:28] God tried to repent tried to repair it
[1:08:30] just couldn't be repaired damage already
[1:08:32] done a Zeal without
[1:08:35] knowledge that's
[1:08:37] right but he says get ready apply it
[1:08:40] believe it clean up let your children
[1:08:42] let your family let your loved ones see
[1:08:44] it in you that's right it'll take effect
[1:08:46] yes sir then apply the token in prayer
[1:08:49] with consideration with believing apply
[1:08:53] it with such love and so forth
[1:08:56] wow till you know it's going to take
[1:08:59] effect it's going to take place that's
[1:09:01] all apply it in confidence believing
[1:09:03] it's going to help when you talk to that
[1:09:05] child when you talk to your husband talk
[1:09:08] to your wife talk to this loved one
[1:09:10] believe that it's going to help them
[1:09:12] just stand there and say Lord I've
[1:09:13] claimed them they're mine I'm getting
[1:09:16] them for you now there's a spirit of
[1:09:17] prayer and the spirit of love to apply
[1:09:19] the token because this isn't about you
[1:09:22] this isn't about you it's about applying
[1:09:24] the token the presence of God in your
[1:09:26] life I want to bring the presence of the
[1:09:27] Lord more in my home I want to bring the

[1:10:56] the Lord let's pray together Heavenly
[1:10:59] Father we feel your presence here
[1:11:01] tonight the teacher the ultimate teacher
[1:11:03] Jesus Christ we feel you in our midst
[1:11:06] and we pray Lord that Revelation would
[1:11:08] drop in the hearts of the people and
[1:11:11] that your Holy Spirit could lead your
[1:11:12] people in the times we live in that the
[1:11:15] homes could be blessed and the marriages
[1:11:17] could be blessed and the children Lord
[1:11:20] and and the teenagers Lord coming along
[1:11:23] in the word of God and I realize there's
[1:11:26] different family situations and
[1:11:27] different things that have been broke up
[1:11:30] and Lord we continue to pray for those
[1:11:32] who've left the faith and left the the
[1:11:35] the the things that they once held dear
[1:11:38] many friends Lord have walked away from
[1:11:41] things they taught me things they taught
[1:11:43] me they've walked away from them that's
[1:11:44] a hard hard thing but we pray for them
[1:11:47] Lord we pray that your love would be
[1:11:50] extended to them Lord the the blindness
[1:11:53] of their eyes it would be lifted off off
[1:11:55] their eyes that they could see
[1:11:57] again we realize because of things
[1:11:59] sometimes the homes can have different
[1:12:01] situations we have single moms raising
[1:12:03] their kids here Lord and we have sister
[1:12:06] inz who lives with an unbelieving
[1:12:08] husband and so Lord every situation you
[1:12:10] can bless the families you can still
[1:12:13] bring a blessing to them Lord when they
[1:12:15] follow the word of God with all of their
[1:12:17] heart when they have the fear of God for
[1:12:20] the principles of God and they follow
[1:12:23] those precepts then Lord we know there's
[1:12:26] a blessing that goes with that so we ask
[1:12:29] that I ask it for my family my four
[1:12:31] children here my wife I ask it for the
[1:12:33] families of the church I just pray Lord
[1:12:36] that this series on Wednesday nights

[1:12:43] hear it may the Holy Spirit go forth
[1:12:46] from this Pulpit Lord from my life and
[1:12:49] my heart may it go into their
[1:12:52] homes take things that are broken up and
[1:12:55] heal them Lord I pray bring the power of
[1:12:59] your blood in their lives Lord father
