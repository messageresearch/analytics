[0:25] that we need if we're hungry so
[0:28] if you're available we'll certainly do
[0:29] our part to provide it here
[0:32] amen first peter chapter 3 and verse 7
[0:35] will read tonight
[0:37] and don't forget our evangelists chris
[0:39] cathy brother chris kathy coming in
[0:41] sunday morning and sunday night we've
[0:43] had him once before i know you'll really
[0:44] enjoy him
[0:45] and he'll be with us sunday morning
[0:48] and uh on sunday night for six o'clock
[0:50] tri-state youth meeting so you're all
[0:52] welcome to that but it's brother
[0:54] chris kathy is evangelist from
[0:55] jeffersonville we've had him before and
[0:58] we know that we'll enjoy his ministry
[1:00] this week and looking forward to you be
[1:01] in prayer for that god bless you i think
[1:03] that's all the announcements at this
[1:05] time
[1:06] first peter chapter 3 and verse 7.
[1:09] likewise ye husbands
[1:11] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:14] giving honor unto the wife
[1:16] as unto the weaker vessel
[1:19] and as being heirs together of the grace
[1:22] of life
[1:23] that your prayers be not hindered so
[1:26] there's a certain
[1:27] violation
[1:28] of respect
[1:30] that can take place
[1:32] when a husband does not view his wife
[1:35] correctly
[1:36] there's a certain violation of respect
[1:39] and so the scripture deals with it very
[1:41] clearly and this will coincide with my
[1:44] subject sunday on oneness and my series
[1:46] on oneness and i want to get into
[1:48] particulars here a little bit but in the
[1:50] marriage relationship and in the husband
[1:52] and wife relationship a godly husband or
[1:55] a god-man
[1:56] must with respect and honor look at the
[1:59] wife properly as being the wake your
[2:00] vessel but at the same time realizing
[2:02] that you're heirs together of the grace
[2:05] of life that your prayers may be not
[2:08] hindered so there is a violation of
[2:10] something that a husband can do by
[2:12] simply not looking at his wife with the
[2:14] right balance and thus brings dishonor
[2:17] uh because he uses the word honor
[2:20] excuse me use the word dwelling with
[2:22] them according to knowledge honoring of
[2:24] the white uses the word honor and as
[2:26] under the weaker vessel as being ears
[2:28] together so there's a oneness with god
[2:31] and there's a oneness with one another
[2:33] and that never changes even though her
[2:36] vessel is the weaker vessel so if a man
[2:38] does not look at that right he will not
[2:41] respect her right and thus his prayers
[2:44] to god will be hindered
[2:47] i'm not hearing any echoing amens in
[2:49] here
[2:50] but it's the truth nonetheless
[2:53] and so if we apply that to all
[2:55] relationships and that's what i'm
[2:56] speaking on relationships if we apply
[2:58] that now then we have to have an
[3:00] understanding of who each member in the
[3:03] body of christ is in order for the
[3:05] respect level to stay very high
[3:08] because if we lose respect then we've
[3:11] lost something in the sense of how we
[3:13] view that person everybody understand
[3:16] so then it goes on to say finally
[3:19] be of all one mind be ye of all one mind
[3:22] having compassion one of another
[3:24] love is brethren be pitiful be courteous
[3:27] not rendering evil for evil somebody did
[3:29] me wrong i'm gonna do them wrong back no
[3:31] no that's not what we do
[3:33] or railing for railing but contrary wise
[3:36] blessings so somebody does you bad we
[3:37] send them back a blessing oh
[3:39] wow
[3:41] knowing that ye there they're they're
[3:43] unto called you're they're too called
[3:46] that ye should inherit a blessing for he
[3:49] that will love life and see good days
[3:52] let him refrain his tongue
[3:54] from evil and his lips that speak no
[3:58] guile
[3:59] let him eschew evil
[4:01] and do good
[4:02] let him seek
[4:04] peace
[4:05] and ensue it this is about relationships
[4:09] it's about relationships it's all about
[4:11] relationship we say well who with
[4:13] everybody
[4:14] this is how we christians view things
[4:16] and he says things like he that will
[4:18] love life how many how many love life
[4:20] and want to have a good life
[4:22] all right a few of us for he that will
[4:24] love life and see good days let him
[4:27] refrain his tongue from evil what you
[4:30] say
[4:31] can be tied to the quality
[4:34] of life
[4:38] for what that he will love life and see
[4:40] good days let him refrain his tongue
[4:41] from evil so what we say is important
[4:43] and his lips from that they speak no guy
[4:46] let him eschew evil run from evil and do
[4:49] good let him seek peace if you want
[4:51] relationships we're the one that's
[4:53] always seeking peace reconciliation
[4:57] whatever we have to do can you say amen
[5:00] praise the lord father bless your word
[5:01] tonight as we administer it through your
[5:03] holy spirit may we step out of the way
[5:05] and be you use the gift that you've
[5:07] given me
[5:08] to feed your people and we ask it in
[5:10] jesus name amen god bless you may be
[5:12] seated tonight
[5:16] i want to just before i go into this
[5:18] subject tonight i want to go back and
[5:21] echo two points from sunday just in case
[5:23] if you're a preacher you understand
[5:25] sometimes
[5:26] um
[5:28] that you preach something and you say
[5:30] did i nail that down enough did i
[5:31] summarize that did i get to the point so
[5:34] i'm gonna echo so i feel better so i'm
[5:36] gonna echo a little bit a couple points
[5:37] that i preach sunday so that we
[5:39] understand
[5:41] when first of all when jesus gave his
[5:43] final words of what the church will do i
[5:46] talked about three or four of them when
[5:48] he left this earth at least in his
[5:49] physical body he gave instructions to
[5:52] the church he gave where the church will
[5:53] go
[5:54] and one of them was the great commission
[5:56] and i was i wanted to make the clear
[5:58] point
[5:59] that the commission was not just to
[6:01] certain believers it wasn't just to
[6:03] apostles the great commission of go into
[6:05] the world and preach the gospel and cast
[6:08] out devils and they shall lay hands on
[6:09] the sick and they shall recover that
[6:11] commission is to every holy ghost-filled
[6:13] believer there's no exceptions to it can
[6:16] you say amen so i wanted to make the
[6:18] point that another can another prophecy
[6:21] he gave for the church is what i'm
[6:23] preaching on is that when he said that
[6:25] they will receive my glory and they will
[6:28] become one with one another as we are
[6:31] one the father and the son
[6:33] they will become one with us
[6:36] excuse me not with us but with christ
[6:38] and they will become one with one
[6:40] another that's a prophecy but that's
[6:42] jesus prophesying this jesus saying this
[6:45] is what the church will become my point
[6:47] just like the great commission it's not
[6:49] just to certain ones to become one with
[6:51] one another it's all holy ghost-filled
[6:54] believers and whether we think it's
[6:56] going to happen or not it doesn't matter
[6:58] it's going to happen because jesus said
[7:00] it and if jesus said it that settles it
[7:04] so no matter how bad it looks he said i
[7:06] don't we're never going to come into
[7:07] unity in this in this message well it's
[7:09] just it seems so divided well that's
[7:11] looking in the negative side i'm looking
[7:13] at what jesus said and i'm looking at
[7:15] the local congregation more than even
[7:18] nationwide or worldwide let it start at
[7:20] home he said because of the glory coming
[7:24] into the church they will become one can
[7:27] you say amen
[7:29] so there's no exceptions you can't say
[7:31] well i don't have to participate in that
[7:33] even though i want to be a sunday
[7:34] morning christian at the church i don't
[7:35] have to pray no no this is by the holy
[7:37] ghost and if you say you have the holy
[7:39] spirit and the holy spirit's number one
[7:41] evidence that the evidence of the holy
[7:43] spirit is to believe the word from your
[7:46] heart forever for the age that you live
[7:47] in and if you believe that i believe
[7:49] every word then i just read to you jesus
[7:52] word for the church especially at the
[7:54] end time when it is the day of oneness
[7:57] he said at that day ye shall know i and
[7:59] the father i and you you and me at that
[8:03] day they will become one
[8:05] and under that revelation there are no
[8:08] exceptions to just certain people that's
[8:10] why i love what brother josiah preached
[8:12] a few weeks ago and the sermons have
[8:14] been coming along into jesus life and
[8:16] how he responded to people treating him
[8:18] bad and all these other things and a
[8:20] local level with family and a
[8:21] congregation we have to realize the holy
[8:24] ghost is trying to do something in us
[8:26] he's trying to work deeper in us and it
[8:28] never produces just an island to
[8:30] yourself i'll go to heaven and i don't
[8:32] need anybody else i'm sorry brother and
[8:34] sister it just doesn't work that way he
[8:37] said we would become one as him and the
[8:39] father were one can i get an amen
[8:43] the second echo i want to give from
[8:44] sunday is isaiah 53 and it was
[8:47] interesting to see
[8:49] someone had suggested to listen to
[8:50] brother donny from sunday morning he was
[8:52] on the same scripture as i was isaiah 53
[8:55] making some wonderful points but here's
[8:57] the point i was making out of it is god
[9:00] was pleased and satisfied with the
[9:03] offering and the sacrifice of christ
[9:06] he was pleased that's the word he was
[9:08] pleased to see him bruised god was
[9:11] pleased he was satisfied with that
[9:14] sacrifice and why was god satisfied with
[9:17] that sacrifice why would god even be
[9:19] happy about suffering it's not it's not
[9:21] that we have a god that just says i love
[9:24] when people suffer i like to make people
[9:26] suffer no no that doesn't have anywhere
[9:27] where it's going but when he sees the
[9:30] sacrifice of christ laying down his life
[9:33] by his own choice can you say amen but
[9:35] here's why it's it is god is here's why
[9:38] he's pleased with it god is pleased and
[9:40] satisfied with the offering or sacrifice
[9:44] that dies to self in order to restore
[9:47] relationship and bring true oneness
[9:52] because christ
[9:53] in his suffering would bring many sons
[9:56] many sons to glory as well so god is
[10:00] satisfied because this decision that
[10:02] christ has made i'm satisfied i'm
[10:05] breathing this in this suffering this
[10:07] pain this thorn in his
[10:09] crown all these other things taken place
[10:12] god was satisfied why not just because
[10:14] of suffering this suffering restored
[10:17] relationship with god and man this
[10:19] suffering broke the middle walls of
[10:21] petition between us this suffering
[10:24] brought better relationship not just
[10:26] better but brought man back one with god
[10:29] this suffering would open a way for them
[10:32] to receive the actual holy ghost in
[10:34] their soul without calvary you had no
[10:38] place to receive the holy ghost
[10:40] but because somebody suffered it would
[10:43] burn out the sin it would burn out the
[10:45] defiling serpent nature and replace it
[10:47] with what the very nature of god and
[10:50] what happens when you have the nature of
[10:52] god in you you have the same nature as
[10:54] the author written in the word and you
[10:56] as the same nature as the other person
[10:57] sitting next to you that has the holy
[10:59] ghost that's how you can become one with
[11:02] them
[11:03] not because you agree on everything
[11:05] intellectually but because by the same
[11:07] nature if i have the nature of christ
[11:10] within me
[11:11] i don't have any problem being one with
[11:13] him
[11:14] because by nature
[11:16] i have been bonded
[11:18] and bonded is such a a just a very
[11:21] surface word to use in this this is a
[11:24] oneness that no man can achieve this is
[11:28] won by spirit i am one with him because
[11:32] i have his spirit within me tonight
[11:36] you talk about relationship
[11:38] that's not two spirits trying to get
[11:40] along that's becoming one because you
[11:42] are the same spirit that's why tonight i
[11:43] can say amen to the word of god that's
[11:45] why since 16 years old i have no problem
[11:47] saying him into the world to the to the
[11:49] word i have no problem with it something
[11:51] resonates with you every time you hear
[11:52] the word and even when i'm convicted i
[11:55] have no problem responding i trust it if
[11:58] if the word takes the height off of my
[11:59] back or encourages encourages me and i'm
[12:02] on cloud nine for the weak it doesn't
[12:05] matter there's an amender down here he
[12:07] put it there can you say man that's why
[12:10] i can say amen to the world there's no
[12:11] resistance down here my flesh sometimes
[12:13] says
[12:16] that's probably the way it sounds but
[12:18] but my soul is always saying that's hard
[12:21] in my flesh but it's a man amen that's
[12:24] me i love that that's me yes that's my
[12:26] husband christ i'm his wife and i say
[12:29] amen and i submit to that word there is
[12:32] no resistance in my soul
[12:36] because i've met the author and i have
[12:38] the author living in me
[12:42] so because god was satisfied with that
[12:45] sacrifice that was explained in isaiah
[12:47] 53 he was pleased to bruise him
[12:50] in order to restore relationship then we
[12:52] learn something
[12:55] that there is a suffering and sacrifice
[12:58] that is made
[12:59] when you want to make relationships
[13:00] better
[13:05] now
[13:06] let's let's just say this
[13:08] if you
[13:09] reach out christ-like and you
[13:12] go through prayer i want to reconcile i
[13:15] want to restore i want to see things
[13:17] reconciled in a relationship that's
[13:19] wrong and bad someone did me wrong
[13:20] whatever it is i did them wrong
[13:24] they may not always respond right
[13:27] right away
[13:30] did we all respond right away
[13:33] to the lord
[13:36] some did some right away but some of you
[13:38] man you took a long time
[13:42] and it was god's love that went to
[13:43] calvary for you it was god's love that
[13:45] wouldn't found you it was god's love
[13:47] reaching out to you when you were
[13:49] rebuked for for your earrings and your
[13:51] short dresses and your makeup and all
[13:53] this stuff and you came in the first
[13:55] service and the preacher just whipped
[13:57] all that stuff when you come in there
[13:59] you didn't feel you so much you didn't
[14:01] feel so much it was the love of god but
[14:03] yet if there's something within you that
[14:06] changes you
[14:07] can you say man and that's that's my
[14:09] husband talking
[14:11] sister uh there's a sister of her name
[14:13] on wendy sister lindsay she visits here
[14:15] she goes to brother um
[14:18] help me out over here in akron
[14:20] and
[14:22] she said that uh
[14:24] first service she went to and here she's
[14:26] in the world and everything and she went
[14:27] to here brother brother isaiah brooks
[14:29] and lima he was the pastor there at the
[14:31] time and the first service brother
[14:32] isaiah was on he was on the dress code
[14:35] and he was bringing out the message of
[14:36] what what a woman should wear what a man
[14:38] should wear he was just bringing it down
[14:39] the line
[14:40] and i think he's a little bit like me
[14:42] where that we don't preach that every
[14:44] service but this service he was going at
[14:46] it and he was he was doing it and that's
[14:47] the first service you come and a lot of
[14:49] times we christians were kind of
[14:50] cringing saying
[14:52] does it have to be this service
[14:55] you're going to run them away well
[14:56] probably 90 you'll run away but
[14:59] wendy sat there
[15:01] and she said she testifies
[15:03] everything he preached on i was wearing.
[15:08] and he doesn't know her
[15:10] but god knows her
[15:12] had that man come in you know i've had
[15:14] visitors come that are catholics and for
[15:16] some reason sometimes they come and
[15:18] visit and somebody will call me and say
[15:19] uh sometimes but sometimes they won't i
[15:21] don't know who's there and that's the
[15:23] service i just you know take apart the
[15:25] system of the catholic church and
[15:27] they're there and you're going oh oh no
[15:28] don't do it don't don't
[15:30] don't say it you know
[15:32] but there's been people delivered that's
[15:35] right
[15:37] all of a sudden sister wendy was
[15:38] delivered that night
[15:40] gave her heart to god wonderful sister
[15:43] full of the holy ghost
[15:45] so don't be afraid of this word
[15:47] don't be afraid because why it's not
[15:49] them intellectually changing it's a
[15:52] nature change and when the nature
[15:53] changes
[15:55] something says amen to the word of god
[15:57] and something lines up with the word of
[15:59] god they don't have a problem getting
[16:01] rid of the makeup they don't have a
[16:02] problem getting with the short skirts
[16:04] and the earrings what the word speaks
[16:06] against can i get an amen here tonight
[16:09] there's not a lot of amen sometimes even
[16:11] people around the message anymore it's
[16:13] still the word it's still the truth and
[16:15] when you have the nature of god you
[16:17] don't have a resistance in your soul to
[16:19] that it's amen sometimes it's ouch but
[16:22] there's an amen that says that's my
[16:24] husband speaking and he's telling me
[16:27] as a daughter of god what i wear
[16:31] not the magazines telling me what to
[16:33] wear
[16:36] they may not respond right that was my
[16:38] point i'm i'm still bringing my points
[16:40] from sunday and i haven't got my message
[16:41] tonight so this is a problem they may
[16:44] not respond right right away when you go
[16:46] for relationship and
[16:48] reconcile you some people don't respond
[16:51] right away to god
[16:53] how many years did it take some of you
[16:55] and god dealt with you and you're a
[16:57] little kid
[16:58] but now it's just later on finally you
[17:00] responded how many can raise your hand
[17:01] it was that way
[17:02] so in when when god's reaching out to
[17:04] restore a relationship he goes to
[17:06] calvary and he starts to move on you by
[17:08] the holy spirit and you it's not
[17:10] everybody that responds to being
[17:12] reconciled by right away
[17:14] so if that applies with god dealing with
[17:16] us it applies when we bring a
[17:18] christ-like spirit to say i'm going to
[17:20] sacrifice i don't want to be
[17:22] self-focused here i'm going to make
[17:23] right what i've done wrong but i want to
[17:25] have an open conversation with somebody
[17:27] and i want to talk to them i want to say
[17:28] to them listen is there anything i can
[17:31] do to make our relationship better is
[17:33] there anything i can do to restore
[17:36] what's been lost years ago is there
[17:38] anything that can be done and when you
[17:40] start asking questions like that and you
[17:42] start oh being open like that you may
[17:44] not always get the response back because
[17:46] the holy spirit has to do it in their
[17:48] life too
[17:49] but nevertheless christ reached out when
[17:52] while we were yet sinners christ died
[17:54] for us
[17:56] praise the lord
[18:00] all right now
[18:01] uh 7 46 i'm just beginning my sermon for
[18:04] tonight then
[18:05] if you're counting time
[18:09] i want to speak tonight
[18:11] shortly on oneness
[18:13] working
[18:14] in different vessels
[18:16] okay how does this work
[18:18] oneness working in different vessels
[18:20] because guess what we're all
[18:22] different vessels just like i bring out
[18:25] about the husband and wife and paul's
[18:26] addressing peter's addressing paul
[18:29] addressed it peter addressed it and he's
[18:30] talking about the differences in in
[18:32] husbands and wife and she even in her
[18:34] vessel in her vessel is the weaker
[18:37] vessel but how many know that she's not
[18:39] the weaker wrestle when it comes to
[18:40] spirit one with god and one with one
[18:42] another the oneness that's not a weaker
[18:44] vessel but the vessel itself that's a
[18:46] weaker vessel how many knows that
[18:48] so now i i want to talk about how
[18:50] oneness works in different vessels
[18:52] because you know we are all different
[18:54] vessels we are all different
[18:56] personalities your personality is not
[18:59] sin it's before i get into sin in
[19:01] person's life because sin when you cross
[19:04] over after the garden everything comes
[19:06] into relationships all relationships are
[19:08] broken down they don't have the
[19:09] potential anymore to be what they were
[19:11] in the garden of eden before
[19:13] jealousy comes in hatred comes in
[19:16] blaming comes in
[19:18] the glory of god departs from them
[19:20] there's nothing there to work off of as
[19:22] far as oneness with other people and
[19:24] your husband and wife it's gone it's
[19:25] gone that's why today without god
[19:27] without the glory of god it's difficult
[19:30] to hold a marriage together
[19:33] because he's the one that created
[19:34] marriage right and we don't have an
[19:36] understanding have the glory of god
[19:37] we're just working off an intellect and
[19:40] surviving basically but you see now
[19:42] there's something greater than surviving
[19:44] there's overcoming there's the glory of
[19:45] god and when it comes into our life then
[19:47] we have something getting us back so i'm
[19:50] not even in the next few weeks i'll get
[19:52] into the sin part because there are
[19:54] normal things
[19:56] that are happening still today in
[19:57] relationships that we're still calling
[20:00] normal
[20:01] but they're normal under after the fall
[20:04] and after sin
[20:07] okay and we're still doing some of those
[20:10] things because we've been taught that's
[20:12] normal but we've been taught by
[20:13] hollywood the movies you watched
[20:15] whatever you were taught and so it's
[20:17] ingrained in your system this is normal
[20:19] this is how i treat another person this
[20:21] is how i act this is how i respond but
[20:23] there were
[20:24] things that happened under the fall
[20:26] like blaming one another like jealousy
[20:28] like sin like like all those things came
[20:31] from the fall they didn't come from
[20:32] before the fall they came after and so
[20:34] now we need to look at whatever's
[20:36] happening under sin we need to at least
[20:38] say if i'm doing that wait a minute god
[20:40] you're teaching me this isn't normal
[20:42] this is an order to normal to be a rage
[20:45] of anger in front of my children and in
[20:48] a range of anger just yelling in their
[20:50] face and anger and belittling them and
[20:53] and and belittling their character let
[20:56] me tell you brother whoever you are or
[20:58] sister that's not normal
[21:01] that's not normal that's not normal
[21:03] behavior for a christian
[21:05] if you make a mistake bring it under the
[21:06] cross when when that's a pattern and
[21:08] it's broken relationships your whole
[21:10] your whole wife your whole life
[21:14] you need to really look at your
[21:15] experience with god
[21:17] because the glory of the lord would be
[21:18] changing that
[21:20] that's under the fall
[21:21] that's treatment of other relationships
[21:24] under the fall that's not when the glory
[21:26] of god comes in
[21:28] it begins to change
[21:31] how many remember that from sunday from
[21:33] glory to glory he's changing me
[21:36] so what's it changing
[21:38] the nature of the fall was the serpent
[21:40] nature all that came with it uh
[21:42] just all the separations all the break
[21:44] up all the broken relationship with god
[21:46] everything come from the fall now
[21:48] because of coward the glory of god comes
[21:50] back to his church comes in by the holy
[21:53] ghost and now we come into a process now
[21:56] of by nature saying i'm reversing god's
[21:58] saying i'm reversing all these patterns
[22:01] that broke relationship and you've got
[22:03] something within you that builds strong
[22:06] relationships by the holy ghost
[22:09] hallelujah
[22:11] you got something that reconciles
[22:12] relationship that's you you've got
[22:13] something what do i do i look to the
[22:15] word this is what i need to do in this
[22:16] situation what i do this person that
[22:18] hates me the word tells you what to do
[22:20] if you get rebellious to say i'm going
[22:22] to do it my own way i'm you know i'm
[22:23] going to no no no
[22:25] we're under the glory of god here
[22:27] and from glory and glory he's changing
[22:29] us can you say amen
[22:31] so now you know
[22:33] we're living in the day
[22:36] at that day you shall know i and the
[22:38] father
[22:39] i knew you and me them and one another
[22:42] oneness we're living in the day of
[22:44] oneness
[22:45] and intimacy with the lord
[22:48] please don't read that word intimacy
[22:49] wrong the world has made it the sexual
[22:52] experience or whatever intimacy is a
[22:54] complete open relationship without walls
[22:57] there's no hindrances there's no walls
[23:00] we're living in the day being restored
[23:02] back to true oneness with god in one
[23:04] another and true intimacy with god and
[23:08] with one another
[23:09] no walls a relationship without walls
[23:14] you know friends and that's that's the
[23:16] revival
[23:18] that i'm looking for
[23:20] in our lives
[23:23] people talk about revival taking god
[23:25] this that and i'm i rejoice in any
[23:28] rejoicing of the word of god
[23:30] i mean if god chan whatever god can
[23:33] change the atmosphere in any service and
[23:34] do whatever he wants to do
[23:36] but if you want to know your pastor what
[23:38] kind of revival he's looking for
[23:40] i'm looking for a revival
[23:42] to come to the true oneness it's a
[23:45] revival to me when someone truly
[23:47] forgives another christian
[23:51] when believers come into oneness and die
[23:53] to themselves i'm wondering after
[23:55] sunday's service
[23:56] i wonder how many brothers went down and
[23:59] sat with their families this week and
[24:01] said after what was preached i'd like to
[24:04] sit down and talk with you and i'd like
[24:06] to have an open relationship how many
[24:08] brothers did it to their wives i'm not
[24:09] saying you had to do it i'm just
[24:11] wondering what effect this is having
[24:12] because we can not in church all we want
[24:15] to
[24:16] but if we are serious with god then we
[24:19] say now i'm going to be open with my
[24:21] family with my wife and i'm going to say
[24:23] what can i do to make the relationship
[24:25] better what have i done is there any
[24:27] walls up here that we can tear down so
[24:30] satan quits getting the glory
[24:34] i'm not saying that to be because
[24:36] probably most didn't do it and i'm not
[24:37] putting you down with that but i'm
[24:39] asking you is that what are we taking
[24:41] from this series in relationships to go
[24:43] ahead and go the way of calvary and the
[24:45] cross and say i'm going to go the
[24:47] suffering in the hard way a way that
[24:49] god's pleased with because if there is a
[24:51] reconciling a relationship at the end of
[24:53] it god is satisfied
[24:55] if that's a suffering thing to do god is
[24:57] satisfied
[25:00] praise the lord
[25:02] i think it's a revival when someone
[25:03] forgives someone when believers come
[25:05] into oneness and die to themselves for a
[25:07] greater oneness in their marriage and
[25:09] family and others
[25:10] that's also what jesus said the church
[25:12] would come to not just the great
[25:14] commission not just casting out devils
[25:17] not just if they drink any deadly thing
[25:20] not just they shall lay hands on the
[25:22] sick and they shall recover he said they
[25:24] will become one as we are one that's
[25:28] part of the end time revival
[25:30] can i get an amen tonight don't forget
[25:33] oneness is a part of the end time
[25:35] revival it's not just laying on hands
[25:38] it's not just healing lines that's all
[25:40] part of it the supernatural needs to
[25:42] show himself in the church of god a book
[25:45] of acts church repeated again
[25:48] can you say amen friends
[25:50] but don't forget the book of acts church
[25:53] it wasn't just all miracles when someone
[25:55] lied to the holy ghost they got in
[25:57] trouble for it
[25:59] don't forget the book of acts church
[26:00] they sold all their goods because they
[26:02] were trying to meet the need in someone
[26:04] else there was other things working in
[26:06] the book of acts church and jesus said
[26:08] at the end they will become one as we
[26:10] are one that's the revival that i am
[26:13] looking for and this word i believe will
[26:15] produce it can you say amen
[26:17] now i wanted to say here that god
[26:20] created us a relational
[26:22] being
[26:23] in the beginning
[26:25] god created you a relational being what
[26:27] do you believe what do you where'd you
[26:29] get that
[26:30] it is not good for man to be alone and i
[26:33] use man not just in the sense of the
[26:35] brothers but the sisters because
[26:36] remember they were together as one
[26:38] spirit
[26:39] masculine feminine right
[26:42] so then he says it is not good then he
[26:44] puts him in two vessels then then he has
[26:46] adam there it is not good for man to be
[26:49] alone so he begins the process of taking
[26:51] the feminine part out they've never lost
[26:53] their one not oneness because when he
[26:55] took her out he said and they too
[26:59] shall a man leave his father and mother
[27:01] and cleave unto his wife and the two
[27:03] shall be won so the oneness hasn't been
[27:05] broken there's still one in spirit
[27:08] but now their vessels are different
[27:11] okay
[27:12] and so
[27:13] god has created us a relational being it
[27:16] is not good for man to be alone
[27:19] if man is detached from relationship
[27:22] with others of his kind
[27:24] it's not good and it's not of god
[27:28] if someone would say i don't need
[27:29] anybody i don't need friends
[27:32] all friends have hurt me i don't need
[27:34] any friends anymore
[27:36] i don't need people
[27:38] i had a fellow tell me one time years
[27:40] ago he says i want to come to your
[27:42] church but he says i really don't want
[27:44] to be around the people i want to come
[27:46] and hear the preaching and get in my car
[27:47] and head home i don't need people and
[27:50] he's already off track and doesn't know
[27:52] his bible because christ is living in
[27:54] his people
[27:57] something's wrong with that picture and
[27:58] i mean you don't have to be
[28:01] bffs with everybody
[28:04] but it's the body of christ it's not
[28:06] even bff it's not even best friends
[28:08] forever no it's it's the body of christ
[28:10] if you have the holy ghost they have the
[28:12] holy ghost you're one with them and you
[28:15] can't go in this thing and says i can be
[28:17] on my own an island you can't do that
[28:19] because god made you a relational being
[28:21] he said it is not good for you to be
[28:25] alone
[28:27] god made us a relational being it's not
[28:30] just about marriage we know we apply
[28:31] that to marriage and read it at weddings
[28:34] that's not good for man to be alone so
[28:35] thus he brought and helped mate and that
[28:37] suffice the marriage but look at the
[28:38] picture now it's not good for man to be
[28:40] alone he made us a relational being
[28:43] so the great one of the greater
[28:44] fellowships is to have someone that's a
[28:46] companion in life there's nothing not a
[28:48] thing wrong with that desire it's a
[28:49] wonderful desire god put that desire
[28:52] within you the problem i have as a
[28:54] pastor is people don't approach it the
[28:55] right way and they get the wrong partner
[28:57] in life
[28:58] you need to pray pray pray pray you need
[29:01] to pray until the lord shows you the
[29:03] character of the word in a guy or girl
[29:05] and you need to build a strong
[29:06] foundation for a good marriage ahead of
[29:08] time and that is you're
[29:10] very close to the lord you have the holy
[29:11] ghost
[29:12] both are very close to the lord have the
[29:14] holy ghost and then you reach to that
[29:15] desire to have a husband or wife no
[29:18] problem whatsoever praise the lord god
[29:20] put it there i didn't put it there and i
[29:22] wouldn't try to take it out of you
[29:24] praise the lord you want a companion for
[29:25] life i don't care if you're 40 years old
[29:27] don't stop giving giving up hope
[29:31] her name might even be hope
[29:34] don't stop giving don't start giving up
[29:36] now there's nobody for me no no don't
[29:38] you if you have that desire then you
[29:39] pray and god you might still end up
[29:41] being 50 but you still might find what
[29:44] god has for you
[29:46] and it'll be more about companionship
[29:48] then it'll just be man god's finally
[29:50] gave me my companion we've had it here
[29:52] in the church
[29:53] one thing is just don't be in a hurry at
[29:55] young ages to form this without the
[29:57] maturity in your life
[29:59] because i'm all about
[30:01] meeting the need of a husband or wife
[30:03] but i'm all totally against of doing it
[30:05] out of lust or doing it
[30:07] too quickly or doing it when you don't
[30:10] know what the character of the word is
[30:12] yet yourself
[30:14] praise the lord amen brother paul amen
[30:17] amen amen
[30:22] if someone says i don't need nobody i
[30:23] don't need friends you're denying the
[30:25] way god made you
[30:28] it's the thirst god put in us for
[30:30] fellowship for companionship for
[30:32] friendship
[30:33] this intimacy of
[30:35] wanting a relationship without walls
[30:38] god put that within us
[30:40] wanting relationships without any walls
[30:42] is a thirst god put in us to have that
[30:45] type of relationship with people is the
[30:47] cry of every heart the whole world they
[30:49] even crave for it they want it so bad
[30:52] and look at all those as i said sunday
[30:54] who marry and have a
[30:56] tragic terrible divorce and a few years
[30:59] later sometimes within months they marry
[31:01] again
[31:02] why because there's a craving for
[31:04] fellowship i don't want to be alone
[31:07] so then they go on to the next person
[31:08] without the holy ghost they probably
[31:10] might marry the wrong person the next
[31:11] time too
[31:13] you see
[31:14] so it's all about the craving on the
[31:16] inside and going to god and remember it
[31:19] wasn't
[31:20] adam walking around saying
[31:22] god
[31:24] it's not good for me to be alone
[31:27] god it's not good for me to i need a
[31:29] wife adam wasn't crying saying i need a
[31:32] wife he had something within him that
[31:33] god could see
[31:35] how do you know what a wife was
[31:39] how did he know where the helpmate was
[31:41] he didn't
[31:42] but there was
[31:43] there was a craving on the inside
[31:46] but it was adam walker's son need a wife
[31:48] i need a wife need a wife no he was
[31:50] focused on what god gave him to do in
[31:51] his kingdom he was focused on that
[31:54] but there's god that come and said adam
[31:57] it's not good for you to be alone you're
[31:58] looking at all these animals and there's
[32:00] a male part and female part they have
[32:02] fellowship they have companionship all
[32:04] these other things and now my son
[32:07] is alone it's not good i'm going to
[32:08] provide help mate for you
[32:11] god is the one that orchestrated god was
[32:14] the wedding coordinator
[32:18] god made the pre-plans
[32:23] thank you
[32:24] thank you elaine praise the lord i got
[32:26] an amen from lane
[32:28] so
[32:29] this intimacy is a thirst to have that
[32:31] type of relationship with people is a
[32:33] cry of every heart
[32:35] we start with this pure thirst within us
[32:38] for intimacy and for closeness with
[32:39] somebody
[32:40] problem is as soon as we start getting
[32:43] close we realize that there is not a
[32:46] human being on earth
[32:48] that can properly be that kind of friend
[32:52] because the human race is fallen
[32:55] and in this particular age most of us
[32:58] never
[33:01] a person or a world without the holy
[33:03] spirit
[33:05] you're going to go through damaged
[33:06] relationships and it's going to make you
[33:09] disbelieve that god can fulfill that
[33:12] desire
[33:15] we have this pure craving for intimacy
[33:18] and closeness with somebody and then we
[33:20] get burnt
[33:22] don't forget it's a burnt world don't
[33:24] forget it's a fallen world
[33:26] don't forget that human beings do not
[33:28] have it within them without the lord to
[33:31] give that type of relationship back
[33:34] and so now if you have
[33:36] if you have something real and you try
[33:39] to connect on that type of intimacy
[33:42] besides the lord with someone else if
[33:44] they don't have the same thing
[33:46] it it can never be right they can't give
[33:49] you
[33:50] what you're looking for
[33:53] the human being can't fill that without
[33:55] god
[33:57] amen
[33:58] you can have companionship you can feel
[34:00] clothes all these other things but the
[34:02] real intimacy of relationship without
[34:04] walls and there's such a oneness there
[34:07] nothing would ever tear you apart that
[34:09] comes from god he can and that's why he
[34:11] said about the marriage god said jesus
[34:13] said excuse me jesus said when he was
[34:14] here on earth he said what god
[34:17] hath joined together
[34:20] no man can put asunder that's pretty
[34:22] strong
[34:24] if you orchestrated it
[34:27] things can tear it apart
[34:29] but if god was in it then there's that
[34:31] oneness can you say amen and what god
[34:34] has
[34:35] put together let no man put asunder
[34:37] there's such a bond it goes beyond any
[34:39] of the best super glue you could ever
[34:41] talk about it's a bond can you say man
[34:43] it's a it's it's it's for life can you
[34:45] say amen
[34:47] and then what about relationship with
[34:48] christ paul said he said there's nothing
[34:51] present there's nothing in the future
[34:53] there's no death nothing can separate me
[34:56] from the love of god
[34:58] that's in jesus christ praise the lord
[35:01] so now
[35:02] we start to look for this pure thirst
[35:04] the spirit there's of this intimacy
[35:06] problem is as soon as we start getting
[35:08] close real close we realize there's not
[35:09] a human being on earth that can probably
[35:11] be that kind of friend because the human
[35:13] race has fallen especially in this age
[35:16] most of us never had balances balanced
[35:20] images of relationships
[35:22] most of us come from a generation that
[35:24] never seen too many balanced
[35:26] uh
[35:27] images of relationships
[35:30] how many would admit to that
[35:32] most of us did not come from normal
[35:35] balanced
[35:36] relationships in jesus christ most of
[35:39] this generation didn't see them so if
[35:41] you haven't seen what's normal then you
[35:44] better be a good student to the lord
[35:47] you better be in class every day
[35:51] you better give the teacher an apple
[35:54] and say i am all ears to learn what true
[35:58] relationships are and how they're normal
[36:02] in the kingdom of god
[36:04] i want to be married you better be a
[36:06] real
[36:07] sponge soaking in what the word says or
[36:10] what a marriage is
[36:11] because if you've watched too many
[36:13] disney things and too many movies and
[36:15] too many chick flicks and you have been
[36:18] on social media and you've watched the
[36:20] movie stars how they go from
[36:23] wife to wife to wife and husband to
[36:24] husband and husband within sometimes
[36:27] hours if you watch britney spears
[36:29] uh married in vegas and break it up the
[36:32] next day
[36:33] you your mind's been messed up and you
[36:35] gotta have say lord wash all that out of
[36:37] my mind and you better become a student
[36:39] that's sitting at jesus feet giving him
[36:41] an apple saying i want to learn what
[36:44] real relationships are can i get an amen
[36:47] out of somebody here tonight
[36:48] you better be a teacher before you have
[36:51] someone you want to get close to first
[36:53] be a student and have her teacher say i
[36:55] need to learn because i've been
[36:58] hindered by this generational decline
[37:02] of true relationships
[37:05] you say well i had a good mom and dad
[37:07] and even without the lord and brother
[37:09] brahm commented so what about these
[37:11] marriages with that lord praise the lord
[37:12] they come to a oneness they're committed
[37:14] to each other it can happen it can
[37:16] happen
[37:17] but it can never be fully right brother
[37:18] bram says never be fully right without
[37:20] christ because he's the one that come up
[37:22] with marriage so it can't be the holy
[37:24] spirit oneness it's just a human oneness
[37:27] it's a human coming together and being
[37:29] committed to one another praise the lord
[37:30] we have some of those but for the most
[37:31] part we're at about 60 divorce rate
[37:35] in our nation about 60 percent divorce
[37:37] rate
[37:38] so
[37:38] people don't understand the true image
[37:41] of marriage
[37:43] you don't understand it you say well i
[37:45] understand it i've been in the message
[37:46] all my life well don't be so sure be a
[37:48] student say lord teach me
[37:51] and i say
[37:52] we should be settled
[37:54] in our relationship with our lord and
[37:56] our families before we
[37:58] pursue one with someone else
[38:05] most of us never see balanced images of
[38:07] relationships we have been damaged in
[38:09] our spirit so much we can't feel it for
[38:10] someone else we can't get what like it
[38:13] get it like we want it
[38:15] we can't give it like we want so we
[38:17] can't get what we want and we can't give
[38:19] what we want until
[38:21] we have this glory of the lord by the
[38:23] holy ghost come in our lives
[38:25] and when that comes in we have something
[38:26] to work off of that he can change me and
[38:29] teach me
[38:30] what true normal relationship is
[38:34] in all relationships
[38:36] but it's in us we're built for it so we
[38:38] approach life with this innocence
[38:40] wanting in this intimacy but we get dis
[38:43] disappointed so quickly and some get so
[38:46] down they become bitter and they close
[38:48] themselves and they won't even try
[38:50] anymore because they have stopped
[38:52] believing there is such a thing as being
[38:54] real close friends and close
[38:56] relationship with no fences people have
[38:58] stopped believing it so they don't even
[39:00] try it anymore they
[39:02] you and when you do you lose your
[39:03] freedom in life you're not free the
[39:05] quality of life is tied to the quality
[39:09] of our relationships not how much we own
[39:13] not how many trucks we have not how big
[39:15] a house we have
[39:17] you could have the loveliest house and
[39:19] inside the relationships are the walls
[39:22] are all up and it's just bitterness
[39:24] can i get an amen tonight you can have
[39:26] the nicest cars you can have all the
[39:28] money in the world there's a lot of
[39:30] people have a lot of money and they have
[39:31] zero relationship there there's no
[39:34] connection with their children there's
[39:35] no connection with their wife they're
[39:37] just existing together there's some
[39:39] message homes where there's marriages
[39:41] just existing together because they are
[39:43] too embarrassed to get a divorce that's
[39:45] wrong divorce but they live in hell
[39:47] every day
[39:48] i said they live in hell every day
[39:50] because they're not willing to go the
[39:52] way of calvary to get to a better
[39:53] relationship through the holy ghost and
[39:56] through the glory of god they sit there
[39:58] for years miserable saying we're married
[40:01] we're married but it's a miserable
[40:02] situation all kinds of walls up there's
[40:05] about 10 subjects you'd never talk about
[40:08] why in a marriage is the subject you
[40:10] can't talk about there shouldn't be any
[40:11] subjects you can't talk about
[40:15] we have this cry
[40:17] and the quality of life i know some
[40:20] might disagree with this but i'm going
[40:21] to say the quality of life is tied to
[40:23] the quality of our relationships number
[40:25] one with the lord
[40:28] no relationship can be written without
[40:29] the lord so the quality of life is the
[40:32] quality of the closeness that we feel to
[40:34] the lord can i get an amen
[40:36] the quality of life is based upon the
[40:38] quality of relationships and it's not
[40:41] just the lord but it's with one another
[40:44] because if we can develop some quality
[40:46] relationships with one another by the
[40:48] holy ghost and friendships that are
[40:50] based upon the word of god i got a
[40:52] friend out here i got a friend over here
[40:53] in college and all that well that's
[40:55] great but the more you lean towards that
[40:58] is it's not going to be good for you
[40:59] because there's only so much connection
[41:01] you can wait but the friendships you
[41:03] need to form is if you're saying you've
[41:05] got this glory and holy ghost in you you
[41:07] need to form friendships with another
[41:09] member that has the same holy ghost and
[41:11] there's where you find fulfillment of
[41:13] true friendships
[41:16] can i
[41:17] you're quiet tonight but i i believe
[41:19] you're catching it amen so
[41:21] the quality of life is tied to the
[41:22] quality of our relationship that's why
[41:24] we want to say pray and say lord how can
[41:26] i make it better
[41:27] what can i do lord what what path can i
[41:30] go down i might be suffering for a while
[41:32] i might open up a conversation a person
[41:34] just get mad and cuss me out i don't
[41:36] know but lord i'm i'm so willing because
[41:38] i want to go the extra mile
[41:41] to make relationships better
[41:44] i want to tear the walls down myself and
[41:46] do everything i can it's always will be
[41:50] the cry that is within us will always be
[41:52] there it will always be there no matter
[41:54] how much you deny it and say it's not
[41:56] there there is a thirst
[41:58] for good relationships
[42:02] amen
[42:04] and there's one way we can approach this
[42:06] as as we preach sunday selfishly
[42:09] can't be so focused can't be all about
[42:11] you
[42:12] some people on social media it's all
[42:14] about three people me myself and i
[42:17] thank you jayden for posting all of my
[42:19] pictures every day this week
[42:22] if i knew you're gonna do that
[42:24] then i want a little bit more if i'm
[42:26] gonna use your phone again in a service
[42:28] i'm gonna have a lot more control over
[42:30] what happens
[42:31] he took it monday tuesday wednesday
[42:33] thursday and friday and
[42:34] today was the worst one and he posted
[42:36] them every day
[42:38] just to show i'm all about myself right
[42:43] we'll watch you boy
[42:46] but um
[42:48] it's a self-focused world
[42:50] and there are venues to feed your
[42:53] self-focused
[42:55] thing
[42:57] so much work that's to be said about it
[42:58] i've got
[43:00] article after article that shows after
[43:02] all these years of social media they say
[43:03] this is mainly what it's all about
[43:06] people are craving attention craving
[43:10] praise and they're willing to do
[43:12] anything even alter the photographs now
[43:14] i didn't do that those are real
[43:15] photographs i am that good looking jaden
[43:19] but people will spend money to alter the
[43:21] photographs
[43:22] and make them look skinny and all of
[43:24] that that's how there's a craving to be
[43:27] accepted to be appraised to get the
[43:28] likes oh you are like a movie star babe
[43:31] man wow you're something
[43:34] it's this craving to be accepted this
[43:36] craving to be loved to be praised for
[43:39] who they are
[43:40] and all the while they said here's what
[43:42] the articles say
[43:44] disappointment after disappointment they
[43:47] actually go into depression teenage
[43:48] girls going depression because why it's
[43:50] never enough
[43:52] even if you got 10 likes it's not enough
[43:55] lust is never satisfied
[43:57] you all know that right
[43:59] that's the thing with luck there's no
[44:00] another never a final satisfaction with
[44:02] lust you're just looking for the next
[44:04] thing you want the next thing whether
[44:05] it's sexual or whatever it is if you do
[44:07] one thing you're looking for the next
[44:08] thing because lust is never satisfied it
[44:10] never satisfies in here
[44:12] so you're looking for what's next what's
[44:13] next what because lust is never
[44:15] satisfied
[44:17] genuine love in the lord divine love
[44:19] there's some satisfaction there
[44:22] and so now when you have relationships
[44:25] going on then you have to realize when
[44:27] when we begin to become hurt by these
[44:29] things we have to be careful because we
[44:31] don't want to lose what god puts within
[44:33] us that there are true good healthy uh
[44:37] godly relationships that we can have
[44:39] both for marriage and everywhere else
[44:41] but we can't do it selfishly
[44:43] that i want my needs met first
[44:46] people say when i am happy
[44:49] then i then i'll do things to make
[44:50] others happy we can't do that
[44:53] some people come into a room say until
[44:55] i'm happy nobody's allowed to be happy
[44:59] amen everybody see anybody like that if
[45:02] i'm having a bad day that everybody gets
[45:03] to have a bad day
[45:05] if i if you all don't make me happy in
[45:08] some way then i'm not going to do
[45:10] anything to make you happy
[45:11] so
[45:12] opposite of laying down your life
[45:16] you know and that's the thing you might
[45:17] as well say it about church what is this
[45:19] thing
[45:20] you you listening online and you hear
[45:23] tonight what is this thing where we go
[45:25] through something depressive and we go
[45:28] through a loss or something like that
[45:30] and the first thing that goes is you
[45:32] dump out i don't want to go to church
[45:35] you can go to walmart you can go to all
[45:38] your shows on your phone to escape into
[45:41] it
[45:42] what is this thing that when we hit
[45:44] depression i don't need anybody i don't
[45:46] need to go to church
[45:48] now now that's when you need
[45:51] to be encouraged
[45:53] that's when you need to be corrected
[45:56] that's when you need a fresh water to
[45:59] draw you out of your depression
[46:01] what is this
[46:04] and then you go another path i'm just
[46:06] going to block everybody out i don't
[46:07] need anybody and that's when you're
[46:09] really saying if i'm not happy then i'm
[46:12] not going to do anything else to make
[46:13] someone ha and the truth is it's the
[46:15] other way around there's actually true
[46:17] joy
[46:18] in giving
[46:19] when you don't get it back
[46:22] you know i went over there to the gas
[46:23] station sometime and see this this
[46:26] young girl and i can tell she's got you
[46:28] know three kids in the car she's putting
[46:30] in five dollars in the tank that's i
[46:32] know she's just barely making it to get
[46:34] to her job and and and i don't say this
[46:37] to both but sometimes i just go in there
[46:40] and i go up and i put my card in and i
[46:42] fill that tank for her
[46:44] do you know there's great joy in doing
[46:46] that
[46:49] and you make your account suffer and
[46:51] someone else gets happy because of it
[46:54] you see in the kingdom of god it's the
[46:56] other way around
[46:58] it's when we give
[47:00] unselfishly
[47:02] that we find satisfaction in life
[47:06] you're coming into a marriage and you
[47:07] look at what she can do for me
[47:10] or what he can do for me
[47:12] and she can meet my needs and i can meet
[47:14] her you're coming in for the wrong
[47:15] reason
[47:16] you're going and saying how can i
[47:19] how can i
[47:21] make
[47:22] this
[47:22] girl or guy's life better by my
[47:24] sacrificial to make them closer to the
[47:26] lord how can i make them a better
[47:28] christian
[47:32] it's not about your needs so until i'm
[47:35] happy nobody gets to be happy some
[47:37] pursue happiness
[47:39] others create happiness
[47:41] is this okay tonight
[47:43] says some pursue happiness and they're
[47:45] always pursuing it but they never get to
[47:47] it others create it there are two types
[47:49] of people givers and takers many times
[47:51] the takers are mooching off the givers
[47:53] all the time but it's the givers that
[47:55] seem to have the real happiness in life
[47:58] can you say amen it is the givers that
[48:01] find the true satisfaction in life
[48:04] it is the givers in a marriage that find
[48:06] the true satisfaction that you're going
[48:08] to do everything you can to meet their
[48:10] needs and get to know them
[48:12] in our marriage things that we talk
[48:14] about five needs of a woman five needs
[48:16] of a man that's the basic needs in both
[48:18] but yet there's other individual needs
[48:20] as you get to know that person and your
[48:22] lifelong perceive pursuit precede
[48:24] pursuit is to meet that person's need
[48:27] i'm living so that i can try to meet
[48:28] their needs and he's living to meet her
[48:30] needs that's when it's unselfish giving
[48:33] that's when you have happiness
[48:35] not when you're coming and saying will
[48:37] they meet my needs will they meet my
[48:38] needs and they never fully will
[48:41] and you set yourself up for
[48:42] disappointment
[48:45] now let's go into the prophet's message
[48:46] in this quote and oneness
[48:49] it says the word this this is some
[48:51] foundational things that i thought were
[48:53] amazing as we come into the subject more
[48:56] and more of oneness all right and this
[48:58] is what a great message oneness the word
[49:00] oneness means to be one with
[49:04] the word oneness means to be one with
[49:06] oneness united and now this is quite a
[49:08] subject and it deserves a lot more
[49:11] attention than i am able to give it
[49:13] and more than most any person on earth
[49:16] could able to give it so you can see
[49:18] where i'm at tonight
[49:20] this desert deserves a lot of tension
[49:22] and more attention that he was able to
[49:24] give it and more than any other person
[49:26] on earth it's pretty important subject
[49:28] but i would like to express it to you my
[49:30] opinion of it and with what god will
[49:32] give us later on in the a few paragraphs
[49:34] later the first man the first woman in
[49:36] the garden even was perfect harmony with
[49:38] god so much that god could come down at
[49:40] any time he desired and talk lip to ear
[49:43] with adam and eve now that is perfect
[49:45] oneness god in his creation god speaking
[49:47] lip to ear with adam and eve and they
[49:49] were so perfect in harmony with god till
[49:52] they were one with god god and his
[49:54] family was one any man and his family a
[49:57] correct good noble obedient family is
[50:01] one with one another any family and if
[50:03] there's something in the family that
[50:05] moves them apart then it's not right the
[50:07] family is broken somewhere they should
[50:09] all be one father with mother mother
[50:12] with father children with parent parent
[50:15] with children all in
[50:17] agreement
[50:19] praise the lord
[50:22] and when you see that you'll see one
[50:24] lovely picture
[50:25] that's god's purpose
[50:28] if you're not there tonight you say i'm
[50:31] not going to listen to the devil i'm
[50:32] going to say brother brahman said that's
[50:34] god's purpose
[50:35] and if it's in my inheritance i'm going
[50:37] to go for it
[50:41] that's god's purpose and his purpose as
[50:43] father supreme was to be one with his
[50:45] family earthly family adam and eve and
[50:47] the only way they could be one with
[50:48] family or with god was because god's
[50:51] nature was in them the only way you can
[50:52] truly be one is god's nature was in them
[50:55] that's that's the only way moves on
[50:57] later in the sermon a few paragraphs
[50:59] later he says and if you'll notice how
[51:00] that eve was united with adam she become
[51:03] a part of him god did you notice in
[51:05] genesis 1 27
[51:07] he created man male and female created
[51:09] he them now the man was both male and
[51:12] female when it come to being in the
[51:14] spirit of feminist and masculine
[51:17] then god took his side a rib did you
[51:20] notice the part body part was by a
[51:22] byproduct but not the spirit
[51:25] the body part of the woman was a
[51:27] byproduct after the creation had been
[51:29] finished
[51:30] god took from the so the original
[51:33] creation
[51:34] eve was in adam they were one in spirit
[51:39] all right
[51:40] then i'm just taking it as brother brahm
[51:42] says it here then god took
[51:44] then god took from the side of rib did
[51:46] you notice the body part was a byproduct
[51:48] but not the spirit the body part of the
[51:50] woman was a byproduct after the creation
[51:53] had been finished god took from the side
[51:55] of adam a rib and made a woman but not
[51:58] the spirit the spirit was part of adam
[52:02] for he was both male man and woman
[52:05] uh feminine spiritually speaking both
[52:07] masculine and finished so before he
[52:09] separated him adam was both masculine
[52:12] and feminine now don't you see what this
[52:14] see the great picture
[52:16] we now he goes to us we
[52:18] in flesh
[52:20] are different
[52:22] we're like a byproduct a created being
[52:25] by holy wedlock but in spirit we are
[52:29] sons and daughters not some other spirit
[52:32] but the spirit of the living god
[52:35] now in that
[52:37] revelation in those words as simple as
[52:40] they are
[52:41] friends you will find the answer
[52:45] to oneness and relationships like never
[52:48] before
[52:50] to realize when i look at that person if
[52:53] it's a person with the holy ghost
[52:56] their flesh is a byproduct
[52:58] their flesh is different
[53:01] their personality is different
[53:04] but in spirit
[53:06] we're one
[53:08] it's a different way to look at it
[53:10] because if you get to looking at the
[53:11] flesh you'll start acting wrong towards
[53:14] them
[53:16] because you see their flesh you see how
[53:18] different they are than you
[53:28] so just hold on to that all right so in
[53:30] the garden
[53:32] i'm just trying to figure out now what
[53:34] to jump out of here and uh
[53:36] finish up so we'll have to pick it up
[53:38] next wednesday lord willing
[53:40] in the garden there was perfect oneness
[53:42] let me just move on because i've got to
[53:43] some of this already they were the same
[53:45] image and the nature of god but then god
[53:47] separated the vessels that's why i read
[53:49] to this scripture
[53:50] that the the husband give honor to the
[53:53] wife as the weaker vessel but you're
[53:55] heirs together so you're still one in
[53:57] spirit one with god by the holy ghost
[53:59] your heirs together with that there is
[54:01] no levels in that of weaker and stronger
[54:04] right
[54:05] it's all
[54:07] um
[54:08] it's all one spirit but yet in flesh
[54:11] she's a weaker vessel so now if he gets
[54:13] to dishonoring that and looking at her
[54:15] too much of the weaker vessel
[54:17] and belittling that and she gets to
[54:19] belittling him it's interesting thing
[54:21] about our culture because
[54:24] them not having the revelation that the
[54:26] man and woman should become one they're
[54:28] only looking at flesh when they get
[54:30] married and so now
[54:32] what we've had in our culture for all
[54:34] these years
[54:35] is
[54:36] the the women
[54:38] um belittling the men all the way from
[54:41] the movie the the the uh
[54:43] sitcom i love lucy you'll watch little
[54:46] traits there of i love lucy you watch
[54:48] him belittling
[54:50] uh whoever her husband was there
[54:53] ricky thank you brother daniel
[54:55] i see you've watched a lot of those
[54:58] grew up on that probably
[55:00] um
[55:02] ricky so now if you watch this look
[55:03] there's not much of it but there's
[55:05] little traces of her
[55:06] as the women's liberation moving
[55:09] starts to move in 40s and 50s even the
[55:11] spirit of it and she's giving these
[55:13] little belittling comments to some of
[55:15] the ways he is and all that's happening
[55:17] is they're capitalizing on the
[55:19] differences of a man and woman how they
[55:21] look at stuff how they see stuff and so
[55:23] now that was never supposed to bring a
[55:25] divide it was supposed to be respected
[55:28] and honored that's the way god made her
[55:30] in her feminine way that's the way god
[55:32] made him but now all of a sudden now
[55:34] she's looking at his rough ways and look
[55:37] where we're at speed ahead 70 years look
[55:40] at the belittling of men so much so that
[55:43] brother branham says that men are turned
[55:46] into homosexuality because there's such
[55:48] a dishonor to woman and there's been
[55:50] such also a dishonor to man he doesn't
[55:53] even know his place anymore because he's
[55:55] been so belittled for being a man
[55:59] do you understand
[56:01] he has been so put down for being a man
[56:03] he doesn't even know how to and he's
[56:05] scared to be a man to stand up and be a
[56:07] man
[56:08] he's a follower and not a man to stand
[56:10] up for truth and stand up for conviction
[56:12] stand up for the word of god god give us
[56:15] more young men like that girls are
[56:16] looking for them holy ghost girls are
[56:18] looking for them but you see the the
[56:20] culture the generation has tore down
[56:23] that man tore down that man and
[56:25] belittled the way that god made him so
[56:27] much
[56:28] that he just he's scared to be himself
[56:31] then he becomes feminine
[56:34] he's lost himself so much he begins to
[56:36] question i must not be a man then
[56:39] so i have to be a woman to be accepted
[56:42] in this society because that's who's
[56:43] made an idol is the woman
[56:47] lost his way he's lost his way
[56:50] so you got that going on but then you
[56:52] kind of see this
[56:53] shifting a little bit too where now the
[56:55] women
[56:56] are belittled the women are belittled
[56:58] for their nature and the way that they
[57:00] are and the the way god made them so man
[57:03] everything begins to break down but when
[57:06] i was bringing it the two vessels were
[57:07] separated god put the mask into one
[57:10] effeminate in the other i brought out
[57:11] some things about their differences and
[57:13] i'm not going to have the time to bring
[57:15] them all back up here tonight but
[57:17] there's one writer i wanted to read some
[57:18] of these differences because i want the
[57:19] young people and marriages here to
[57:21] understand here's what i want you to
[57:22] understand is that god had this marriage
[57:25] as an image on earth to show what the
[57:27] image would be of a bride and christ
[57:30] coming together in oneness
[57:32] and we would be a different vessel of
[57:34] course
[57:35] and we would have to respond to the lord
[57:37] but in this vessel
[57:39] we would have to have a oneness by
[57:40] nature with him but then there has to be
[57:43] an honor like a husband and wife
[57:45] she's one with you and in her
[57:46] inheritance with christ but she is the
[57:49] weaker vessel so he says that if the
[57:51] husband gets off track here and he
[57:54] starts to look at her and belittle her
[57:56] for her being the weaker vessel too much
[58:00] and i'm not talking about talking with
[58:02] one another i'm talking about belittling
[58:04] it you're a lesser
[58:06] specie of human being
[58:09] that's not the word
[58:11] it's not the word
[58:14] it's it's really funny how
[58:16] as i said the world shifts to belittling
[58:18] men
[58:19] and then sometimes in the circles of
[58:21] christianity
[58:23] and in the circles sometimes in our
[58:26] groups
[58:27] and i might have to hold this i want to
[58:28] make sure i say it just right i don't
[58:30] want to offend
[58:32] but sometimes in our groups i watch an
[58:35] overly belittling
[58:37] of the woman
[58:39] in our ranks
[58:41] and the man is here and the woman is
[58:44] here
[58:46] that's my most polite way of saying that
[58:49] and
[58:50] he's always believed
[58:52] as the truth-giver
[58:54] and we have to question everything she
[58:56] says because remember eve was the one
[58:58] that fell in the garden
[59:02] but i want to remind you that calvary is
[59:04] restoring us back
[59:06] to oneness
[59:08] not the woman that should become a
[59:09] women's liberal it's not that she's not
[59:10] under subjection to her husband i'm not
[59:12] saying that i'm just saying in spirit
[59:14] when a man catches a revelation and
[59:16] you've got an honorable godly wife
[59:18] you're going to celebrate the way god
[59:20] made her as feminist different and
[59:22] you're not going to belittle those
[59:23] difference as she's a lesser species of
[59:26] human being
[59:28] because that's not the word and that's
[59:29] not the message
[59:31] can i get an amen
[59:32] so essentially in the world we got a
[59:34] belittling of men but sometimes in our
[59:36] ranks we've got a belittling of women
[59:37] too much
[59:40] so and
[59:41] it just all accumulates
[59:43] where there's a dishonor going on for
[59:45] the woman
[59:46] there's a dishonor going for on for the
[59:48] man there's a dishonoring of women
[59:51] sometimes in our own rank
[59:53] and it
[59:54] it it has fruits to it i'll tell you
[59:56] friends it has some fruit to it that i
[59:58] haven't enjoyed watching through the
[1:00:00] years
[1:00:01] in our in some of our groups
[1:00:05] maybe we can talk about that more at
[1:00:07] another time
[1:00:08] but this writer says
[1:00:10] men aren't from mars women aren't from
[1:00:12] venus they're the same species from the
[1:00:14] same planet
[1:00:16] but the sexes certainly aren't the same
[1:00:18] exactly the same the differences between
[1:00:20] men and women are real important real
[1:00:23] and important this from a medical point
[1:00:25] of view they serve biological functions
[1:00:27] and can even help you better understand
[1:00:29] your health and needs when you know
[1:00:30] understand these differences these
[1:00:32] differences give each sex unique
[1:00:34] strengths that help with the most
[1:00:35] important task survival there are
[1:00:38] differences in the way male and female
[1:00:40] brains are structured
[1:00:42] how they process information and
[1:00:44] interact with chemical signals some
[1:00:46] examples men are more information
[1:00:48] containing gray matter but women have
[1:00:50] more white matter which connects
[1:00:52] different parts of the brain also women
[1:00:55] have bigger memory centers than men
[1:00:58] men are less sensitive to cold
[1:00:59] temperatures
[1:01:02] women have better senses of smell and
[1:01:05] taste
[1:01:08] okay
[1:01:11] that's why they come into the house
[1:01:13] there's something that smells bad in
[1:01:14] here
[1:01:16] and then she's trying to find out who it
[1:01:17] is
[1:01:20] tracking it down
[1:01:22] women they have 50 more cells
[1:01:25] neurons in their
[1:01:27] olfactory
[1:01:29] bulbs the part of the brain responsible
[1:01:32] for processing smells that's why they're
[1:01:34] that way women also usually have more
[1:01:36] taste buds than men the differences in
[1:01:38] the way in men men and women see the
[1:01:39] world are partly physical on average men
[1:01:42] are more likely to be colorblind but
[1:01:44] their eyes also sense movement better
[1:01:46] women are able to distinguish small
[1:01:47] difference in color and color better one
[1:01:49] thing you shouldn't do is use the
[1:01:52] differences
[1:01:53] between men and women to make a case
[1:01:55] that one sex is somehow better than the
[1:01:58] other
[1:02:00] one thing you shouldn't do is use the
[1:02:01] differences between men and women
[1:02:04] marriages have used the differences to
[1:02:06] justify
[1:02:08] terrible terrible bitter battles
[1:02:11] and a lot of times we know sin is in the
[1:02:13] picture and i'll get to that later not
[1:02:14] tonight but just sometimes the
[1:02:16] differences in male and female or female
[1:02:19] can bring such a divide that they're
[1:02:21] ready to call it quits and all it is is
[1:02:24] the differences in how god made them
[1:02:26] and it's not celebrated it's belittled
[1:02:33] brother ziada when you see those things
[1:02:35] as i was talking about adam starting to
[1:02:36] see those things in his wife when you
[1:02:38] start to see those things you ought to
[1:02:39] just step back before you act too
[1:02:41] quickly
[1:02:42] because if you start belittling it
[1:02:45] and you don't have a revelation that's
[1:02:47] really a part of me
[1:02:49] she's another part of me
[1:02:51] that's where you come to oneness is this
[1:02:53] honor and respect
[1:02:55] and throughout the history of human
[1:02:56] beings he finishes the differences have
[1:02:58] helped men and women survive
[1:03:01] i'm just say this again now through the
[1:03:02] history of human beings the differences
[1:03:05] if when they're looked at right can
[1:03:06] actually have helped men and women
[1:03:08] survive
[1:03:09] mostly
[1:03:10] working together
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:13] that's the goal isn't it
[1:03:15] working together
[1:03:17] making life better
[1:03:19] there's no int
[1:03:22] living for the key part of each other
[1:03:27] love one another
[1:03:29] we can handle any kind of weather
[1:03:31] working together
[1:03:33] that was written by paula fontaine
[1:03:38] when they sell it when they celebrate
[1:03:40] these things and these are just
[1:03:41] biological mostly there's
[1:03:43] i said 200 differences or more
[1:03:47] emotional
[1:03:48] when these things are capitalized so
[1:03:50] here's my point i've got to move on
[1:03:52] that's adam and eve and maybe we'll get
[1:03:53] to that further my point is to look at
[1:03:55] that marriage and look at how we see
[1:03:59] that
[1:04:00] clearly
[1:04:01] god makes every one of us different not
[1:04:05] the sin part but he makes everyone in
[1:04:07] the body of christ different and that's
[1:04:09] why paul picks it up in first
[1:04:11] corinthians
[1:04:13] 12
[1:04:14] and says we're a body
[1:04:16] and the hand cannot say to the foot i
[1:04:19] have no need of thee because you're not
[1:04:21] important you can't do it
[1:04:24] so does paul pick it up yeah he's
[1:04:25] picking up this idea that we're all in
[1:04:27] our personalities different we're not
[1:04:29] talking about sin yet we'll get into
[1:04:31] that but we're talking about the the
[1:04:34] subject tonight is that how does this
[1:04:36] oneness work when it's in different
[1:04:39] vessels and i'll just conclude by saying
[1:04:41] this in this point the utmost honor and
[1:04:44] respect for the other is because they
[1:04:47] are one if you don't know you are one
[1:04:50] you will never respect properly they are
[1:04:53] less than you in some part in your
[1:04:55] thinking if you do not have a revelation
[1:04:57] of oneness that you are one whether it's
[1:04:59] with the body of christ or your husband
[1:05:00] or wife wherever it is
[1:05:02] if you don't have that revelation you
[1:05:04] will dishonor and respect them too much
[1:05:07] and break the relationship
[1:05:09] you understand
[1:05:12] you will never respect properly and
[1:05:15] especially in a marriage unless you
[1:05:16] understand oneness and how god has made
[1:05:19] you one
[1:05:20] you hurt her you're hurting yourself
[1:05:23] you hurt him you're hurting yourself
[1:05:26] and if you have that disrespect they are
[1:05:28] less than you in some part of your
[1:05:30] thinking then they shouldn't be less
[1:05:31] than you they should be a part of you
[1:05:33] now let me end by saying this i was out
[1:05:36] early this morning and uh
[1:05:38] we're having a lot of birds come around
[1:05:40] um our house now a lot of different
[1:05:43] kinds of bird we put some feeders out
[1:05:45] and this is getting fun
[1:05:47] guinea and i especially are enjoying it
[1:05:48] in the mornings we're all enjoying it
[1:05:50] because we're getting a lot of i was
[1:05:51] down at brother jim and sister julie's
[1:05:53] house last year and man they got it down
[1:05:56] pat because just sitting there 10
[1:05:57] minutes in their living room i seen
[1:05:59] birds i'd never seen before coming to
[1:06:01] their back porch now it's happening to
[1:06:03] us and we're getting some of the most
[1:06:04] beautiful birds
[1:06:06] unique birds and my thought this morning
[1:06:09] as i went into this tonight
[1:06:11] we
[1:06:11] serve a god a variety
[1:06:15] he hasn't made any of us the same
[1:06:19] you know they're all they all maybe got
[1:06:21] beaks and they all maybe got some things
[1:06:24] that similar but there's some things
[1:06:25] that are very different on those birds
[1:06:28] the woodpecker the other birds probably
[1:06:29] don't tap on the tree you know and put
[1:06:31] holes in the tree but the woodpecker
[1:06:33] he's built for that so people are built
[1:06:35] for different things they're doing
[1:06:36] different things
[1:06:37] one bird could be critical and this is
[1:06:38] what i get out of watching all these
[1:06:39] birds one bird could be critical and say
[1:06:41] what is he up there doing holes in the
[1:06:43] tree for what a waste of time you know
[1:06:45] that's just the way he is that's the way
[1:06:47] he's made
[1:06:49] and so i'm watching the uniqueness and
[1:06:52] i'm saying lord you have made us and
[1:06:55] that's just the bird kingdom look at all
[1:06:57] of god king god's kingdom and he never
[1:07:00] makes anything just cookie cutter the
[1:07:02] same
[1:07:03] the beauty of it the colors of it it's
[1:07:05] so
[1:07:06] beautiful so and there's strange ones
[1:07:08] and there and then i got to thinking how
[1:07:10] i've got some strange birds living in
[1:07:13] the house do with me
[1:07:18] i did i got to thinking i won't mention
[1:07:20] names but
[1:07:21] i got some strange birds the lord gave
[1:07:24] me in my own household
[1:07:26] i've got and sometimes even
[1:07:28] angry birds
[1:07:33] is that okay yeah
[1:07:36] that's a game if you want to play it
[1:07:38] i got these unique birds and then god
[1:07:40] sends me a son-in-law he's he's a
[1:07:41] strange bird too he's different
[1:07:44] very different than the fontaine's
[1:07:47] all this
[1:07:48] is
[1:07:50] for
[1:07:51] to reflect god's glory and what he's
[1:07:53] going to do if we're to come to oneness
[1:07:56] as families in a church and in christ
[1:07:59] we're going to have to get over the fact
[1:08:02] that we're trying to make that person in
[1:08:04] personality like us that god made them
[1:08:06] the way that they are for a reason now
[1:08:08] i'm not talking about sin yet sin is a
[1:08:10] different story okay if it's a sin in an
[1:08:12] individual and a serpent nature god has
[1:08:14] to deal with that and there's a lot of
[1:08:16] ugliness that comes out of
[1:08:19] sinful creatures it's all there is to it
[1:08:21] but i'm not talking about i'm just
[1:08:22] talking about differences that are not
[1:08:24] sin
[1:08:25] but we make them sin
[1:08:27] we make them i will not be i'm putting
[1:08:29] up my walls i'm never speaking to that
[1:08:31] person again you can't do that if just
[1:08:33] god made them a different personality
[1:08:35] you're not allowed to do that because
[1:08:37] god's a god a variety
[1:08:40] and i wanted to read you something as we
[1:08:41] close tonight i know i've been a little
[1:08:42] long for a wednesday night but i want
[1:08:44] you to look at this picture because this
[1:08:46] this was really neat not only does god
[1:08:49] have a variety in nature but some
[1:08:51] there's there's oneness expressed in
[1:08:53] nature and one example of all the
[1:08:56] oneness and nature they come together
[1:08:58] with all their differences they can come
[1:08:59] together in a oneness now if birds can
[1:09:01] do it
[1:09:02] human beings can do it by the holy ghost
[1:09:04] can i get an amen tonight
[1:09:06] there's sometimes oneness is expressed
[1:09:08] in the animal kingdom where they come
[1:09:10] together and an example is is the
[1:09:12] canadian geese as the geese take flight
[1:09:14] from the canadian shoreline they lift
[1:09:16] off from the water in a squawking
[1:09:18] discourse
[1:09:19] yet in the matter of seconds a line
[1:09:21] begins to emerge from the mass of brown
[1:09:23] feathers this line straightens arches
[1:09:25] slightly and then as on cue
[1:09:28] bends sharply to form a perfect v-shape
[1:09:31] canada geese fly in v formation for a
[1:09:34] very pragmatic reason a flock of geese
[1:09:37] flying in formation can move faster and
[1:09:41] maintain flight longer than anyone goose
[1:09:44] flying alone on his own can everybody
[1:09:47] say amen
[1:09:49] all right do i need to read it again
[1:09:52] a flock of geese flying in formation can
[1:09:54] move faster and maintain flight longer
[1:09:56] than any one goose flying alone synergy
[1:10:00] is a law of nature
[1:10:02] what is synergy how does it relate to
[1:10:04] leadership we have a lot to learn from
[1:10:06] these geese and i'm going to read you
[1:10:08] about six things and i'm closing i
[1:10:10] promise by flying in v formation i like
[1:10:13] v why that's great that's
[1:10:14] victory they're flying together to get
[1:10:17] the victory can you say amen
[1:10:20] flying in a v formation the whole flock
[1:10:23] adds at least 71 percent greater flying
[1:10:26] range than if each bird flew on its own
[1:10:31] praise the lord
[1:10:34] well i got happy about it anyway
[1:10:35] whenever a goose falls out of formation
[1:10:38] it suddenly feels the drag and
[1:10:40] resistance of trying to go it alone
[1:10:44] and quickly gets back into formation to
[1:10:47] take advantage of the lifting power of
[1:10:50] the bird immediately in front of it
[1:10:53] this happens this happens
[1:10:55] next one when the lead goose gets tired
[1:10:59] he rotates back in the wing and another
[1:11:02] goose flies point
[1:11:06] you know they didn't read any textbooks
[1:11:08] on this
[1:11:09] it's all
[1:11:10] instinct these geese honk
[1:11:14] from behind
[1:11:16] to encourage those up front
[1:11:19] to keep their speed
[1:11:23] that's why i love it every sunday
[1:11:25] morning and some wednesday nights when i
[1:11:27] hear some honks from the audience
[1:11:36] you know just for what you did to me let
[1:11:37] me know what a honk sounds like from a
[1:11:39] geese right now what's a honk come on
[1:11:42] your best honk
[1:11:44] no your best one real loud no you you
[1:11:46] pay back time
[1:11:48] yep
[1:11:49] how does the geese honk let me hear it
