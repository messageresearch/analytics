TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second chapter and we're gonna read from second chapter in verse one through three the book of habakkuk second chapter so whenever you have you can say Amen or we have it on the screen amen so it says I will stand upon my watch and not and set me upon the tower and I will watch to see what he will say unto me in what I shall answer when I am reproved here we see that habakkuk is looking for an answer and amen so when you have an answer the Lord will always come and give you answers amen so in the Lord answer me and said right right division and make it plain upon tables that's that he may run that breed at it for division is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it will tarry but he is saying the Lord is saying wait for it wait for it because he will surely come he will not tarry amen you may have your seat now in the Amplified verse the second verse and the third verse it says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and engrave it so so plainly upon tablets that everyone who passes by will be able to read it that it will be easy and quickly as he Hastings a Hastings by and then it says for the vision is yet for an appointed time and and it Hastings to the end so it will be a fulfillment of that Vision it will not deceive or disappoint in other words you will never be disappointed with the Lord it says Solitaire wait for it because it will surely come it will not be behind or it will not be behind hand on its appointed day so in other words there is an appointed day for your vision to come to fulfillment amen so now in the book of uh Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 3 uh verses uh 2 through 11. we're gonna read there and it says ER our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all man for as much as year manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ Minister by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of a stone but in fleshy tables of the heart so you see the Lord is changing these Sensations in the past it was given to Moses it was up in the mountain but now the Lord is saying but now these these uh gospel is is coming in a different form amen so and and as such have we uh through Christ to go to go work and not that we are sufficient of ourselves Amen to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God we depend on God this morning amen who also made us able ministers for the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kileth but the spirit giveth life but if the administration of death greeting and Engraving in the stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which which Glory was to be done away so now he he the Apostle Paul is talking you know there there there was a Ministry in Moses that when they saw it they couldn't behold his face amen and he's talking about a fleshy Ministry or or a a natural Ministry during the life of Moses but now he's switching he's saying like how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious so now he's switching the dispensation is going from Moses is going out to Jesus and it is not staying there because now he's saying that we are being made able ministers and then it says for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more does the administration of righteousness and it doesn't only come in glory either seeds in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory and disrespect by the reason of the glory that excellent for for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious much more the gospel that you have received is glorious and not as Moses which put a veil on over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blind for until this day remaineth the same Veil taken away in the reading of the Old Testament they have to put something on them when they read the the Scrolls which Veil but now Paul is saying that this Veil is going to be done away this Veil needs to be removed and and he was amen so if now the veil is removed now what's going to happen nevertheless when it shall turn when they when each Soul turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now it is moving now the Lord is that spirit that spirit that was with Moses now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is healing amen where the spirit of the Lord is there there is freedom there is restoration there is a change of heart but we all with open face beholding beholding us in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same uh the same image from glory to glory even us and look at this it is not your work it is not your works it is no it is not how much you come to church or how you dress or or how you talk is by the spirit of the Lord You're gonna be changing from glory to glory isn't that beautiful this morning that is not your work it is is not the the death works that we can have but it's by the spirit of the Lord in our lives amen so what I want to catch from from this scripture is is talking that you are written Epistles written in our hearts and we read here that there is a vision so this morning by God's grace we can title this right according to the vision right according to the vision and then as a subject we can say that tablets of your heart and the tablets of your heart you know the Lord was the first one that created the tablet say man there with Moses that he went to the mountain and then there were some tablets there right he wrote the Ten Commandments and we think that that's a new thing no the Lord knew him amen but now he's going from something natural to something deeper in our lives amen so we can we if we can start this asking that question so when we talk about a vision what are we referring when we are talking about a vision the prophet of God says what is a vision and he says a vision is the forecast of future events it foretells the thing before it happens amen and that's the way God always has been indicated it whether something is true or not amen because somebody can say you know I have a vision something is going to happen then it doesn't happen then you know why can't they say well that's not a true prophet a man but by God's grace a vision the Lord is going to show a person something and then that's going to happen but I'm gonna I'm gonna I want to go beyond that the Lord showing something to a person I want to tell you that there is already a written Vision that whenever you get as close as possible to that to that you're gonna see the Lord and where is that Vision that's in his word amen so now if we look here we see habakkuk he was complaining if you have read the book of have a cook he was complaining to the Lord and he was Lord I need an answer you know he went to learn he's like he was a he was seeking for an answer about the things that the children of Israel were going through you know time of Oppression time of distress for the people so have a cook needed an answer but and then the Lord comes and answers Hema and as we can see but he shows him a vision and then he is required he's like you are required to write it in the tablets of of in in tablets so that everyone who passes they will see the vision and they will know that every time they will see the vision it will be a reminder to them that the Lord has promised something amen so we see the beginning in our when you read your scriptures your Bible you see the beginning it was the fall amen and even and there was the fall there and then you read it in the middle of the Bible and there was Jesus when he came amen and then at the end of the of the Bible then we see that we won that's why the importance to go back and read the vision so you will know now the havocs of this day they can go back and read the vision and then say they can say Lord you are that my healer you are the kind that kind of healeth all my diseases you are my restorer You Are My Redeemer you're everything to me but you have to go in the vision the Lord is also telling him that even though he is seeing a vision it is for a specific time you know how many times we get impatient Lord I've been praying for this I've been praying for this and I don't get it well keep waiting and the more you you're asking the Lord about it the more you're gonna wait why don't you just you know go as we say go with the flow and just write with the Lord and say Lord I'm just gonna wait for what for your timing because what happened it may have not been for his day but he's telling him do not worry don't worry have a cook it is the sir the Lord and and if if it is thus said the Lord he will come to pass or we sometimes like have a cook and we feel entitled to request an answer from the Lord for the matters of our heart and I'm gonna tell you the Lord has an answer for all our matters however he's telling us wait for it don't step out of your position like like you know as we have many many of us have heard the vision that the prophet of God saw and then there was kind of the different nations walking you know the the different uh the brides from every country and then there was a time that some of them started going away amen but then the prophet of God says but I I and I was telling them don't step out of light in other words Johnny step out of the vision amen many people are are stepping out of their Vision but I I want to invite you to this this morning stay in line with the word and stay in in Your Vision that the Lord has given you there is only one way that we can be aware of the decision he has for us and is the closer we get to the Lord the more we are on his word the more he will open his vision to us the more we match our experience experience to his word the more we will hear from heaven if you are sick the more you're in the world the more you're gonna read that he's your healer if you're lonely the more you are in the world you're gonna hear that he is your friend but if you're gonna spend time with the word in the word don't expect the Lord to come and be close to you he will come but he was gonna it is gonna be hard there it is better for you to always stay in the word the prophet of God says this is a matching time you know that's true it is a matching time that that then that's right listen that is true now I'm going to tell you my brother I don't care whether my shoes match my my pants or my pants matches my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible I don't wanna I don't want God to fit to my vision I don't want God to fit to my schedule I want to feed to the god of the Bible these the prophet of God says that is the marching time if you want to match something match your experience against Paul's experience that's what we need today it is a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example right real matching matching time don't try to match your your experience with your neighbors it won't work don't compare yourself with with your with your neighbor next next to you because it won't work you are unique in the sight of the Lord amen it says the prophet of God says if you are a saint act like that like a saint walk like a saint dressed like a saint talk like a saint break like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be like a saint leave a saint like and die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint amen this is matching time and now in the Book of Proverbs chapter 7 verse 1 it says my son keep my words lay up within you my Commandments and treasure them keep my Commandments verse two of uh Proverbs 7 2 it says keep my Commandments and leave and keep my law in teaching us the apple of your eye bind them on your fingers and then write them on the tablet of your heart what is the Lord telling us in this scripture that in our hearts there are tablets where he can write it goes beyond something written in natural material but it goes beyond that to write his vision now he wants to write it in your heart and as we read in the in our opening a scripture but with the spirit of the Living God is not in the tables of a stone but in fleshy table of tables of the heart that's why he needs to change our hearts as Ezekiel said Ezekiel said in in Ezekiel 36 26 it says a new heart also will I give you so you see how beautiful he is walking with the Lord that he is not gonna ask you for something that he is not gonna provide isn't that beautiful that he's telling you I want to write in in the in in the tablets of your heart he's gonna give you a new heart she's gonna give you a blank a tablet and he's gonna say now I want to write write my word in that heart but he will not give you only a new heart but he also will give you a new a new spirit will I put within you Ezekiel 36 26 and it says and I will take away the stunning heart of your flesh in in other words it's sunny you know your ideas I will take take away your Revelations on what you think what God is and then he says and I will give you a new heart and I will give you a heart of Flesh in other words when you have a heart of Flesh he's a heart that is gonna feel he said isn't that beautiful that when you come to church you can feel his presence and then it's like you can thank the Lord because now you don't have a stunning heart that now you're tender to when he is speaking to you now you can say thank you Lord because now you have changed my heart but you see this scripture is very very particular because in verse 27 it says I will give you a spirit I will give you one spirit I I will will I put a new spirit within you but then in verse 27 and he says and I will put my spirit within you in other words First Alert comes and then changes your spirit and then he he and then he comes and brings a spirit that is going to be able to match to his spirit and and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do him why I love these scriptures that we're going to be reading today why because the Lord is always I will do it the first person he's always the Lord doing the work he is not sending somebody else but he's always saying I will put my spirit I will change your heart I will remove your Stony heart I will remove your all ideas you're all crazy you're all thinking and I will put a new heart I will put my spirit but then I will put my spirit send that beautiful the Lord doing the work that's why you don't have to trust you know the Bible says some some trust in chariots some trust in in their properties what they have but who do we trust in this to this morning we trust in the name of the Lord amen what is he writing in our hearts he has written before the foundation of the world what he thinks about you Jeremiah 29 11 we always hear that scripture when you go to the youth camps or when we go to the youth meetings we always hear this scripture for I know for I know the thoughts that I think though are you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you unexpected end I know I love it the Lord again I know I will give you I will change your heart I know how you think this gives us confidence that he that he has a vision about me that that is why he is saying I know what I think about you I know your struggles I know your Temptations I know your shortcomings I know your desires but I do see you through those thoughts because I I can see now your heart and I see something else and I love this I see my masterpiece that's why my thoughts the Lord says our thoughts of peace and thoughts of not evil because now I am seeing my masterpiece and even more I will give you unexpected end I have a vision that on what you will become at the end send that beautiful he knows the end from the beginning that's how we have to walk this morning Lord you know my end you know my tomorrow you know how I'm gonna pay my bills you know everything you're gonna provide I have never seen the righteous forsaken neither his seat begging for bread but what is he asking for us what what is the law requiring from us he is asking for us to surrender to get on your heart so that he can get and he can write in in our heart and I can tell you if you know where you're coming from the Lord will show you your purpose and your expected future whatever your desire is make sure it is according to the Lord's perfect plan for your life you know just thinking and I just put it here you know I have had I have heard people that they they they they want to get married or they are in the process of getting married or talking to a sister talking to a brother and then all of a sudden then you start praying and then they I found some that they kind of asked for obvious signs to feed it into what they think that is the will of God you know maybe one can say you know what that she may be in church well what's the probability that she's going to be in church on a Sunday oh she's she's gonna be in church well I think you need more prayer or what's the probability that you know kind of the youth or like in general we get ideas on on how we want to feed God that's what I'm saying like we want to fit God into our thinking into our schedule or people seeking for designs I have heard you know as I'm saying that but uh I will do it differently nothing against it again nothing against it but things that I have seen but then you see the end result and then you see that it wasn't the will of God but I will I will tell you stay in the word and let those signs follow you I'm not following the signs amen because the Believers are not science followers the signs will follow the Believers because that's what the scripture says amen then the these signs shall follow them God believe so what's the requirement for you young people or for you kind of adult is that you have to be living the word of God and then everything that you're praying will will come into into the right place in the right time in the appointed time of the Lord amen build according to the vision amen if the Lord is telling you something he's just pray about it if if our pastor is telling you something just pray about it and then observe that thing and then do it and you will see that that those instructions are going to come to fruition Proverbs 29 18. it says where there is no vision the people perish in the in the amplifier it says where there is no Redemptive Redemptive revelation of God the people will perish but listen to this portion but he who keeps the law or he who keeps his Commandments blessed happy is he there is no vision there is nothing of the Lord You're Gonna perish but how beautiful it is when there is a vision then I will it will have the opposite will happen to me I won't perish where there is no not changing of the hearts the people will perish amen now in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 5. the Lord is talking through Moses to to his children and he tells them but you are to seek the place of the Lord your God the place of Lord your God will choose from among all the all your tribes to put his name there for his dwelling so what is the Lord instructing here to to to Moses he's telling him you know there is going to be a place and there is going to be among uh kind of all the tribes you have to uh build a place you have to uh erect a tabernacle and there there you I will put my name and I will be dwelling there amen so and then in the book of Acts I do Exodus chapter 25 verse 9 verse 9 it says and you shall make it according to all that I show you the pattern of the Tabernacle or dwelling and the pattern of all the furniture of it you see how glory is bringing up Moses is bringing him from one thing you know you're going to choose it among your among your the tribes and then he's gonna and then he's telling him and I will show you how you're gonna build it that's the beauty of the Gospel the Lord is not just going to give you instruction but but the Lord is very precise in what how he wants you to do things and we have we have learned through the years that when he gives precise a precise uh instructions is for our good is for our protection Amen in any book in the book of Hebrews chapter 8 and then it um Paul writing he says but the offer certainly it was just a pattern in the Amplified it says as a foreshadowing of what it is true and exists okay what has its true existence and reality in the Heavenly sanctuary for when Moses was about to erect the Tabernacle he was warned by God saying see to it that you make it all exactly according to the copy according to the model which was shown to you on the mountain and we're gonna get into something here why was it so important for Moses to follow the pattern as shown in the vision because he had to represent on how the Heavenly looked like amen that's why that's why Moses is like okay you have to build it according to what you saw and not only that also he needed to represent the one that was to come and that was Jesus amen not only the what was that because Mo if Moses when he was building the Temple I mean the Tabernacle when he was you know putting everything The Atrium the the holy place and the holiest of holiest and then when he was building all of that there were specifics every specifics the Lord was telling him telling Moses you have to use gold you have to use the silver you have you have to use this specific type of good everything was very specific and everything had a purpose why because it was pointing to someone to someone that was coming after after Moses and who was that well that was Jesus amen so and then Not only was Jesus amen we always hear that you know many people they say in Jesus but now it goes beyond what Jesus did at the cross he goes beyond that he needed to go back to heaven and then come back again and why he needed to come back again because now he needed to build a tabernacle again and where is that Tabernacle this morning are we getting it where is that Tabernacle now [Music] the first representation of that Vision was in Moses the second representation of that Vision was in who was in Jesus but now the third representation of that is in the bride it's in the bride of Christ this morning amen Psalms 102 and this is scripture you know you go to the Old Testament and now this scripture is prophesying on someone that needed to come he says this shall 102 18 it says these shall be written for direct generation to come and the people with which shall be created they shall praise the Lord who is that people this morning there is a people that needed to come and that people is here this morning verse 19 it says for he had looked down from the height of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth and then I love this next scripture next verse it says because the Lord is is looking from heaven and what is he going to be doing number one to hear to hear what the groaning of the prisoners that there was a people that was coming and the Lord knew that that people they were going to be in prison but then then what's gonna happen is the Lord is not gonna just leave them they're in prison amen now the Lord is going to hear their complaint the Lord is going to hear their pain their the Lord is gonna hear their despair of the prisoner he will hear them and not only that but also to lose because this priests on Earth they were appointed to death but now you are being set free that's the scripture he's gonna hear you to come and lose you and not only that verse 21 it says to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem what does that mean they will be positioned why because what does it mean to declare to have a name it characterizes your life when you receive the name that is above all names it is characterizing your life that's on why under that great vision he gave a name above all names Jesus Christ we take his name we declare his name We Are characterizing The Life of Christ we must accept his name amen he will hear you he will lose you and then he's gonna position you she's got to take the word the same way he did it with Jacob from uh a liar planter the worst of of the worst from that to a prince with with God where were you before where are you now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen from Abraham Abraham what was he he also was a liar he he he did the wrong things but from that the Lord changed his name from Sarah someone that laugh in front of the Lord now what is she what is she she became a princess with God from uh from Peter what was his name before Simon Peter or Simon what was his that was his name and now became what Peter and then from Saul uh a persecutor of the of of the of the Christians then became Paul all these people they had to declare the name of the Lord so now the name you have received you didn't receive a simple name you have received a name that is above all names and that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what the Bible says in the name that all the families on Earth are named after that they are going to represent Christ they are going to declare the name of the Lord amen if the Lord has a vision or a plan for you he will make it known to you you have a purpose how many here believe that you have that you have a purpose you have a reason to be here on Earth we get disappointed because we're not you know you're not the one that is doing uh one like everything that people can see but you are doing things behind the scenes and that's okay too foreign you have a purpose the prophet of God says God uses men and men only God doesn't use machinery group groups of men God doesn't use organizations but God uses individuals always Lord I'm Available to You here is my hands here's my eyes here's my mouth Use Me For Your Glory used me to declare your name on on this Earth Lord if even if I don't say a word Lord but may people see the name of Jesus walking on earth once again now God changes in different forms as part of that Vision but it's still the same God we are part of him the prophet of God says and that's God he changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man he changed himself from that from that back in the spirit again that he may dwell in man God acting in man what he really was Jesus Christ was God acting in men in a man in a man that's what he was he changed from the pillar of Fire that's what we're saying he changed from the Tabernacle in the wilderness to Jesus and then he had to come in which was the veil in the wilderness that that was hit from that hit God from Israel Moses he see he he saw the shape of his body but really was hit all the time behind the pillar of Fire which was the logos that went from God now we find here since Pentecost God is not acting now God is acting through man amen he was acting in a man then Jesus now he's acting through men that he has chosen for this purpose he has chosen for this day God in the form of man he changed himself from the form of God to the form of of a man but now where is the Lord where is that vision amen now if you let's think a little bit about that Tabernacle is this okay amen when the Tabernacle was built there were utensils there were specific areas that needed to be in the right place you know the seven gold golden Candlestick it needed to be in the right place they're in the Tabernacle they they they show up right it needed to be in the right place and if you start thinking about this and then what does John in the Book of Revelations what is what does he see he sees one that is walking in in the middle of the that seven seven Candlestick what is he saying he's like the same that was in the beginning and Moses now he's walking around there and then when he's talking about the showbread what does that mean he says Jesus said I am the bread of life is it was in Christ fulfilling all those scriptures from Moses yes he was and you know then they were also in that Tabernacle there were also three courts on which the Tabernacle was divided and the prophet of God says but his Abiding Place you know that was the tabernacle and and that was just attributes of his presence from the holiest of holies amen but I now know notice you yourself you yourself you are perfected in three your soul your body your spirit amen your water there's water blood in the spirit when you were born and then these three things they come from from his body that makes up the new birth amen so now let's break this a little bit more so when he's talking about the Tabernacle that it was a kind of divided in three he's talking that there was the atrium in the Tabernacle amen do we know that there was a tabernacle and it was divided in three the first section was the atrium amen and and in that section what will he do in that section like people will come they will wash and they will offer over the sacrifices amen so here is where the sacrifices were were carried out and that we can say that it represents our body amen because now with without with our flesh we offer the sacrifices of praise didn't David says my flight My Flesh and my soul they they they Worship the Lord or something like that it was his flesh amen that was the outer part that was the atrium part and then the holy place the the the the place in the middle is here we have The Mercy Seat and then this this area here the holy place it represents the spirit of mankind amen you have the atrium so you have your body amen and then you have the Holy place now is the spirit you know is the spirit that we're talking you know like how how you have a spirit but you need to receive his spirit amen in the third section is the holiest of holies here we have the presence of the Lord in the holiest of holies but but but you see one thing the Lord build it build a tabernacle the lord gave an instruction to build the Tabernacle so the Lord wasn't going to work only with the holiest of holies not only with the Atria everything was needed for that Tabernacle to to to to keep running so that's the same for your life that's when you come to Christ you have to surrender everything you're you're outer The Atrium your the holy place your spirit and then you have to surrender the holiest of holies which is where he can dwell amen now you know even during that time during the time of the Tabernacle they they were worshipers in every section amen there were worshipers in The Atrium those that you know they make Believers possibly that they will come there once in a blue moon the ones in the Holy place that you know they they will try to make it sometimes but then there were the the the worshipers or there was only one worshiper that was the holiest of holy that will enter into the holiest of holies and there was a priest and he couldn't come only once a year amen that that was the rule amen but after Christ that's why everything that was with Moses now was in Christ that's what when Christ came if you're interested if you know your Bible when Christ came when when when when when he uh gave up the gods the ghost what happened the the veil in the temple it was rented pottered in two so now people can go into the holiest of holiest they didn't have to wait for every year to come and worship or or to to be able to have communion with the Lord now they could go there at any time that they need it he said that the same thing that happens with us right now every time that's why I'm telling you when you are in the work you are in communion in the Holiness of holiness that's when you say Lord I need you he can come and say hey I I want to dwell in that who is the police but I also want to take control of your atrium I want to take control of your spirit I want to take control of how you think of your imagination your conscience your memory I want to take control of that as well but I need to dwell in the holiest of holies so what worshiper are you this morning the one in the art room the one in the Holy place or the one in the holiest of holiest amen the prophet of God says he dwelt in his Tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his Tabernacle so now we're going from Moses praise the Lord for Moses now we're going from the man Jesus now he has another Tabernacle now that Tabernacle is here on Earth and that Tabernacle is me this morning I don't know about you but I want him to have a Dwelling Place in my life Lord I surrender all that I have I'll surrender my mind I Surrender my body I Surrender my soul all to you this morning but we must make this a Dwelling Place not an outer Court place or or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of holies are consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God isn't that beautiful just go there and they in his presence that's what I want this morning Lord now there is more to their Tabernacle I want to drive your attention to the following the Tabernacle had a cover you see they they build a tabernacle and then Moses was instructed you know there will they will be there will be curtains that you have and they have to be blue some of them have to be blue some have to be red and then you have to have the the gold rings you know everything was very so perfect but in that area or like when he was building the Tabernacle he had to he had to cover that Tabernacle because just think about it when they would set up the Tabernacle then they will see the pillar of fire at night or they will they will see the cloud during the day amen and then when they will do that then if they wouldn't protect the Tabernacle then rain will come and then it will be a mess in the Tabernacle for Prince they will have to clean all the mess but they didn't have to do that because the Tabernacle was covered with a layer of skin the dabernacle was covered with a layer of a skin that sometimes on Sunday morning that layer of skin doesn't feel like waking up it has happened many times how in the world from Monday through Saturday you I can wake up very early and then on Sunday it's like I can't but it's because that layer of skin doesn't want to move but it has to move amen amen numbers four uh verse 6 it says in in shall put there on the covering of badgers skins in Charlotte spread it over over eat a cloth holy or blue and shall put it in this in the staff's thereof so in other words that Badger of his skin it needed to be painted a certain color and that was blue okay but it still it wasn't still animal skin and I googled and I found a picture of the badger animal and it's a very ugly animal so just think about your life how ugly these Badger skin can be sometimes but guess what the beautiful thing about this that the Lord is hidden in there and then I just think about this what's the characteristics of these uh Badger skins they are tough they are rough there is no Beauty in them but they are durable and they they don't have they are non-porous amen they are water repellent and they are weather resistant isn't that beautiful your body you can resist everything as much as the Lord LED you to resist amen you you you can resist that's why the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you because the devil is gonna try to bring the storms in your life is gonna be against you but you have a protection amen what was their purpose they were meant to protect what was inside of the Tabernacle so this outside is meant to protect what's inside amen what is it when a man breaks through that Veil into the Shekinah Glory now the world calls him a fanatic they can't see what's wrong but behind there there is no beauty of him he might not be able to pronounce pronounce his words right amen he may not dress just right he might not dress in clergy clothes but she might not dress the way they think she ought to dress but it may be but you see inside behind that Badger skin behind that human skin is there in there is the Shekinah Glory in there is a power in there is the word in there is the showbread in the in the Shekinah Glory which is a light that makes that light what does that light make in your life it makes your life ripen and there until you come in behind about your skin until you get out of your all the skin your all thoughts your all creates and you come into the presence of God then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the Shekinah Glory and let me this is the the Simplicity of the Gospel is it tells me that the Shekinah Glory is Christ in me then the prophet of God says then the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then you're living in his presence eating the showbread that's only provided that day for the Believers and in that day was only provided for the priest but now we are priests we are the royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving a spiritual sacrifices to God but you must come in behind the veil to see the unveil God and God now is open God now is unveiled in our eyes that's his word made manifest behind that battery skin behind that rough person that sometimes wouldn't even cry now King come to the altering tear for the Lord it's in that beautiful cobbler can work in our lives it's just Lord It's just amazing it can be tough it can be rough but in the presence of God there is not nothing like that now I think we have we still have some time amen as I was saying before that's the reason why the Tabernacle needed to be very precise it needs to be perfect why because God dwells imperfection amen now the Lord if you message uh readers you you have you have read the lord gave the prophet uh a vision and it was a tenth Vision amen and we always have heard about that 10th Vision in some I'm not I'm not wanting I'm not waiting for that Vision to be fulfilled in the future I want that Vision to be fulfilled now and I can tell you that that vision is being fulfilled in our day because why you are that Vision we are that vision what is that the prophet of God speaks about a first pull what was that first pull the first pull to the prophet of God was that he like like when if you go back in the book of Exodus and Moses is in front of the burning bush and the Lord says I'm gonna use your Moses and Moses had so many questions so many excuses to the Lord like how are you gonna use me I I'm not I'm I kind of short in my words and the Lord every single time he will bring an excuse the Lord will bring an answer but then the Lord says what do you have in your hand and he says well I have a rod then you just put it there and then that Rod became became a serpent and then Moses went and grabbed it he got it again and then the Lord said if they even believe you for by the first sign now you're gonna you're gonna do something else put your hand under your bosom and then it became leper right he became a leper and then when he put it back then he became healed amen so that was in the scripture so the prophet of God it was the same thing his first pull his first experience or the the beginning of his ministry was the same thing that he will grab the the hymn of the people on the right side of the like the the right hand if I'm not mistaken he will grab the right hand and then there will be like some kind of red marks on his arm and then if if that sickness will go away then that that person who could be declared healed right and and if that that uh sickness wouldn't go away the angel of the Lord told him you just declare a blessing on them and let them go amen that was the first the first uh the first pool or or or or the beginning of the prophet's Ministry in the in he always told us to go back to the scriptures and make sure that everything was in the scriptures so that's why I'm quoting Moses again because Moses had the same experience amen the prophet of God who was matching his experience with Moses experience amen that was the first poem then we can say something about that first pool it was it was a time of humility for the prophet of God it was a time of humility for for Moses because when he goes in front of the burning bush what does the Lord do he does he tells Moses you have to remove the the your sandals because where you are is a holy place and when we're talking about someone removing kind of covering or removing something out of their feet that's a sign of humility amen so the first thing we can say that that the first pool was a sign of humility as well as uh healing of the heart it meant I was that that was something that we can say there and then the the the the the second pool was about the prophet of God was told if they don't believe the first sign as well you will you will then you will know the secrets of the of the heart of the people amen so and when he will know the secrets of the heart of the people God was so precise that he will say you know your sisters aren't so you live in in science in in this city and this is your street and this is your number God is very precise and then there was one occasion just as an example or as a background that the prophet of God told his sister you live on this street and this is your number and then there was somebody next to next to her and and that was the friend and she's like well that's not right he made a mistake but no God God doesn't make mistakes that sister just recently moved that's how God knows your address God God knows where you live amen that was the second pool knowing the hearts of the people now where can we find this in the scriptures let's go back to the scriptures Genesis 18 chapter 9. serps at the 10th when the lord gave the word to Abraham the Lord knows all the intents and desires of the heart in this occasion Elohim the melchized that comes to Abraham and tells him in the time of life your Sarah your wife will have a son amen that was a promise and then sir and then he asked where is first he has where is Sarah and Sarah was behind him in the tent but then when when when he he was there and then Sarah laughed at the tent and I can say that there was enough there was enough distance that they they couldn't he couldn't he couldn't have hurt her when she was laughing but the Lord knows that the the desires and the intents of the heart so he said why did Sarah laugh and then say I I imagine that Sarah came and she said I didn't laugh what was going on here the Lord was revealing the desires and the intents of the hearts of Sarah that her heart was not at the time was not ready to receive the promise but I'm gonna tell you something when it is your time to receive a promise the Lord is going to prepare your heart you when it is your time for a vision to be fulfilled in your heart the Lord is going to prepare the grounds so that you can receive that promise and I I was last Sunday morning we were in The Sundays because we were talking about this one is specifically the Lord revealing the desires and intents of the heart and why what was the reason that the Lord couldn't kill Sarah why well he he couldn't say you know what you just laughed you just lied to do the God Almighty made him flesh in front of you why he couldn't have killed her why because she was part of Abraham amen there was already the seed of God in her that's why he couldn't sit the god of her of a promise that needed to come to pass so why sometimes in our lives all our sometimes we lie in the face of God we we don't live the life that he wants us to live we don't we watch the wrong things that we shouldn't watch why aren't we not kill this morning because he is dwelling in you God cannot kill his own seed he said he says Sarah you're going to have a son and she left but then the Lord said you're gonna have it anyway because you're gonna be ready to receive the promise and now in this day in this hour many times without of the promise of the Lord but he's telling us you're going to receive what you have been praying for even though you laugh but I cannot destroy you because you have a purpose and one more thing you are me you are Christ that's the second the second pool what was that was yielding that's what you have to yield the first ball you have to be humble the second pool you have to yield you have to say Lord I offer my life to you this morning I give it all to you Lord whatever it takes as we were singing I was just touched by by that song Whatever It Takes Lord I'll yield it to you that was the second pool but now the Lord Works in Perfection Perfection not imperfection but imperfection make make sure about that what was the third book is a time of communion because what what did he say he's like during that that the last the last part of the vision the first Vision was the first pull the second the the first poll was was the the um the the hand the second pool was knowing the desires and the intents of the hearts or the secrets of the hearts of the people and but the third he's like I found myself in a tent yeah wouldn't that be I found myself in a tabernacle and that in that Tabernacle there may have been the first pool there may have been the artery there may have been the holiest of the Holy place but in that Tabernacle there was a little room at the end and every single person that was going through that little room they were coming in crippled and they were walking out healed it's like that will be your second pool is like he said and then the the most important part here he said the first and second pool like kind of the Angel told the prophet of God you messed it up why because you were telling you were trying you were explaining to people what this meant you are not supposed to explain these things to people they just have to believe amen how many times we want to explain things when you just have to believe I that's the way it is supposed to be I don't have explanations for for many things in in my life but the only thing I'm standing here I'm believing what he has promised amen but the same voice and and now I want you to notice here the same voice that was talking to me he says I will meet you in there I will meet you in that little room and this is the third pool but nobody will know nothing about it I say well I don't understand why in there why why there he says he will not be a public show this time I said I don't understand going into that closet like that he says it is it is not isn't it written by our Lord when thou praise be not like the Hypocrites who who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who see it in secret and he could see it in secret shall require you openly I will ask you this morning how many times have you entered into that little room that where is that prayer I will meet you there we want to finish soon what is the third pool it is the little room in the heart of the believer where the Lord wants to come and meet us there it is that heavenly vision that Moses saw about the Tabernacle there were so many parts of it but there was the Holy stuff of holies where the presence of the Lord was going to dwell those were types and shadows on what is taking place today every time the Lord is telling us I will meet you now it is not a physical Tabernacle no it is in the heart of the believer where the Lord every day is telling is telling us as I started this this sermon this morning I will change your heart I will give you a new spirit and then now to the prophet he's telling him I will meet you the Lord wants to meet you there inside of that little little room that Shekinah Glory is is where the seed will ripen where all your questions are gonna be answered even if it is a no Lord I know you have my answer as we were hearing from Brother rap on Wednesday people trying to fit Garden into their will but now I'm I'm gonna be feeding God in into my will I'm gonna feed myself into the world into the vision into his perfect will for my life that is my desire that I can be in the presence of the Sun every day what a beautiful promise it is that he has Pro that he he has given us that he will meet us there you see how the prophet of God he's kind of is like it's not about me it's not about a Ministry it's it's not it's not even about the faithful Ministry is about God Christ and his people and he's telling him I will meet you there I want to reveal things that are in your heart I wanna change your heart I I Wanna Give You salvation I want I want to give you restoration but I need to meet you in there that's what Revelations 3 20 says behold I stand at the door and I am knocking and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will stop with him and he with me to him that overcoming and then overcome it then he says will I grant again the Lord I will give you I will come to you I will grant you to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I am sit down with my father in his throne that's the last Church age promised I will come to you I'm outside of your door knocking do you want your vision to be fulfilled the Lord is knocking the reason why he wants to come and dwell in us to live is because he wants to live his life through us he wants to display that Divine love that we have been hearing in the past few days that is the whole purpose where God and men have met now is that time where the people of God the Christians they will display The Life of Christ they are in that little room that where the Lord is meeting them every day and they're saying I will meet you there I will feed you there I will give you of my bread of life I will give you of that water of eternal life that if you come to that water you will never be thirsty again and we can finish with this everything that we have spoken this morning about that Vision summarizes into this Colossians 1 26. and I'm finishing it says even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to whom to his Saints we were saying dress like a saint live like a saint act like a saint and now the scripture is telling us I am manifesting my word to you to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory that's the summary of all of this because when he comes and dwells in your life now you are stepping into that vision of the Lord in whatever you ask even if it is Enough From God you are going to be content because the people that is living in that little room they are content with the portion that the Lord is giving them what can we say about about this this morning Lord as you as you told if the musicians can come as you don't have a conclure you told him to wait so today you're telling me to wait there may be decisions that I have to make but there are these are decisions you don't have to rush them if you just wait on the Lord and you say Lord I'm gonna step into that Vision I'm gonna go and take my Bible I'm gonna go and sit and listen to the tapes I'm gonna go and see see and listen to our pastor or the minister the ministry here I want to hear from you I want my vision I want my life to match to that Vision I want my life to match to that those that experience the the ones the the pulse experience I want that in my life Lord that Pillar of Fire changing his life that's what I want Lord Christ in you that's a summary Christ in you the hope of glory it was God the Father it was God above us and then Jesus came and it was Emmanuel God With Us but then he switched and there was something else because now is Christ in you the hope of glory that Heavenly Tabernacle became a a a flesh Tabernacle in Jesus but now it goes something else it goes somewhere else and now that's you and you privilege this morning that's you this morning can you say it's I it's me it's me it's me like that little boy when he started looking at himself in the mirror at first you know he was coming from the town and he didn't know what it was then he went in front of the mirror and he started saying hello he started worshiping and something happened the one on the other side of the mirror was doing the same and then until he was like hey that's me when you start seeing yourself in the world and then you start lifting your hands to the Lord and then you start seeing that he's been reflected in you then you're gonna say hey that's me trusting you the hope of glory amen let's all stand and let's buy our heads if you want him to if you want to join that vision of the Lord why don't you surrender and say Lord I want I Surrender my life I surrender all that I have I Surrender my I Surrender my thoughts I Surrender everything Lord Jesus I Surrender it to you this morning because it's Christ that wants to come in to come in fellowship with you this morning he wants to dwell in that little room where the rod of Aaron it changed it kind of gave fruit gave flower in everything in that holiest of holiest father we thank you this morning thank you for your children Lord thank you for this word that it may seem so complicated father but it is just so simple where we can see ourselves in the world that we can say Lord this is I this is I Lord what I have been waiting for years Lord now you're opening your word to me and that I can see myself through the scriptures your lord lord all those that suffer through the scriptures Lord I may have been suffering Lord desires that have not been fulfilled father but now this day this scripture is being fulfilled in our eyes Lord that's you in US that hope of glory we thank you Father we thank you Lord Jesus thank you for everybody that was here this morning just come in our lives these words father may they be a blessing to your children may we go back and we we Ponder these words as those that were walking on the way

telling us where we were coming from was in a heart burning when he was telling us that he was a resurrection in the life thank you Father [Music] thank you Lord Jesus [Music] you
