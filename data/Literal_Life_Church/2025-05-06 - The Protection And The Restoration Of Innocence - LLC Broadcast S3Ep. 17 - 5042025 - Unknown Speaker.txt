So let's change the atmosphere. Jesus promised to be [Music] near. So let's change the atmosphere. They did not destroy the nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them. So because God said, "Go forth and destroy those nations. Take over your land." Listen to what happens though when they didn't step up to the plate and destroy those nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them, but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works. Everybody pay attention now. When we don't destroy that thing that's trying to destroy us, then the next stage is to mingle with the heathen and learn how they do things. This our nation today. We have mingled too much with the heathenistic ways. We We're mingled among the heathen and learned their works. And they serve their idols which were a snare. Not talking about the the heathens. It's talking about Israel started to serve their idols which were a snare unto them. Yay. They sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils. Who did? Israel. They so learned the way of the heathen. And the distinction, one of the distinctions in idol worship and heathen worship is to actually sacrifice your sons and daughters to the gods that you served. How far can you get that you believe this is God so much that they actually took the one of the phrases is they took him through the fire. In other words, they let him go through the fire. They sacrificed. There's different views on how that happened, but that was a distinction of the heathenistic worship of their gods, gods. They sacrificed their sons and daughters. Yay. They sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood. And that's what I'm, if you just underline the word innocent. That's what I'm preaching on today, a protection, a restoration of innocence through this. They shed innocent blood. In other words, he's talking about the children. He's talking about anything innocent. He's talking about sacrificing those that are innocent. They didn't have anything to do with it. They they they didn't they just their children are followers. They're going to follow how you lead. And now dad, mom, they're leading their family into this idol worship and they didn't realize they're just going, "Okay, daddy. Okay, mommy, let's start worship. Bring the idols into their tents." They begin to worship. Then they learn their ways. And one of those ways those children didn't they it wasn't fair. They didn't know that eventually they'd become so obsessed in this heathenistic way, they had to come and say, "Listen, I love my God so much. I want you to pass through the fire and I'm going to give you offer you up to my God. Innocent innocent blood. Yeah. Innocent children. Oh, I just my heart is going now to innocent millions of innocent children's life who have to see separation, have to see abuse, have to hear. Oh God have mercy on us. They shed innocent blood. even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood. Thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions. And then I want to pick up something though because I don't want to leave it dim here or uh gloomy. Verse 44, that's the reality of it. They sacrificed them. Nevertheless, verse 44, after all this history of rebellion, Nevertheless, he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. Aren't you glad for the multitude of his mercies? Aren't you glad for grace? Grace says, "Whatever you done wrong, whatever innocence you destroyed, I'm able to restore you back again. Amen. I'm able to affect the future generations. Aren't you glad when you read the judgment chapters, if you read Lamentations, it's all the judgments of God because of Israel rebellion. And yet you can find little verses with a threat of redemption in there. Say, "But I will restore. I will bring you back. They didn't deserve it, but what you've done, you've made a mess, but I will restore, sayeth the Lord." You always have the thread of redemption throughout the Bible. And here he says his multitude of mercies he made them also to be pied of all those that carry them. So I just wanted to catch that. And look at the next chapter 107 and uh verse one. Give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Amen. I said let the redeemed of the Lord say so. The redeemed are the ones that know. No matter how much trouble we got in, no matter how much trouble our nation gets in, my home, whatever it is, the redeemed of the Lord knows what it is. I'm under the power of redemption here. And when you know you're under the power of redemption in your life, you raise your hand and says, "Let the redeemed of the Lord shout. Let him say so. Let him sing of redemption. My God can restore innocence again. That's right. He says, he says, "And he gathered them out of the lands." Oh, I didn't finish. Let the redeemed Lord say so. Whom he hath redeemed out of the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. Wherever they got scattered, God said, I'll bring them all back. That's a good promise for y'all that's got children wayward. I always tell you, don't give up. Because he said for all the children of Israel, he said, I'll redeem them. He says, he said, "I'll I don't care how far they've gone to the ends of the earth. If they're my children, I'll bring them back again." Somebody say, "Praise the Lord. I'll bring them back again. I'll restore them." David Padfield is a evangelist in Zion, Illinois. And of course, I don't know him, but he he says something here pretty straight about this heathen way of sacrificing children. And if you think that's going on just 6,000 years ago, no, it's going on today worse. Among the many sins of the Gentiles is the charge that they were without natural affection. Romans 1:31, they were without natural affection. That means they lose their feeling, their sensitivity. Albert Barnes correctly observed that Paul doubtless refers here to the practice so common among the heathens of exposing their children and putting them to death. The pages of history are bloody with the record of heathen nations sacrificing their children. This is the one of the reasons. I'm going have to read this quickly because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this. So, as my dad used to say, I'll read quick and you listen fast. This is one of the reasons God destroyed the Canaanites. They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons and shed innocent blood. Even the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of uh Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood. He's got scriptures for all this. Of course, the wicked king Manasseh uh followed the example of the Canaanites and caused his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Henon. 2 Chronicles. The ancient Persians buried their children alive. In Grecian states, emphaside was emphasized uh excuse me, infant side was enforced by law. The Romans were the most unrelenting in treatment of their children. The Roman father had absolute power over the life of his children. Babies were also sacrificed among the ancient uh uh Phoenosians. Uh Carthagans, Chinese and Hindus, other religions sacrificing their children. That's the heathen. That's the wrong god to serve. You never find that in our god. How can any parent deliberately sacrifice their son and daughter to demons? The practice is so vile that we cannot comprehend what would cause one to commit such a despicable act. Yet I contend that many parents today are willing to sacrifice their children to demons. While their children not are not burned or buried alive, they are placed on the altar of Satan by foolish parents. They're placed on the altar of pleasure. Some parents are so concerned about their children having a good time that they will sacrifice the soul of their own child on an altar of pleasure. Solomon told the young man to rejoice in his youth and let your heart chill you in the days of youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. Enjoy life, but don't forget about the judgment. Parents have been known to leave the Lord and join some church because it offers to entertain their children. I'm going to get my kids to that church because I like their music or I like their entertainment. I like their program because but if you do it for the motive of just entertaining your children, that's not enough. I think what he says is right. The entertainment of children is the duty of the home, not the church. Christ did not die on Calvar's cross just so teenagers could have a party in the fellowship hall. You think I'm a hard preacher. When parents are willing to sacrifice the souls of their children in the pursuit of entertainment, are they any better off than the heathen who sacrifice their sons and their daughters to demons? You let them watch anything on their phone. You let them watch anything on the television programs. I'm telling you, I wonder if what he's saying is true that it's the parents, not the children. It's the parents sacrificing in the name of entertaining them at the altar of Hollywood. He says the altar of popularity or success. Some Christians have been known to sacrifice the children in an attempt to make them popular. Since the moral code reviewed in the new revealed in the New Testament is not in harmony with the standards of the world. Many will yield to the pressure and allow their children to engage in activities they would rather you not know about. In an effort to make the dollars popular, they were allowed to become cheerleaders and try to defend their skimpy attire on the grounds that it's no worse than anyone else wears. Yet Paul and modest women to adorn themselves in modest apparel. Amen. Why is there different rules for our children than it is for the adults? What Paul said, he says, now this is for all the older sisters. They need to adore themselves in modest apparel. No, modesty is a godly attribute. Can you say amen? And it's to be taught to our children. You don't take your clothes off in front of everybody. Other parents will allow their children to go to the public pool where they not only shed their own clothing, but because others cause others to lust after them. Yet our Lord said, "Whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery within his heart. A man might be guilty of lusting after a woman. But if the woman dresses in such a way to cause him to lust, she is just as guilty of sin as he is. We all know he's telling the truth right there. The altar of education is success. No, I'm I'm not opposed to secular education. A good education is required for children to function in this world. However, I'm also concerned about the world to come. And that's what I preached last Sunday. You can't just have temporal values for your children. The most important desire you should have is they connect with eternal life. Can I get an amen? So we have a duty to give our children an education and lead them in the right way. But you know the greatest thing we have as a mandate from the scripture is to lead them to the place to receive eternal life and to receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. Every prayer upon the lips of the parents should be this promise in the book of Acts, this promise Peter said that's come to us that we've been waiting for 2,000 years to be it fulfilled. And here it is in the upper room, the pouring out of his spirit. Not just the pouring out, not just on their flesh like the Pentecostals. Oh, I feel the anointing. No, no. It went to their souls. Tongues of fire, not unknown tongues. No, no, no, no. Tongues of fire came in that upper room and they were changed. And when he come out of it, Peter was being asked, "What do we need to to be saved?" And he says, "You need to repent and you need to be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Next words. And the promise, this promise is unto you and your children, and further as many as our God shall call. But the second one that you should have on your lips beside you is your children. You got a promise this morning. Now see, if you were trying to if I can get them to the front and if I can get them saved and it becomes a kind of a formula and pressure them. No, no, no, no, no, no. Pray, pray, God, put a hunger in their heart for the Holy Ghost because they're not going to make it in this life without true salvation, true Holy Ghost. They need the same thing that they had on the day of Pentecost. Can you say amen? And and and you don't have to say this is my promise to my it's not your promise. It's God's promise. And the promise said, "This will come to your children as well." What do we need to pray for? That promise is more important than success, than this life, than them wearing the right clothes, than education, this promise is more important than anything. And I love when David says here when he says, "I'm concerned about the world to come." I think all of us should not just be concerned and pressured and worried about this world. We should be worried about the world to come that our children would be in the world to come. Eternal values. My heart breaks every time I hear some parent tell me their child could not make it to Wednesday evening Bible class because they had homework. The homework has to be done. But why at the expense of Bible study? Why don't they just skip a few hours of television and talking on the phone instead? What excuse can a parent possibly have for their children not having their Bible class lessons prepared? out of 168 hours in a week, they couldn't find one hour to study their Bible. Did they have time for television? Did they have time to talk with their friends on the phone? Did they have time to play outside? I don't blame the children near as much as I do the parents. How many say amen to that? It's been told us by the prophet of God, it's not child delinquency. It's not teenage delinquency. It's parent delinquency. That's right. First, why you think I'm a hard preacher? This I don't know who this David Patfield. Wow, he says it like it is. I can say amen to it. I think we should be concerned about the world to come more than this world. We're praying for our children to receive Christ. We're praying that God help us to protect them, that we put protections in place for their innocence. I think we have a promise of the Holy Ghost is to us and our children. That's the promise you need to be holding up before God and believing for. Can you say amen? The token in the book of Exodus was applied to the home. The token was a protection for the homes and it was for the children. The very Holy Ghost and say what is that? Well, the token was a type of the Holy Ghost because that blood which came from the blood of Christ, his spirit. This is this is simply explained friends is that when he died, his blood was shed but there was a life in that blood. He had to shed a his blood is the lamb at Calvary. But and the blood was there on the cross. But there was a life in that blood. And the life of that blood came back on the day of Pentecost again to bring true conversions and power. After the Holy Ghost has come, you shall receive power. Power for what? Power to be a witness. Power to live an overcoming life. You can't live an overcoming life without his life of his blood living in you. So we believe in the blood, but we believe also in the life of the blood. It poured out at Calvary. His blood poured out. His life went somewhere. Where did it go? Well, the body went as a memorial up to the that's all scriptural now to the right hand of the father in authority. But the life of the blood, where did it go? The spirit, it came into them on the day of Pentecost. How do you know that? Because after a while, the people said they took note. They've been with Jesus. They look like Jesus. They're doing the works of Jesus. Why? Jesus spirit was in them. The token is applied to our homes. It's for our children. It's for protection. That night in Egypt, the firstborn's life was at stake. The dark angel was going through the land. And that little child, that firstborn, was at stake. And the home was at stake. And daddy went out and applied the blood to the doorpost and the upper part of the door. And when he applied the blood to his home, the death angel passed their home and they were protected. I'm covered by the blood of Jesus Christ. I'm protected by the blood of Jesus Christ. I don't have any hope for my children except for the blood of Jesus Christ. All my efforts are I pray God will bless my efforts to direct my children, but they need the blood of Jesus Christ. Didn't Job pray constantly and breathe sacrifices of blood for his children? He was such a father that he brought him every day and worshiped God. He says, "I'm bringing the sacrifice. My kids, they may not have done something wrong today, but I'm bringing the sacrifice in case they do something wrong." He's applying the blood to his children. And guess what? Even after that, he lost all of his children. speed ahead. The last chapter, he's blessed and gets all of them back. Not them, but everything he had lost, God gave him back. And I'm preaching to you, he's the restorer. You take a daddy like that, in the end, Satan thinks he lost. No, he didn't lose. He gained. Amen. You think your home has been destroyed or your home is in a mess now. There's some people's homes that's in a mess and they don't even realize it. They're too proud to admit it. But you think your lives and your homes are in a mess now. You trust the Lord. Apply the word. Get honest with God. Get sincere. Get repentant. Bring this word into your home. And God will bless your home and restore your home. Martin Luther said here, if you have the quote there, I'm afraid that the schools will prove to be the very gates of hell unless they diligently labor in explaining the holy scriptures and engraving them in the heart of the youth. We have reasoned with things too much. We have lowered the standards. Sometimes we're too loose about watching over the innocence of our children. Sometimes the church has complicated things for hungry hearts that are coming. I want to add the church in because the church world, the denominational world as a whole has readjusted things and complicated the simplicity of the power of the gospel to where it becomes systems and formulas for the new birth. And those formulas won't work. It takes the power of God to protect and restore our children. And to restore any innocence. Can you say amen? It takes the power of God. We should connect with our children first. Then we should connect them with the things of God. Can you say amen? Some parents already disconnect. They're disconnected. We should connect. And I think of, you know, uh we should protect them. We should connect them to God. It's to connect with them. But the most important connection is that someday they connect with this person of the Lord Jesus Christ in a real experience with him. I believe I've got a whole list of notes to finish this concerning the scriptures and quotes that tell us the power of not only the protection of innocence but the restoration of innocence. I can preach on it for hours, friends, that this power of the the word and the gospel and what God's restored. I want to talk about how everything that got lost in 2000 church ages. You say, "What got lost?" The reason I know that things and truths got lost and messed with through church systems is because there's about six or seven solid prophecies that say he's going to restore things in the end time. Joel says all the years that the canker worm has ate and the caterpillar and he ate off that tree. He took the doctrine. He took the fellowship. He he ate off that's a prophecy about the church when they started at Pentecost is just a few years later Satan begins to do what he did in Eden and that's pervert the word and through church systems he perverts the word. And but Joel says Joel says two chapters later I will restore all the years that Satan ate. Then you come along to Jesus referring to John the Baptist and also another he says John the Baptist he came to foreign my coming but he says Elijah truly shall first come and what restore all things Jesus himself uh it's Matthew 17:11 Elijah will come at the end time and restore all things restoration. Acts 3:21, Jesus was received into heaven until the time of restitution of all things. Revelations 10:7, in the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, all the mystery of God should be finished. Revelations 1 says, all the seven angels are the seven messengers to the seven ages or seven churches. So the seventh one is to have a restoration ministry to bring the people of God back to the innocence that was lost throughout the ages to restore the word. Our God is a God of restoration. But all of I all I said about the restoration of innocence is culminated in all this ministry of the last days is culminated in Ephesians that I read to you at the beginning. I'll have a a church. I'll present it to myself. She'll be a spotless bride, a virgin bride. Not tainted with men's ideas, not tainted with church systems, not I'll bring her back to her purity again. And how I do it, I'll wash her by the water of the word. I can't even preach to you how powerful the restorative work of the Lord is. If it can bring a bride spotless in the last days, do you think it's not powerful enough to change you? to restore your innocence, to forgive you of what you've done wrong, to restore your family to a healthy family instead of chaos. No, this word, this Lord wants to restore. Thank you for watching our service today. If you would like more information, please contact us by visiting our website, literallife.urch.
